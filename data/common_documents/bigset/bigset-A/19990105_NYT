CALICHMAN TRADE ALL BUT FINALIZED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ In a move designed -- at least on the surface
-- to further the Los Angeles Galaxy's youth movement, veteran
defender Dan Calichman, the Major League Soccer team's captain and
emotional leader, is being traded to the New England Revolution for
two draft picks, a deal expected to be consummated today.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman, 30, who missed most of last season after suffering a
broken leg in the Galaxy's eighth game, claims the swap is a
personal vendetta by Coach Octavio Zambrano, angered over his
captain's comments about him to the team's new owners in November.
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, who was in Ecuador on Monday and unavailable for
comment, said last week that he wanted third-year defender Steve
Jolley, 23, to team with Robin Fraser, 32, in the center of the
L.A. defense this season, making his captain expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Jolley, who played Calichman's place last season, is seen as the
future of the Galaxy back line, and Zambrano said it was crucial
that he receive the playing time needed tyo grow fully into the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve's going to be a great player -- I love Steve, he's
terrific,'' Calichman said Monday, ``but the fact that their
getting rid of me has nothing to do with Steve and everything to do
with personal stuff. The whole thing is personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Calichman acknowledged he voiced criticism of Zambrano, in
answer to a query from new team president Tim Leiweke, soon after
Kings owner Philip F. Anschutz purchased the team for $26 million.
Leiweke, in a process to determine whether Zambrano should be
retained, met with players and asked their opinions of their coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything said was to answer a question asked by the new
ownership,'' Calichman said. ``I didn't go out of my way (to
criticize Zambrano). It's in my personality to answer as honestly
as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano had earlier denied any friction with Calichman, and
assistant coach Ralph Perez said that he didn't think a personality
conflict had anything to do with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Octavio was a little surprised at some of the things
that were said ... felt Dan slighted him, but I don't think that
played a role. This was a hard decision, and he agonized over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will receive New England's second-round selection in
next month's collegiate draft, the 13th overall, and its first pick
in the supplemental draft, the first overall. The Galaxy has yet to
sign off on the deal, MLS officials said, and Galaxy spokesman Luis
Garcia said Leiweke wanted to talk with Zambrano before doing so.
</P>
<P>
   The collegiate pool this year is not considered as deep as last
year's, from which the Galaxy picked up four players, and the
supplemental draft is expected to offer only ALeague
(second-division) and waived MLS players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's got to make Dan feel like L.A. just wanted to get rid
of him,'' Fraser, who likely will become the Galaxy captain, said
when told what L.A. would receive. ``That's giving away a player of
that caliber. ... I think it's a bad move. Who's to feel safe,
secure (now)? What kind of environment is that for players? I
personally don't think that's a healthy environment. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a bad trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he understood those feelings. ``I think the
perception makes it appear that way, that we got raped. But we
don't yet know who those two players are. If those two guys come in
and make a contribution, it might be a good trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy earlier loaned midfielder Martin Machon to Mexico's
Santos, creating an opportunity for second-year midfielders Clint
Mathis and Daniel Hernandez, and goalkeeper Kevin Hartman,
defenders Joe Franchino and Greg Vanney, and forward Welton -- all
regulars -- also are younger than 25.
</P>
<P>
   Calichman, instrumental in leading the Galaxy to the 1996 MLS
title game, started 60 of 64 regular-season games during the first
two seasons and all eight before breaking his leg. He made an
emotional return to the field in L.A.'s playoff opener, a 6-1 rout
of Dallas, in October.
</P>
<P>
   It is a homecoming of sorts for the 6-foot, 180-pound redhead,
who was raised on Long Island and attended Williams College in
Massachusetts. He'll likely anchor the Revolution defense in front
of goalkeeper-head coach Walter Zenga, an Italian star who is MLS's
first player-coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part is leaving the players and the fans,''
Calichman said. ``Part of me is very angry I would give anything to
this team, and I think I have. ... But (the Revolution) is excited
to get me, they asked the Galaxy for me. Who wants to play for a
team happy to get rid of you? I want to play for team that wants
me.''

 &HT;    Tennessee takes Fiesta, wins championship
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ When the history of Tennessee's magical 1998
football season is written, it will simply be known as ''The
Catch.'' For the record, Tee Martin threw it, Peerless Price caught
it, and it covered 79 yards of the most beautiful yards ever seen
by the fans from Big Orange Country. And by the way, it also gave
the No. 1 Volunteers a 23-16 victory over Florida State in the
Fiesta Bowl for their first national championship since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (13-0) was presented the national championship trophy
by the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll immediately after the game.
Early Tuesday morning the voters in the Associated Press media poll
went through the formality of making it unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   A Fiesta Bowl record crowd of 80,470, the vast majority wearing
orange, turned out to watch Tennessee put the perfect cap on a most
improbable season. Exactly one year and two days after the great
Petyon Manning played his final game for Tennessee, the Volunteers
defied all odds and won the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a slim 14-9 lead, Tennessee took possession at its
20-yard line with 10:41 left in the game after holding the
Seminoles, who saw their drive stall at the Volunteer 26.
</P>
<P>
   After two running plays netted only one yard, quarterback Tee
Martin found Peerless Price, who had a step on Mario Edwards and
launched the 79-yard scoring strike to make it 20-9 after Jeff
Hall's extra point was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   On Florida State's next possession, quarterback Marcus Outzen
fumbled at his own 29-yard line. Tennessee took the turnover and
got a 23-yard Hall field goal that gave the Vols a 23-9 lead with
6:01 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida State would not go down without a fight, as the
Seminoles drove 49 yards on five plays to come within seven, 23-16,
with 3:42 left.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State then tried an onside kick, but officials ruled
that one of the Seminoles touched the ball before it went the
required 10 yards, giving Tennessee the ball at the 42-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee drove to the Florida State 11-yard line but fumbled
with 1:23 left, giving the Seminoles one more chance. But Outzen's
deep pass was intercepted by Steve Johnson with 1:16 left, sealing
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 14-9, Tennessee appeared to be in position to put the
game away early in the fourth quarter. After holding Florida State
deep in its own territory, the Volunteers took over on the Seminole
34-yard line after a 17-yard punt return by Eric Parker.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of running some clock, Tennessee elected to go for
the home run on the first place. Tee Martin's pass in the end zone
for Peerless Price was intercepted by Dexter Jackson and returned
to his own 26-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State moved the ball down to the Tennessee 26-yard but
never got a chance to kick a field goal as the Seminoles were
penalized five yards for motion and then gave up a quarterback
sack. After a wild second quarter that enabled Tennessee to take a
14-9 lead at halftime, neither team could generate much offense in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   FSU threatened to score midway through the quarter when the
Seminoles moved from their 9-yard line to the Tennessee 30. But at
that point Marcus Outzen was sacked for a loss of 9 and FSU was
penalized for holding. The Seminoles eventually had to punt,
pinning Tennessee at its 5 with 3:18 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was able to string together three first downs, thanks
to passes of 22 yards to Peerless Price and 15 yards to Jeremaine
Copeland. But the drive stalled at the FSU 45 as time ran out,
setting up a fourth quarter that would decide the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Like two heavyweight fighters, Tennessee and FSU spent the first
14 minutes of the game throwing light jabs and feeling each other
out. Then came the heavy punches in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee landed the first big blow when quarterback Tee Martin
hooked up with Price for a 76-yard pass that gave the Volunteers a
first down at the FSU 12.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later Tennessee's offense was stopped and apparently
had settled for a 24-yard field goal by Jeff Hall. But FSU was
called for roughing the kicker on the play and Tennessee was
awarded a first down on the FSU 4. Two plays later Martin hit
fullback Shawn Bryson for the touchdown to make it 7-0 with less
than a minute gone in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   FSU tried to strike back when Outzen found Ron Dugans open from
29 yards out. But on the next play, Tennessee cornerback Dwayne
Goodrich stepped in front of a pass intended for Peter Warrick and
raced 54 yards for a touchdown. Tennessee led 14-0 with 13:40 left
in the period and Sun Devil Stadium was rocking.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's defense held the Seminoles to three plays and out on
the next possession, and it appeared the Volunteers had a chance to
deliver a knockout blow. FSU was down by two touchdowns with a
sophomore quarterback that had started only two career games. But
the Volunteers were not smart once they got the lead.
</P>
<P>
   On Tennessee's second play of its next possession, Martin threw
down the middle and was intercepted by FSU safety Derrick Gibson,
who returned it 43 yards to the 3. Three plays later William McCray
scored from the 1. Sebastian Janikowski's extra point was blocked
and Tennessee had a 14-6 lead with 8:58 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   On Tennessee's next possession the Volunteers were called for
three penalties, including an illegal shift on a punt. It turned
out to be a fatal mistake as Tennessee had to kick the ball again
and Warrick returned the punt 51 yards to the Vols' 27.
</P>
<P>
   FSU had problems with penalties, committing three during the
possession. As a result, the Seminoles moved only 10 yards in 10
plays and had to settle for a 34-yard Janikowski field goal to
bring FSU to within 14-9 with 1:17 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for 14 penalties for 97 yards in the first
half. Tennessee outgained FSU 181-93, but the Seminoles had the
equalizer in Gibson's 43-yard interception return and Warrick's
51-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee squandered a couple of scoring opportunities in the
first quarter. On their first possession the Vols drove to the FSU
16, where Jeff Hall missed a 33-yard field goal to the right. Later
in the period Tennessee drove to the FSU 32 and running back Travis
Henry fumbled. The Seminoles couldn't turn either mistake into
points.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee lost two defensive starters in the first half as
tackle Fred Weary sprained a knee and cornerback Dwayne Goodrich
twisted an ankle.

   Florida State then tried an onside kick, but officials ruled
that one of the Seminoles touched the ball before it went the
required 10 yards, giving Tennessee the ball at the 42-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee drove to the Florida State 11-yard line but fumbled
with 1:23 left, giving the Seminoles one more chance. But Outzen's
deep pass was intercepted by Steve Johnson with 1:16 left, sealing
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 14-9, Tennessee appeared to be in position to put the
game away early in the fourth quarter. After holding Florida State
deep in its own territory, the Volunteers took over on the Seminole
34-yard line after a 17-yard punt return by Eric Parker.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of running some clock, Tennessee elected to go for
the home run on the first place. Tee Martin's pass in the end zone
for Peerless Price was intercepted by Dexter Jackson and returned
to his own 26-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State moved the ball down to the Tennessee 26-yard but
never got a chance to kick a field goal as the Seminoles were
penalized five yards for motion and then gave up a quarterback
sack. After a wild second quarter that enabled Tennessee to take a
14-9 lead at halftime, neither team could generate much offense in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   FSU threatened to score midway through the quarter when the
Seminoles moved from their 9-yard line to the Tennessee 30. But at
that point Marcus Outzen was sacked for a loss of 9 and FSU was
penalized for holding. The Seminoles eventually had to punt,
pinning Tennessee at its 5 with 3:18 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was able to string together three first downs, thanks
to passes of 22 yards to Peerless Price and 15 yards to Jeremaine
Copeland. But the drive stalled at the FSU 45 as time ran out,
setting up a fourth quarter that would decide the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Like two heavyweight fighters, Tennessee and FSU spent the first
14 minutes of the game throwing light jabs and feeling each other
out. Then came the heavy punches in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee landed the first big blow when quarterback Tee Martin
hooked up with Price for a 76-yard pass that gave the Volunteers a
first down at the FSU 12.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later Tennessee's offense was stopped and apparently
had settled for a 24-yard field goal by Jeff Hall. But FSU was
called for roughing the kicker on the play and Tennessee was
awarded a first down on the FSU 4. Two plays later Martin hit
fullback Shawn Bryson for the touchdown to make it 7-0 with less
than a minute gone in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   FSU tried to strike back when Outzen found Ron Dugans open from
29 yards out. But on the next play, Tennessee cornerback Dwayne
Goodrich stepped in front of a pass intended for Peter Warrick and
raced 54 yards for a touchdown. Tennessee led 14-0 with 13:40 left
in the period and Sun Devil Stadium was rocking.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's defense held the Seminoles to three plays and out on
the next possession, and it appeared the Volunteers had a chance to
deliver a knockout blow. FSU was down by two touchdowns with a
sophomore quarterback that had started only two career games. But
the Volunteers were not smart once they got the lead.
</P>
<P>
   On Tennessee's second play of its next possession, Martin threw
down the middle and was intercepted by FSU safety Derrick Gibson,
who returned it 43 yards to the 3. Three plays later William McCray
scored from the 1. Sebastian Janikowski's extra point was blocked
and Tennessee had a 14-6 lead with 8:58 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   On Tennessee's next possession the Volunteers were called for
three penalties, including an illegal shift on a punt. It turned
out to be a fatal mistake as Tennessee had to kick the ball again
and Warrick returned the punt 51 yards to the Vols' 27.
</P>
<P>
   FSU had problems with penalties, committing three during the
possession. As a result, the Seminoles moved only 10 yards in 10
plays and had to settle for a 34-yard Janikowski field goal to
bring FSU to within 14-9 with 1:17 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The teams combined for 14 penalties for 97 yards in the first
half. Tennessee outgained FSU 181-93, but the Seminoles had the
equalizer in Gibson's 43-yard interception return and Warrick's
51-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee squandered a couple of scoring opportunities in the
first quarter. On their first possession the Vols drove to the FSU
16, where Jeff Hall missed a 33-yard field goal to the right. Later
in the period Tennessee drove to the FSU 32 and running back Travis
Henry fumbled. The Seminoles couldn't turn either mistake into
points.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee lost two defensive starters in the first half as
tackle Fred Weary sprained a knee and cornerback Dwayne Goodrich
twisted an ankle.

PRESIDENT'S LAWYERS PREPARING NEW ATTACK ON ARTICLES OF
IMPEACHMENT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Also see BC-IMPEACH-NYT)   (sw) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's lawyers are preparing an
assault on both the form and content of the two articles of
impeachment sent to the Senate by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   With Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, and other senators
attempting to forge a bipartisan consensus on how to proceed with a
possible trial, Clinton's legal team has not wanted to get in the
way of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's lawyers have been busily deconstructing
every word and charge in the articles, which allege perjury and
obstruction of justice. They have prepared some new legal arguments
as well as a more detailed critique of the evidence the Judiciary
Committee cited in buttressing its case for impeachment in its
final report issued on December 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two articles are legally defective, constitutionally
deficient and factually without foundation,'' said Gregory B.
Craig, special counsel to the President. ``No responsible
prosecutor would consider bringing charges based on the evidence
and to consider removing the president on this basis would be the
single most destructive act of partisanship in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a full trial is averted, the president's legal team is
likely to present a defense that attacks the impeachment case on
two grounds, constitutional and factual.
</P>
<P>
   According to one document prepared by the president's lawyers,
the two impeachment articles are constitutionally flawed because
they bundle together several accusations of wrongdoing, making it
impossible to determine whether a majority of the House voted to
impeach Clinton on one act or another. For example, the article
accusing the president of perjury before the grand jury cites four
areas where he allegedly lied. The obstruction of justice article
cites seven separate instances of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   In a criminal court proceeding, the president's lawyers argue,
these charges would have to be outlined in separate counts. A
Senate rule specifies that ``an article of impeachment shall not be
divisible for the purpose of voting thereon at any time during the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides this constitutional assault on the articles, the
president's legal team is prepared to attack the evidence, which
they characterized as circumstantial and subjective. The lawyers
argue that the articles of impeachment draw unsubstantiated
conclusions about Clinton's motives.
</P>
<P>
   While the president's lawyers concede that he did attempt to
conceal an improper relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, they will
argue that he did not perjure himself or hinder justice.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to challenge each of more than half a dozen direct
lies that the Judiciary Committee alleges the president told the
grand jury, including instances in which Ms. Lewinsky's testimony
is at odds with Clinton's, a member of the legal team said. The
lawyers are also ready to challenge Ms. Lewinsky's credibility if
witnesses are called at a trial.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton's early statements to his aides, cited in both
articles, in which he denied the affair, the president's lawyers
contend that he was trying to hide the relationship rather than
influence testimony.

USC NEEDS GAME PLAN TO EARN RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no snow-covered mountain or ski lift
within squinting distance. Indeed, there was nothing but brilliant
sunshine for miles and miles. And yet it seemed fitting to see the
person standing in a line outside the Sports Arena on Monday with
his arm raised, broadcasting a tentative ``Single.''
</P>
<P>
   The slippery slope the USC basketball team is on was driven home
in the 2-for-1 ticket promotion dreamt up to drum up interest in
the Trojans' Pacific-10 matinee against No.6 Arizona. It also was
in evidence in the closing minutes of the ensuing game, which
Arizona pulled out, 87-78, in front of 4,116.
</P>
<P>
   There are campuses where you don't have to give away tickets to
see a snaking line materialize like magic, you merely have to
announce there are some nosebleed seats for sale. The young nucleus
of this year's Trojans team has grand hopes of turning USC into one
of those schools before they're through. To do that, though, they
have to win games like this one, which slipped through their
fingers in the final six minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game I feel we were supposed to win, definitely,''
said senior forward Adam Spanich, who had a quiet game with six
points and three defensive rebounds. ``We know how talented we are.
But until we beat teams like this, we're not going to earn people's
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't matter that USC was off to its best 12-game start
since 1975-76. To the average Trojan, hoops success sounds as
contradictory as offensive defenseman. The Trojans have fewer NCAA
Tournament appearances (10) than their crosstown rival UCLA Bruins
do NCAA titles (11).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not basketball gods on campus like at UCLA,'' Spanich
said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there was USC Monday afternoon, building toward an
ethereal ending. At halftime, the Trojans had the team with all the
hot-shot recruits and the resplendent resume exactly where they
wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, who had been declawed by UCLA on Saturday, were
trailing 44-35 at intermission and they looked many more years
removed from their national championship run than a measly two.
</P>
<P>
   That's partly because Sam Clancy looked more than two days
removed from coach Henry Bibby's doghouse. The freshman forward
didn't play one minute of USC's two-point win over Arizona State on
Saturday. Bibby held Clancy out of the game for going through the
motions at practice.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy found out on Sunday that he would be making his fifth
start and we're pretty sure he spent the next 24 hours hoarding
energy molecules. He bounced off bodies at both ends of the floor,
contributing nine points and seven rebounds in his first 19
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sports Arena hadn't seen such ferocious rebounding since
before the Clippers' Loy Vaught underwent back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats didn't stop Clancy in the second half but then,
they didn't have to; he slowed himself down by getting into foul
trouble. He collected his fifth with just under three minutes
remaining in the game and left, exhausted, with a career-high 16
points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   As he leaped to the lights to grab a rebound or jam the ball
down the net, murmurs went through the crowd. More than one person
was heard gasping, ``Who's that No.50?''
</P>
<P>
   Having blown his cover wide open, Clancy won't be able to tiptoe
through any more practices or games. He better not even try,
Spanich warned him as the two tried to rinse off the residue of the
loss in the showers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You better make sure you play like that all the time,''
Spanich said, ``or I'm going to get on your butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam tends to slack off a little bit,'' Spanich said later.
``He's so young, he doesn't know what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Among this year's team members, Elias Ayuso is the only one with
any NCAA Tournament experience. The rest of them are going to have
to figure things out on the run, so to speak. The good news is they
appear to be quick studies.
</P>
<P>
   Take sophomore center Brian Scalabrine. The junior-college
transfer was whistled for two fouls before the game was three
minutes old and when he picked up his third in the second half, it
turned his game inside out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bullying his way into the paint, Scalabrine stayed on
the outskirts and launched rainbows. His feeble shot selection
seemed to be contagious; guard Brandon Granville also started
taking rushed shots instead of working the ball around, and just
like, that the whole offense slipped out of gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to pick up a foul fighting for position so I
just went outside a lot more,'' said Scalabrine said. ``I got
tentative after picking up that second foul and I don't think I
helped our team too much. I should have gone down low and if I
fouled out, I fouled out.''
</P>
<P>
   Granville did foul out and sophomore guard Jeff Trepagnier got
bogged down with four. Before the officials' whistle stifled his
aggressiveness, Trepagnier slashed his way to 11 first-half points.
He finished with 14 and added five assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it got close we started trying to do too much,''
Trepagnier said. ``We were just taking quick shots instead of going
through our plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In time they'll learn to trust their system and one another.
It's the only recourse they have, if they want to win respect. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: TENNESSEE REMAINS KING OF THE HILL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ There was room for only one team on the symbolic
pinnacle, and it was captured by the team that celebrates to the
tune of ``Rocky Top.'' Tennessee held the high ground on Monday
night, in a 23-16 victory over Florida Stae in the Fiesta Bowl to
undoubtedly gain the unofficial national championship, far too late
into January to generate any enthusiasm except by its own fans.
</P>
<P>
   The game was one of the all-time bowl-game stinkers from every
standpoint _ artistic, elapsed time and financial returns for the
kindly scalpers who took a bath.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many lengthy television timeouts that ABC should
have been embarrassed, but surely is not. And perhaps the players
stunk out the Fiesta Bowl with penalties and mistakes because they
had not played in over a month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, under the new format called the Bowl Championship Series,
one of these teams was sure to be crowned national champion.
Tennessee was the only top-level undefeated team (sorry, Tulane),
and once-beaten Florida State had been anointed to challenge
Tennessee in this ultimate game of king-of-the-hill.
</P>
<P>
   The football coaches who vote in the ESPN poll were committed to
crowning the winner, while the writers who vote in the Associated
Press poll reserved their right to cast ballots three hours after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   John Cooper tried to make a case after his Ohio State team
escaped Texas A&AMP;M during the long New Year's glut of bowl games.
Cooper said the writers might consider his team if Florida State
did not rack up many style points in a theoretical victory over
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame John one bit for feeling the way he does,'' said
Coach Bobby Bowden of Florida State on Sunday. ``John might have
the best football team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Bowden quickly added, ``if Tennessee wins this ball
game, they're going to be national champions. And if we win this
ball game, we're going to be national champions.''
</P>
<P>
   There were few style points on Monday night during a long and
gruesome first half, which involved 14 penalties worth 97 yards.
The game was so ragged that writers were threatening to vote for
Ohio State, for Tulane, for anybody, just to protest this dreary
afterthought of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee calmed that silly little groundswell by remaining
undefeated, and Florida State would have had championship momentum
if it had managed to win. Florida State showed the good sense of
losing to North Carolina State early, upon which kindly old Grandpa
Bowden informed his older players that they could keep their
scholarships while sitting way down on his bench.
</P>
<P>
   The new system lucked out because there were not three
undefeated contenders trying to squeeze into one Fiesta Bowl. (Come
to think of it, a triangular football game does have its anarchic
appeal.) Ohio State lost on Nov. 7, while UCLA and Kansas State
made the gross mistake of losing in their last regular-season game,
because bowl officials penalize teams for recent losses.
</P>
<P>
   If UCLA had not lost to Miami, there would have been a
UCLA-Tennessee game here on Monday night, a battle of undefeated
teams. The fans would have been down on Mill Avenue begging for
tickets at $500 or $750 or maybe even $1,000, but instead scalpers
were muttering ``face value, face value'' as their gloomy mantra.
Before the game, the fans had time to take a walk on the pile of
rocks known as Mount Kush, just west of the stadium. Craggy peaks
have a place in Tennessee lore, what with the adopted football
anthem containing lines like, ``Once two strangers climbed up Rocky
Top, looking for a moonshine still.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it was more than two strangers, and they were looking for
a photo opportunity, and instead of Rocky Top it was Mount Kush.
All the strangers in Volunteer orange and all the strangers in
Seminole garnet were cordial. Bowl games, after all, are a rather
bourgeois affair, drawing a bunch of lawyers and accountants who
can afford to travel with their favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   This is the hill up which Frank Kush used to send his football
players, in full battle regalia, in the blazing August heat when he
was the resident sadist at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Kush is around here somewhere, and could probably make
a great piece of change hiring himself as a universal football
coach, goading grandfathers and little children up the mountain, to
prove their courage. As the sun went down, the fans flocked to Sun
Devil Stadium, where both schools were aspiring to lofty heights,
each having won a national title _ Tennessee back in 1951, and
Florida State in 1993. The joint reverberated with ``Rocky Top,''
written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, and having nothing to do
with football but rather with the flinty independence of all
mountaineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top, reckon they never
will,'' is the punch line of the Bryants' classic song. Tennessee
survived its match alongside Mount Kush, and the college football
season is finally over, much too late and much too sloppily. &QL;

EL NINO'S STORM WARNINGS REPLACED BY   LA NINA'S FIRE RISKS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: ``Today'' in story refers to Jan. 5, 1999.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY STEVE CARNEY AND LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The unusually dry, warm weather La Nina thrust on
Southern California has left wild lands primed for winter brush
fires _ like the one that scorched Porter Ranch during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And unless some rain unexpectedly shows up, experts warn that
Southland residents should expect more large blazes in the coming
months and a fearsome 1999 fire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be very, very, very bad if we stay in this
drought condition,'' said Scott Franklin, an urban wild-land fire
consultant in Newhall, an L.A.-area suburb. ``This is going to be
dynamite.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain torrents from last year's El Nino storms created an
explosion of new greenery. But the warm, dry weather that La Nina
has extended into the winter turned that vegetation into tinder
covering the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with cool temperatures, all you need is a dry day and you
begin to have containment problems'' if a fire starts, Franklin
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, strict brush-clearing programs in the city and county
helped keep the Porter Ranch fire _ measured at 470 acres _ away
from any structures, said Capt. Paul Quagliata, head of the Los
Angeles Fire Department's brush-clearance unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year we usually slack off brush clearing. But it
usually is raining,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warm air holds more moisture, so that's why more rain resulted
from El Nino, which is characterized by warmer than normal water in
the equatorial Pacific. And the opposite is true during
cooler-water La Nina conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, we're already out of the fire season,'' added Los
Angeles County fire Inspector Henry Rodriguez, but the high
temperature and low humidity is worsening the fire danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the time of year, you'd think it would be over, but
it's not,'' said Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   More than 375 firefighters from Ventura County, and the Los
Angeles and county fire departments fought the Porter Ranch blaze,
which was 100 percent contained and 90 percent extinguished Monday,
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expected to have it doused completely by today, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt and no structures burned. The cause remains
under investigation, but arson is not suspected, Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Herb Spitzer, assistant chief in the county Fire Department's
forestry division, said he's seen fire season extended into the
winter months before, but conditions this year are especially
worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had warm weather before, plus winds, but the fuel
moistures are so low for this time of year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no month in the year that Southern California is
immune from wildfires,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Every month since 1919 the county has had a fire of 100 acres or
more. The Porter Ranch fire was just the second in any January
during that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get these little dry episodes like this, we need to
expect fires, so we need to gear up,'' Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Under such conditions, firefighting agencies need to coordinate
what their responses will be and push for brush clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not enough to run suppression forces out there. What
will happen as we move further into the year, we won't have just
one little fire. So then you have competition for hand crews, air
units, bulldozers, everything. That's not a prediction, it's a
fact. That's what's happened historically.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1988, a 500-acre fire burned 12 houses as
firefighters had to contend with four other blazes in Los Angeles
County at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, when the worst brush fire in county history charred
more than 130,000 acres, crews were battling 10 others, said
Franklin, a former vegetation management officer with the county
Fire Department. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The pre-Christmas freeze that devastated
California's navel orange crop hit consumers Monday when grocery
stores began dramatically raising prices on citrus fruit.
</P>
<P>
   At Lucky Stores Inc., navel orange prices jumped from 69 to 99
cents a pound, a spokeswoman said, while other major grocery chains
like Ralphs and Vons were charging a hefty $1.69 and $1.79 a pound,
respectively.

   With at least half the California navel crop destroyed, there is
no doubt the tasty fruit will become a scarce commodity on produce
shelves in the coming months. But some say the price hikes are
premature considering that most of the oranges on the shelves were
harvested and purchased before the freeze sent wholesale prices
soaring from roughly $10 to $20 a crate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a bit opportunistic,'' said Rex Laird,
executive director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The big chill is being felt in smaller stores, too. Benjie
Chankin, produce manager at Follow Your Heart Natural Foods Market
in Canoga Park, waited out the lunch rush Monday before raising the
price of his California navels from 99 cents to $1.25 a pound.
Chankin said he paid $30 for a crate of organically grown navel
oranges Monday morning, roughly twice the standard price.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling it,'' Chankin said. ``The price of the navel is
going up, and the quality is going down. I expect to pay as high as
$36 a crate. You always eat it somewhere _ mostly where the weather
makes you.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chankin raised his prices Monday, California growers in the
Central Valley were in their groves for the first time after a
two-week self-enforced industrywide hiatus to see how much of the
crop could be salvaged. Growers agreed to the hiatus to give
damaged fruit a chance to mend itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, at least 50 percent of the crop was
destroyed,'' said Claire Peters, spokeswoman for the Sunkist
Growers Cooperative. She said roughly 35 percent of the current
crop had been picked when temperatures dropped below freezing Dec.
21. The cold continued for three days, causing an estimated $591
million in damage. On Monday, Dole Food Company Inc., which owns
6,500 acres of citrus in the area, reported it will lose $10
million to $15 million in expected 1999 earnings because of the
freeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``The losses are substantial,'' said Heather Flower, spokeswoman
for the Western Growers Trade Association. ``For consumers, this
will mean you will see a shortage of navel oranges coming out of
California. Typically, that means price increases.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was sure how high the price will go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had a crystal ball to see what we're going to see
over the next few months, but it's impossible,'' Flower said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wait-and-see situation,'' said Sunkist spokeswoman
Peters. ``Right now, prices are changing day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wilson, Whole Foods Market produce coordinator for the
Southern Pacific region, said the sudden price increase has forced
his company to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grim,'' he said. ``We're starting to see price increases.
This will affect the entire navel season.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Valley growers have set up a special citrus checkpoint
to ensure orange quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to pull a lot of bad ones out,'' Chankin said. ``The
quality and availability are down across the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Nurseries also are logging dozens of calls from people concerned
about cold weather plant damage.
</P>
<P>
   Many plants look dead, but a flicker of life still might remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically just advising them not to do anything,'' said
Kathy Post, an employee at Sperling Nursery and Gift Shop in
Calabasas. ``It's best to wait until it warms up a little to see
what happened. They'll be amazed at what survived.'' &QL;

ICY EAST KEEPS LAX CROWD GROUNDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY MICHAEL COIT AND JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With another balmy day wafting over Los Angeles,
travelers Monday were forced to juggle flight cancellations and
delays at LAX as snow and cold again pummeled the Midwest and East
Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Most airlines resumed regular flight schedules between Los
Angeles International Airport and snowbound destinations, ending
two- and three-day waits for vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   But the airports still were snarled as frenzied business
travelers mixed with vacationers marooned here _ and the whole mess
was not expected to ease until as late as Wednesday, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These weather-related problems are crippling,'' said Missy
Siskind, a veteran agent with Nelson Custom Travel in North
Hollywood, an L.A.-area suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a domino effect, it just backs up and has a ripple effect
through everything.''
</P>
<P>
   So crippling that even a travel planner like Siskind was delayed
a day in returning to Los Angeles from New York over New Year's
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Her troubles didn't compare with one of her customers. Siskind
said United Airlines canceled his Sunday afternoon flight from LAX
to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and he was bumped _ to
the same flight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines continued to encourage those who can delay their travel
plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've been doing since early last Friday was to reticket
and avoid people traveling on Saturday or Sunday if at all
possible,'' said Matthew Triaca, a United Airlines spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For vacationers departing from LAX, that meant a few more days
in the Southern California sun. For University of Wisconsin
football fans, that meant more time to bask in the warmth of their
school's Rose Bowl victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we were saying if you can stay out in California
and enjoy the weather, why go home to (the snow),'' Triaca said.
</P>
<P>
   And travelers who were snowbound over the weekend continued to
straggle home Monday.
</P>
<P>
   University of Kentucky math senior Chris Rakes' trip to L.A. for
vacation included a drive through a blizzard and delayed flights
into and out of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I get to L.A., they had put my luggage on the wrong
plane so I had to wait another half hour. It was awful. There were
long lines everywhere,'' said Rakes, who was soaking in the warm
weather outside an airport flyaway.
</P>
<P>
   Duane Butler, 27, was delayed by more than a day in his quest to
fly home to Los Angeles from Montreal, where he had been working
for an aviation parts supplier. Scheduled to leave Sunday morning,
he got off the ground Monday afternoon on a standby flight amid the
chaos that he said engulfed the Montreal airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stood in line for four hours just to get to the check-in
desk and they said, `No way, we'll have to switch you to a smaller
plane,''' said Butler, who was traveling with his fiance and her
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to pack everything up and go back home. But for anyone
without a place to go, you'd be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Bathed in afternoon sun at the the flyaway, Butler said he was
glad to be moving back to Saugus, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so sweet I can't even tell you,'' he said.
``Seventy-five degree weather _ after 35 below.'' &QL;

TENNESSEE SECURES NO. 1 RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ It was only two plays, really, that made the Bowl
Championship Series and its inaugural title game worth watching on
Monday night. Two huge identical plays involving the same two
Volunteers who made Tennessee college football's national
champions. Tee Martin to Peerless Price, twice.
</P>
<P>
   One came into this game overshadowed by the legacy of the
quarterback he replaced: Peyton Manning; the other by Florida
State's all-America wide receiver, Peter Warrick. But with 9
minutes 15 seconds to play in the game and the Vols on their own
21-yard line, the two afterthoughts hooked up on the same play that
had gone 76 yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Price went down the right sideline, as he had before, beating
the same man, Mario Edwards. And Martin delivered, a 45-yard arc so
soft it rattled into the hands of his receiver until Price tucked
it in and raced the rest of the way for a 79-yard touchdown in
Tennessee's 23-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It meant Tennessee was up, 20-9, and the Volunteers (13-0) were
about to collect their first national championship since 1951. It
was Martin, the man who replaced Tennessee's folk hero, who
delivered it with his two touchdown passes. It was Price, with 4
catches for 199 yards, who insured that it arrived in exciting
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles did, however, have one last chance. Tennessee's
Travis Henry fumbled the ball on the Seminoles' 10 with 1:29 left.
But on the next play, Marcus Outzen threw a deep pass that the
Vols' Steve Johnson picked off.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the 12th meeting of No.1 versus No.2 in bowl
game history. It may have been the inaugural BCS title game. It may
have been the two best teams in the nation, a couple of stalwarts
from the South. But when the gun sounded signaling the end of the
third quarter, you would hardly have known it.
</P>
<P>
   The teams had combined for 18 penalties worth 130 yards, 11
punts, 4 fumbles and 2 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   With his team down by 14-6, Warrick provided one of the first
three quarters' two big plays when he returned David Leaverton's
punt 51 yards. It was a balletic run up the middle of the field on
which Warrick rolled like a marble down a hill making Volunteers
miss. It was Leaverton's touchdown-saving tackle at the 27-yard
line that began Florida State's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Two timeouts, three false start penalties and 4 minutes 33
seconds later, the Seminoles had to settle for Sebastian
Janikowski's 34-yard field goal to close to within 14-9.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Volunteers who threatened to play like a national
champion first. They found the end zone less than a minute into the
second quarter, thanks to Price. In six plays, the Vols went 88
yards thanks largely to one spectacular play _ a 76-yard Martin to
Price bomb _ and a bone-headed one by the Seminoles, who played the
early part of the game as if they wanted to give it away.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols wasted an impressive opening drive of 66 yards when the
usually sure-footed kicker Jeff Hall (19 for 24 on field-goal
attempts this season) pushed a 33-yard attempt wide right. But the
Seminoles, despite moving the ball with reverses and swing passes,
let mistakes stall their ensuing chances. It was penalties,
especially, that hamstrung Florida State, none bigger than a
roughing the kicker penalty that allowed Tennessee to go up by 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   On first down at the Volunteers' 12, Price faked Mario Edwards
and then Sean Key inside and outraced the Seminoles' defenders as
Martin arced a perfect rainbow into his hands. Price was corralled,
however, at the Seminoles' 12.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's No. 1 defense appeared to have held when Hall
trotted onto the field for a 24-yard attempt. He hit it for an
apparent 3-0 lead, but Dexter Jackson slammed into him, and a
roughing penalty was called. Two plays later, Martin got them when
he rolled left and fired a rocket to the wide-open fullback Shawn
Bryson. Hall converted and Tennessee was up, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if the sloppy play might unravel Florida State
immediately. On the next possession, Outzen made the kind of
mistake many feared a sophomore making only his third career start
might commit. On first down on the Florida State 49, the sophomore
tried to find Warrick in the flat, but Dwayne Goodrich flashed in
front of the receiver, snapped up the ball and romped 54 yards down
the left sideline and into the end zone. The Vols were now ahead by
14-0.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vols, too, were slow to shake off the jitters. Martin
tried to go to Price again, this time as he crossed midfield. But
his wobbly ball floated and safety Derrick Gibson grabbed it and
ran 43 yards down the left sideline until he was pushed out of
bounds at the 3.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Seminoles fullback William McCray banged it
over. But fittingly, on a night when the best hardly played like
it, Janikowski's point-after attempt was moved back 5 yards because
of an offside call. Janikowski, the Lou Groza award winner as the
nation's best kicker, then bounced the football off the crossbar _
only the second extra-point attempt he had missed all year _ and it
was 14-6.

GOV. DAVIS' POLITICAL BASE HAS SOUTHLAND ROOTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ With powerful links to Los Angeles County, Gov.
Gray Davis' new administration should mean more clout _ and more
money _ for the region, according to lawmakers and political
observers.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos and Los Angeles County interest groups also are likely
to prosper under the new administration, political analysts said
Monday as Davis was sworn in as the state's 37th governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that there will be a shift in the political fulcrum to
the south of the state, especially in Los Angeles County,'' said
political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. ``The ethos of Davis'
politics, the foundation of his politics, has its foundation in
Southern California _ Latinos, labor and teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who formerly served in the state Assembly representing
parts of Los Angeles' Westside, has a home in Beverly Hills. As
governor, he has filled three of his Cabinet positions and several
key staff posts with appointees from Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Davis will be a great thing for L.A. County, a great
resource for better health care, schools and transportation,'' said
state Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena. ``We're going to have more
support to improve services. There's been an innate hostility in
the past towards the county from leadership in San Francisco, San
Diego _ really the whole state. Davis doesn't have that. In fact,
it's exactly the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, state lawmakers from Los Angeles County appeared
disorganized for years in comparison to the San Francisco
delegation, which often seemed more capable of delivering on the
Bay Area's priorities, aided by the powerful influence of former
Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr., D-San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles,
leaders in the Los Angeles region are hoping for more out of
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, chairman of the powerful
Rules Committee, said he knows most of the governor's top-level
appointees, and the county's lawmakers won't have to spend as much
time on get-acquainted meetings as they did under Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful,'' Hertzberg said. ``With Wilson, the center of
his universe was San Diego. Davis' people are going to be much more
sensitive to the needs of Los Angeles County.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides supporting environmental measures, Hertzberg believes
the Davis administration will be more likely to support a separate
transit authority for the San Fernando Valley if it considers
breaking off from the cash-strapped Metropolitan Transportation
Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Contreras-Sweet of Los Angeles, the new secretary of
business, transportation and housing, is familiar with the ``MTA
morass,'' Hertzberg said, and he predicted that she would be more
sympathetic to the needs for a San Fernando Valley transit
authority and the Pasadena Blue Line.
</P>
<P>
   Contreras-Sweet, president of an international management
consulting firm, is the first Latina to fill a Cabinet position.
</P>
<P>
   Other new Cabinet members from Los Angeles County are Mary
Nichols, state resources secretary, who was founding attorney for
the Los Angeles office of the Natural Resources Defense Council;
and Aileen Adams, secretary of the State and Consumer Services
Agency, who has served on the Los Angeles Fire Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Californians are being named to other key posts. Frank
Grimes, a 32-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department,
will head the Office Of Criminal Justice Planning.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hunt, another LAPD veteran, was appointed to the Alcohol and
Beverage Control Appeal Board.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Jones, a Los Angeles County firefighter since 1965, will
head the state Office of Emergency Services.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yamaki, the new special assistant to the governor, is
the president of the Los Angeles Fire Commission and served from
1991 to 1993 on the Los Angeles Police Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Even Davis' press secretary, Michael Bustamante, comes from Los
Angeles. Bustamante previously worked for Supervisor Gloria Molina
and other public officials.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Pines, the new judicial appointment secretary for Davis,
served as Los Angeles city attorney from 1973 to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Pines' wife, Karen _ program manager for a welfare-to-work
program for women in Pacoima called ``Moving Up!'' _ said she
believes the new administration will result in more money for
social programs in Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Los Angeles County doesn't always get its fair share,'' she
said. ``San Francisco was where the power base was. I think under
Davis there will be a desire for fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who attended the
inauguration, said she also feels hopeful that the administration
will help make inroads in the area's transportation woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm setting up as many meetings with people that I can,''
Galanter said. ``I'm encouraged by the response.''

RANGERS DEFEAT SHARKS, 4-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a successful road trip, the Rangers returned to
New York and took the ice on Monday night at Madison Square Garden,
trying to avoid a letdown. But they skated through the opening 30
minutes at about the pace of families gliding around Rockefeller
Center's rink. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers could not score, and they also struggled to get off
a shot. Behind by two goals to the San Jose Sharks and needing
something to fire them up, the Rangers got it from Todd Harvey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Jose goaltender Steve Shields had not made a mistake through
the first 30 minutes, and his first error was one of judgment, not
knowing where Harvey was as he skated behind the net to pick up a
loose puck. Harvey, the fiery winger, accelerated, meeting Shields
at the puck and sending the Sharks' goaltender sprawling, his
helmet spiraling off. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a coincidence, but the Rangers scored the first of
four straight goals just over two minutes later. Once awakened, the
Rangers took charge and escaped with a 4-3 victory that kept their
record against San Jose unblemished at 13-0-2.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the Rangers evened their record on the season at
15-15-7 and continued the success they enjoyed on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've struggled a bit the last three games,'' Harvey said. ``I
wanted to come back with a big effort. We came out a little flat.
They scored those two goals, but we didn't panic. We knew if we
stayed with the system, we'd get a couple past Shields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't mean to hit him,'' Harvey said of the play that
seemed to lift his team. ``I wanted to try to draw a penalty there.
We just kind of ran into each other. His helmet came off. The crowd
here likes to have big hits.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The crowd also appreciated that Harvey contributed a goal and an
assist in the third period. After scoring once in the second, the
Rangers scored twice in 25 seconds early in the third and added a
fourth goal before the Sharks (11-17-8) scored with 3 minutes 32
seconds to play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third, Wayne Gretzky took a pass along the boards
from Adam Graves and, with an almost instantaneous twitch, fired a
pass in front to Harvey for the tying goal. And 25 seconds later,
the Rangers had the lead when Kevin Stevens tucked the puck into
the net. Graves poked in a loose puck off a shot by Harvey with
5:52 left to make the score 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks threw a scare into the Rangers once again when Ronnie
Stern swiped the puck from Stan Neckar alongside the Ranger goal
and fed Mike Ricci for a goal with 3:32 to play. But the Rangers
were able to hang on and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that we're growing a little bit,'' Rangers Coach John
Muckler said. ``Down two goals, we came back and got stronger. I
think it was just desperation. We needed this game badly.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And they needed Harvey badly, too. ``He was the best player on
the ice tonight, both physically and skillwise,'' Graves said. ``He
led us in the right direction.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, it seemed as if the Rangers were consumed by
an offensive malaise lingering from their 1-0 victory in St. Louis
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period on Monday night, the Rangers continued to be
unable to mount any sort of a threat. They had just three shots on
goal when San Jose's Bill Houlder went to the penalty box with 3:21
remaining in the period. They sent Stephane Matteau to the penalty
box with 2:47 left, giving the Rangers a five-on-three for 1:26. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers did little, flubbing their few chances. First,
Petr Nedved fed Harvey near the far post, but the puck skipped off
Harvey's stick. Gretzky then slipped a pass to Mike Knuble across
the ice as the first penalty was about to expire. But the puck
bounced over Knuble's stick as he tried to one-time the shot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers finished the period with seven shots, but the Sharks
had eight and a 1-0 lead thanks to a quick wrist shot by Patrick
Marleau on a pass from Joe Murphy. The Sharks increased their lead
to 2-0 in the second period when Brantt Myhres rushed the net and
saw the rebound of a Tony Granato slap shot roll in off his skate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not get a shot on goal that period until Gretzky
set himself before firing from close range into Shields' chest at
7:32. But after Harvey's hit on Shields, the team seemed to stir,
getting a pair of good chances before it paid off at 12:29 of the
period when Knuble skated across the blue line and left the puck
for Ulf Samuelsson, who fed Niklas Sundstrom. Sundstrom fired a
shot, and Knuble deflected it from outside the crease, sending it
behind Shields for the goal, cutting the deficit to 2-1.

AMONG PLAYERS, AN EAGERNESS TO VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was confusion. Not everyone knew how the vote
would be conducted or how the union would map out the logistics of
gathering 430 members in New York on 48 hours' notice, but players
seemed clear on wanting a resolution to the six-month National
Basketball Association lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The union's 19-member negotiating committee has rejected the
final offer the league has placed before it, but the executive
director, Billy Hunter, said on Monday that the players would
assemble in New York on Wednesday and cast a vote on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if a vote would be by a secret ballot of if
players unable to attend on such short notice would be given a
chance to decide the issue. But if the players repudiate their
negotiators and vote for the owners' proposal, it could save the
season from being canceled when the NBA's board of governors meets
on Thursday. NBA Commissioner David Stern has been urging the the
entire players association to vote for the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like some closure,'' Houston guard Mario Elie said on
Monday night. ``If we're going to vote, let's vote. I know guys are
tired of wondering what's going to happen next. It's like one day
you're up and you think a deal is close, and the next day things
fall apart. Guys have been on a yo-yo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good to get a vote by the body. The NBA isn't
represented by 19 players because there are 430 voices to be heard.
So I think it's best to deal with this now.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie did not indicate if he would vote for or against the
owners' proposal, but he said he thought the outcome would be
``very, very close.'' Other players also said the method of
balloting could alter the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a secret ballot,'' said New York Knicks forward Buck
Williams, a former union president, ``that might make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knew just how the meeting would be conducted. No one knew
if players would have to look the union's president, Patrick Ewing,
in the eye, along with Hunter and the rest of the negotiating
committee, and tell them that they disagreed with the committee's
recommendation to reject the owners' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   One agent thought a gathering of all the players would create an
intimidation factor that would make it hard for individuals to
stand up and voice their opinions. ``If they elect to go against
the recommendation of the committee, then we'll have to live with
that,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hunter and Ewing delivered the union's last proposal
to Stern and the deputy commissioner, Russ Granik. After the league
looked over the offer, Stern and Granik said that the sides were
still far apart and that they expected the board of governors to
cancel the season.
</P>
<P>
   With the potential for a vote on Wednesday, the players will
have a chance to decide what their fate may be before the owners
get an opportunity. As of Monday, no further negotiation sessions
were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a good thing,'' Williams said, referring to
the surprise players meeting. ``I'm sure once we get everyone in a
room, guys will be told that this is a bad deal that the owners
have proposed. But at some point, you have to get the body together
and get a pulse on what they are thinking.'' &QL;

When Nolan Ryan broke into the major leagues with the New York Mets
in 1966, he earned $10,000.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   The final stop of the ``Ryan Express'' is expected to come at
approximately 1 p.m. today, with official word coming from
Cooperstown, N.Y., of Ryan's election to the Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it will be one of the greatest things that ever
happened to me,'' said Ryan, who in his career established or
shared 53 major-league records, including all-time marks for
longevity (27 seasons), strikeouts (5,714) and no-hitters (seven).
He went 324-292 for four teams _ the Mets, Angels, Astros and
Rangers _ before retiring in 1993 at age 46. The victory total ties
him with Don Sutton for 12th all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Ryan as strong Hall candidates in their first year of
eligibility are George Brett and Robin Yount, two members of the
3,000-hit club. In addition, Carlton Fisk and Dale Murphy are
rookie candidates, while the list of holdovers on the 28-man ballot
includes Tony Perez, Jim Rice, Bruce Sutter, Tommy John and Gary
Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, 51, and Brett are considered locks to increase the current
Hall membership of 237, while uncertainty remains for the remaining
hopefuls needing the required 75-percent support of 10-year members
of the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six players have been elected in their first year of
eligibility, but only once _ during the original election in 1936
when Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Honus Wagner and Christy
Mathewson were chosen _ have three been picked at the same time.
The last player selected in his first year on the ballot was Mike
Schmidt in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Further proof of the degree of difficulty in being named to
baseball's exclusive fraternity: The last time the BBWAA voted
three players in was in 1991, when Rod Carew, Ferguson Jenkins and
Gaylord Perry made the cut. And the last time four new members were
elected by the writers was in 1955, when Joe DiMaggio, Gabby
Hartnett, Dazzy Vance and Ted Lyons were deemed worthy of
enshrinement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the previous six elections, the BBWAA has taken a total of
five players, with pitcher Sutton the lone selection last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to certainly be a stronger class than usual,'' said
Jerome Holtzman, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune and a
longstanding member of the BBWAA. ``It's very difficult to get into
the Hall _ which it should be. (Attaining) 75 percent (of the
voting) is difficult because if one writer leaves you off, that one
`no' cancels three `yes' votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Induction ceremonies are scheduled for July 25 in Cooperstown.
The Veterans Committee could add to the Class of 1999 when it meets
March 2 in Tampa, Fla., with manager Dick Williams and Pittsburgh
second baseman Bill Mazeroski expected to draw support.
</P>
<P>
   Local sentiment aside, Ryan had his most dominating years while
with California. But not until after today's announcement will he
say which cap he will wear on his Hall of Fame plaque. Five former
Astros are in the Hall, but none wears an Astros cap on his plaque.
The Rangers do not have a player in the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't made that decision,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, who spent his entire 21-year career with the Kansas City
Royals, has some impressive credentials: 3,154 hits, a .305
lifetime average, 317 home runs and the American League Most
Valuable Player Award in 1980. He is the only player to win batting
titles in three decades (1976, 1980 and 1990).
</P>
<P>
   Yount, a mainstay with the Milwaukee Brewers for 20 years, was
named AL MVP at two positions (in 1982 as a shortstop and in 1989
as a center fielder) and finished his career with 3,142 hits, 251
homers and 1,406 RBIs. And while some believe his .285 lifetime
average may keep him out in his first year, take note. Not since
that 1936 election has a player with 3,000 hits failed to be
elected in his first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to do well in the balloting are Fisk, who caught
more games (2,226) and hit more home runs (376) than any other
catcher in history, and Perez, a cog in Cincinnati's Big Red
Machine of the 1970s who is in his eighth year on the ballot. Last
year, he fell 34 votes (68 percent) shy of election.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Mickey Lolich, 217-191 and Most Valuable Player of the
1968 World Series, and Minnie Minoso, a .298 career hitter, are on
the ballot for the 15th and final time.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
With the NBA season on life support, the league's negotiating
committee finally looked at the players' ``last offer'' Monday and
unanimously recommended the league's Board of Governors pull the
plug. Wednesday, the players will get a chance to consider the same
dire option.
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern declared the players' proposal,
received in an hourlong meeting Monday, ``a step backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the prospects of an accord before Thursday's league
vote to cancel the season, Stern said: ``In light of the union's
so-called final proposal, it doesn't seem likely at all. It's
pretty grim.''
</P>
<P>
   Before league owners get a chance to vote to reject the players'
proposal and cancel the season, the union membership will gather in
New York to vote whether to accept the owners' last offer.
</P>
<P>
   Union executive director Billy Hunter said every union member is
invited to meet in New York on Wednesday when the membership will
vote on the owners' last proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter said he and the union's 19-member negotiating
committee would recommend the membership reject the proposal, even
at the cost of the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
   The union previously had insisted the membership would not vote
on any proposal its negotiating committee could not recommend.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter said Monday that the union would put the proposal to
a vote to ``to assure that the owners understand the level of
player resolve and the degree of opposition to the NBA's onerous
demands.''
</P>
<P>
   But before the union membership does vote, Stern added another
formidable consequence to consider. While describing the
cancellation of the season as almost inevitable, Stern offered his
strongest comments to date about the future of the NBA, including
the use of non-union ``replacement'' players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cancel the season, given this group of union leadership,
we have been directed by the committee to make plans for the
1999-2000 season,'' Stern said. ``It's not necessarily a pretty
sight early on, but obviously if we have to rebuild the league, we
will rebuild the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for people that share the spirit of partnership
that has gotten us where we have gotten. Clearly the people in
leadership do not share that spirit of partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, you give it your best shot, and we did. This is
not a union interested in making a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   There also has been speculation about the emergence of a rival
league.
</P>
<P>
   Of that option, Stern said: ``Our players have been sold a
certain bill of goods. To take the 100 best players and start a
league of six or eight teams is so sad to me, it's almost
unspeakable.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the influx of rookies this season and next alone
would end the careers of 20 percent of the union membership in a
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Board of Governors could accept the union's proposal
with a simple majority, although the nine owners on the labor
relations committee have shown their hand by voting to recommend
the cancellation of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're far apart on every issue,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik said. ``We're far apart on trying to achieve high-end
limitations, far apart on the percentage we think is needed on the
escrow, far apart on what needs to be done on the rookie scale, far
apart on exceptions to that cap that would increase our
expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some areas, the differences do not seem great enough to
warrant the cancellation of the season and the subsequent damage to
the league and its franchise values, or the financial windfalls
still available to NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   In past correspondences to his players, Hunter has asked if the
differences in the proposals seemed significant enough to cancel a
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stay tuned, and see on Thursday how close we are,'' Stern
said. ``In order to see who's more accurate in his depiction of
where we are, we're going to have to lose a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate making a deal.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
In a surprising turn of events, National Basketball Players
Association executive director Billy Hunter stepped off his soapbox
and _ finally _ broke out the ballot box.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After vowing he never would submit the league's final
collective-bargaining proposal for a vote of the union membership,
Hunter authorized just that Monday, apparently bowing to a
groundswell of players who were demanding a vote.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter stuck to his rhetorical guns, apparently thinking the
union would vote down the proposal. Hunter said he wanted to
``assure that the owners understand the level of player resolve and
the degree of opposition to the NBA's onerous demands.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's negotiating committee unanimously rejected the
league's last offer, made Dec. 27 at a meeting in Denver. Hunter
said Monday he will recommend all players do the same Wednesday in
New York. A meeting open to all 400-plus players will be held that
day, and a vote will be taken on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   If the players vote down the owners' offer, NBA commissioner
David Stern said he will recommend canceling the rest of the
1998-99 season when the league's Board of Governors meets Thursday
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Malik Rose, a member of the union's negotiating
committee, predicted at least 70 percent of the union membership
would vote to reject the proposal. But players who make their homes
in Houston begged to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to vote on this because I want to play,'' said free
agent Mario Elie, long a staunch union supporter. ``A lot of other
guys in my position want to play. A lot of guys have already lost a
lot of money. We went this far, and I'm proud of the guys for
stepping up and finally speaking out (about a vote). We want to get
this done.
</P>
<P>
   ``(New Jersey's) Jayson Williams made a good point _ I don't
feel good about being an NBA player now. I go up to fans, and
they're very disappointed and asking me when they're going to start
the season. This is the first time in my career that I feel bad to
be an NBA player. This should have been resolved. I guarantee guys
are going to vote to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern apparently thinks likewise, long lobbying for a vote by
the union rank and file. But Hunter resisted, claiming the players'
negotiating committee had the power to reject any offer it deemed
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   But players such as the Nets' Williams and Keith Van Horn,
Toronto's Kevin Willis, Minnesota's Sam Mitchell, Chicago's Luc
Longley and the Rockets' Brent Price have raised the subject of
submitting the owners' proposal for a vote. And more voices,
including Hakeem Olajuwon's, joined the chorus Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual players should have the right to decide their own
fate,'' Olajuwon said. ``You can't take that away. I would go along
with them. That's the power of the union _ everybody has individual
rights to decide their own destiny. They have to give everybody
that. They can't take that away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said he will give his opinion on the owners' proposal but
will not try to unduly influence the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they elect to go against the recommendation,'' he said,
``then we'll have to live with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' Robert Horry is in Hunter's camp, thinking the
owners' proposal isn't strong enough to make him vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that (having a vote) is the only right thing to do,''
Horry said. ``I think every guy should have the opportunity because
it's their livelihood that we're dealing with. From the other
things that I've been seeing, I'd probably be closer to no. There
are some things that need to be tweaked, to take a word from Karl
Malone. But I think there are a couple of things that need to be
tweaked here and there before it becomes an OK deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Elie said too many players have too much to lose to leave the
fate of the union in the hands of the negotiating committee, which
is fronted by mega-contract players such as president Patrick Ewing
and vice presidents Alonzo Mourning, Juwan Howard and Dikembe
Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand we voted for those guys on the committee, but I
don't want to keep my livelihood in those guys' hands,'' Elie said.
``I think each guy should have a say in what goes on, and that's
430 players, not just these top guys. Alonzo and Ewing, those guys
are going to be fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm going to be OK, but I still want to get a couple
more years in to be secure. Those guys (Ewing and Mourning), I
understand they're missing one year at $18 million, but those guys
have another $30 million stacked up in the bank, and I'm not one of
those guys. I want to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys play the game for the love of the money, but a lot
of guys play for the love of the game. I'm one of those guys who
plays for the love of the game, and I just want to go out there and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   So, like almost everything else in a tense basketball situation,
the labor war is going down to the wire.
</P>
<P>

TENNESSEE SECURES NO. 1 RANKING

 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Two identical plays involving the same two
Volunteers made Tennessee college football's national champions on
Monday night. Tee Martin to Peerless Price. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   Martin came into the inaugural Bowl Championship Series title
game overshadowed by the legacy of the quarterback he replaced, the
former Volunteer Peyton Manning; Price by Florida State's
all-America wide receiver, Peter Warrick. But with 9 minutes 15
seconds left in the Fiesta Bowl, Martin and Price hooked up on the
same play that had gone for 76 yards and led to a touchdown in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   It might as well have been called ``Go Long'' because that's
what Price did down the right sideline, as he had before, beating
the same Seminole defensive back, Mario Edwards. Martin delivered a
45-yard arc so soft, it rattled into Price's hands until he tucked
it in and raced the rest of the way for a 79-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was up by 20-9, and the Volunteers (13-0) were about
to collect their first national championship since 1951 with a
23-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in here and had to depend on someone,'' Martin said of
his chemistry with Price. ``I had to rely on somebody and Peerless
has been doing that for us all year. We knew each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Martin who engineered the championship, completing 11 of
18 passes for 278 yards and 2 touchdowns. It was Price, with 4
catches for 199 yards, who insured the victory in dazzling fashion.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Volunteer Coach Phillip Fulmer, standing on the field
at Sun Devil Stadium surrounded by the orange-clad faithful who
dominated this Fiesta Bowl-record crowd of 80,470, who stated the
obvious: ``It's been 47 years since Tennessee football has brought
one of these home. You can't say enough about Tee and Peerless and
the big plays they've made all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Martin, the highest-profile replacement on a team that lost
10 players to the National Football League: ``We're the only ones
who believed in ourselves. We won it with offense, defense, special
teams. We are a team. ``
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (11-2) could not manage a second national
championship for its coach, Bobby Bowden. In the final minutes of
the game, Shaun Ellis knocked the ball loose from the beleaguered
Seminole quarterback Marcus Outzen, and his teammate Billy Ratliff
jumped on it at the Florida State 29-yard line to set up Jeff
Hall's 23-yard field goal for a 23-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen banged over the goal line to cut the Seminoles' deficit
to 23-16, and with 1:29 to play, Florida State got the ball back
one final time when Travis Henry fumbled at Florida State's 10. But
cornerback Steve Johnson picked off Outzen's bomb in Tennessee
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen, making just his third career start after replacing the
injured Chris Weinke in the 10th game, was only 9 for 22 for 145
yards with 2 interceptions. But he also didn't have much help.
Warrick, hounded by Tennessee's defense, caught just one pass for 7
yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was penalties, however, that crushed Florida State _ 12 for
110 yards. Penalties killed drives twice late in the game when the
Seminoles were inside the Tennessee 40.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been the inaugural BCS title game, with the two best
teams in the nation, but when the gun sounded signaling the end of
the third quarter, you would hardly have known it. The teams had
combined for 18 penalties worth 130 yards, 11 punts, 4 fumbles and
2 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   And there had been only two big plays. With his team down by
14-6, Warrick provided one when he returned David Leaverton's punt
51 yards. But it was Leaverton's touchdown-saving tackle at the
27-yard line that began Florida State's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Two timeouts, three false-start penalties and 4:33 later, the
Seminoles had to settle for Sebastian Janikowski's 34-yard field
goal to close to within 14-9.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Price had combined for the first big play, setting up
the game's first score. In six plays, the Vols went 88 yards thanks
largely to a 76-yard Martin to Price bomb and a boneheaded play by
the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties especially hamstrung Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   On first down at the Volunteers' 12, Price faked Edwards and
then Sean Key and outraced the defenders as Martin arced a perfect
rainbow into his hands. Price was corralled, however, at the
Seminoles' 12 after a 76-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Hall had to settle for a 24-yard attempt, however. He hit it for
an apparent 3-0 lead, but Dexter Jackson slammed into him, and a
roughing penalty was called. Two plays later, Martin rolled left
and fired a rocket to the wide-open fullback Shawn Bryson for a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   On the next possession, Outzen made the kind of mistake many
feared he might commit. On first down on the Florida State 49, he
tried to find Warrick in the flat, but Dwayne Goodrich snapped up
the ball and romped 54 yards down the left sideline for a 14-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   But later Martin tried to go to Price again, as he crossed
midfield. His wobbly ball floated and safety Derrick Gibson grabbed
it and ran 43 yards down the left sideline until he was pushed out
of bounds at the 3.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Seminoles fullback William McCray banged it
over. But fittingly, on a night when the best hardly played like
it, Janikowski's point-after attempt was moved back 5 yards because
of an offside call. Janikowski then bounced the football off the
crossbar _ only the second point-after he had missed all year _ and
it was 14-6.

UCLA WINS IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If nothing else, know this about the UCLA Bruins:
When coach Steve Lavin calls a 20-second timeout in the first three
minutes of play _ ie: when he sees sloppiness, lethargy, or both _
trouble is sure to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case Monday night. The Bruins opened with turnovers
on four of five possessions, prompting a Lavin timeout that, of
course, signalled tough times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA eventually shook its funk in time to rally from a late
deficit in regulation and defeat Arizona State 88-85 in overtime at
Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took an 86-85 lead on Jerome Moiso's free throw with
1:07 left in overtime, then forced Arizona State guard Eddie House
into a difficult, high-arching jumper from the right baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Bailey grabbed the rebound, and after a timeout _ what
else? _ Bailey hit Earl Watson in the lane for a hanging jumper
that gave the Bruins an 88-85 lead with 19 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   House missed a 3-pointer from the left corner, then Bobby Lazor
missed a 22-footer at the buzzer, and UCLA had defeated ASU for the
20th consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA forward JaRon Rush, back from his one-game suspension,
entered to a moderate ovation with 13 minutes left and promptly
drained his first shot, a 3-pointer from the left wing. He would
finish with a team-high 19 points in one of his best games of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Bruins lacked the emotion they displayed two
nights earlier against archrival Arizona. Lavin's timeout settled
them slightly, but their first half was spotted with hurried shots
and bad decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The worst came with eight minutes left, when Baron Davis became
entangled with House under the basket and whipped his elbow to
break free. Although it did not appear malicious, Davis grazed
House in the face and was assessed a technical foul _ his third
personal of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, it was unclear who had made the mistake: Davis, for
throwing the elbow; referee Charles Range, for his super-sensitive
whistle; or Lavin, for having the uber-aggressive Davis in the game
with two fouls and eight minutes left. It would eventually cost
Davis, who fouled out with 2:21 left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, the Bruins focused their defensive energy on
Arizona's best player, point guard Jason Terry. Monday, House was
their priority. Watson and Bailey took turns shadowing House, who,
unlike Terry, plays without the ball and is most dangerous curling
off screens for jump shots. He made 3 of 13 shots and finished with
10 points.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins were not as successful against ASU forward Mike
Batiste, who scored nine consecutive points midway through the
second half and gave UCLA's big men a lesson in low post play.
</P>
<P>
   When Batiste's production slowed in the final minutes, Lazor
warmed up. His free throws tied it at 65-65 and then again at
67-67. Then, with three minutes left, he drained a jumper from the
right baseline to give the Sun Devils a 72-69 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed 74-71 with 40 seconds left when Davis sliced
through Arizona State's zone defense, grabbed a pass from Watson
and made a leaning jumper. He was fouled by Batiste and hit the
free throw to tie the game 74-74.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, ASU guard Alton Mason dribbled past Davis to
the basket, but UCLA's Ray Young jumped into Mason's path and
forced a traveling violation.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA gave the ball to Davis, but his charge to the hoop was
thwarted by Batiste, forcing a held ball and giving ASU possession
with 2.8 seconds left. Mason's 60 footer clanked off the rim at the
buzzer.

NORTHRIDGE EDGES IDAHO STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge coach Bobby Braswell called
the play in the huddle. Then associate coach Mike Johnson added a
twist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to Rico (Harris),'' Braswell said. ``As they got
out of the huddle, Johnson grabbed Derrick Higgins and said, `Go to
the glass, you have to be ready to make a tip to win this game.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Good tip by Johnson. And by Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   It was Higgins' tip-in with 1.1 seconds remaining that lifted
the Matadors to a 79-77 home win against a spirited Idaho State in
front of 575.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight game Higgins, known as a defensive
stalwart, hit a shot in the waning moments for CSUN. But unlike
Saturday's 3-pointer at Northern Arizona that sent the game into
overtime before the Matadors lost, this one gave CSUN the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Rico was going to miss, I was going to get the rebound,''
said Higgins, who had 15 points and eight offensive rebounds. ``I
have to try to be the leader. I'm the captain. I have to be the
leader. Follow me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was the Matadors' defense, which was beaten for a
bunch of easy lay-ups, that provided the final opportunity after
Idaho State took a 74-70 lead with 3:58 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors scored the next seven points after stellar
defensive efforts before Stephen Brown's 3-pointer tied it with
2:16 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho State had three chances to break the 77-77 tie in the
final minute, but twice couldn't get a shot off because of
defensive pressure as Jason Crowe forced Brown (14 assists) into a
pair of errant passes.
</P>
<P>
   Following a timeout with 11.1 seconds remaining, the Matadors
went to Harris. He missed a 14-footer from the right side, but on
the advice of Johnson, Higgins flew down the lane for the tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some divine intervention there,' Braswell said. ``We
didn't play well at all, but if you're going to be a good team,
even when you play bad you have to find a way to win. We played
poorly and found a way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The tip-in accounted for the only points scored in the last two
minutes, and helped CSUN (9-5, 1-1 Big Sky) keep away from a
disastrous loss that would have changed the complexion of their
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals (2-10, 0-2) have lost five in a row, were coming off
a 27-point loss at Eastern Washington and averaging a mere 58
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   While the Matadors did lose interest for a while after taking a
49-36 lead at the half, they also survived a surreal shooting
performance from Idaho State's Kevin Sweetwyne. The junior guard
scored an acrobatic 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors were led by sophomore guard Carl Holmes, who made
his first five 3-pointers and finished with a season-high 25 points
and eight rebounds. But the news wasn't all good for Holmes, who
earlier in the day saw the team doctor about painful calcium
deposits in his knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to go back in a couple of weeks because there was a
lot of movement in the knee,'' said Holmes, who hit 8 of 13 shots
from the field. ``The shooting, it's confidence I came out and the
guy (Johnson) was telling me I need to be in the weight room. I
said, `You're right.' Then I kept hitting shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Matadors survived a game they should have lost. But
they're hoping the last-second win completes a long, painful
transition from being an average team to a Big Sky contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll take it, man. It's the Big Sky,'' Higgins said. ``In the
past we couldn't pull these out. We pulled this one out, so I guess
that breaks the curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Eighty percent of CSUN's starting lineup was different
than against Northern Arizona. Only Higgins kept his starting job.
He was joined by Harris, Hewitt Rolle, Jason Crowe and Holmes....
Walk-on Eian Daniels didn't dress and is considering transferring.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
TEMPE, Ariz. _ His name left no doubt, much like his team left no
doubt once he showed the way.
</P>
<P>
   Peerless.
</P>
<P>
   For much of this cool night in the desert with the college
football national championship on the line and nerves at their
ends, almost everyone except this precocious receiver looked
anxious, out of sorts and overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State quarterback could have been called Marcus
``Three And'' Outzen. Outzen hustled and hurled caution to the wind
but ultimately made Florida State coach Bobby Bowden's worst fears
come true.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen missed receivers, threw critical interceptions, including
one returned for a touchdown, and did everything a sophomore
one-time third-string quarterback should do except sit on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the usually bruising Tennessee running game
generously could have been called average. The likes of Travis
Henry, Travis Stephens and Shawn Bryson often ran only into the
attacking front seven of the Seminoles' defense, finishing with a
mere 95 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The two kickers, Tennessee's Jeff Hall and Florida State's
Sebastian Janikowski, considered among the best in the nation, each
missed an extra point, although Hall's was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Balls were snapped into the dirt by special-teams centers.
Passes slipped through hands. Players slipped on the field. There
were lost fumbles and interceptions _ seven turnovers in all.
</P>
<P>
   And the officiating crew called the game as if all of them were
named John Cooper _ raining yellow flags on the field and making
things sloppier than even the 11-1 and title-dreaming Buckeyes
could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   There were a combined 21 penalties in the game, with the silly
mistakes virtually evenly distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Noles clearly made the most severe gaffes of the night when
a pair of potential scoring drives were pushed out of range and a
personal foul helped the Volunteers take a field goal off the board
and turn it into a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was Peerless Price, the spirited kid from Ohio,
of all places, who spent the days leading up to Monday night's
Fiesta Bowl telling all the world not to forget about him. Not to
forget Tennessee, which entered undefeated and an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   How could they now?
</P>
<P>
   Price made some waves on the way to Monday night's
national-championship showdown when he was the only Vols player who
seemed relaxed, confident and sure the game would be Tennessee's.
</P>
<P>
   He responded to bold predictions from the Florida State
secondary and made a bold prediction himself, saying he wouldn't be
intimidated by college football's great intimidators.
</P>
<P>
   He listened to all the talk about the Tennessee running game
being vital to the game's outcome and said: ``Nah. It will be the
passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was.
</P>
<P>
   It was Peerless.
</P>
<P>
   It was Price being relaxed, confident and sure. It was Tennessee
23-16, and now the Volunteers can only be called peerless, too.
</P>
<P>
   With the two biggest plays of the night _ a 76-yard bomb from
quarterback Tee Martin to set up the Vols' first touchdown and a
79-yarder for the clinching touchdown in the fourth quarter _ Price
erased all doubts about not just himself but this Tennessee team.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my team to win, I knew it was going to have to be me
making the plays,'' said Price, who finished with four catches for
a Fiesta Bowl-record 199 yards. ``I knew we were in a game that was
tough on both sides. I had to score. I knew we had to win.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, and the names all fit. Peerless was indeed. Tennessee
was indeed an unquestioned No. 1, too, leaving all the Ohio States,
Kansas States and others scrambling for something less.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we won every game there would be no doubt,'' Price
said. ``Coming in, we knew if we won this one, there wouldn't be
any question.''
</P>
<P>
   It was sometimes sloppy, sometimes silly and often nervous and
often in doubt. But when the clock wound down and the Volunteers'
party broke into a frenzy, all eyes looked to midfield.
</P>
<P>
   There was Price, tossing his helmet into the air, standing in
the middle of it all and dancing away as fireworks exploded
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his game,'' Martin said of Price. ``Just like all
year, when we needed a big play at an important time, we turned to
him and there he was.''
</P>
<P>
   There he was.
</P>
<P>
   Peerless.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ His predecessor has a street named after him outside
Neyland Stadium and a life-size likeness greeting visitors to the
university athletics complex. For much of Tennessee's season of
dreams, the new kid found himself suffering comparisons to the
legend that was Peyton Manning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   No more. Tennessee may always be Peyton's place, but the
business of winning clearly suits his successor to a Tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to come out and prove to everyone that we were
the No. 1 football team in the nation,'' Tennessee quarterback Tee
Martin said after leading the Volunteers to a 23-16 win over
Florida State in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl national-championship
game. ``We came a long way, but we knew we were going to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin (11-of-18 passing for 278 yards and two touchdowns) made
sure of it. With nothing more than Tennessee's first national
championship since 1951 on the line, the junior from Mobile, Ala.,
stepped up in the pocket and into Volunteers history. His 79-yard
touchdown pass to Peerless Price (four catches 199 yards, one
touchdown) with 9:17 remaining broke open a five-point game, and
Tennessee held on to claim the much-maligned Bowl Championship
Series' first attempt at a national-title game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been 47 years since a Tennessee football team brought one
of these things home,'' Volunteers coach Phillip Fulmer said.
``We've got a special place for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few will argue with the Vols' credentials. At 13-0, the team
that finished the regular season No. 1 will remain there.
</P>
<P>
   FSU, meanwhile, finished 11-2 as coach Bobby Bowden came up
short in his effort to win a second national championship to go
with the one the Seminoles claimed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a season of close calls and great escapes, the Vols
didn't get to celebrate until they had endured some anxious
moments.
</P>
<P>
   After kicker Jeff Hall (whose extra point after the Price
touchdown was blocked) tacked on a 23-yard field goal with 6:01 to
play, Tennessee had to hold off a Seminoles rally. Quarterback
Marcus Outzen's seven-yard touchdown run cut the lead to 23-16 with
3:42 left, and FSU kicker Sebastian Janikowski appeared to recover
his own onside kick to keep hope alive.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, however, ruled Janikowski touched the ball before
it traveled the necessary 10 yards, and Tennessee took possession.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the Vols were unable to run out the clock when Travis
Henry fumbled at the Florida State 10 with 1:29 remaining, giving
the Seminoles a final shot.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted all of one play. Outzen's deep throw for Laveranues
Coles was intercepted by Steve Johnson, and the tens of thousands
of orange-and-white-clad fans who made the trek West could get on
with the party.
</P>
<P>
   While the finish was breathless enough, the final game of a
memorable college season was hardly a masterpiece. Instead, it was
a night filled with penalties (21 for 165 yards combined),
turnovers (seven total, four by Tennessee), special-teams blunders
(two extra points were blocked) and enough mistakes to leave Fulmer
and Bowden shaking their heads as if they had just witnessed an
August scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening 15 minutes of tentative play and sloppy
special-teams work, Tennessee finally broke out ahead, scoring two
touchdowns in a span of 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The first was set up by a 76-yard pass from Martin to Price
(named Most Valuable Player on offense), but the score would
require a bit of daring on the part of the normally conservative
Fulmer.
</P>
<P>
   When Hall was roughed as he made a 24-yard field goal, Fulmer
opted to take the points off the board, accepting a first-and-goal
at the FSU four. On the next play, Martin found fullback Shawn
Bryson on the left side with a short pass that Bryson carried in
for the score, making the gamble pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Volunteers faithful had gotten done rocking Sun Devil
Stadium with another rendition of Rocky Top, Tennessee was on the
board again.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays into the Seminoles' ensuing possession, Outzen hung an
out pattern for wide receiver Peter Warrick, who caught just one
pass for seven yards on the night. Tennessee cornerback Dwayne
Goodrich (named the game's defensive MVP) stepped in for the easy
interception, which he returned 54 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, it was 14-0 with 13:40 remaining until halftime.
But the Vols quickly showed they could give as well as receive.
</P>
<P>
   On a second-and-eight from his 24, Martin went deep down the
middle for Price, only to find Florida State rover Derrick Gibson
instead. Gibson took advantage of the poor read and returned the
interception 43 yards to the Tennessee three-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, fullback William McCray extended the ball
over from the one to give the Seminoles their first score. The
extra point, however, went awry after an illegal-procedure penalty
set the ball back five yards. Janikowski's kick was tipped at the
line and glanced off the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, FSU would get a big play from Warrick, who
returned a punt 51 yards to the Volunteers' 27 before punter David
Leaverton made the saving tackle. With three procedure penalties
hindering their efforts, the Seminoles needed 4:33 to move 10 yards
in 10 plays before settling for a 34-yard Janikowski field goal to
cut the margin to 14-9 with 1:17 left until the break.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way into the fourth quarter, when Tennessee
appeared to have a chance to put the game away. After forcing
Florida State to punt from its end zone, the Vols were set up at
the Seminoles' 35, and Fulmer decided to go for the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Off a play fake, Martin went deep down the right side for Price.
The ball was thrown into double coverage but hit Price in the
chest, only to glance into the hands of safety Dexter Jackson, who
returned it to his 26.
</P>
<P>
   FSU moved to the Tennessee 26 before stalling on _ you guessed
it _ a false start, followed by a sack.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, Price would atone for his mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave Peerless another chance to come through for us,''
Martin said, ``and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   In Peyton's place, they are making room for a few new heroes.

<P>
   Much ado was made about Chamique Holdsclaw and her homecoming
date at Madison Square Garden Sunday night. Tennessee, the
defending national champion now ranked No. 2 behind Connecticut,
beat up on Rutgers at the hoops mecca in the heart of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   However, the story of another Tennessee victory was nothing
compared to Holdsclaw's return to New York, where she was a
schoolgirl wiz and the nation's top recruit.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw is the greatest women's college player in the country
today _ possibly the best ever _ and little she does escapes
national attention. That is why a record 15,735 fans showed up at
the Garden to see Holdsclaw play.
</P>
<P>
   In March, after Tennessee makes another run at a national title,
Holdsclaw will look to her future. It is a mere formality that she
will sign a deal with the WNBA, then be assigned to the New York
Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Jamie Redd. Or Amber Hall. Or any of the other
collegiate standouts who lead their leagues or conferences in
scoring or rebounding or steals.
</P>
<P>
   What happens to those two University of Washington seniors now
that the American Basketball League has shut down and the only pro
opportunity in the United States is with the WNBA? What happens to
the many female players now that the competition for jobs has
dwindled to 132 openings?
</P>
<P>
   That's how many roster spots there will be in the WNBA after the
league expands to Minnesota and Orlando, pushing the total to 12
teams. That is 90 fewer than existed two weeks ago, when the ABL,
in the midst of its third season, declared bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Redd and Hall, who played in the Huskies' Pac-10 opener Monday
night against Washington State, both have valuable college
experience. Both have played for their respective national programs
_ Redd, a skilled shooting guard, with USA Basketball; Hall, a
tenacious rebounding center, with the Canadian National Team.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, Redd and Hall could have figured that the next
step for them was a roster spot on the Seattle Reign or one of the
other eight American Basketball League teams. Maybe Hall could have
found work in the WNBA, where post players are desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   But with the death of the ABL, it is clear now that for players
like Redd and Hall, the chances for landing a job just got slimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely all disappointed to see that opportunity
taken away from so many players. It's definitely not good news for
women's basketball,'' Washington coach June Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty, an Ohio State graduate who led the Buckeyes to Big
Ten championships in the late 1970s, is one of hundreds of American
female college players who had to go to Europe to play
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   That tide was stemmed three years ago, when great American
players like Teresa Edwards and former Reign star Cindy Brown (now
with the WNBA) finally had the ABL and the WNBA as options.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, I know I felt lucky to have the opportunities
to play overseas ... but you hate to see (more players again)
having to rely on that in the future. There is nothing like playing
for your country, playing in front of your fans,'' Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is why a group of ABL fans mobilized to raise money
to buy the ABL, now in Chapter 11. It is clear that ABL fans
understood the attraction of the grass-roots league that failed to
attract a TV deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely, however, that the WNBA slowly will
incorporate ABL cities into its fold. Whatever animosity or
suspicion ABL players, coaches or fans had about the WNBA, it is
quickly evaporating. Women's basketball fans in Seattle are so
eager for the pro game to return that the WNBA is hardly a
disastrous alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, there is no word on what happens next. ABL
players have let the WNBA know they are interested and available,
but the WNBA has issued no response other than the requisite
``we're sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the players knew they were going to be invited to try out,
many of them would not go to Europe right now,'' former Reign coach
Tammy Holder said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The race is on, you see. There are 90 players in the ABL looking
for new jobs. Almost every one is of the same caliber as those that
now populate WNBA rosters, but only about 30 or 40 percent would
likely have a chance to make the switch.
</P>
<P>
   Even Holder knows the score here. ``A lot of players are a dime
a dozen. The WNBA is going to be looking at the cream of the crop.
After that, they're going to be loyal to the players that were
loyal to them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be realistic, if the WNBA only brings in Orlando and
Minnesota this summer, that makes 12 teams and that means about
half of the ABL players won't get drafted,'' Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   And that trickle-down effect will be felt all over the college
ranks. From Duke to Stanford to Arizona and Washington, a future
once so bright for players like Redd and Hall just got a lot less
so. Not exactly what you like to see for Generation Next.

VOLUNTEERS CAP PERFECT SEASON WITH FIESTA BOWL WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The inaugural college football season of the Bowl
Championship Series had produced mostly criticism and controversy.
Monday night in the Fiesta Bowl, it labored and grunted and finally
gave rise to a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which had survived several narrow escapes in its
first season without the marvelous Peyton Manning, parlayed a
big-play passing offense and a defense that stifled Florida State
and thwarted the Seminoles, 23-16.
</P>
<P>
   As the only team besides under-scheduled Tulane to go unbeaten
this year, Tennessee was the consensus national champion when The
Associated Press media vote late Monday night joined the coaches'
choice of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``All year long, we've been called a team of destiny,'' said
Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer. ``It wasn't always perfect or the
prettiest, but they found a way to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in this one, it was neither perfect nor pretty, as
two defense-dominated teams made a passel of mistakes, especially
in a first half devoid of execution. But Tennessee (13-0) was
clearly the better team, taking advantage of Seminole stand-in
quarterback Marcus Outzen's inexperience to claim its first
national title since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't look very good to me,'' lamented Bobby Bowden,
the Florida State coach, whose team finished 11-2.
</P>
<P>
   In its spotless season, the Volunteers needed a late,
fourth-down pass-interference penalty to win by a point at
Syracuse; a shaky overtime victory against Florida; and a
near-miracle fumble by Arkansas in the final two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the season, Fulmer said, ``We said we didn't need to
be the best team (in college football). We just had to be the best
team on Saturday _ or Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   No question about this particular Monday. Quarterback Tee Martin
hit wide receiver Peerless Price with four passes for a startling
199 yards, including one of 76 yards that set up the Vols' first
touchdown and a second of 79 that made it 20-9 in the fourth
quarter. Martin completed 11 of 18 for 278 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Tennessee ran just effectively enough against the
voracious Seminole defense, while the Vol defense controlled Outzen
in just his third college start as a fill-in for injured Chris
Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, though top-ranked, came in as a 5{-point underdog,
testament to its perceived luck this year and Florida State's
10-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chip on our shoulder because of that,'' said the
6-foot-3, 215-pound Martin. ``Winning the national championship
should get us some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming nobody noticed the first half, that is. It was a
thoroughly messy 30 minutes, punctuated by:
</P>
<P>
   --Tennessee's six illegal-procedure calls, three on one series.
</P>
<P>
   --Flags on Florida State for roughing the punter and roughing
the kicker, the latter used by the Vols to set up their first
touchdown, a four-yard pass from Martin to running back Shawn
Bryson in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   --A pass by Outzen pilfered and returned 54 yards for a
touchdown by Vol corner Dwayne Goodrich, and an equally ill-advised
throw by Martin over the middle with the Vols leading 14-0,
prompting Florida State's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a very rusty football team,'' said Bowden, referring
to a 44-day break since his last game. ``They were, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between Price's production and that of Florida State's
mercurial Peter Warrick was huge. Miscommunication between Outzen
and Warrick, combined with Tennessee's excellent coverage, resulted
in Warrick catching one pass for a niggling seven yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to get the ball to their threat,'' said Bowden,
with Outzen sitting by his side, ``and we had a hard time getting
the ball to our threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The halftime score of 14-9, Tennessee, held up into the fourth
quarter, when Florida State drove to the Vols' 26 with 12 minutes
left. After a miserable series, FSU had to punt from the 41, and
three plays later, Martin hit Price, who shed Mario Edwards' close
coverage on the sideline and took it 79 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a very crucial thing,'' Bowden said, referring to the
aborted FSU drive. ``I thought momentum was creeping to our side.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Outzen's seven-yard touchdown scramble brought the
Seminoles to within 23-16 with 3:42 left. But Florida State's
onside kick was ruled illegal and Tennessee took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have hit it (the ball) twice,'' Bowden conceded. ``I
think the call was accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained only for Tennessee to drive to the FSU 10, with the
help of a fourth-and-one pass from Martin to Bryson _ a telling
statement as to the Vols' confidence in Martin. The Seminoles had a
final chance on a Vol fumble, but Outzen burped up another
interception on a deep route.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a college season that wound through Ohio State,
Kansas State and UCLA finished in the lap of where the gods seemed
to want it _ Tennessee.

UCLA WINS IN OVERTIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If nothing else, know this about the UCLA Bruins:
When coach Steve Lavin calls timeout in the opening minutes _ i.e.,
when he sees sloppiness, lethargy, or both _ trouble is sure to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case Monday night, 48 hours after an emotional
victory over Arizona. The Bruins committed turnovers on four of
five possessions against Arizona State, prompting a Lavin timeout
after 2{ minutes. As always, it signaled tough times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys at halftime that's why coaches get gray hairs
and ulcers and don't sleep,'' Lavin said. ``After an incredibly
emotional game.... I knew there would be a letdown. You use
everything you can for motivation, and you can still see it coming
like a freight train, and you can't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 12 minutes, we were awful.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins were good enough in the final six to escape with
an 88-85 overtime victory Monday night before 8,828 at Pauley
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Baron Davis' three-point play with 40 seconds remaining tied the
game at 74-74 and forced UCLA's first overtime of the season. The
teams exchanged baskets for 4{ minutes, until Earl Watson's hanging
jumper with 19 seconds remaining gave the Bruins an 88-85 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struggling all week as far as hitting shots,'' said
Watson, who was 3 of 12 from the field before the game-winner. ``I
knew sooner or later it had to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU guard Eddie House clanked a 3-pointer from the left corner,
then forward Bobby Lazor missed a 22-footer at the buzzer _
securing UCLA's 20th consecutive victory over the Sun Devils and
its eighth straight win overall.
</P>
<P>
   The No.7 Bruins are now 1-0 in Pac-10 games in which Lavin calls
a quick timeout. No doubt there will be other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could sense (a letdown) because we weren't playing an
Arizona team that was ranked sixth in the nation,'' UCLA forward
JaRon Rush said. ``It was hard to get emotional, but I think we got
through it at about the 12-minute mark. They've got a good team,
and we just couldn't break away.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a one-game suspension (a result of homesickness),
Rush submitted his most complete performance of the season with 19
points and eight offensive rebounds. However, he is not
recommending homesickness and suspensions as cures for subpar play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to prove I belong here,'' Rush said.
</P>
<P>
   Watson, the other half of UCLA's Kansas City connection, was the
key component on defense. Despite a bruised bone in his right foot
that may force him to miss Thursday's game at Oregon State, Watson
played 44 minutes and held House, ASU's leading scorer, to 10
points on 3-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same game plan we used on (Arizona's) Jason
Terry,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins had little success against Sun Devils forward
Mike Batiste. The versatile senior gave UCLA's rookie big men,
Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, a lesson in low post play _ scoring
a game-high 22 points, including nine in a row midway through the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Gadzuric did manage a career-high 14 rebounds, but because of
ASU's speed, he and Moiso rarely played together. Instead, Lavin
used a three-guard lineup for much of the second half. Ray Young
(11 points, four rebounds) and Ryan Bailey (11 points, four
assists) responded with their most productive games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our twin towers with a smaller team is a difficult matchup,''
Lavin said. ``We were more effective when we went small.''
</P>
<P>
   When Batiste's production slowed in the final minutes, Lazor
warmed up. His free throws tied it at 65-65 and then again at
67-67. Then, with three minutes left, he drained a jumper from the
right baseline to give the Sun Devils a 72-69 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins trailed 74-71 with 40 seconds left when Davis sliced
through Arizona State's zone defense, grabbed a pass from Watson
and made a leaning jumper. He was fouled by Batiste and hit the
free throw to tie the game 74-74.
</P>
<P>
   After a timeout, ASU guard Alton Mason dribbled past Davis to
the basket, but Young jumped into Mason's path and forced a
traveling violation.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA gave the ball to Davis, but his charge to the hoop was
thwarted by Batiste, forcing a held ball and giving ASU possession
with 2.8 seconds left. Mason's 60-footer clanked off the rim at the
buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took an 86-85 lead on Moiso's free throw with 1:07
left in overtime, then forced House into a difficult, high-arcing
jumper from the right baseline. Bailey grabbed the rebound, and
after a timeout _ what else? _ found Watson for the clinching
basket.

GRAY DAVIS SWORN IN AS CALIFORNIA'S GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT B. GUNNISON and CARLA MARINUCCI  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
 
 
SACRAMENTO _ Gray Davis took the oath of office as California's
37th governor Monday and immediately pledged to improve public
education, strengthen the state's ban on assault weapons and end
``the politics of division.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Davis, the state's first Democratic governor in 16 years, was
repeatedly interrupted by cheers and applause _ 39 times in all _
as he declared that his administration will combine ``lasting
values and new direction'' with a goal of restoring ``a standard of
decency and compassion to government.''
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Davis saluted outgoing Governor Pete Wilson
``for dedicating more than 30 years of public service to California
and America,'' but he made it clear that he will steer a different
course.
</P>
<P>
   In a pointed reference to Wilson's support for efforts to cut
services to illegal immigrants and end government affirmative
action programs, Davis said, ``We will repair our strained social
fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   In the line that earned him the biggest cheers of the day, Davis
said, ``Throughout my campaign, I pledged that the day I took
office, the era of wedge-issue politics in California would be
over. Well, my fellow Californians, that day is here. That time is
now. And you can finally ring down the curtain on the politics of
division.''
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd of 3,500, including Vice President Al Gore and
his wife, Tipper, gave Davis a thunderous standing ovation _ one of
11 that came during the address _ Wilson and his wife, Gayle, sat
quietly in their chairs on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In his 26-minute speech, Davis defined himself as ``a moderate
and a pragmatist by nature.'' And he promised, ``I will govern
neither from the right, nor left, but from the center, propelled
not by ideology, but by common sense that seeks better results from
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   He also distanced himself from former Governor Jerry Brown, his
former boss, who was sworn in Monday as mayor of Oakland. Brown
promised an ``era of limits'' in 1975 and urged Californians to
``lower your expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davis took an opposite tack, urging ``the era of higher
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made a few specific proposals, including granting
automatic admission to a University of California campus to top
high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek to ensure diversity and fair play by guaranteeing
that those students who truly excel by graduation in the top 4
percent of their high school _ whether it's in West Los Angeles or
East Palo Alto _ will automatically be admitted to the University
of California,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also sought to address one of the central dilemmas of his
administration _ how to meet the political demands of his organized
labor supporters like the California Teachers Association while
achieving changes in classrooms to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was frequently at war with the politically powerful
teachers union, but Davis offered a different vocabulary _ and some
tough words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blaming teachers, as many have done, is no solution,'' he
said. ``Yes, there are deficient teachers and principals out there.
Under my administration, either they will get better _ or they will
be encouraged to find another line of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But let us not forget the tens to thousands of selfless
teachers and administrators who struggle _ often against terrible
odds _ for too little pay, and frequently at their own expense _ to
educate our children every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also pledged to sign legislation strengthening the state's
ban on semiautomatic military-style firearms. The state's original
law has been weakened by court decisions. Last year, Wilson vetoed
a measure that would have banned the firearms based on their design
rather than by specific models, as the original law intended.
</P>
<P>
   The new governor repeated his pledge to travel to Mexico to
improve relations that worsened after the Proposition 187 campaign
in 1994 in which illegal immigration was singled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will, of course, speak out against illegal immigration,''
Davis said. ``But I will treat the only foreign country with which
we (Californians) share a border with the respect and courtesy a
peace-loving, sovereign nation deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   And on abortion, Davis got cheers when he said that efforts ``to
pass bills restricting women's constitutional rights ... simply
will not happen on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the day was spent in public, Davis also attended a
private reception hosted by the California Chamber of Commerce,
shaking hands with lobbyists for health care providers, utilities
and oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, his transition and now the first day of his
administration, Davis has tried to assure business interests that
he will not abandon them in favor of the trial lawyers and labor
unions who generously backed his campaign. Davis' inauguration was
the centerpiece of a busy day of ceremonies as three other newly
elected Democrats _ Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante, Attorney
General Bill Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides _ took their
oaths of office, and the Democratic-controlled Legislature met for
the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Davis' ceremony was California Supreme Court Justice
Stanley Mosk, 86, who attended the inauguration of the first
Democrat to be elected governor this century _ Culbert Olson, who
took office in 1939. Davis is the fourth Democrat, after Pat Brown
and his son, Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Also present was Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco, whom Davis
called ``my anchor tenant'' for his early endorsement, when many
political experts had written off his primary election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Seated next to Brown was Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whom Davis once
compared in a television ad during the 1992 election to millionaire
tax evader Leona Helmsley. Davis and Feinstein have since made up.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Davis hosted two inaugural balls, one with a rock
'n' roll theme where the usually reserved Davis performed a brief
rap: ``My real name is Graham but you can call me Gray. I whupped
Dan Lungren on election day.''
</P>
<P>
   He told the crowd of several hundred mostly young supporters,
``When I'm in my rocking chair, I want you to say Davis put on a
pretty good party. He wasn't that bad a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis then departed for the other ball, a black tie affair
attended by his more well-heeled backers, lobbyists and political
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, in the Capitol rotunda, the new governor and
Gore arrived to shake hands and greet a line of 1,500 supporters _
schoolchildren, union workers and veterans, some of whom had waited
three hours for the chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He opened his door and his heart for us,'' said Abdalla
Megahed, an Egyptian-born construction worker. Megahed, who arrived
from San Francisco by Greyhound bus at dawn, said he made the trip
because Davis and the Democrats now appeared ready to extend a hand
to all Californians. ``As an Arab American, I think that means some
suffering will end ... and I salute them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, appearing to clearly enjoy the moment, respectfully
saluted veterans as they approached, posed for photos, and then
just minutes into his administration, began fielding ideas _ and
requests _ from voters and longtime supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even kids from the fourth-grade class from Rio Linda School
District _ all of whom had donned badges announcing them as
``Future Governors of California'' _ wasted no time in lobbying
him.
</P>
<P>
   Cheng Saeteurn, 9, said he wanted to ask the governor for
``better health care'' and ``more police forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Amber Alderson, 8, a third-grader from Sacramento's Taylor
Street School, decided to start her own political career. She told
Davis, ``Good luck, and can I be president some day?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a governor,'' Davis smiled, then motioned to Gore.
``But you can ask the next guy if you can be president.'' The vice
president, who chose to be with Davis and in California _ the
nation's most populous state _ just days after formally announcing
his intentions to be a presidential candidate, told her yes.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Gore were due at a private luncheon when time ran out,
but both worked a rope line to shake hands with the hundreds of
children who had waited.
</P>
<P>
   After all, said one Democratic operative, looking toward future
elections, ``they're all potential voters.''

JERRY BROWN BECOMES OAKLAND'S NEW MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK DELVECCHIO  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
OAKLAND, Calif. _ Former Governor Jerry Brown became mayor of
Oakland Monday, calling for democracy and civility over mediocrity
and pauperism in urban America as thousands reveled into the night
in a free-form civic celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old scion of one of the state's most famous
political families took the oath of office before more than 2,000
people in the lavish Paramount Theatre, his white band-collared
shirt and monkish buzz-cut scalp accented against black bunting and
a scarlet curtain.
</P>
<P>
   A globe made of bamboo and decorated with gold, silver and
copper ribbons hung over the stage, a laser beam piercing it with
fluorescent green light. The globe represented a ``seed pod,'' and
the laser signified technology, said the sculpture's creator,
Slobodan Dan Paich.
</P>
<P>
   Brown picked up on the symbolism, saying his administration will
bring together nature and technology, the old and the new. That is
the essence of political rebirth in Oakland, and Oakland is a
microcosm of America, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know politics isn't doing too well these days,'' Brown
said. ``With a lot of struggle, I really see this place as a
revitalization of what it means to be in a democratic society.''
</P>
<P>
   After his swearing-in, Brown outlined four general goals in a
speech to about 400 supporters outside City Hall: to help cut
crime, create public charter schools, attract 10,000 people to live
downtown and encourage festivals and artistic performances.
</P>
<P>
   Brown joined hundreds in a six-block march to the civic green at
Frank H. Ogawa Plaza. As Lenny Williams of the onetime Oakland funk
band Tower of Power belted out the early-1970s hit ``What Is
Hip?'', Brown moved toward City Hall amid a nest of cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's 47th mayor delivered one of the few written speeches
of his 30-year political career, a five-page oration that was
nothing if not evangelical.
</P>
<P>
   The former seminarian and three-time presidential candidate
promised Oaklanders a skillful, honest, impartial and frank city
government during his four-year term. In return, he said he
expected Oaklanders to believe in themselves. Government is only as
good as each individual's moral strength, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today marks the beginning of our new journey together _ one
that must be undertaken with courage and the willingness to speak
truth to each other,'' he said. ``It's no secret that we are
frustrated _ even angry _ at the gap between Oakland's inherent
capacity and the stark reality of above-average crime,
below-average schools and a downtown struggling still to recapture
its glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the city's 57 neighborhood crime prevention councils
will go beyond public safety to serve as the units of democratic
power during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who beat 10 contenders in a landslide victory in June and
won an even more lopsided victory in November when voters acclaimed
his move to make Oakland's mayor the city's chief executive, said
the city's high rate of serious crime is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But his sharpest words were reserved for his analysis of what is
wrong with public education in Oakland. He said it is a legacy of
what Martin Luther King. Jr. condemned at the height of the civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gradualism accepts glacial change and fears rocking the
boat,''Brown said. ``Gradualism is prepared to wait for many
generations until sometime in the far-off future, things are
finally made right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He demanded a plan of action for the immediate success of the
public schools. He said he will assist parents in creating charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he wants to bring about a vibrant civic culture based
on the arts and a strong economy centered on a business district
that is as packed with residents as it is with jobs. He said that
during his administration downtown Oakland will become so
attractive that thousands of people will want to make their homes
between Interstate 980 and Lake Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   That precise numerical goal has been city policy for more than
20 years, but this is the first time a city leader with star power
has come along to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been promoting a feisty boosterism since he began
campaigning formally 14 months ago. In his speech, he said Oakland
is cheaper and friendlier than San Francisco, and joked that it
soon may be safer than Walnut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad people want to work here, but what about live here?''
he asked. ``By the time we're finished, there will be a lot less
crime in Oakland than there is in Walnut Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown filled his inauguration day and half the night with
celebration, and the wackier and edgier, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the ``life of a great city transcends the mundane and
expresses itself in the liturgy of public art,'' he turned over the
evening to his devoted volunteers, who put on an arts and culture
blast at the Henry J. Kaiser Convention Center and the Oakland
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before show time, the organizers themselves weren't
entirely sure what and whom to expect. For example, the people
behind the annual Burning Man event in the Mojave Desert gave Brown
volunteers a list of 30 street performers, including three named
Molotov Malcontent, Insecta Knight and Ms. Jewelz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will show up in strange outfits and act strangely,'' said
Antonia Scatton, an arts organizer for the inaugural. ``That's
really all I know.''
</P>
<P>
   An arts collective called Sandcrawler, after the giant desert
rover in the first ``Star Wars'' movie, requested an obstacle
course and some pinatas. And the Wish Fairy from Children's
Fairyland was scheduled to flit about the event to help Brown pick
up wishes from the community.
</P>
<P>
   But the content of the festival, and of the formal inauguration,
seemed secondary to the attitude of liberation and acceptance that
it affirmed in many who watched the event.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Harris stood by a lamppost on Broadway watching the
parade pass by toward City Hall. He wondered if it were a protest
of some sort, but when he heard the parade was marking Brown's
inauguration, he nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe he's really going to do something for Oakland,''
Harris said. ``Why else would he have come to Oakland if he didn't
want to help Oakland? He could have gone anywhere else and been
mayor. But he came here.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelio Grillo, a longtime Oakland political organizer, said what
made Brown's speech tick was his ``energy and spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the master of the bully pulpit,'' Grillo said. ``He's
going to bring lots of attention to Oakland, attracting small
business capital and human capital. His role is going to be
Oakland's cheerleader because he can conceptualize and communicate
feelings of hope.''

VOLUNTEERS ANSWER TITLE ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are certain of two things now that the Fiesta Bowl is over.
</P>
<P>
   There is no ``I'' in TEAM, but there are three ``t's'' in
Tostitos.
</P>
<P>
   And Tennessee is the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt. No question. No argument. The unbeaten team in the
Tang-orange jerseys finished running the table Monday night by
beating Florida State, 23-16, and answered the question ``Who's No.
1?''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is 13-0.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is unmatched. Unrivaled. Unparalleled. Unexcelled.
Incomparable. Peerless, as in Price, the hero of the game.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't artistic. Sloppy is a better word. Interceptions.
Fumbles. A flurry of yellow flags flew.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bowden who is accustomed to having his way in bowl games,
spent the evening anxiously pacing the sideline, jaws working on a
stick of gum, exasperated by what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   FSU buried itself in penalties. The Seminoles looked out of
synch, especially in the first half, rusty after a 44-day layoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles came back. But in the end they couldn't match a
Tennessee team that led throughout after scoring two early
touchdowns and made the plays in the fourth quarter _ the kind of
big plays that champions do.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Fulmer knew he needed all the help he could get to
win his first national title. When he asked for a show of hands, he
got plenty of Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Tee Martin volunteered to operate the offense, as he has all
year. He threw two touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Henry volunteered to run the ball. The former Frostproof,
Fla., schoolboy who rushed for 4,000 yards his senior season and
kept running all the way to Knoxville, gained only 32 yards against
the nation's top-ranked defense. But somebody had to do the grunt
work. He worked hard for every yard.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee won this year by running the ball. The handoff is to
the Volunteers what the steel guitar is to the Grand Ole Opry. But
it wasn't the ground game that meant the difference this night.
</P>
<P>
   It was Peerless Price.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee wide receiver volunteered to win the game with his
feet and his hands, and that's just what he did. Early in the
fourth quarter, Price separated himself from a defender and pulled
in a Martin pass on the run and raced down the Tennessee sideline _
a 79-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Johnson volunteered, too. No man, they say, is an island,
but the Tennessee defensive back felt like one. His job was to
cover the Seminoles' most dangerous receiver, Peter Warrick.
Warrick caught one pass, for 7 yards. And Johnson sealed the
victory in the closing minutes with an interception.
</P>
<P>
   When the game ended, Fulmer felt a chill run up his spine, and
it wasn't just from the icy bath he received. There is no feeling
like the one he experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden knows the feeling. The FSU coach was once the best-known
bridesmaid in sports. He waited 40 years before he won his first
national championship, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Florida State was the underdog. The night before FSU
played Nebraska, Bowden showed his players a tape of some of the
great upsets in recent history. Buster Douglas' knockout of Mike
Tyson. Duke's win over UNLV in the 1991 NCAA basketball tournament.
Notre Dame's win over the Seminoles that year.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Tennessee was the underdog. The Volunteers didn't
believe they deserve second-class status. After all, they had
beaten every team they faced this year. They outlasted Florida,
20-17, in overtime. They survived against Arkansas, coming from
behind after the Razorbacks fumbled in the closing minutes and
opened the door when hope appeared lost.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy getting to the mountain top. The Rocky Top.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win a championship you've got to be good and you've got to
be lucky,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was both this season.
</P>
<P>
   A little lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Very, very good. &QL;

FALSE START: THE SYSTEM DOESN'T WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Volunteers?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I will. To drive both these teams to the airport, send them
on their merry way and put to rest a season of pseudodrama and
cybergeeks.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, Tennessee. And good riddance to a system that
should be stowed on the Seminoles' plane and dumped in the
Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Flags?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there were. A giant orange one paraded across the field,
capping a contest that featured 21 little yellow ones soiling the
grass.
</P>
<P>
   The first signaling a false start on the BCS. And then another
and another, until the game and a season crawled to a finish,
mercifully ending an experiment fraught with errors, meltdowns and
data dorks better suited to mastering ``Madden '99'' than crowning
a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but this did not feel like the Super Bowl of college
football. Not when scalpers were selling their tickets for $10,
some even giving them away. Not with two teams toiling in the
Dadgum Bowl, two teams that entered with a collective yawn and left
amid a sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   As in, thank heavens that's over.
</P>
<P>
   With a third-string quarterback, Florida State had no chance.
Except for the fumble that gave them a chance.
</P>
<P>
   And with the exception of two shining moments _ a bomb to
Peerless Price and a punt return by Peter Warrick _ this game had
the flavor of lint.
</P>
<P>
   Promise unkept &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, Tennessee. May you enjoy your title. And may
you be the catalyst for change.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, this whole postseason is proof that you can't have it
both ways. You can't keep remnants of the bowl structure and
incorporate a national championship formula.
</P>
<P>
   On its own, the old bowl system was understated enough to work,
to flourish on the bar stools of debate. When college football
promised nothing, we accepted its flaws and rolled with the
inadequacies.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't promise what you can't deliver, and no amount of
pomp and circumstance, false advertising or tortilla chips can mask
the obvious:
</P>
<P>
   The BCS is a rumblin', stumblin', fumblin' wreck.
</P>
<P>
   So what was touted as a revolution turned into one of the most
fragmented, unmemorable bowl seasons in history.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Wisconsin and UCLA in the Rose Bowl, it was all a
kennel of canines, a parade of poodles in corporate sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, all the enthusiasm was imported. Canned applause
dressed in orange. Tired Indian chants pierced the air. The Valley
is not a big-event town, not a region prone to cheer for cheering's
sake. But in this case, the apathy is not our problem, rather a
condition belonging to college football.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Kramer is the architect of the BCS, the John DeLorean of
college football. He should know that in boxing, the belt doesn't
make the fighter. And in college football, the trophy _ sorry, make
that the Sears National Championship Trophy _ doesn't validate the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The argument for a playoff is obvious, weary to the point of
cliche. But the reason the BCS doesn't work is simple.
</P>
<P>
   Why care? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no familiarity with any of these teams. No build-up. No
crescendo. No reason to care.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee and Florida State had emerged from playoff
brackets, they would gain allegiance from the casual fan. If they
had to run a gantlet, they would arrive with a certain pedigree.
And no one would care how many losses a combatant had if it emerged
from a viable system.
</P>
<P>
   One playoff weekend has expired in the NFL, and already, the
momentum is at a fever pitch. Here, it's almost as if these two
teams dropped in on parachutes, expecting us to care.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Not on January 4.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles hadn't played in 44 days. Not that it showed or
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Swiss-based company called ISL proposed an
eight-year, $2.4 billion plan for a 16-team playoff. That's $300
million a year, which would more than double the $140 million
payout stemming from all 22 bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, college presidents will shy away from such a concept.
</P>
<P>
   As I stare at a giant Tostitos logo, I understand. Wouldn't want
to overcommercialize the game, right? &QL;

MARTIN, PRICE CAP DREAM SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They came West searching for respect, and fittingly, found it in
a stadium between two rocky tops.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1-ranked Tennessee, thanks to the appropriately named
receiver Peerless Price and a stifling defense, defeated No. 2
Florida State, 23-16, in the Fiesta Bowl on Monday night, clinching
the school's first national championship since 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only people who believed in ourselves, and tonight
we came out and showed it,'' quarterback Tee Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee finished the season 13-0 and will no doubt be crowned
the consensus national champion this morning when the Associated
Press' writer poll is released. The coaches poll had already agreed
to name the winner of the Fiesta Bowl as the national champion.
</P>
<P>
   A record crowd of 80,470 in Sun Devil Stadium witnessed one of
the sloppiest national championship games in years, but it was
Tennessee that made the big plays when it counted most.
</P>
<P>
   Price, as he has done all season, lifted the Volunteers. He
finished with four catches for 199 yards, including a 79-yard
touchdown pass from Martin that gave the Volunteers a 20-9 lead
with 9:17 remaining. It was sweet redemption for Price, who minutes
earlier let a potential touchdown pass bounce off of his chest and
into the hands of Florida State safety Dexter Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Price set up Tennessee's first score when he caught a 76-yard
pass from Martin down to the Florida State 12 late in the first
quarter. On both plays, he beat cornerback Mario Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (11-2), by contrast, could get little going
offensively. Sophomore quarterback Marcus Outzen, making just his
third start after replacing the injured Chris Weinke, was
overmatched. He completed 9 of 22 passes for 145 yards and was
intercepted twice, one of which was returned for a touchdown, and
fumbled once.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State receiver Peter Warrick, the team's chief offensive
threat, touched the ball just twice on offensive plays, gaining
only 14 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Seminoles weren't out of the game until late.
</P>
<P>
   This is how strange college football has become. The outcome
might have been different had officials not ruled that an onsides
kick bounced up and hit a Polish kicker, who came to the United
States to play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   With his team down by a touchdown with less than four minutes
left, Florida State kicker Sebastian Janikowski tapped the ball and
let it roll just over 10 yards before recovering it. Officials,
however, ruled that the ball had touched Janikowski before it had
gone 10 yards, giving Tennessee the ball at the Florida State 42.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers appeared to have things clinched when, on fourth
and 1, Martin hit running back Shawn Bryson with a pass that went
22 yards. But running back Travis Henry fumbled on the next play,
giving Florida State one last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen didn't make it last. On the first play, he tried to throw
long to receiver Laveranues Coles, who was doubled-covered.
Cornerback Steve Johnson came down with the interception, denying
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden and the Seminoles their second
national championship in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the fourth quarter, Tennessee fans were mockingly
doing the tomahawk chop, the Seminoles battle cry that by game's
end was more like a mournful wail.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless third quarter, Tennessee led, 14-9, entering
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State put together two decent offensive drives in the
second half, but both fizzled. They drove to the Tennessee 30 in
the third quarter, but a sack and a false start ended the threat.
</P>
<P>
   They had a similar drive early in the fourth quarter, moving to
the Tennessee 26, but another false start and another sack forced
them to punt again.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Martin and Price put the game away. Price raced down
the right sideline, gaining a step on Edwards. Martin laid the ball
out perfectly and Price took it in. The 79-yard pass, the longest
touchdown pass in Fiesta Bowl history, put the Volunteers ahead,
20-9, with 9:17 remaining. Jeff Hall's extra point was blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ending was exciting, the game was poorly played.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State committed 8 penalties for 67 yards in the first
half. Their infractions ranged from roughing the kicker (twice),
false starts, an illegal shift and a late hit.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was no better. In the first half, it was penalized
five times for false starts and once for an illegal formation. The
first half took nearly two hours to play, causing a numbing effect
to spread through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams showed the effects of not having played in weeks.
Florida State's opening drive started on its 20. The Seminoles had
gains 14, 11 and 23 yards, but because of a fumble, a penalty and a
pass that lost eight yards, they ended the drive at their 30.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Seminoles only display of wretched offense. Late
in the first half, Warrick returned a punt 51 yards to the
Tennessee 27, and the Seminoles drove to the 5 where they had first
and goal.
</P>
<P>
   They proceeded to commit a false start, lose two yards on a run,
throw an incompletion, be penalized for an illegal shift, and throw
another incompletion. Their ``drive'' went 10 yards in 10 plays and
graciously ended when Janikowski made a 34-yard field goal to cut
Tennessee's lead to 14-9 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee missed a field goal and committed two turnovers.
Outzen had a pass intercepted and returned 54 yards for a score.  &QL;

BRUINS OUTLAST SUN DEVILS  
 ASU TAKES NATION'S NO. 7 TEAM TO OT 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-UCLA-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Arizona State never blinked, never backed down nor
tried to avoid the parade of ``Parade'' All-Americans. Facing a
bigger, deeper and presumably more talented UCLA team, trying to
beat history as well as a darned good opponent, the Sun Devils took
the Bruins to the limit and beyond before losing, 88-85, in
overtime Monday night at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Moiso's free throw with 1:07 minutes left in overtime
broke an 85-85 tie, and after Eddie House missed a short jumper for
ASU, Earl Watson scored on a driving basket to give the
seventh-ranked Bruins (10-2, 2-0 Pac-10) a three-point lead with 19
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ASU had two more chances, but a three-pointer by House missed,
and after the Sun Devils reclaimed the basketball, Bobby Lazor's
three-point attempt rimmed out at the buzzer as most of the 8,828
in attendance breathed a roar of relief.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 20th straight loss for ASU against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it had a chance,'' Lazor said of his shot. ``It's
the kind of shot you always want to take and work your whole life
to take. I got a chance. I just didn't come through. Hopefully,
I'll get another chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils led, 35-34, at halftime, and the score was tied
at 74 at the end of regulation after Baron Davis scored for the
Bruins with 40 seconds remaining. Neither team led by more than
five the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Led by their sophomore guards, Davis and Watson, and what most
of the so-called experts regarded as the best recruiting class in
the country, UCLA was coming off a big win over Arizona on Saturday
in the Pac-10 opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils (8-6, 0-2) lost to Southern California on
Saturday and appeared to be overmatched. Two of the Bruins'
freshmen, 6-foot-10 Dan Gadzuric and Moiso, also 6-10, are taller
than any ASU player. The rest of the cast wore accolades and
acclaim.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sun Devils displayed a lot of heart.
</P>
<P>
   And appearances are often deceive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the outcome of the basketball game,'' ASU
Coach Rob Evans said after his first game on the visitor's bench at
Pauley. ``Without a question, I thought we played well enough to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard enough to win. We just didn't take care of some
details at key times that allow us to win a ballgame. But those are
the things we're getting better at, and we're gonna continue to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Batiste, who had 22 points and 12 rebounds for ASU, added,
``It's a real tough loss, because we were very focused coming into
this game. We've been executing well, and I thought we gave the
effort we needed to. We just couldn't come up with the `W.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had six players in double figures, led by freshman
JaRon Rush's 19 points. Rush was coming off a suspension against
Arizona for missing a game last week. Gadzuric was held to three
points but had 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ASU also got a balanced effort. Junior swingman Derrick Davis, a
junior college transfer, had by far his best game of the year with
16 points. Davis hit some key baskets down the stretch, including a
three-pointer that gave ASU a short-lived 70-67 lead with 3:32 left
in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Lazor added 14 points and House had 10, but it was House's
second straight poor-shooting game. He made just 3 of 13 attempts
from the field against the Bruins after going 2 for 10 against USC.
He began the week as the leading scorer in the Pac-10. &QL;

CATS RALLY, GAIN SPLIT ON ROAD  
 FRESHMEN SHOW AGGRESSIVENESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's unusual when a college basketball power is
happy to get a split on the road, and it's unusual, too, when a
learning experience is more positive than painful.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona is an unusual team.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at the Sports Arena, baby steps looked more like giant
steps for Coach Lute Olson's youngest team ever. The Wildcats
ralled from nine points down at halftime to beat Southern
California, 87-78.
</P>
<P>
   The game started at 1 p.m. local time so as not to conflict with
the Fiesta Bowl, which is what can happen when your athletic
director is a former Heisman Trophy winner. Mike Garrett won the
prize for the Trojans in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett was among the crowd of 4,116, decent by Sports Arena
standards, that observed another phase of Arizona's growth process.
Richard Jefferson, who at this time a year ago was playing for Moon
Valley High School, scored a season-high 24 points starting at
guard for the Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   Another freshman, guard Ruben Douglas, had 11 points, also a
season-high for him. The most mature of the youngsters, forward
Michael Wright, had a game-high 12 rebounds to go with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're freshmen no longer,'' senior guard Jason Terry said.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, however, the older folks were around for guidance and
leadership, not to mention points, rebounds and defense. Terry had
14 of his 16 points in the second half. Senior center A.J. Bramlett
had 13 points and 10 rebounds while helping hold the Trojans'
strong post player, Brian Scalabrine, to eight points. Scalabrine
had 25 in the Trojans' win over Arizona State on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the win was twofold. After losing at UCLA on
Thursday, the Cats desperately wanted to avoid dropping two
straight to start the Pac-10 season. And the freshmen needed to
assert themselves, avoiding the tentativeness that marked the first
half of the Bruins game.
</P>
<P>
   Making just 13 of 32 shots, UA trailed the Trojans at halftime,
44-35. The Cats (9-1, 1-1 Pac-10), who fell two rungs to No. 8 in
the Associated Press poll, might not have played with the necessary
skill, but at least they played without fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to come in at halftime and feel like we were
afraid of playing somebody, and I thought we were at UCLA,'' Olson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today we were aggressive. I thought defensively, for the
most part, we did a good job, and I was very pleased with the job
we did on the boards, particularly in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cats, who shot nearly 61 percent after halftime,
outrebounded the Trojans by 16. USC made only 9 of 34 shots in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona gradually worked into a 52-52 tie with 13:45 to go. But
USC, which had 16 points from freshman Sam Clancy, took a
five-point lead with 7:36 remaining. A pair of Bramlett free
throws, a three-pointer by Terry and then a steal and basket by
Terry made it 72-67, Cats, with 5:16 left.
</P>
<P>
   USC (9-2, 1-1) got within three, but a Terry jumper followed by
two Jefferson free throws made things safe for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, whose previous best was 17 points last week against
Florida International, said he was ``devastated'' by the UCLA game
and wanted to do something about it. He did, making 7 of 11 shots
from the field and 9 of 11 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was think about playing aggressive the whole game,
coming out and getting out on 'em,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said he thinks his team learned a lot on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hope it'll show each time we go out,'' he said. ``Five
of our nine scholarship guys are freshmen. It's not like we should
expect miracles. But we are expecting miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't be like freshmen anymore. We've had 2{ months
with them, and they've got to stop looking at themselves as
freshmen.'' &QL;

ROENICK RETURNS AFTER CONCUSSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB McMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During his news conference upon being traded to the Coyotes from
the Chicago Blackhawks two years ago, Jeremy Roenick said he was a
lot of things. One of them being a risk taker, because of his
reckless, helter-skelter style on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to end my career on every single shift,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of so many concussions in the NHL the past few
seasons, some might question whether Roenick is putting his career
on the line by playing tonight against the visiting Florida
Panthers. It was only a week ago that Roenick suffered a concussion
during a freak incident against the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   According to Roenick, it was the fifth concussion of his career.
Yet he's missed only three games, including the Coyotes' past two _
a 3-1 victory Wednesday over the New York Rangers and a 2-1
overtime loss Friday to the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have played Friday,'' Roenick said. ``They made me go
on injured reserve, and when you go on injured reserve, you have to
stay out for at least a week. That screwed me up right there. But
that's all right. I got a nice little mental rest, and I'm ready to
go back at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this. They can't keep me out of (tonight's) game.
There's no way. I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   If you saw replays of the left side of his head violently
slamming into the no-give, seamless glass during his collision with
Doug Bodger last Monday, you probably wondered whether Roenick was
ever going to get back up, let alone play again. It was a horrific
sight, much like the concussion he suffered last season during an
equally frightening play in almost the exact same spot on the rink
at Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But JR was back in the lineup three days later, after sitting
out one game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 100 percent recovered according to our medical people,''
Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He'd have to be, of course, or there's no way the Coyotes
(21-8-4) would allow him back on his skates this soon. Especially
against sub-.500 teams such as the Panthers (13-14-7) and the
Edmonton Oilers (15-17-4), who visit on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But still, concussions are serious business. In the past year
alone, they've claimed the careers of Pat LaFontaine, Nick Kypreos
and the Coyotes' Jimmy Johnson. Brett Lindros also was forced into
early retirement for the same reason and now his brother, Eric, is
sidelined with one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Is it better to be safe than sorry when it comes to concussions,
and hold players out longer just to be certain?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this game safe, period?'' Roenick asked. ``Some people say
this is not a safe game to play whether you're healthy or you're
not healthy. But this is my livelihood. This is what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick said he is not concerned about possible long-term
affects that a series of concussions may bring, if any.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' he said. ``Hopefully, I won't be going into
astrochemistry or become a rocket scientist or a Rhodes scholar or
anything like that. So I think I'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we're not doctors, because we choose to play right
afterward. We never think of what's good for our well being, just
what's good for our ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Roenick's ego should be satisfied up to this point. With 37
points (14 goals, 23 assists) in 31 games, he's on pace to score
the number on the back of his jersey _ 97. He hasn't finished with
that many points since 1993-94, when he become the first player in
Blackhawks' history to record three consecutive 100-point seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I want to get back into the lineup, because things
were going so good before I got hurt,'' said Roenick, who was
ranked sixth in the league in scoring at the time of his concussion
and remains No. 1 among U.S.-born centers. ``Hopefully, this thing
doesn't catch up to me and become a deterrent. But this is an
important time of the year right now. These are the dog days of the
year. This is when you can make your best push for playoff
positioning.''
</P>
<P>
   With linemates Keith Tkachuk (broken rib) and Dallas Drake
(suspended) still out of the lineup, expect Roenick to play in the
middle tonight between veterans Greg Adams and Rick Tocchet. Or
perhaps with centers Bob Corkum and Mike Stapleton, each on whom
can play the wing.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld could put Roenick anywhere and feel safe. The 10-year
pro has played so well on such a hot team, there could be serious
debate if he is not selected as a reserve for this month's All-Star
Game in Tampa Bay, where Schoenfeld will be serving as an assistant
on the North American squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping JR's play is indicative of our team,'' Schoenfeld
said. ``We set our standards higher to begin with, just like he has
done. But I still think Jeremy is a better second-half player than
a first-half player, and I still think he's a better playoff player
than a second-half player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes big-game situations, and even though he's having a
good start and a good season, that doesn't mean that he's still not
going to improve as the season goes along. That's the case we hope
with our hockey team. We started with the bar higher, but we still
have to keep pushing it higher if we want to play for an extended
time in the playoffs.'' &QL;

CARDS CORNERS CLAMP DOWN  
 SECONDARY LOOKS FORWARD TO TEST FROM VIKINGS RECEIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinals Coach Vince Tobin doesn't want to touch the issue. Ask
him in the off-season whether rookie cornerback Corey Chavous will
be moved back to safety
</P>
<P>
   ``He will line up at corner this week,'' Tobin said. ``We'll
worry about next year next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl cornerback Aeneas Williams thinks the decision is a
no-brainer after Chavous' six pass deflections and five tackles in
the Cardinals' 20-7 victory over Dallas last Saturday in an NFC
wild-card playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think that's foreseeable,'' Williams said of
Chavous returning to safety, where he played the first 11 games of
the regular season. ``Corey's going to stay at corner. He makes
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chavous and the Cardinals' cornerbacks have their biggest
test on Sunday when they play the NFL's best receiving corps of
rookie Randy Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed of the Minnesota
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals meet the Vikings at 2:15 p.m. Sunday in an NFC
second-round playoff game at the Metrodome in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, theVikings' first-round draft pick, led NFL receivers
with 17 touchdowns. He had 69 catches for 1,313 yards, second most
in the NFC. Carter had 78 receptions for 1,011 yards and 12 scores.
Both made the Pro Bowl, Moss as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Reed has been out for five games because of a back injury but is
expected to return to action Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't decided yet whether they will put Williams
on Moss, nicknamed ``The Freak'' for his rare combination of size
(6 foot 4, 197 pounds) and speed (4.2 seconds in the 40-yard dash).
</P>
<P>
   Williams thinks Chavous, who has only six career starts, could
hold his own against the NFC's Offensive Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I rated Corey's game on a 1 to 10 scale, it'd be as close
to a 10 as I've seen, especially for a young guy,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams doesn't get any argument from Vikings Coach Dennis
Green, who considered drafting Chavous in the first round last
April before picking Moss. Chavous, 6 foot, 204 pounds, was rated
the top cornerback on the Vikings' draft board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody knew how we felt about Chavous,'' Green said
Monday. ``If we went the way of cornerback, it probably would have
been him. He has good size and speed. That's what we like in a
corner. He's a real talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said Chavous played his best game of the season last
Sunday, a week after he struggled against San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's so encouraging is the way he approaches his
job, his dedication,'' Tobin said. ``He's a football player who
wants to be the best. He looks at film and analyzes it and uses the
information to improve his game. Some guys just watch because we
tell them to.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavous already has watched enough film on Moss to realize he
has spectacular ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just as quick as he is fast,'' Chavous said. ``He has a
6-4 body and moves like a 5-9 jitterbug. That's what makes him a
special type receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Moss has become the perfect complement to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Vikings quarterback Randall Cunningham just throws the
ball high and lets Moss jump and get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great knack of finding the long ball and re-adjusting
his routes to get a better position on the defensive back to get
that ball,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he did playing basketball, particularly in jump-ball
situations, Chavous said, ``I better be pretty good this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings already were good at receiver before Moss joined
them. A year ago, Carter and Reed became the first wide receiver
duo to gain 1,000 yards each four straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable receiving corps,'' Chavous said.
``They've proved that all season by being able to stretch defenses
vertically. They've been able to get it done week in and week out,
and you don't see that with many tandems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carter works the slot and is savvy and physical to get open.
Reed is a strong, fast receiver with great hands. Moss is `The
Freak.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get excited about playing them. You have a
chance to play the best. You have to want those challenges. It's
another stop on our road to glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Most teams stay away from throwing at Williams. So don't be
surprised if the Vikings try to pick on Chavous and second-year pro
Tommy Knight, who likely will be the nickel back and matched up
with Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Knight's hamstring injury is the reason the Cardinals moved
Chavous from backup strong safety to cornerback last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corey didn't want to play safety,'' free safety Kwamie
Lassiter said. ``He was just willing to help the team. In his
heart, he always wanted to play corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Many pro scouts thought Chavous was too slow to play cornerback.
He had interceptions in each of his first two games at cornerback
but doesn't get great satisfaction at proving the experts wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted the opportunity to go out and play corner,''
he said. ``There's a certain amount of confidence that goes with
playing that position. But I had no problem playing behind (strong
safety) Tommy Bennett. I learned so much and the experience helped
me at corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When get an opportunity to play in this league, you can't be
choosy.''

SATURDAY'S VOICE ENDS DREAM CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Keith Jackson says he's going to retire, you have to ask:
``Retire from what?''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling from Columbus, Ohio, to Athens, Ga., to Tempe to Ann
Arbor, Mich., to Corvallis, Ore., to South Bend, Ind., stringing
the crisp autumn afternoons into decades, he's made as many fine
memories as a glass of beer has bubbles. OK, maybe not Corvallis.
</P>
<P>
   Retire? High school guidance counselors don't dare suggest that
such a wondrous job could exist. Why implant inevitable
disappointment in students who may become mere astronauts, rock
stars or software barons?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson more or less spoiled his Monday night retirement party
by hinting, in an otherwise fine pregame interview on ESPN, that
maybe he might not be gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   ABC broadcast the Fiesta Bowl anyway, complete with a moving
halftime tribute to Jackson, who ended his run as the big daddy of
college football play-by-play men by calling the Tennessee victory
over Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has been in the booth for lots of unforgettable calls,
including the Olympic triumphs of Mark Spitz and Bruce Jenner. But
college football is the grand game he ruled, a place where a bad
punt is a ``cold, dead shank'' and poor field position can get a
team ``penned up in be-careful country.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the young gladiators on the field had a bad case
of the nervous yips. Fumbles, stumbles, interceptions and penalties
fractured the flow, mocking the tortured BCS algebra that brought
these two teams to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ears are hummin', your mind's turning to oatmeal and
you're looking at a sidehill 3-footer,'' was how Jackson described
the national-championship pressure that evidently caused all the
false starts, somehow mixing the aftereffects of a rock concert, a
sensible breakfast and golf into the rumblin', tumblin' cascade of
words.
</P>
<P>
   He went on. The little penalties, though comparatively harmless
at 5 yards a pop, add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nickel, and soon you've got a quarter and pretty soon
you've got a big heavy sack, and you're not going anywhere,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   After letting the nutty imagery fly through the air for just an
extra second, boothmate Bob Griese couldn't help himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's been fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Jackson sometimes went a little overboard during his
career, especially when piling the purple on football coaches. Gods
among men? Not once you get a good look at their players'
graduation rates.
</P>
<P>
   But he became as much a part of the college football experience
as fight songs and face-painting fools. Jackson began his road trip
in 1966, working a 9-6 Clemson victory over Duke. Now, there's a
score only the purest of college football purists could love.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the Sponsoring Snack Chip getting big billing above a
bowl game's name is a development Jackson could not have seen.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the ``enhanced TV'' whatever-it-is over on the
newfangled Internet? Nooo, Nellie. In the second quarter, Jackson
seemed tickled to inform the TV audience that the heavily hyped
ESPN webcast was overloaded. ``We've got all the users we can
handle,'' he said. ``Try again, if you would, in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson pointed out the broadcast's phantom first-down
line, Griese noted his approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just lazy,'' Jackson then grumped, with an affectionate
growl.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the broadcast was as imperfect as the action on the
field. Cameras got faked out on several key plays (perhaps a
reflection of the ongoing battle between ABC and some of its union
camera operators, technicians and engineers), and the
Jackson-Griese combo wasn't as slippery-smooth as it might've been.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of Jackson's great career, the last game didn't
really mean much, as he tried to tell us himself.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the evening, Griese made several little references to
the Jacksonisms that have made his partner the voice of Saturday
afternoon, but the voice itself sounded bashful about all the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the end, with the game decided and concluding time outs
to fill, did Jackson allow himself to reminisce about ancient Rose
Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the game, and his career, as promised, without much of
a farewell. Just the final score and, ``God bless and keep ya.''
</P>
<P>
   Come fall, we'll all have to relearn our Saturdays. &QL;

   From third team to the national stage, quarterback Marcus Outzen
dreamed of this day: leading Florida State to the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the dream turned into a nightmare, and, ``poof,'' Outzen's
15 minutes of fame were over Monday night at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The sophomore, who rose to folk-hero status in Tallahassee late
in the season, is likely to see orange in his sleep for some time
after top-ranked Tennessee drilled Outzen and the second-ranked
Seminoles, 23-16, in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen was third string in the spring and had questioned his
future with Coach Bobby Bowden last year.
</P>
<P>
   After Dan Kendra blew out his knee in a spring scrimmage and
Chris Weinke suffered a neck injury the 10th game of this season,
Outzen became the man.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen received his collegiate baptism, many believed, by
surviving the Florida game. It was only his second start, and,
although luck played in his lone touchdown pass, Outzen didn't mess
up too much, made some big plays with the pass and run, and had the
Seminoles in position to get to Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   He figured if he could lead the Seminoles past Florida, then he
could do it against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   All week, he said he felt no pressure, that the Florida victory
provided the confidence he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen looked like someone making only his third college start
in the first half against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   He overthrew passes. He floated passes. He struggled to find
All-American receiver Peter Warrick. Warrick had only one catch for
7 yards through the first three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers made the mistake of punting to Warrick, who
returned it 51 yards, setting up a field goal that cut the score to
14-9 late in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen wilted under the heat of the national-championship
spotlight and Tennessee's pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   He was sacked four times. He was intercepted once and fumbled
the ball away once as the Volunteers built a 20-9 lead in the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers had Outzen on the run. They had him
second-guessing. They had him in a daze.
</P>
<P>
   On Florida State's third offensive play, Outzen wobbled a pass
behind tailback Travis Minor. It was ruled a fumble, and the
Seminoles were hit with a penalty and loss of down when Minor
batted the ball out of bounds to keep Tennessee from recovering.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles lost another eight yards in the series when Minor
was tackled behind the line after taking a pass from Outzen.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee made Outzen pay for not putting any zip on an out pass
to Warrick early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Raynoch Goodrich picked it off and ran 54 yards for
the score, the second Volunteers' touchdown in 25 seconds, that put
the Seminoles in a 14-0 hole early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen completed only 4 of 10 passes for 35 yards in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   He had only 90 passing yards, entering the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was livid in the fourth quarter, stalking the sideline,
screaming at anyone within earshot, trying to generate some emotion
in an offense that had become predictable. Meanwhile, Outzen sat
solemn-faced with a baseball hat pulled down close to his eyes. But
he didn't sulk. He kept returning and made enough plays to get the
Seminoles close. He kept Ron Dugans busy. He found Dugans for a
long pass play, then found a gap in the middle of the defense and
ran for a touchdown that cut the score to 23-16 with less than four
minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Outzen was in position to be the hero, after Florida State
recovered a fumble with 1:29 to play on its 10. On the first play,
however, he threw deep _ not to Warrick _ and the pass was picked
off, ending the Seminoles' hopes. &QL;

PENALTIES HAUNT UNDISCIPLINED SEMINOLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In keeping with their theme from the season, particularly the
final three games, Florida State's penalties haunted them in Monday
night's Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles were flagged 12 times for 110 yards. Making
Florida State's penalties seem worse was that many were illegal
procedures, the type that are basically indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just undisciplined,'' nose guard Corey Simon said.
``You can't play a team like that and make those kinds of mistakes
and expect to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles and Tennessee combined for 21 penalties, tying the
Fiesta Bowl mark set in the 1974 game between Oklahoma State and
Brigham Young. For Florida State, the inordinate number of
penalties was nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles, who committed at least 11 penalties in eight of
their 12 games, were called 117 times for 1,042 yards in 11 regular
season games, including 41 times for 365 yards in their three
previous games. Tennessee had 72 penalties for 597 yards in their
12 regular season games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can try too hard,'' Florida State Coach Bobby
Bowden said. ``The more aggressive you are, the more penalties
you're going to get.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Peyton Manning was supposed to be the quarterback who led
Tennessee to its first national championship since 1951. But in his
four years at Knoxville, Manning never managed to get the
Volunteers this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting to be a part of it, to have played with these
guys,'' said Manning, who attended the game from a luxury box with
high-level Volunteers boosters. ``I think everyone in Tennessee
feels like they're a part of this, all the way to the fan in the
top row of the stadium. It's really special to be a part of the
Tennessee family.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, a former U.S. senator from Tennessee,
attended the game with 60 Secret Service agents. It should be noted
that Gore never attended Tennessee, earning his graduate degree
from in-state rival Vanderbilt. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee cornerback Dwayne Goodrich's 54-yard interception
return for a touchdown was the longest in Fiesta Bowl history,
eclipsing a 49-yard return by Alabama's Charles Gardner in the 1991
game.
</P>
<P>
   The 76-yard pass completion from Tennessee's Tee Martin to
Peerless Price was just one yard short of the Fiesta Bowl record
set last season, when Kansas State quarterback Michael Bishop
connected with Darnell McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   The 80,470 people who crammed into Sun Devil Stadium Monday
became a part of Arizona sports history, marking the largest
football crowd in state history. &QL;

THIS TIME, HE'S PETER THE ORDINARY  
 WARRICK IS FRUSTRATED BY TENNESSEE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-WARRICK-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The frustration marked his face the way the loss would
eventually mark the man.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Warrick, Peter the Great for one season, was a beaten
warrior Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The imminent loss, an inevitable toll, was evident with about 10
minutes left. Warrick paced Florida State's sideline. He yelled. He
pointed at himself with a demanding gesture.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted the football at least one more time.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a victory.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted a national title.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick got nothing. Not the football. Not the the role. Not the
victory. And, most especially, not the national title in
Tennessee's 23-16 victory over Florida State in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick had been the lightning bolt in the Florida State offense
all season, but on this night, the 6-foot, 190-pound junior had
only one reception for seven yards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for his name in the scoring summary. His absence is
significant. He failed to score in only Florida State's victories
over Maryland and Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   But his real importance to Florida State is best summed by a
different, more significant collection of statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick was special against the best. Florida State faced eight
teams that at one time or another were ranked among the Associated
Press' Top 25 teams. Against that great eight, he averaged six
receptions and 123.4 yards and scored 10 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But against the one, No. 1 Tennessee, Warrick was unable to
reach quarterback Marcus Outzen's floating attempts and unable to
shake Tennessee's suffocating defense. He was orange crush.
</P>
<P>
   His night of futility was summed up in one single stroke.
</P>
<P>
   With 13:40 left in the first half, Tennesse right cornerback
Dwayne Goodrich stepped in front of Warrick and picked off an
Outzen attempt that had more hang time than a blimp above Sun Devil
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich went 54 yards for a touchdown. Warrick raced after
Goodrich as though the Tennessee cornerback was running away with a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's dream.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Florida State's chances at a national title
ended right then and there. Still, Warrick kept flickering hopes
alive later in the first half with single moment of brilliance
during a game in which the Vols otherwise dominated special-teams
play.
</P>
<P>
   He took a Tennessee punt and raced through the Vols' onrushing
defenders with a dazzling display of footwork.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen plays later, the Seminoles scored three points on a
34-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski. But those three points
represented a disappointment, a muffled firecracker after the
fireworks provided by Warrick, who was left to face the
frustration. &QL;

SPEAKING VOLUMES ON FIELD  
 MARTIN, PRICE SHINE IN FIESTA SHOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
 STARS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was always about the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tennessee landed in the Valley on Dec. 26, receiver
Peerless Price found himself bombarded with questions about Florida
State receiver Peter Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   Tee Martin, meanwhile, heard the words ``Peyton Manning'' more
than he cared to remember.
</P>
<P>
   But Warrick played about as much of a factor in Monday's Fiesta
Bowl as Manning, who finished school a year ago. Meanwhile, Price
and Martin teamed up to lead the Volunteers to a 23-16 victory at
Sun Devil Stadium and give Tennessee its first national title since
1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say enough about the plays Peerless Price and Tee
Martin made all season,'' Volunteers Coach Phillip Fulmer said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago, Price said, ``I'm tired of hearing about
(Warrick) and what he's going to do in this ballgame. I'm just
going to show everybody what I'm about on Monday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he ever. He caught four passes for 199 yards and scored the
Volunteers' biggest touchdown with 9:17 remaining in the game.
Martin threw an on-target pass to Price, who beat cornerback Mario
Edwards on man-to-man coverage and sprinted down the right sideline
for a 78-yard touchdown. It put Tennessee ahead, 20-9.
</P>
<P>
   It was sweet redemption for the senior, who earlier in the
quarter let a pass in the end zone bounce off his chest and go
right into the arms of the Seminoles' safety Dexter Jackson, who
returned it to the Florida State 26-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, displayed the poise of someone who had done
this before. The truth is, he had never started a game before this
season.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 11 for 18 for 278 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He made only one serious mistake, a second-quarter pass intended
for Price that was intercepted by Derrick Gibson. Three plays
later, the Seminoles' Williams McCray scored on a 1-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   He kept his cool even as the game grew dicey in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers had the ball at the Florida State 33-yard line
with 1:40 to go. Tennessee opted to go for it on fourth and 1 and
Martin completed a 22-yard pass to fullback Shawn Bryson.
</P>
<P>
   What an amazing ending for the quarterback. He managed to do
something even his predecessor Manning couldn't: win a national
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the only ones who believed in ourselves,'' Martin
said. ``We showed everyone, didn't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a big reason the Volunteers were not in the top five
of most preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the season with no starts. He had completed only
eight passes in his ``career'' at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But he had given an inkling of what he was capable of in the
Orange Bowl last season. After Nebraska had a firm hold on the
game, Martin led the Volunteers 80 yards in eight plays and capped
the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Andy McCullough. He then
hit Travis Stephens for a two-point conversion.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time he saw action last season was as Manning's
understudy during the late stages of four games.
</P>
<P>
   While Tennessee's staff was confident about Martin's potential,
it didn't want to put too much pressure on the junior early on this
season. So it kept the offense simple in the first four games, so
simple that Martin said he felt like he was in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``And my own coaches put me in it,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   He came into this game hot. In the final seven games of the
regular season, he threw for 1,499 yards, 10 touchdowns and two
interceptions. &QL;

VOLS DEFENSE SUPERB  
 SEMINOLES QB HASSLED THROUGHOUT 
</HEADLINE>
 DEFENSE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florida State has the ``No Name Defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's defense has a catchy new nickname, too.
</P>
<P>
   National Champions.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's defense thwarted Florida State's running attack,
hounded Seminoles quarterback Marcus Outzen and lifted the
Volunteers to a 23-16 victory Monday night in the Tostitos Fiesta
Bowl at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And with it, the Volunteers triumphed in the first unified
national championship game played under the Bowl Championship
Series system.
</P>
<P>
   With a defensive effort like the Volunteers turned in Monday
night, they might have won the title in any system. They sacked
Outzen four times, forced him into two fumbles and intercepted him
twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The talk going in was the Number 1 defense of Florida State,''
said cornerback Steve Johnson, who ended Florida State's final
threat with an interception. ``They got a lot of hype, about being
Number 1 against this, Number 2 against that. We were like sitting
on the back burner with no press or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been getting respect all season, let alone the last
week. We were able to take our respect on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The game may have turned on junior cornerback Dwayne Goodrich's
interception for the Volunteers and his stunning 54-yard return for
a touchdown that followed. It staked Tennessee to a 14-0 lead 1:20
into the second quarter and earned Goodrich the game's Defensive
Player of the Game award _ even though he left because of an ankle
injury before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's every defensive back's dream,'' he said. ``I'm just
happy my dream came true. The ball kind of floated out there, but I
still had to make a great play on the ball against a great
receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich caught Outzen looking for his favorite target, Peter
Warrick, and floated the ball into the right flat. Goodrich was
sitting on the route, and broke perfectly on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He intercepted in stride and sprinted to Tennessee's
checkerboard end zone. It was Goodrich's first career scoring
return, and it couldn't have come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich was part of the parade of Tennessee players that went
to the sidelines with injuries. At one point, the Volunteers had
three backups playing in the defensive secondary.
</P>
<P>
   But Outzen never had the time to take advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That top-rated Florida State defense was upstaged by Tennessee's
swarming defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our front seven was great,'' Johnson said. ``(Outzen) was
rattled, you could see in his eyes. And when the quarterback is
rattled, the receivers get rattled. They were complaining about not
getting the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteer defense wasn't exactly shabby during the regular
season, ranking 17th nationally in total defense, ninth in scoring
defense and sixth in rushing defense.
</P>
<P>
   But they saved their best for the Fiesta Bowl finale in a
national showcase.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers limited Warrick to one catch for 7 yards. And
they came at Outzen from all directions. Even when they didn't get
to him, they were close, knocking him down more than a dozen times
after he threw.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Outzen finally slipped through to score on a rushing
touchdown late in the game, it was questionable whether he got into
the end zone before his knee touched the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, it didn't matter. Tennessee's defense already had
made its name. &QL;

 &HT;    Meet the (new) Beetles: Volkswagon says sales up
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Demand for the new Volkswagen Beetle continues to
boom in the U.S. and Europe, and local dealers still have long
lists of customers waiting to take home the new Bug.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen AG, Germany's largest automaker, said Monday strong
Beetle sales fueled a 11 percent increase in 1998 car sales that
were also helped by robust economies in the U.S. and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   VW Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech said the maker of Audi, Seat,
Skoda and Volkswagen brand cars sold more than 4.7 million vehicles
last year, increasing its global market share to 11.4 percent from
10.4 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for the company's New Beetle, which has sold more than
64,000 units since going on sale last year, has even outpaced the
company's expectations and helped it sell more cars than ever
before. Strong economies in the U.S. and Europe, its two largest
markets, also kept sales of its trademark Golf and Jetta sedans
brisk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be much better than 1997,'' Piech said of the
company's 1998 profit, which wasn't released.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami Valley, local Volkswagen dealers said the Beetle
craze hasn't slowed down from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have 40 people on our waiting list and we've had
everyone from 18-year-olds to a 74-year-old man buying the (Bug),''
said Greg Bane, general manager of Frank Z Imports in Vandalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a neat car with all the nostalgia and goodies people
could want. But I think it's also a case of people wanting what
they can't get.''
</P>
<P>
   The old VW Bug was a cheap, noisy car with a no-frills heater, a
rear engine and a cramped front-end trunk. The new Beetle has air
conditioning, remote-control electric locks, six-speaker stereo _
and a $15,200 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Bane said his dealership sold about 50 Beetles in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Beetle also was also honored Monday as winner of the
prestigious North American Car of the Year Award by the organizing
committee at the 1999 North American International Auto Show in
Detroit.
</P>

 &HT;    Sales hearten Mac loyalists
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Citing new data that show that their beloved
platform has surged to 10 percent of the U.S. personal computer
market, Macintosh loyalists kicked off the Macworld Expo in San
Francisco earlier this week with an optimism that has been in short
supply for years.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 Mac users who arrived early for the annual four-day
show to attend a ``town meeting'' on the Mac and Apple Computer
Corp. heard several speakers praise Apple, its interim chairman,
Steve Jobs, and its attention their needs.
</P>
<P>
   There also were some complaints and warnings about the company's
future and its service.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, the speakers were upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how happy I am to be entering 1999 with Apple
very focused on the future,'' said Greg Galanos, president and
chief technology officer of Metrowerks Inc. of Austin. ``Apple has
been through a very deep cleansing. A cleansing of the soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that exodus, in turn, hastened Apple's decline,
because the Mac's appeal is tied to the variety and quality of work
applications and games that can run on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very happy to say that I think the development community
on the Macintosh is as dynamic as it was in the early 1990s,''
Galanos said.
</P>
<P>
   The optimism was a sharp contrast to the mood that dominated the
Macworld show a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Apple's stock, which closed Monday at $41.25, up 62 1/2
cents, was trading at about $15 a share and Jobs had virtually put
an end to cloning by Power Computing Corp. of Round Rock and other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, things were about as bad as they've ever been,''
said Bob LeVitus, a Mac expert and writer who helped moderate
Monday's meeting in the San Francisco Marriott Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which was organized by Macworld sponsors and not
Apple, fed the excitement with which Mac users await today's
keynote speech by Jobs. He is expected to introduce a robust new
PowerMacintosh for the professional and education markets and
announce new software for the Mac, including games.
</P>
<P>
   The revered and sometimes controversial Apple co-founder was
fired in the mid-1980s by John Sculley, who Jobs helped recruit as
Apple's chief executive. Jobs took the reins back in the summer of
1997 and cut the work force, slashed spending and killed several
products that he believed were confusing potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts returned Apple to profitability after a 1997 loss of $1
billion. But the biggest boost for Apple, financially and
emotionally, came last August with the introduction of the iMac,
Apple's innovative desktop computer with a translucent blue shell.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 800,000 iMacs have been sold since August, which
was a key factor in boosting Apple to a 10 percent market share in
the United States, according to recent estimates from PC Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bouyant mood in evidence Monday, the meeting
included warnings and some complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The desktop war is over,'' said computer industry consultant
Tim Bajarin. ``No matter what Apple does, it will never gain more
than a 10 percent marke share worldwide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies in Campbell, Calif.,
said Apple still can be a significant influence on how consumers
view computers, which he believes is a goal of Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding computer applications on the Internet, including
digital appliances for accessing the World Wide Web, offer
opportunities for Apple to innovate, he said. Bajarin said Jobs
strongly wants to leave a legacy as a computer visionary, and the
iMac is a part of that drive.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's new notebook for consumers, expected later this year,
``is going to make people completely rethink how a consumer
portable looks and how it should be used,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the question and answer session, several members of the
audience complained about the lack of help they get from Apple in
tech support of software development.
</P>
<P>
   David Gutierrez, a programmer at the University of Texas M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said researchers there like Macs
but are frustrated by the paucity of software for their work.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Y2K is OK by me
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ It's the first of the New Year, a time
for new beginnings. No time like the present to start preparing for
the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   You can hardly open up the newspaper without seeing a headline
warning of the impending doom of ``Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're like I am, and look no further than the headlines,
you've probably been wondering why all the commotion about a new,
improved, double-strength lubricating jelly.
</P>
<P>
   But read on. ``Y2K'' is abbreviation for the year 2000 and the
likelihood of impending doom when the century turns over and the
computers roll over and play dead.
</P>
<P>
   Apocalypse, if not now, soon.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of our own destruction of our database were sown in the
beginning of the computer age. Youngsters may believe that in the
beginning there was Word Perfect. But this was way before then, in
the 1950s thereabouts, when computers were vast in size and vastly
limited in capacity.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that instead of, say, ``1957,'' computers were
programmed simply to recognize ``57,'' thus saving a couple of
digits. In the process, we may have lost life as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly all utilities and other such niceties of civilization
will fail if computers go kaput come the year 2000, unable to cope
when the century changes. Heaven knows I know how they'll feel.
I've been having trouble coping with change since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even as the doomsday clock ticks down, there are
those among us who believe the Y2K is much ado over next to
nothing, which in turn greatly offends that segment that believes
Y2K-liness is next to godliness.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is much involved. A Baptist church in my little
hometown, for example, is urging members to slowly begin
withdrawing their money from financial institutions during the
coming year, the idea being when the computers fail, the banks will
fail right along with them.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be surival of the best outfitted. True believers of the
worst-case scenario are hard at work stocking up and socking away
foodstuffs, kerosene and water supplies. Some are even digging
their own water wells and connecting their homes to private
generators.
</P>
<P>
   It's the fallout shelter crisis all over again, when some
families in the 1950s installed backyard concrete bunkers in
preparation for nuclear holocaust, also much preached from pulpits
to scare the hell out of us.
</P>
<P>
   What with the untimely implosion of the Soviet Union and the
godless communism therein, Y2K may be helping to fill the void left
for subject matter in sermons of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Y2K lacks the immediacy of A-bomb annihilation.
``Repent now, for tomorrow you may die'' certainly has it over
``Repent now, for 12 months from now your computer may die.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to make light of a subject taken seriously by many among us.
</P>
<P>
   I know an editor who made that mistake. Referred in print to it
as ``Y2Kookiness,'' he did.
</P>
<P>
   An outraged reader called to warn him that he'd be laughing out
of the other side of his face, as it were, come the 2000 revolution
and he finds himself sitting in his own sewage.
</P>
<P>
   I think he missed a good bet. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're right and I'm wrong, indeed, on New Year's Day 2000
I will sit in my own sewage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I'm right and you're wrong, you have to sit in my own
sewage.''
</P>
<P>
   Any takers?

 &HT;    Cat-owner communication? Forget it _ my pets have already read
the book
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Cat people are the most misunderstood folks
on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Dog people eye us suspiciously because they doubt the sanity of
anyone who would share the sofa with a fuzzy friend who didn't even
know how to roll over
</P>
<P>
   on command or come when called. Example:
</P>
<P>
   Me: Okay, Biddy (my 15-pound, 10-year-old Siamese), let's roll
over.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy (with the snap of an elegant ear and a supercilious
sneer): Yeah, right. You first.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, cats do know how to do tricks, but only when they're
sure the whole
</P>
<P>
   thing is their own idea. Biddy, and her ladylike 13-year-old
sister Stella, are far too smart for such foolishness. Like the
other afternoon when I came in from the grocery store with a new
toy for each of them.
</P>
<P>
   Me: Hey ladies! Come see what I have for you.
</P>
<P>
   The girls: (Silence).
</P>
<P>
   Me: Catnip meeses for everyone. Come see.
</P>
<P>
   The girls: (Nothing, so I go looking for them. They're snuggled
in their quilt-lined baskets next to the window seat radiators. I
repeat my offer. Stella opens one disinterested eye and quickly
closes it lest I mistake her response for enthusiasm. Biddy, who is
sleeping on her back with four feet stretching heavenward, snuffs
and twitches a front paw in annoyance.)
</P>
<P>
   Feeling a lot like a rebuffed St. Nick, I gingerly place a red
mouse on Biddy's velvety tummy, another in the bend of Stella's
front paw, and go unpack the groceries. A few minutes later,
Stella's inside an empty grocery bag and Biddy is sitting on her.
Not a mouse in sight.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of days later I find both mice at the bottom of the dry
sump pump hole in the basement. No question what they thought of my
meager offering. Fortunately, I grew up with cats so I'm pretty
much desensitized to their little slights. But it doesn't stop me
from trying. And now I have help. A friend gave me a cat book for
Christmas that is going to teach me how to talk to my cats and
(this is the unbelievable part) get them to do what I want them to.
</P>
<P>
   First, I'm supposed to get to know my cats better. Better than
what, I'm wondering. We already have intimate chats in the bathroom
and share butter at
</P>
<P>
   the breakfast table, but apparently we're talking (ITAL)at(END
ITAL) one another instead of (ITAL)with(END ITAL) one another.
That's where this little book comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you treat your cat with love ... with respect ... as if she
is an intelligent, thinking animal, capable of making decisions,
your cat will respond in astonishing ways.'' Great theory. I decide
to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Me (looking into Biddy's eyes): We're going to talk about your
behavior in my
</P>
<P>
   office.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy (yawning): Ho hum.
</P>
<P>
   Me: You must agree to stay off of the computer keyboard so we'll
not have any
</P>
<P>
   more accidents like the other day when you stood on the ``Send''
button and e-mailed my column to the news service 587 times and
clogged their mailboxes so
</P>
<P>
   badly they almost missed out on a war and an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy (rolling her eyes and focusing somewhere beyond my left
shoulder): Wroww!
</P>
<P>
   Me: And please behave when I'm on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Biddy (now refusing to look at me which, according to the
handbook, is basic
</P>
<P>
   to our reaching an understanding): Urrrrh!
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the instruction is over and Biddy stomps out of
my office to think it over. It doesn't take her long. As she sits
in the hall glaring at me with her tail all a-twitch, I hear a
guttural groan building that soon erupts into a jarring shriek.
Nothing happens so she does it again. Then, when Stella's curiosity
has been aroused enough to climb the stairs and investigate, Biddy
lets out one more howl and takes a nasty swipe at her sister's
ears. They both disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes later I have lulled myself into a false sense of
feline success when the phone rings. It's barely off the hook when
Biddy hits my desk at a full run and is screeching into the
receiver. I remind her of our bargain. She responds by knocking the
lampshade askew with her nose. I swear at her. She shoulders five
file boxes off the corner of my desk, leans over to inspect the
damage, curls up on the computer, and begins to purr.
</P>
<P>
   Why do I have the feeling she's already read the book?

<P>
   Are you sabotaging your weight-loss goal with the self-defeating
behaviors that clinical psychologist Jeff Wilbert calls
``fattitudes''? You probably are, he says, if:
</P>
<P>
   You can't seem to stay on track with healthy eating.
</P>
<P>
   Your exercise habit lasts only a few days or weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you're making progress, something happens to knock you
off course.
</P>
<P>
   You want very much to slim down, but losing weight makes you
feel anxious.
</P>
<P>
   You turn to food for emotional coping.
</P>
<P>
   You feel shame or guilt over eating.
</P>
<P>
   You have a track record of yo-yo dieting, binge eating or graze
eating.
</P>
<P>
   You're preoccupied with food and dieting, with a poor image of

 &HT;    A weighty issue: What it takes to lose unwanted pounds
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For the longest time, Norean Wilbert didn't even
notice her own voice debating her in the background. But whenever
she embarked again on her treasured goal of losing weight, her
voice was there to talk her out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really thought about how I was sabotaging myself,''
she says. ``I didn't even hear myself.'' It didn't occur to her
that she and millions of other people would have so much trouble
shedding unwanted pounds because their desire to lose weight was no
match for their unconscious desire to stay fat.
</P>
<P>
   The fat served a purpose. If her marriage ever happened to fail,
she knew it wouldn't be her fault. It would be simply because she
was overweight. Wasn't that the reason her father had left her
mother for another woman?
</P>
<P>
   So she tested her husband, ``pushed him to the limit,'' almost
dared him to leave and complete the scenario she expected anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jeff, wasn't much help, either. As a psychologist,
he should have known better, but he says, ``I did things that were
really stupid.'' For one, he made it clear he thought laziness was
the only reason anybody was overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was condescending,'' Norean says. ``He said, 'I don't
understand what your problem is. This is very simple. You just move
more and eat less.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The more he read about weight management, the more he understood
his attitude was just giving a microphone to Norean's background
voice. As a matter of fact, it became clear that he, too, had some
unknown ulterior motive for Norean to remain overweight.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven or eight years, as his interest in helping her
prodded his psychology practice toward a subspecialty in weight
management, he found himself helping clients in ways he couldn't
help his wife. He saw a common thread running through their lives
like a mailman's footprints through snow-covered lawns.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``universal obstacle'' to healthy weight management,
Jeff concluded, and it was self-defeating behavior. People would
develop patterns of thinking _ ``fattitudes,'' he called them _
that led them to sabotage their attempts to lose weight, or their
partners' attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what approach you take,'' he says, ``if you're prone
to self-defeating behavior, nothing will help. Not exercise. Not
diet. Not even Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   So the first step to long-term weight loss, he says, is
identifying the attitudes that bred the behavior that undermined
all those previous attempts at losing weight. But that's just one
step. It's not enough unless a person also replaces those
self-destructive thought patterns with productive ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have to decide to commit to a healthy
lifestyle,'' he says. ``But now that's an emotionally uncomplicated
decision.'' It's a lot easier to exercise more and eat better when
a person doesn't have a subconscious voice insisting all that
effort is just going to make him or her more vulnerable or create
expectations that will be harder to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still something I fight,'' Norean says after losing 45
pounds in about six months, even while replacing fat tissue with
heavier muscle. ``But once you start listening to yourself and
hearing that negative talk, it's much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fattitude voice has always liked to tell her, for example,
that she really doesn't have time for exercising, what with
children, who are 8 and nearly 3, and a high-pressure job directing
the emergency department at the Children's Medical Center in
Dayton. It often urged her to take pity on herself when she was the
only one awake in the house at 5 a.m., sweating on her treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   But now she has learned to anticipate the inner conflict about
getting up early after a late night and see it for the trap it
always has been. ``It's just something I have to do, and actually,
I enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wilberts aren't the first people to figure out how people
undermine their weight-loss goals psychologically, but the book
they're writing together blends Jeff's perspective of helping
overweight clients and Norean's perspective of controlling weight
herself. Jeff, meanwhile, has made the concept the centerpiece of
his practice with a fattitudes Web site and an agreement to counsel
the trainers at Just Results Lifestyle Studios in Kettering so they
can recognize and help correct self-defeating behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   They're not that hard to spot. Just as someone is making
progress, she starts skipping appointments.
</P>
<P>
   In order to identify the underlying thought patterns, Jeff says
a person should complete the sentence, ``I need my fat because _.''
For most overweight people, he says, there's a payoff to being
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe being unattractive is actually a benefit. For women with
sexual abuse or painful relationships in their past, Jeff says it's
a relief to know men probably won't come on to them.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the benefit is a built-in excuse to fail, as Norean
felt about her marriage. Others take comfort in being able to say
they didn't get a promotion because they were fat, not because they
didn't deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe sheer size is the benefit. Some people equate it with
power. ``I had a woman tell me, 'If I lose weight, I'm afraid I'll
get trampled at work,' '' Jeff says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the benefit is a sense of carrying out justice. Most of
Jeff's overweight clients have low self-esteem, and it's a short
leap from there to punishing their bodies with cigarettes, alcohol
or fatty diets. ``That's the most fearsome fattitude,'' he says.
``I don't deserve to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The diet industry nourishes two fattitudes when it makes such
promises as, ``Give us a week, and we'll take off your weight,''
Jeff says. First of all, a week isn't long enough. The search for a
quick-fix is self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   The weight that stays off doesn't come off much faster than one
pound a week, which is what people should remind themselves when
they're feeling impatient. Or else they'll start reciting the
``This will never work'' fattitude, which of course takes them off
the hook from losing weight because who would expect them to
undertake an impossible task?
</P>
<P>
   The other counterproductive thought that advertising claims
plant is that someone else can take off your weight. ``You have to
do it yourself, and it's hard work,'' Jeff says after spending most
of his 18 years of marriage trying to be his wife's ``someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Low self-esteem is also a common thought pattern for people who
sabotage their partners' weight-loss plans. ``I need my partner to
be fat so he or she won't leave me,'' Jeff says. Then when he does
start losing weight, she'll buy him a box of candy or withdraw
emotionally, whatever it takes to make that incentive for staying
fat once again greater than the incentive to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Or someone might want his wife to stay fat so he doesn't have to
compete. He can watch TV and drink beer every night without feeling
ashamed. Jeff calls that the ``Let's focus on your problems so we
don't have to look at mine'' fattitude.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff's biggest problem for Norean was his eagerness to take
charge of her weight loss. ``He would consistently point out what I
was doing that was detrimental to weight loss,'' she says. Because
control was one of her benefits of staying heavy, ignoring Jeff's
advice was an easy decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I could do for her was get out of her way,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   She needed her own motivations, and they converged early last
year. She wanted to spare her kids from caring for the
weight-related health problems her own mother has developed. She
was tired of being the only fat person at meetings at work.
</P>
<P>
   Diet played only a minor role in losing her weight. She stopped
drinking Pepsi as though it were water, and started eating more
fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a nurse,'' she says. ``I can teach it. The question I had
to answer was, `Why am I not doing these things that I know I
should do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   There always are reasons, Jeff says. ``If you don't deal with
the reasons for your self-defeating behavior, you'll never be
successful at weight loss.

 &HT;    A weighty issue: What it takes to lose unwanted pounds
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For the longest time, Norean Wilbert didn't even
notice her own voice debating her in the background. But whenever
she embarked again on her treasured goal of losing weight, her
voice was there to talk her out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really thought about how I was sabotaging myself,''
she says. ``I didn't even hear myself.'' It didn't occur to her
that she and millions of other people would have so much trouble
shedding unwanted pounds because their desire to lose weight was no
match for their unconscious desire to stay fat.
</P>
<P>
   The fat served a purpose. If her marriage ever happened to fail,
she knew it wouldn't be her fault. It would be simply because she
was overweight. Wasn't that the reason her father had left her
mother for another woman?
</P>
<P>
   So she tested her husband, ``pushed him to the limit,'' almost
dared him to leave and complete the scenario she expected anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jeff, wasn't much help, either. As a psychologist,
he should have known better, but he says, ``I did things that were
really stupid.'' For one, he made it clear he thought laziness was
the only reason anybody was overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was condescending,'' Norean says. ``He said, 'I don't
understand what your problem is. This is very simple. You just move
more and eat less.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The more he read about weight management, the more he understood
his attitude was just giving a microphone to Norean's background
voice. As a matter of fact, it became clear that he, too, had some
unknown ulterior motive for Norean to remain overweight.
</P>
<P>
   In the past seven or eight years, as his interest in helping her
prodded his psychology practice toward a subspecialty in weight
management, he found himself helping clients in ways he couldn't
help his wife. He saw a common thread running through their lives
like a mailman's footprints through snow-covered lawns.
</P>
<P>
   There was a ``universal obstacle'' to healthy weight management,
Jeff concluded, and it was self-defeating behavior. People would
develop patterns of thinking _ ``fattitudes,'' he called them _
that led them to sabotage their attempts to lose weight, or their
partners' attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what approach you take,'' he says, ``if you're prone
to self-defeating behavior, nothing will help. Not exercise. Not
diet. Not even Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   So the first step to long-term weight loss, he says, is
identifying the attitudes that bred the behavior that undermined
all those previous attempts at losing weight. But that's just one
step. It's not enough unless a person also replaces those
self-destructive thought patterns with productive ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have to decide to commit to a healthy
lifestyle,'' he says. ``But now that's an emotionally uncomplicated
decision.'' It's a lot easier to exercise more and eat better when
a person doesn't have a subconscious voice insisting all that
effort is just going to make him or her more vulnerable or create
expectations that will be harder to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still something I fight,'' Norean says after losing 45
pounds in about six months, even while replacing fat tissue with
heavier muscle. ``But once you start listening to yourself and
hearing that negative talk, it's much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Her fattitude voice has always liked to tell her, for example,
that she really doesn't have time for exercising, what with
children, who are 8 and nearly 3, and a high-pressure job directing
the emergency department at the Children's Medical Center in
Dayton. It often urged her to take pity on herself when she was the
only one awake in the house at 5 a.m., sweating on her treadmill.
</P>
<P>
   But now she has learned to anticipate the inner conflict about
getting up early after a late night and see it for the trap it
always has been. ``It's just something I have to do, and actually,
I enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wilberts aren't the first people to figure out how people
undermine their weight-loss goals psychologically, but the book
they're writing together blends Jeff's perspective of helping
overweight clients and Norean's perspective of controlling weight
herself. Jeff, meanwhile, has made the concept the centerpiece of
his practice with a fattitudes Web site and an agreement to counsel
the trainers at Just Results Lifestyle Studios in Kettering so they
can recognize and help correct self-defeating behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   They're not that hard to spot. Just as someone is making
progress, she starts skipping appointments.
</P>
<P>
   In order to identify the underlying thought patterns, Jeff says
a person should complete the sentence, ``I need my fat because _.''
For most overweight people, he says, there's a payoff to being
overweight.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe being unattractive is actually a benefit. For women with
sexual abuse or painful relationships in their past, Jeff says it's
a relief to know men probably won't come on to them.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the benefit is a built-in excuse to fail, as Norean
felt about her marriage. Others take comfort in being able to say
they didn't get a promotion because they were fat, not because they
didn't deserve it.
</P>

get trampled at work,' '' Jeff says.

or fatty diets. ``That's the most fearsome fattitude,'' he says.
``I don't deserve to be successful.''

 &HT;    Brokerages offer top picks of '99
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here are some of the varied predictions professionals
at Southeastern brokerages are making for the stock market this
year:
</P>
<P>
   _ A continuing bull market, with a Dow rising to about 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very positive outlook and believe the super bull
market continues to be in force,'' said David A. Lee, senior vice
president and research coordinator at Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.
``Disinflation is the most important factor in that investment
thesis. It is still present, and we believe it is likely to
continue to be a dynamic that will favor strong valuations in the
stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey also predicts the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index will advance this year, to 1,323.
</P>
<P>
   _ A volatile market, making opportunities for fleet-footed
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be themes, but a lot of it is going to come back to
looking for opportunities to get out ahead of those themes,'' said
Jack White, research director at Interstate/Johnson Lane in
Charlotte. ``You need to be opportunistic and buy (promising
stocks) when they're down and out.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A wholly unpredictable market but maybe a good year finally
for small-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to forecast the market,'' said research director David
M. Guthrie of Morgan Keegan in Memphis. ``That's fruitless. But one
thing that does intrigue us is the fact that small stocks have
underperformed the Dow Jones for five years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's unheard of,'' he continued. ``We're looking for better
performance from small stocks, and it may be in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their varying expectations, the three have one thing in
common: Short lists of stocks with strong potential for price
increases in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   We asked them to share their best investment choices for the new
year.
</P>
<P>
   Here are highlights from their responses. An asterisk indicates
the broker has been an underwriter of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID A. LEE
</P>
<P>
   Robinson-Humphrey
</P>
<P>
   Reliastar Financial
</P>
<P>
   The company is the second-largest provider of retirement
investment products for elementary and secondary school teachers.
This market is rapidly growing, said Lee, because there are more
teachers and a growing percentage of them is planning for or
thinking about retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month target price: $62
</P>
<P>
   _ Office Depot
</P>
<P>
   The largest office superstore chain in the country could
generate earnings surprises as it opens more new stores. Lee said
he expects to see increases in same-store sales, as well as margin
improvements. It is the cheapest company in its sector, at 21 times
estimated earnings per share for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month target price: $36
</P>
<P>
   _ Sterling Commerce
</P>
<P>
   The company provides software and network services used in
electronic commerce. Sterling is a leader in a rapidly growing
field, has a strong international distribution mechanism, generates
strong internal growth and could grow from acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month target price: $55
</P>
<P>
   _ AnswerThink Consulting
</P>
<P>
   Formed by 40 former KPMG Peat Marwick consultants, this company
advises Fortune 1000 companies on information technology. Lee said
the company has strong management. As a result of an agreement with
KPMG, AnswerThink will be free to solicit its former KPMG clients
as of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month target price: $30
</P>
<P>
   _ Ryanair Holdings
</P>
<P>
   Lee characterizes this no-frills airline as ``the Southwest
Airlines of Europe.'' From its base in Dublin, Ireland, Ryanair is
expanding to continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month target price: $41
</P>
<P>
   _ Saville Systems
</P>
<P>
   Saville sells billing and customer care software to medium-size
to large telecommunications companies. Its price took a beating
because of problems related to new product development. Lee said
those products are being released and the company has the potential
for rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Six-month target price: $25
</P>
<P>
   JACK WHITE
</P>
<P>
   Interstate/Johnson Lane
</P>
<P>
   _ Antec
</P>
<P>
   The company is a leading provider of cable television network
transmission products. White said Norcross-based Antec will benefit
from a cycle of upgrades in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   12-month target price: $23
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientific-Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross-based company also will benefit from a general
upgrading in the cable television business. A strong suit is an
``excellent digital set-top box,'' said White.
</P>
<P>
   12-month target price: $26
</P>
<P>
   _ Quintiles Transnational
</P>
<P>
   It's a leader in clinical research for pharmaceutical companies.
Quintiles also handles sales for those companies. It has one of the
largest sales forces in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   12-month target price: $66
</P>
<P>
   _ World Access
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based World Access markets telephone switches that allow
phone service operators to be more competitive. White said the
company has a strong management team and an excellent growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   12-month target price: $40-$42
</P>
<P>
   _ Post Properties
</P>
<P>
   White said the Atlanta-based real estate investment trust has a
proven management team and a yield approaching 7 percent. The
sector is out of favor and is due for a resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   12-month target price: $44
</P>
<P>
   DAVID M. GUTHRIE
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Keegan
</P>
<P>
   SCB Computer
</P>
<P>
   The Memphis-based company supplies information technology
staffing and consulting. Guthrie said the company is rapidly
expanding its customer base and moving into higher-margin
operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ SCP Pool
</P>
<P>
   SCP is a leading seller of swimming pool supplies. It has been
growing rapidly by consolidating a fragmented, $1.6 billion
industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Service Experts
</P>
<P>
   This Nashville-based company is acquiring numerous competitors
in the residential heating and air conditioning market. The company
has met or exceeded expectations in nine quarters since it went
public.
</P>
<P>
   _ US Xpress Enterprises
</P>
<P>
   A trucking company based in Chattanooga, US Xpress has increased
revenue by an annual average of 21 percent and its stock price 24
percent over the last three years. Guthrie predicted even higher
revenue growth in 1998 and 1999. The shares are trading below the
industry average price-earnings ratio.
</P>
<P>
   _ Resortquest
</P>
<P>
   The company, which went public in May 1998, manages vacation
condos and for-rent homes in resort areas. Strong management in a
fragmented marketplace gives it plenty of room to grow, Guthrie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Morgan Keegan does not establish target prices.

 &HT;    Austin college-bound seniors get $500 to further education
 &HT;    By Andy Alford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lillian Kerley may be retired from the
classroom, but she still has lots to offer Austin students.
</P>
<P>
   Her practical, no-nonsense attitude and hard work elevated her
from a student in a mean, one-room, packed-dirt school house in
Manor during the Depression to a master teacher in Austin's public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   At 83, she's now using the lessons she has learned to give a
boost to needy Austin students.
</P>
<P>
   Kerley awards $500 scholarships to college-bound Austin seniors,
many of whose parents are Kerley's former students or lived in
Austin public housing.
</P>
<P>
   Kerley's home, a modest, one-story, orange-brick house in East
Austin, is festooned with the handmade knickknacks of generations
of grade-school pupils. Lovingly preserved red-and-white-felt
Santas, wooden-spool candlesticks and tissue-paper angels show that
the passage of time hasn't lessened Kerley's devotion to her former
students or to the families she has helped over the years as a
counselor in Austin's housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try and reach out to the children that I have taught.
There's a whole lot,'' said Kerley, who raises, manages and
administers the scholarship money herself through her nonprofit
foundation named for her husband, Lloyd C. Kerley Scholarship Inc.
``You've got to meet the needs of the children. You've got to get
on in the dirt with them. Now is the time to do it. These children
need it more now than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Born one of eight children in Webberville and reared on a farm
in Manor, Kerley moved to Austin with her family in the 1930s and
knows firsthand the struggle to get through college while living in
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   She swept floors to pay her way at Huston-Tillotson College,
married in 1938 and went back to Manor to teach in 1943. She went
on to earn master's degrees in 1959 in education and home economics
from the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here when times were hard. That's what has led me to do
what I'm doing,'' Kerley said. She has awarded 29 scholarships
since 1990. Her husband was 71 when he died in 1983, after years of
service as an Austin public-housing manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to give money to the colleges, but they used it on
administration and put it into buildings,'' Kerley said. She
decided to make sure her money went directly to students by
awarding the grants herself. ``I'm not for buildings. You could
learn in a tent.''
</P>
<P>
   She raises the money by soliciting donations from friends and
former employers, co-workers and students. In 1998, Kerley awarded
16 grants to graduating high-school seniors, including Teisha
Palacios, a freshman at Austin Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was going through a rough time, and I needed (the
scholarship money) so that I could go to college,'' said Palacios,
who wants to major in business, transfer to Southwest Texas State
University and eventually study law. ``It paid for all my
first-semester classes. Ms. Kerley is great. She's a wonderful
lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Kerley's former students, including Austin school-board
trustee Loretta Edelen and Dallas Mayor Ron Kirk, say Kerley hasn't
finished with her lessons even though she retired almost 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had tough-love teachers back then who would invest in
you,'' said Lee Kirk Jr., a programs coordinator in the General
Land Office and Ron Kirk's brother. Kerley ``was the kind of
teacher who did that. She wouldn't just teach us at school. She
would teach you every day, any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not giving those scholarships to unworthy students,''
Kirk said. ``It's not a handout. It's a hand up, and I commend her
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerley said she wishes more people would learn that they could
do tremendous good by giving back to their communities. ''I don't
see how I could get any more joy than to give back,'' she said.
``If you've got it, give it away. Do you hear what I'm saying?
Don't just climb out by yourself.''

 &HT;    `Lucky enough to be here': Vet, 100, receives thanks for WWI
service
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mitchell Bowman of Boca Raton concedes
that, yes, he did catch a grenade fragment in World War I, and a
whiff of poisonous gas landed him in a French hospital. But why the
big fuss?
</P>
<P>
   ``Save that hero stuff for the boys who fell at Chateau-Thierry
and Belleau Wood,'' he told me.
</P>
<P>
   That's Bowman. Humble. Direct. One hundred years old.
</P>
<P>
   And perfectly able to distinguish between true valor and just
showing up for work. For that matter, he said, he was lucky he
wasn't thrown in the stockade for stretching a 24-hour pass so he
could hook up with a pal from the States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hitched a ride to a town north of my outfit with my knapsack
full of cigars and brandy,'' he chuckled, ``and next thing you
know, I'm down for AWOL. If my captain hadn't fixed it, I would
have been court martialed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with an asterisk on his attendance record, the state of
Minnesota and the American Legion have seen fit to present Bowman
with a certificate of honor for serving in France 80 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman is in select company. Only about 3,000 WWI vets are still
living, said Ken Powell, 11th district commander of the American
Legion Department of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   And that's Bowman's point about the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have to be alive to get it. I am alive and lucky
enough to be here. I just don't want anybody thinking I'm a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   In flagrant disregard of his opinion, Bowman's daughter, Brenda,
and her husband, Tony Straus of St. Paul, Minn., sat right in his
Boca Raton condominium living room idolizing the daylights out of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, Dad,'' Brenda said, ``the reporter doesn't know how
you enlisted and what it was like over there.''
</P>
<P>
   With a diffident shrug, Bowman was persuaded to rehash his
military service during the Great War once more.
</P>
<P>
   By volunteering, Bowman spared his older brother from the draft.
``He had a job and was supporting a lot of people, so I went to
Chicago to join the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy rejected him. Too short. ``You had to be 5-4. I was
5-1, a rough guy, very tough. I tried the Army, and they said I
could be a courier.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after eight decades, Bowman recalls shouldering his kit bag
and boarding a troop transport at Newport News, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were scared from the day we got on the ship. Everybody was
sick. We stood around the rails looking for periscopes. We didn't
see any. The crossing took 17 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman still remembers arriving in France during a chilling
downpour, and crowding into box cars with troops and horses.
</P>
<P>
   His job was to ride in a motorcycle sidecar at the mercy of a
maniac driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough? That guy would kill you soon as look at you. He was my
best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman recalls that his compact size left room in the side car
for himself, his dispatch satchel, food, water and his weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carried a Colt .45 on my belt and an Enfield rifle with the
stock cut down to fit me.''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Bowman has no idea of the contents of his
dispatches. He usually dealt with aides, but on one occasion he was
handed a dispatch by the great man himself, Gen. John Pershing.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers his pay to the penny. ``As a private first class I
got $30 a month plus 10 percent for being overseas and 10 percent
for hazardous duty. It came to $36.60 per month.''
</P>
<P>
   And while officers were more liberally paid, they were charged
more in town for loneliness counseling. ``The girls would come up
and say 5 francs for enlisted, 50 francs for officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling rations, Bowman said, were hardtack and cheese, ``not
bad,'' as Bowman recalls. He even managed to put on weight, thanks
to a chow line pass good anywhere. As for his injuries, they were
trifling, he insists. Once a grenade went off near him in a
training exercise, and that's it if you don't count trench foot and
dysentery, practically standard issue to the 2 million Doughboys
who served between 1917 and 1918.
</P>
<P>
   The courier's duties kept him out of the thick of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only Germans I saw were prisoners who seemed relieved to
be out of the war. As for the gas, I just remember a smell like
ammonia. They kept it a secret.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Bowman and a friend moved to Miami and started a
furniture business just in time for a major hurricane that put them
out of business. He moved to Minneapolis, where he worked as a
furniture salesman until he could open another store.
</P>
<P>
   It is here in our narrative where Bowman's daughter insists on
picking up the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was very innovative. In 1950, he and my mother,
Rose, went to Europe and brought back 50 or 60 oil paintings for
the furniture showroom. They bought original Italian paintings to
go with the French Provincial furniture. Well, in two weeks, all
the paintings were sold.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 until his retirement in 1980, the Bowmans returned
many times to Europe to buy art.
</P>
<P>
   His wife died on March 28, 1980, he said, rattling off the exact
date.
</P>
<P>
   The old soldier sat very straight, willing to answer questions
as long as I was asking them.
</P>
<P>
   I said I was sorry I missed the American Legion presentation of
the certificate of honor, and asked if it went well.
</P>
<P>
   To this Bowman was uncharacteristically silent, and he avoided
my gaze.
</P>
<P>
   Again, his daughter stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the delegation from the American Legion came into the
room, Dad stood up and saluted. My dad is tough as nails, but when
they gave him the certificate, he cried his eyes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all crying,'' she added. ``It was the first time in
all these years that his service to his country was recognized by
anybody, and it affected him.''
</P>
<P>
   It affected me, and I wasn't even there.
</P>

 &HT;    Alabamian has quite a shine for feet of some of Atlanta's elite
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No patter. No snap-crack of the rag.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Fred Payton shine shoes is as exciting as wax buildup _
which, he says, is exactly the way it ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work here,'' says Payton, 49. ``We don't shuck and jive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy is buffing your shoes with a rag and popping it, he's
doing it wrong. That's just a sales pitch. Just buying time. It
doesn't get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   It's late afternoon and business is slow at Payton's shoeshine
shop, the Glass Shoe, in the Georgia-Pacific Building.
</P>
<P>
   The clean, red-carpeted store with three shine stands _ and rows
of black, oxblood and brown shoes glowing like gems _ has about it
the aura of a speak-easy: Only initiates are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Only those who learn, by word of mouth, that nobody puts a
deeper shine on a brogan or a Gucci loafer than Fred Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect much out of life, except to shine shoes,'' says
Payton, his soft, speedy voice rich with the inflections of South
Georgia, where he grew up. ``I won't say I'm the best. But I do the
best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   And against long odds.
</P>
<P>
   Five days a week Payton commutes 270 miles to and from his
eastern Alabama home, arriving at work at 4 a.m. and leaving at 4
p.m. Some weeks, he takes home less than $300.
</P>
<P>
   His 1972 Chevrolet is on its third engine. He won't move to
Atlanta because his wife inherited the 15 acres where they live.
</P>
<P>
   He thought about working in nearby Columbus, but it didn't offer
Atlanta's office towers of well-heeled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my customers owns 300 pairs of shoes,'' he says. ``And
most of them cost $300 to $500.''
</P>
<P>
   On good weeks, the commute seems worthwhile; the job, a decent
way to support his wife and 4-year-old daughter, Olivia.
</P>
<P>
   His clientele is devoted. Regulars include Mayor Bill Campbell
(``He comes in here three or four times a month''); U.S. Rep. John
Lewis (``I shined his shoes when Al Gore was in town _ he doesn't
trust anybody (to shine them) in Washington''); and former
Georgia-Pacific Chairman T. Marshall Hahn.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Payton's customers are businessmen and women who
figure it's worth paying $5.50 to $7.50 a pair for his trademarked
``Glass Shoe Shine.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton's method? Well, it's a trade secret, involving moisture
(but not spit), a solvent that removes old wax, hand-rubbing with a
damp rag and a flurry of buffing with a horsehair brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these guys use one or two coats of wax and take three
minutes,'' says Payton. ``Well, sometimes it can take 10 coats of
wax, and you can't get the right shine in less than six or seven
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   What little patter Payton manages with customers is usually
about taking care of their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't use wooden shoe trees or saddle soap, and wear shoes only
two days in a row: ``You've got to let the shoes rest and dry
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, Payton briefly tried working on an auto
assembly line in Detroit, and he worked for a decade in the Candler
Building before Georgia-Pacific executives lured him to their
office tower 16 years ago with free rent.
</P>
<P>
   He says he's learned a lot at the feet of some of Atlanta's most
powerful people _ mainly to mind his own business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a person wants to tell you a story, they'll tell you a
story,'' he says. ``But don't ask. Your mouth is your worst enemy.
The things that come out of your mouth can make or break you. This
job isn't about being entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton rubs his thumb back and forth across his fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about one thing,'' he says. ``The green stuff _
money.''

IMPEACHMENT NONSENSE SWIRLS AROUND NATION'S CAPITOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's capitol wallows in ignorance concerning what the
Senate can do _ now that the U.S. House has dropped two articles of
impeachment against President Clinton in its lap. Anyone who has a
hankering to run for a seat in Congress should be forced to read
the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, given a test and
graded before becoming a candidate. A candidate's grade would be
made public at every whistle-stop and TV spot during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton faces two articles of impeachment in the
Senate _ one that accuses him of perjury in testimony before a
federal grand jury and one that accuses him of obstruction of
justice in the investigation of the Monica Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   The House that voted in favor of the two articles of impeachment
belonged to the 105th Congress. It was a lame-duck House. Any
legislation passed in that House but not acted upon by the Senate
would be dead in the 106th Congress. There is a legitimate
constitutional question as to whether a lame-duck House can send
articles of impeachment to the Senate of a new Congress. It is
unlikely, however, that this question will be addressed. It should
be.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Senate begins an impeachment trial, it should either
dismiss the perjury charge against the president or demand that the
House supply a ``bill of particulars'' spelling out what specific
statements the president made that are alleged to be perjurious.
The president has a right to due process like any other citizen.
And any citizen charged with perjury would be given that
information.
</P>
<P>
   The public wants this impeachment showboating to end and our
elected officials to get back to the business of governing the
nation and dealing with serious issues. The Senate is well aware of
the problems of an extended impeachment trial and a possible
political backlash from voters. There is now a movement afoot to
speed up the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the 106th Congress, the Republican senators outnumber their
Democratic colleagues 55 to 45. A vote to convict on an article of
impeachment requires a two-thirds majority or 67 votes in the
Senate. There seems little chance that 12 Democrats will be
persuaded to join the 55 Republicans to convict Clinton of any
article of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate leadership could call for that body to take a single
vote on whether or not both articles of impeachment reach the level
required by the Constitution to remove a president. The leadership
could require a two-thirds vote of its members to continue down the
impeachment path.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately, the Senate could allow the House prosecutors one
day to present opening arguments in support of the two articles of
impeachment and then allow the president's attorneys a second day
to respond. After hearing both arguments, the Senate could take a
vote that would require a two-thirds majority to keep the trial
going.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Senate can cut short a full impeachment
trial or it can drop the matter altogether, if it wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate essentially cut off the impeachment trial of
President Andrew Johnson in 1868. It voted on the three strongest
articles of impeachment but could not get the two-thirds vote
necessary to convict Johnson on any of the three. Conviction fell
short by one vote on each article. After that, the Senate adjourned
without setting a future date to continue the impeachment process.
Members of the Senate did not consider the other eight articles of
impeachment that had been sent to them by the House.
</P>
<P>
   There has been loose talk in Congress about a resolution of
censure that would take Clinton's pension away from him or fine
him. It is clear by the language of the impeachment clauses in the
Constitution that Congress cannot use the threat of monetary loss
to keep a judge in line. Article III, Section 1, states that judges
``shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at
stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which
shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.''
</P>
<P>
   This clause stops Congress from using money as a threat against
judges _ so that the judiciary has the independence it requires in
order to be a co-equal branch of government. Obviously, the same
logic applies to the presidency. Congress cannot hold a president's
salary or pension hostage, dependent on whether the president bends
to the will of Congress. If Congress were to pass a resolution to
take Clinton's pension, the president could successfully challenge
that action in the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the Senate punish the president by levying a fine _ for
the same reasons, it cannot take his retirement pay.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Senate doesn't even have the constitutional
authority to censure the president. While Democrats may want the
Senate to choose censure instead of an impeachment trial, censure
is beyond the power granted by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Censure was already attempted during President Andrew Jackson's
tenure in office. Jackson drew the ire of Senate when he vetoed a
bill that would recharter the U.S. Bank and then fired Secretary of
the Treasury William Duane for refusing to transfer the
government's deposits from the U.S. Bank into state banks. In 1834,
the Senate adopted a resolution to censure Jackson for his actions.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article by senior researcher at the Library of
Congress and constitutional scholar Louis Fisher, published in the
Washington Post, Oct. 4, Jackson wrote a lengthy protest in answer
to the Senate's resolution. He blasted the censure as ``wholly
unauthorized by the Constitution and in derogation of its entire
spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The three branches of government, Jackson wrote, are co-equal
and do not have the ``power or right to control or censure each
other'' _ except through the authority of the Constitution, and the
Constitution only allows Congress the power of impeachment as a
check against a president who jeopardizes our democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Jackson was telling Congress, impeach me if you can
_ or forget it. You have no power to censure a president. And, in
fact, three years later, the Senate ordered the censure resolution
expunged from the record.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would be wrong to accept a censure. If he accepts it, a
precedent would be created that could weaken the office for future
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   A quick vote on an impeachment trial in the Senate would end
this farce and allow the nation get on with its business.

 &HT;    Elton's next tour takes him small U.S. cities
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elton John says he enjoys scaring himself. And now he'll have
the chance.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the singer and pianist will hit the road
alone, playing small American cities _ and Atlanta _ with just a
piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to keep myself fresh and on my toes,'' John said in
an interview. ``It's very rewarding to go out and do shows on your
own because a) it's scary, and b) you get to do numbers you don't
normally perform with a band, and it gives you a chance to talk to
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've had a career for 30 years, you need to go back
and be scared once in a while. With a band, you're surrounded by
people who can support and cover up for you. With this, if I make a
mistake, it's out there for everyone to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets go on sale Saturday for the first leg of the tour, which
begins Feb. 19 in Roanoke, Va. John will also play Chattanooga;
Fort Myers, Gainesville and Pensacola, Fla.; Jackson, Miss.; Grand
Rapids, Mich.; Lafayette, La.; Iowa City, Iowa; and Huntsville,
Ala. He's even playing Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The tour will swing through John's adopted U.S. hometown,
Atlanta, Feb. 23, when he makes his Fox Theatre debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to play the Fox. It's a beautiful theater
and a great size to play,'' John said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices for the Fox date have yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   John will entertain college students during several campus dates
on the itinerary, including Southern Illinois University at
Carbondale and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He says
those shows will help him build on his boomer-heavy fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll either be beside themselves with glee or beside
themselves with absolute horror!'' said John, 51.
</P>
<P>
   The singer also likes the idea of playing places that rarely get
included on superstar tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played Greenville, S.C., recently, and people were saying,
`I can't believe he's coming to Greenville.' Well, why not? Thirty
thousand people are a lot people. Also, these are people who
haven't heard you play for a while. That adds to the challenge of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   John says fans can expect some low-key songs. Sets will likely
include ``Talking Old Soldiers'' from the 1970 album ``Tumbleweed
Connection'' and ``Border Song'' from 1981's ``The Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll be doing some up-tempo stuff, too,'' said John,
laughing. ``Otherwise, you'll have to give people a suicide kit
before they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preparing the tour, the singer has logged time in
a recording studio in recent months. ``Elton John and Tim Rice's
Aida,'' an album based on songs from ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend
of Aida,'' is scheduled for release March 23. (The future of the
Disney stage show, which premiered in Atlanta, is undecided.)
</P>
<P>
   Sting, James Taylor, Spice Girls, Tina Turner, Shania Twain,
Lenny Kravitz and Boyz II Men have all contributed tracks. John
himself recorded duets with LeAnn Rimes and Janet Jackson and a
solo version of the show's title song.
</P>
<P>
   John and Rimes will publicly debut their duet of ``Written in
the Stars'' during the live ``People's Choice Awards'' telecast at
9 p.m. EST Sunday on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Of the ``Aida'' album, John said, ``I just told people, `Don't
do the songs the same as me.' And no one has. Sting has done
`Another Pyramid' in a very, very classic reggae way. James
Taylor's done `How I Know You' in a very beautiful James Taylor
acoustic fashion. And the Spice Girls have recorded `My Strongest
Suit.' They're really the only people who could have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actresses Heather Headley and Sherie Scott, who starred in
``Aida'' during the show's Atlanta run, also put in some time
together in the recording studio. Along with John, they have
recorded the show's ``A Step Too Far'' for the album.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Mozart on the move
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what was the first thing I heard when my favorite radio
program came alive on an otherwise glum morning? You're right, it
was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's overture to ``The Marriage of
Figaro.''
</P>
<P>
   I almost cheered. I started conducting madly with my free arm,
becoming, in an instant, both a menace to public safety and a
public spectacle. What did other drivers think when I queued the
oboes? I hope they were oboes.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't heard the overture for a long time, so it sounded
particularly fine and new. Wolfgang's lovely creation, unlike many
overtures, doesn't contain any of the opera's tunes. Wolfgang
didn't need that; he was brimming over with musical ideas. Just for
fun he grabbed the essence of the opera by its musical throat.
</P>
<P>
   That was all they played. I felt a little letdown. I can't hear
that overture without wanting to hear the last seven or eight
minutes of the opera, which is, in my opinion, the most beautiful
music ever composed. Those few minutes in the garden are a
glorious, good-humored hymn to love, friendship, forgiveness and
humanity. I hummed what I could. I was lousy.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang, somewhere, grinned slyly.

FIT FOR YOUR FEET
</HEADLINE>
  Includes color graphic, available by e-mail, on what to look for in
a running shoe. Call 212-499-3342. 
 By BEN STEELMAN 
 c.1999 New York Times Regional Newspapers 
 American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why does every other shop in the mall these days sell athletic
shoes?
</P>
<P>
   And why do half those shoes cost almost as much as a compact
car?
</P>
<P>
   It may be impossible to say, yet it's easier to answer these
questions: Do you have to spend $150 on your feet? How much of that
cost is fashion, and how much is fitness?
</P>
<P>
   Quality does come at a price, experts advise. If you try to work
out seriously with a pair of cheap imports, you might regret it.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of weekend athletes apparently agree. According to the
National Sports Goods Association, nearly $8 billion is spent each
year in the United States on athletic shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you don't have to sell your soul to get the shoes you
need.
</P>
<P>
   For example, David K. Miller, co-author of ``Fitness: A Lifetime
Commitment'' (Allyn and Bacon, 1995), never pays more than $100 for
running shoes _ and he runs between 25 and 50 miles per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most expensive shoe is not always the best shoe,'' said
Miller. By watching for sales, he often finds the shoes he likes
for $50 to $60 per pair.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sprecher, head coach for cross-country and track at the
University of North Carolina at Wilmington, generally spends $40 to
$60 per pair on his athletes' shoes. ``It's the most important
piece of equipment an athlete can have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with expensive shoes, Sprecher added, is that owners
might be tempted to hold onto them too long. Like tires, shoes wear
down after time; the feet lose cushioning and support. Since a
runner's stride hits the surface with a power of 2 1/2 to 3 times
his or her body weight, those feet need a lot of cushioning.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, according to Dr. Michael D. Carter, a sports
medicine specialist in Wilmington, N.C., is that shoes still look
good long after they're effectively worn out.
</P>
<P>
   For those who exercise regularly, then, it's a good idea to buy
modestly priced shoes and replace them regularly, Sprecher said.
For his distance runners, a typical pair might last about 500
miles: ``After that, they'll start to feel a difference,'' he said
_ and that difference might be felt as aches or pains in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   If you work out in a particular sport for three or four hours or
more a week, you probably need athletic shoes, said Carter.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you need a pair designed specifically for your
event.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mistake, for instance, to use running shoes if you play a
lot of basketball or tennis.
</P>
<P>
   A runner's shoes are designed for continuous forward motion, not
the frequent side-to-side moves under a net or on the court.
Specifically, they're built with a slight incline in the sole;
dodge too fast after a ball, and you could twist an ankle, Carter
warned.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most footwear chains have moved beyond the days
when ill-trained clerks would push you to buy the top of the line,
said Miller. At ``name-brand'' stores, at least, chances are the
staff will include at least one specialist knowledgeable enough to
help you find what you really need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't buy shoes in the morning,'' Carter said. Your feet
expand gradually during the day, especially after a run or workout,
so it's best to shop after work or after exercising.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect athletic shoes to ``break in.'' They should fit
well immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons offers these
suggestions for buying athletic shoes:
</P>
<P>
   When trying on a pair, wear the same type of sock you will wear
for that sport, not your dress socks or hose.
</P>
<P>
   You should be able to wiggle all your toes freely. With running
shoes, there ought to be about a thumbnail's space between the big
toe and the toe of the shoe, according to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Walk or run a few steps in the new pair to make sure they're
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Always relace the shoes before trying them on, making sure you
have even pressure from the bottom to the top.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the grip of your sole is firm. Your heel should not
slip as you walk or run.
</P>
<P>
   The most important factor in shopping for a running shoe, Miller
and Sprecher agreed, is adequate support, particularly for the
mid-sole area.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers will tout ``air'' soles or capsules or gel-based
cushioning, but whatever the material, what's important is whether
the cushioning works.
</P>
<P>
   Cushions generally come in two layers between the sole and foot.
The top cushion should normally be three times the thickness of the
bottom cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Canvas tops are generally not very supportive and may stretch.
Leather is strong but may not allow the feet to ``breathe''
adequately. Thus, the best top material is often nylon or a
nylon-leather combination.
</P>
<P>
   Training shoes will generally be heavier, with thicker soles and
higher heels, than shoes made for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Walking shoes should have a firm heel, good shock absorption, a
smooth tread, and a rocker sole that encourages the natural roll of
the foot.
</P>
<P>
   For longer walks on rough terrain, consider water-resistant
hiking boots. Good boots will have a firm heel, a flexible
forepart, heavily lugged soles for traction, padding around the
ankles and a high, wide toe box.
</P>
<P>
   Court sports _ tennis, basketball and volleyball _ require shoes
that are light and built to take heavy abuse. The key to these
shoes is in the sole, which should be designed specifically for the
sport you'll be playing. For example, serve-and-volley tennis
players may need extra cushioning on the balls of their feet, while
baseline players may need reinforcement on the heels and midfoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hightops'' can provide extra support for the ankles but should
not restrict ankle motion.
</P>
<P>
   For court players, a coach or physician can offer advice on
which sole style will be best.
</P>
<P>
   Aerobic dancers need shoes that are a cross between the
shock-absorbent running shoe and the court shoe with lateral
support. Flexibility in the forepart is especially important.
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance or marathon runners _ those who can cover 80 miles
or more in a typical week _ will likely require more specialized,
more reinforced and more expensive shoes than a typical jogger.
</P>
<P>
   Within these guidelines, Miller warned, each individual foot is
different. One runner's perfect fit might not work with another.
Consumers should pay particular attention to pronation, the natural
inward roll of the foot on each step, which can vary considerably
from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   Where one walks or runs might also affect decisions, Miller
added. The ideal surface would be a level dirt road or field, with
plenty of ``give.'' Paved sidewalks or roadways might require more
cushioning. A sandy beach, on the other hand, might have too much
``give,'' which could lead to a painful stretching of the Achilles'
tendons.

<TEXT>
<P>
   We are 80 miles south of Fort Lauderdale, plodding through
mid-May heat down an abandoned road walled in by a green bramble of
hardwood hammock.
</P>
<P>
   Officially this is the Key Largo Hammock State Botanical Site,
but if you didn't know where to stop along Florida Interstate 905-A
you'd never find this spot. But just the day before in this very
thicket, local birders sighted a La Sagra's flycatcher, a pip of a
bird that's common in the Bahamas but extremely rare in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   We move in a hushed, collective clot, following Jan Pierson. An
affable New Englander with an easy manner, Pierson is a birder of
global experience, first on his own, then as a guide for Austin,
Texas-based Field Guides, the acclaimed bird touring company he
helped found in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson's hands are cupped around his ears and he is peering
into the dense foliage. One of us has a tape recording of the La
Sagra's call. He plays it at intervals, and Pierson listens
intently for the reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There it is!'' Pierson's voice is low and fast. ``Down low.
Halfway up the tree. There! He's hopped to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   Pierson sets up a tripod and scope and we each get our chance to
view the flycatcher, a swatch of brown feathers, nonchalantly
ruffling a white breast with a tiny beak.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the van, Pierson says there might be only one or two La
Sagra's sightings a year in South Florida, which is one to two more
sightings than any place else in North America. ``Could there be
others in there?' someone asks. Pierson eyes the wall of foliage
unreeling beside us at 50 mph. ``There could be 50 La Sagra's
flycatchers in there,'' he smiles. ``You just never know what bird
is going to show up where.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the fun of birding.
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't know much about birders, often portrayed as
binocular-toting obsessives who wear funny hats and dash madly
about saying things like, ``What luck! A pair of mangrove
cuckoos!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, many birders do wear funny hats, but only because most of
them have been around long enough to realize the ramifications of
skin cancer. It's also true that many birders keep lists of the
birds they've seen, and some of them are ardent about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``World lists, North American lists, country lists, county
lists, backyard lists,'' said David Pomerantz, a straightforward
New Yorker who was part of our group. ``I read about a birder who
kept a list of birds who landed on his hat.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most birders lists are merely an excuse to get outside,
to travel, to share discoveries with like-minded people and simply
take a keen look at the world around them. Birders notice things
the rest of us don't. Back at the Key Largo site, Pemerantz had
pointed to the low branch of a tree and said to me, ``Look here.''
I saw nothing, then I looked harder and there it was: a tree snail
no bigger than my fingernail, its lovely ivory-white shell wound
with intricate yellow rings.
</P>
<P>
   We rumbled out of Key West harbor the following morning in
starry darkness. By burnt-orange dawn, everybody had scrambled up
to the top deck of the 63-foot Tiburon, our rolling home for the
next three days. Binoculars at the ready, they scanned the skyline.
The Dry Tortugas are 70 miles from Key West. We would be at sea for
nearly six hours. No one wanted to miss anything.
</P>
<P>
   The Tortugas are seven tiny islands, some barely poking above
high tide, that form a fragile circle of coral and sand in the vast
blue of the Gulf of Mexico. In the spring they are the first fleck
of land that northward migrating birds encounter after a long,
open-ocean haul.
</P>
<P>
   Some birds don't make it. Four hours out of Key West, Pierson
had the Tiburon's captain swing over to a tower marking a shoal.
Light green water languidly rose and fell from the tower's legs. A
dozen birds clustered on a guano-stained platform. Among the
seabirds -- brown boobies and frigatebirds -- was a lone cattle
egret waiting stoically to die.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon bobbed softly under the piercing sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they put down, they don't usually get up,'' said Pierson
quietly. ``This is the last stop for that cattle egret. He's
migrating and he blew it.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be plenty of dying birds on the Tortugas too,
bedraggled things perched beneath a ceiling of sky into which they
would never again lift off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some birders like birds because they give the idea of
freedom,'' observed one of our group, Everett Knapp, a Midwesterner
with 30 years of birding experience. ``Sort of an elusive idea,
though, because they're not really free.''
</P>
<P>
   A few nights before, a storm front had lashed rain across this
part of the gulf. The storm raised the possibility of a ``fallout''
of birds searching for cover on Garden Key, which lay between us
and the Tortugas. We arrived on the key in mid-afternoon and gave
the white sand beaches nary a glimpse but made a beeline for the
entrance to the ruined fort which dominates the island, crossing
its moat a dim archway to the open-air sward at its center.
</P>
<P>
   Here we found a birder's heaven: Birds were sheltering here in
droves, lighting up the crumbling brick walls like ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was pointing and sucking in their breath. Binoculars
swung this way and that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a redstart!'' said Pierson. ``Winters in the West
Indies. Look at that! That's a primo bird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a male scarlet tanager!'' exclaimed someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three male blackpoll warblers fresh from South
America,'' said Pierson. ``Look up! There comes a purple martin!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a cuckoo! Yellow-billed!'' said Pomerantz.
</P>
<P>
   ``A male Cape May warbler!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Indigo bunting!''
</P>
<P>
   For over an hour everyone moved about the sward, training
binoculars and scopes into the trees in a sort of euphoric haze.
They peered resolutely into the sky, but no one seemed to notice
the massing black clouds. Thunder rolled. The palm fronds went
still. Gnats lighted on my knuckles. The air went cool, cooler,
cooler, then fat raindrops began to plock down and everyone
returned to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the Tiburon, we gathered in the galley. Through the
windows sheets of rain ran in ribbons across the water toward ghost
sailboats. In the galley there was a drained hush.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, birding is like gold mining,'' drawled John
Huckabee, a lifelong birder from Texas. ``You look, look, look ,
and then you hit something like this and it keeps you coming
back.''

BE A SUCCESS AND LEAVE AT 5
</HEADLINE>
  By BETTY HOLCOMB 
 c.1999 Working Mother 
 North American rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a managing director at Merrill Lynch, Susan Scherbel knows
she has it good. She works full time, but no one clocks her hours;
in fact, no one even monitors where and when she gets her work
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since my first child was born eight years ago, I've pretty
much worked out of my home, getting the job done as I needed to or
wanted to or could,'' she says. In that time, she's had two more
kids and been promoted. She now shows up in the office only when
it's absolutely essential.
</P>
<P>
   How did she cut such a good deal? With her background as an
attorney with a wide-ranging knowledge of both corporate taxes and
the tax aspects of employee benefit plans, she brings an expertise
to many deals that virtually no one else on Wall Street has. ``I'd
like to think that I'd have this arrangement no matter what, but I
wouldn't bet the mortgage on that. The truth is the more
indispensable you are, the more you can distinguish yourself, and
the more likely it is that you can gain some flexibility and still
move ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   That's excellent advice, according to consultants and academics
who advise companies on flexible work arrangements. Though some
companies have begun to create new ways to work, most still measure
employees the old-fashioned way, by the clock. ``Many managers
still think if they can see your face, you're productive,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, vice president at Catalyst, a New York City
think tank dedicated to advancing women in the workplace. ``That's
not true, of course. Just being there doesn't mean someone is
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Kropf and other consultants have learned over the years,
it takes a big effort to move managers out of this old mind-set. So
what's a parent to do?
</P>
<P>
   As Scherbel's experience shows, even in the most demanding,
time-intensive careers, there are strategies for achieving success
when you work flexible hours or must leave promptly each day. We
surveyed readers and talked to the experts to come up with tactics
for not only surviving, but thriving if you work with
clock-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make yourself indispensable. As Scherbel found, companies will
go the extra mile for you if you have an important skill that no
one else has. Toni Thompson, an occupational therapist and mother
of two from Lutz, Fla., accomplishes the same thing in another way.
``I take on projects that no one else wants to do. I am developing
a reputation as the one you can count on,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many moms say that they volunteer for special
committees, especially those that mean working with other
departments. That initiative keeps you visible, buffering you from
the misconception that you're not pulling your weight because you
leave at 5 or work flextime. ``People look to you when new projects
come down the pike,'' says one mother who works in the marketing
department of a major corporation. ``Pretty soon, they see you as
someone they really need.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Showcase your productivity. Of course, it won't help to have a
talent or an expertise unless you make people aware of it. ``I
never really used to strut my stuff,'' says Thompson. ``Now I make
a point to talk up the committees I'm on and the projects I'm
doing.'' Not only that, but Thompson is also quick to praise her
co-workers' contributions as well. ``I highlight other people's
work, and that way, I show that I am contributing and also a team
player who appreciates other people's productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Choose the right priorities. Productivity only counts when
you're doing the right stuff, of course. Spending hours on tasks
that don't move the firm's main agenda forward is a waste of time.
If the company's goal is to create a top-of-the-line digital camera
or to make milk the most exciting drink in the grocery store, then
that should be your priority as well, in big ways and small.
</P>
<P>
   If you aren't sure what your boss's priorities are, find out.
``It's critically important to sit down with your manager and have
clear objectives,'' says Joy Bunson, senior vice president of
organizational development at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York
City. ``Once you can focus on outcome, face time is less
important.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, having the right priorities means adapting to your
supervisor's habits and personality quirks. ``My boss is a morning
person,'' says one mom. So she does her best to make sure she's on
time in the morning. ``If I stay after 5 because I came in a bit
late, it doesn't matter to him. It's more important that I am here
on time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep the focus on work. Make sure that everyone knows you're
committed to working hard during office hours. Many moms note that
they don't waste time socializing during office hours; many skip
lunch to make the most of their time. ``I let my co-workers know
that I do have deadlines,'' says Tanya Mahoney, a fund raiser for
the Dallas chapter of the American Red Cross. ``If there is a
project looming, I let them know that I am not to be bothered, that
my immediate project is the task of the day.'' With that kind of
clear-cut dedication to getting the job done, co-workers are less
likely to question your commitment or productivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speak up when you have a problem. If you have a conflict that
makes it impossible to arrive on time or forces you to leave a
little early, talk to your supervisor. Otherwise, you're likely to
be seen as someone who doesn't care about your work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have an open conversation with your boss,''
says Kropf. Frame the issue professionally, showing that your goal
is to be more productive. ``You might say, 'I know the standard
schedule is to be here at 8:30, not 9, but that isn't working for
me. I don't want you to think I'm late because I don't care. I want
to be a good performer, and I'm hoping that we can come up with a
mutually agreeable solution.'''
</P>
<P>
   You can then suggest options, such as skipping lunch or staying
a little later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take advantage of technology. If you leave at 5, that doesn't
mean you can't still be in touch with co-workers and your boss. Use
a cell phone, voicemail, e-mail, whatever it takes to stay on top
of business that must be done after you leave the office. ``I use
my cell phone to attend meetings after 5 p.m. or before 9 a.m.,''
says one mother. That way, her boss and co-workers don't think of
her as ``leaving early''; instead, they see that she makes every
effort to be a team player.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Scherbel is evidence that a change is already under way.
``When I first started working at home, I tried to keep the
arrangement quiet,'' she says. But now she's extremely comfortable
with it, especially since Merrill Lynch has touted the arrangement
in company newsletters and to the media. Her schedule is now
considered a model, a harbinger of the future. ``I hope that's
true,'' Scherbel says, ``because it seems to be a win-win for
everybody.''

HOW TO HELP A FORGETFUL CHILD 
 BY MARGERY D. ROSEN
</HEADLINE>
  c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Matthew has always been a sunny, curious child, but in the
past few months he's been so forgetful that my husband and I are
worried,'' says Peggy Simon of Muncie, Ind., who is four months
pregnant with her third child.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy will ask 6-year-old Matthew, her oldest, to do the
simplest thing -- clear his dishes off the table or dump his dirty
socks in the hamper -- and he can't remember to do it. ``This
morning, I asked if he could please bring me the telephone book.
When I went looking for him 15 minutes later, I found him under the
hall table watching a ladybug crawl up the wallpaper. He'd
forgotten all about the phone book.''
</P>
<P>
   During his last school conference, Matt's teacher suggested that
Matt be tested for attention deficit disorder (ADD), since his mind
wanders in class and he rarely hands in a finished homework
assignment. ``Neither she nor I thinks he has ADD, but there are
lots of unanswered questions,'' Peggy continues. ``She'll give the
kids a math packet to complete, but Matt will bring home only the
first page. Or he'll leave his notebook in his cubby so he can't
copy the spelling words.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of his possessions is another problem. ``So far
he's lost two baseball caps, a new pair of soccer shin guards, and,
believe it or not, his backpack,'' Peggy reports. ``When we ask him
where something is, he has no clue that he's even lost the item! Or
he'll cry. I can tell he feels bad about disappointing us.''
</P>
<P>
   A few times Matt has even mumbled that he was stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy wouldn't be so frustrated if Matt's absent-mindedness were
an infrequent thing. ``But after a while, you lose your patience.
I've run out of ways to help him,'' she confesses.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy's a believer in time-outs, but they have had no impact on
Matt's forgetfulness. Neither has the system of rewards she
instituted: ``We made a chart of the things he typically forgets to
do, and I offered a sticker for each task he did without a
reminder,'' she recalls. ``After a week he could trade in the
stickers for a toy. But it didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt's father, Mark, who manages a paint supply business, thinks
Peggy is too lenient. ``He's old enough to keep track of things,''
insists Mark. ``If we didn't let him get away with so much -- Peggy
runs out to buy whatever he loses -- he'd come around. Sometimes I
think he's purposely being defiant.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peggy believes her husband is much too harsh. ``Mark's idea
of solving the problem is to yell and say, 'Shut up!' when Matt
tries to explain himself,'' she protests. As a result, Peggy is
increasingly worried. ``I can't help wondering if Matt's just not
as bright as we thought he was,'' she says. ``Isn't he old enough
to recall simple thing, the first time we ask him?''
</P>
<P>
   The Simons consulted Theresa A. Kruczek, an assistant professor
of counseling psychology at Ball State University in Muncie.
Kruczek's analysis:
</P>
<P>
   A child's forgetfulness, though exasperating, is a normal
behavior that peaks and ebbs throughout childhood. And most parents
react to their offspring's absent- mindedness like the Simons did.
They can't comprehend how a child who, for instance, understands
the computer so well can never remember anything they ask him to
do.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that forgetfulness is usually a behavioral
problem. And that means it can be corrected. But first you have to
figure out what's triggering the absent-mindedness. The Simons'
family history revealed several factors that, taken together, were
contributing to Matthew's frustrating forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Peggy and Mark reported that the problem really
started only when their son entered first grade. I told them I
doubted that ADD was a factor, since children with ADD often
display signs of irritability, lack of concentration and a high
degree of distractibility from infancy. (Psychological tests had
also ruled out any other learning problems.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, first-graders are often forgetful. The curriculum
is more demanding and the school day is more structured than it is
in kindergarten. First-graders have to recall loads of information:
the names of their new teachers and friends, school routines, even
the location of the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matthew has a lot going on in his bead,'' I pointed out, ``and
it can be hard to keep it all straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgetfulness can be unwittingly exacerbated by high parental
expectations. Yes, kids at the age of 6 can do much more than they
used to. But they are, after all, still little. And although
parents want their children to take on increased responsibility,
many never take the time to teach them how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Matthew to draw a picture of his family, another
critical piece of the puzzle fell into place. Matthew drew a house
with his parents, his sister and the dog inside -- and he was
outside. When I asked him to tell me about his picture, he said he
felt like he was on the outside a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy and Mark were initially surprised when they learned this,
but they soon conceded that, with a new business getting off the
ground and a third child on the way, perhaps they weren't spending
as much time with Matthew as they had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, the Simons set aside 30 minutes each day for
one of them to spend alone with Matt, doing whatever he wanted.
Mark also acknowledged that raising his voice and insulting his son
weren't helpful, and he vowed to keep his temper in check.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew knew he was forgetful and was comfortable talking about
it. Together we discussed a plan: Since be was a computer nut, I
suggested that he type into the computer a list of Rules for
Remembering:
</P>
<P>
   1. Ask myself, What am I supposed to do right now?
</P>
<P>
   2. Figure out how to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pick a way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   4. Just do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when his mother makes a request or he starts to do his
chores, Matt recites the list like a mantra. This helps him to
concentrate so he's less likely to forget important things.
</P>
<P>
   I also enlisted Matt's teacher to help him stay focused. She
wrote down each day's homework assignment on an index card, which
he gave to his mother as soon as he got home. Peggy now knows
exactly what Matt has to do each night and can gently prompt him.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, homework had been a haphazard affair, so the next
step was to set aside a specific time for Matt to study. The Simons
chose 7 p.m. as the starting time. I suggested they allow Matt to
choose where he wanted to work and that either Peggy or Mark stay
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Within two months, not only did Matt seem much happier but his
track record for remembering had improved greatly. ``He is so much
more responsible now, we get less upset with the occasional memory
lapse,'' says Peggy. ``After all, he's only 6!''

 Color slides and black and white photos of Billy Crudup and Woody
Harrelson in ``The Hi-Lo Country.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You could say British director Stephen Frears has a way with
women. He took an unknown American stage actress, Annette Bening,
and turned her into a tough little sex cookie in the sizzling movie
``The Grifters'' (1990), garnering her an Academy Award nomination
and the attention of Warren Beatty. Anjelica Huston in the same
film has never been better.
 &HT;    Before that he picked Michelle Pfeiffer out of her sex-symbol
straight jacket, handed her a ``real'' role as the victim of an
amorous count's seductive designs in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' (1988)
and suddenly she wasn't just a pretty face.
 &HT;    And now in his first Western ``The Hi-Lo Country'' he's given
the treatment to not one but two actresses who have never looked
more gorgeous or been more real on screen.
 &HT;    Patricia Arquette plays Mona, wife to one man and object of
desire to two more: best friends and fellow roustabouts Pete Calder
(played by newcomer Billy Crudup) and Big Boy Matson (Woody
Harrelson). Mona is trouble but so seductive that the men risk
their deep friendship and their lives to grab her for themselves.
 &HT;    Arquette is right up there in Frears' book with Bening, Huston
and Pfeiffer. ``She's working class, she's right, she's wonderful,
'' says Frears. ``I saw her in 'True Romance' (1993) and I think
she's quite extraordinary.''
 &HT;    The other actress given the Frears treatment is Spain's leading
star Penelope Cruz. She plays Josepha O' Neil, Pete's
long-suffering girlfriend. Under his direction, a great beauty
becomes an absolute life force.
 &HT;    But while the women in ``Hi-Lo Country'' are the instigators of
the action, this time Frears is telling a story about men--real
men--and the difficult land they are attempting to tame.
 &HT;    ``Woody plays John Wayne here,'' says Frears laughing, ``When I
told him that he said, 'But I'm more flawed than John Wayne.' So I
said, 'That's what this is all about. It's John Wayne with
flaws.'''
 &HT;    For Harrelson's bosom buddy, Frears selected Billy Crudup, seen
in ``Without Limits'' (1998) and still largely an unknown. Under
Frears' direction he comes across like a veteran.
 &HT;    For a Cambridge educated Englishman, making a film in a genre
American audiences know as well as they know their mothers, it was
essential he find actors who looked capable of wrangling horses and
cattle and whose faces reflected a life in the sun in an
unforgiving landscape.
 &HT;    ``When I grew up actors had lines in their faces,'' he explains.
``I looked for actors that looked lived in, who looked as though
they had some experience of life. Billy did. He didn't look like
all those young actors out of Los Angeles. What's on their face is
their life experience.''
 &HT;    As for Harrelson, with whom other directors have had their
run-ins, Frears says, ``He's absolutely wonderful. His Big Boy's a
big lug--crude and rude. He's playing a passionate man, a heroic
American who defends what he believes in. And here I'm talking
about both Woody the person and the character.''
 &HT;    The place is the Santa Fe desert heart of the American West. The
time is immediately following World War II and in the town of Hi-Lo
the two best friends are reunited after their sojourn at war. All
is well until Pete discovers that Mona, a woman he has loved, is
having a hot affair with Big Boy and his own passions are
reawakened.
 &HT;    But the real love affair in the movie is between Big Boy and
Pete. ``In a sense,'' says Frears, who directed ``My Beautiful
Launderette'' (1985) which dealt explicitly with homosexuality,
``when a man loves a man, it must by definition be homosexual. But
making it explicit here would have been to make a different film.
This isn't homosexual, but it's about a man loving a man and it's
from a time when those things weren't laughed at.''
 &HT;    An Englishman's taking on the Western genre is a risk, but risk
has been a part of Frears' career from the beginning. It was a risk
to allow himself to be seduced to come to the Hollywood big time
from England where he had made a slew of small risky films like
``Prick Up Your Ears'' (1987) and ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid''
(1987). It was a risk to go head to head with a director of the
caliber of Milos Foreman who was making ``Valmont'' on the same
subject as Frears' ``Dangerous Liaisons'' at exactly the same time.
 &HT;    Frears' version came out first and blew Forman's away.
 &HT;    ``I was just a bloke off the street,'' says Frears modestly, ``I
had nothing to lose. Christopher Hampton's script was wonderful and
I knew Milos could never have such a good script.''
 &HT;    When the conversation returns to his success with women he
points first to one of his failures: ``Mary Reilly'' (1996) with
Julia Roberts.
 &HT;    ``I think she was wonderful--very, very good in the film. I've
thought how stupid we were to be so undemanding of her. She would
have done anything for us. She would have gone to the moon if we
had asked. But it just didn't work and the problem was right back
there in the writing. We should have stopped it much earlier.''
 &HT;    And when it comes to discussing his triumphs, here too he is
reluctant to take any credit. When Bening's name comes up he beams,
``I'm very proud of her. It makes me laugh that I was there for
this great performance.''
 &HT;    As for Huston, he says, ``I wish I could take the credit for
bringing her out. She had for many years been in the shadow of Jack
(Nicholson). But she'd already won an Oscar for 'Prizzi's Honor'
(1985). The truth is you are just standing there at the moment. I
guess you create conditions, then they suddenly let rip and you
have it in the bottle.''

MORE MEXICANS FIND CRUELTY, NOT ALLEGORY, IN BULLRING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Pepe Serrano stared straight into the bull's dark
marble eyes. Keeping his ankles together, he rolled slowly onto the
balls of his feet. His tense muscles twitched beneath his skin.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a red cape in one hand, Serrano carefully raised a long,
thin dagger with the other, pausing only when the handle reached
his nose and the point aimed at the beast.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in one explosive burst of energy, Serrano dropped the cape
to the dirt, let out a deep, mournful groan, and lunged toward the
animal, plunging the sword between the bull's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, there was no blood. This was a practice
session for aspiring young matadors like Serrano, 23, and others
who train at a small Mexico City park. The ``bull,'' in this case,
is a painted plaster replica set on a wheel and controlled by a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are kingly animals that are born to fight,'' said Curro
Segura, a 50-year-old matador, as he watched his apprentices.
Bullfighting, Segura added, is an allegory of ``the struggle
between life and death. It's not about violence.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Mexicans, however, are beginning to
disagree. Fueled mostly by animal protection groups and small
political parties that argue that bullfighting is nothing more than
glorified cruelty, a movement is percolating to alter a
centuries-old tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you ask people what they think, they will tell you that
they don't like the violence,'' said Gerardo Huerta, president of
the Latin American chapter of the World Society for the Protection
of Animals, which launched similar campaigns several years ago in
Europe and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The battle in Mexico _ which is second to Spain in its passion
for bullfighting _ has intensified over the past year. Last spring,
near the end of the five-month bullfighting season in Mexico, the
animal protection group and Mexico's Green Party polled about
120,000 Mexicans. Eighty-four percent of the respondents said that
the cruelty in bullfighting was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, both groups introduced lessons in several states
to teach elementary school students the importance of respect for
animals. They have also sponsored large demonstrations outside the
50,000-seat Plaza Mexico, the world's largest bullring, and paid
for a large billboard along the Anillo Periferico, Mexico City's
main highway.
</P>
<P>
   And in an effort to get support from the Roman Catholic Church,
which has been closely identified with the sport, Huerta said
opponents plan to flash pictures of bullfighting scenes on the
sides of buildings during Pope John Paul II's visit here later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Bullfighting appears to be muddling through an identity crisis
in Mexico. Purists, who consider the activity an art form rather
than a sport, say the overall quality of bulls and matadors has
diminished over the last generation.
</P>
<P>
   Although more bullrings than ever exist today in the country,
the number of ``corridas,'' or bull festivals, has dropped from 500
a year in the 1970s to 362 in 1998. By comparison, Spain holds
about 900 festivals a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a crisis in values today because there is so much
money and a lack of artistic ambition,'' said Luis Ruiz Quiroz, 72,
one of Mexico's most renowned bullfighting experts. ``These
protection people are making more noise than ever, but they don't
hurt us as much as the absence of well-trained and talented
matadors and noble bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, bullfighting remains a deeply embedded tradition
in Mexico, which has more than 300 bullrings and millions of fans.
The highlights of Sunday afternoon corridas are replayed on network
television. Sports sections of newspapers give them regular
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular matador today is Julian Lopez, a 16-year-old
from Spain, nicknamed ``El Juli,'' who packs rings around the world
and makes more than $60,000 every time he takes on a bull.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate sponsors ranging from soft drinks to hard liquor
compete for advertising space. And politicians use the events as
ready-made photo ops, as Mexico City's embattled mayor, Cuauhtemoc
Cardenas, did at the beginning of the season. (He was greeted by a
chorus of boos.)
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that tourists _ most of them from the United
States, where bullfighting is outlawed _ have also contributed to
the sport's recent surge in popularity in border cities such as
Juarez and Tijuana, and in resort cities like Cancun and Puerto
Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   Bullfighting in Mexico has changed little since it was
introduced to Latin America soon after the arrival of the Spanish
Conquistadors in 1519. A lone, fierce bull is brought into the ring
and surrounded by ``toreros'' on horseback, who wound the animal
with rainbow-colored wooden spears called ``banderillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the battle is left to the matador, who uses a red
cape to tease and lull the bull in a dance. The bull's sharp horns
often brush dangerously close to the matador's body. The fight
usually ends when the matador thrusts the sword between the
animal's shoulder blades. A ``clean'' kill will sever an artery to
the heart or puncture a lung; a poor kill will cause the sword to
stick in a bone or a muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Animal protection activists say they don't want to eliminate
bullfights, just the brutality of them. They want bullfighting
coordinators to adopt Portuguese-style events, in which the animal
could be wounded but not killed. So far, their requests have been
roundly rejected by the major organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Animal-rights groups have won some minor victories. Three years
ago, the Mexican congress passed a law requiring the use of special
pistols to finish off the bull immediately after a fight to reduce
the animal's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Still, bullfighting critics recognize that it may take several
more years before they win the larger battle to persuade a
20th-century audience to change a 400-year-old tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who control these decisions don't want to recognize the
violence that they're producing, especially for children,'' said
Robert Garcia Noriega, a Green Party spokesman who supervised last
year's poll. ``At the very least, they can reduce the violence and
stop sacrificing bulls.''

   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ No one taught Bruce McNeil to read in
elementary school, and he stuttered so badly that a full minute
could go by before a word would form. Still, McNeil says his
elementary school teachers in Salem would force him to stand before
his taunting classmates and try to read to them.
</P>
<P>
   They called him retarded. At first, the label stung. Then it
merely hurt. As McNeil grew older, it seeped in and became part of
him. He used it to win special assistance from the state, calling
himself one of the nation's few mentally retarded entrepreneurs.
But his laundry business failed.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a year ago, McNeil got a letter that would twist
everything he knew about himself into something he could not even
imagine. The state Department of Mental Retardation ruled, in a
brief form letter dated Dec. 12, 1997, that McNeil, then 38, was
not mentally retarded and therefore was ineligible for therapy and
other help he sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly I do not have the stigma of mental retardation,''
said McNeil, chain-smoking in his small kitchen on Eastern Avenue.
``I have been working to undo this for a year now, and it hurts
every day. It was OK for years to leave me in environments where no
child or young adult should be, to talk down to me, scream at me,
not teach me, pay me less. How much money has been used to suppress
me from age 5 to age 38?''
</P>
<P>
   But McNeil's most painful and confusing realization is that, for
the most part, lawmakers, business people, banks, his own clients,
and even strangers all rallied to his side because of a disability
he apparently does not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if he doesn't fit into a neat, politically correct
box any more for people who want to help him and then feel good
about themselves,'' said Sandra Dahl Ronan, a Gloucester clinical
social worker who worked with McNeil in 1990. ``Now, he is just a
guy who is failing, and that is not as romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Labels have defined McNeil's life. Now he faces his greatest
challenge _ trying to live without one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s were brutal for a boy dressed in ill-fitting clothes,
who drooled and cried a lot and spent years mostly segregated from
other youngsters, in a basement classroom reserved for slow
learners and mentally retarded children.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet protected by the special-needs laws that took effect in
1974, McNeil was the child whom teachers and counselors had labeled
for the world as mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a life that God gave, but one that man created.
Being segregated, constantly away from normal, healthy people, that
is abuse,'' said McNeil, now 39. ``No one ever asked me what was
wrong. At school, they just said I was mentally retarded. I heard
that all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of being labeled retarded, McNeil came to believe
it. In many ways, he built his career around it.
</P>
<P>
   Never hiding the fact that his IQ measured from 70 to 80, a full
20 to 30 points below the level for normal intelligence, he started
a seasonal house-cleaning business on Cape Ann. In the mid-1990s,
he got the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission and some local
banks to lend or give him tens of thousands of dollars to help
launch McNeil's Laundry Service, a commercial business that opened
with a splash in this fishing city in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the company run by a mentally retarded man with big
dreams and a mouth to match, but it employed the so-called
unemployables _ alcoholics, mentally ill people, long-term welfare
recipients _ and paid them competitive wages.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and the news media found McNeil irresistible.
Business Week, ``Chronicle,'' ABC News, ``Good Morning America,''
``The 700 Club,'' the Globe, Associated Press, and The Wall Street
Journal told his story in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The laundry failed, McNeil said, mostly because the consultants
and mentors paid to help him simply did not, an accusation they
have denied. McNeil, now unemployed, owes more than a half-million
dollars in bank loans and other debt. He said he has never felt
more alone, now that he is no longer anyone's cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would rather have the little boy who they think doesn't
know any better and doesn't have the ability to think and see,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the state Department of Mental Retardation adopted the
federal standard for mental retardation, which states in part that
retardation ``refers to substantial limitations in present
functioning . . . characterized by significant sub-average
intellectual functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, said Larry Tummino, assistant commissioner for
DMR's field operations, the state relied more heavily on
standardized tests, and anyone with an IQ of 70 points or less was
considered mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
   Tummino said the department never classified McNeil as mentally
retarded, although he acknowledged that teachers, social workers,
psychologists, and others did. A DMR assessment of McNeil in 1997,
his first ever by the department, determined he was functioning
normally by the department's current standards, said Tummino.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bruce's records, you might see the words `mental
retardation,' '' Tummino said. ``But today we would never just
depend on the test. The new standard has actually opened the doors
wider and made more people eligible,'' but not McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil's medical records, which he supplied, make clear that
some of the symptoms once cited as evidence of his mental
retardation _ including speech problems, an inability to pay
attention, and a slow learning style _ were viewed by certain
professionals as physical or ``organic.'' But the symptoms were
eventually recognized as mostly stemming from a brutal childhood of
deprivation, violence, and incest, according to McNeil's July 1978
psychiatric discharge report from North Shore Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would try to learn fractions and division and reading, but
it would not stay in my brain. Nothing stayed in my brain, because
everything around me at home and at school was unsafe,'' McNeil
recalled. ``I just shut down, and that was probably the healthiest
thing I ever did for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the hospital report, McNeil's father, Harold, who
died of cancer when McNeil was 14, had sexually assaulted McNeil's
older sisters, and was suspected of having incestuous relations
with some of his other children, including McNeil.
</P>
<P>
   In another report, McNeil told one therapist of recurring
nightmares of sexual attacks by his father that began before he was
age 4. He recalled hiding in the cabinet under the kitchen sink and
also sneaking food there so he could eat it without being preyed
on.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the children's hospital, from John T. Berry
Rehabilitation Center in North Reading, and from a therapist at
Children's Friend and Family Services in Salem described the McNeil
household as chaotic. All the children were diagnosed as dyslexic
or retarded and in dire need of psychological help, according to
McNeil's 1976 report at Berry, where he and three siblings went to
vocational school.
</P>
<P>
   Despite McNeil's pleas in his teen years to leave the family,
McNeil's mother, Blanche, a homemaker and onetime president of the
Berry parents association, told social workers she wanted her
family to remain together, the records say. In 1978, a psychiatrist
at Berry concluded the family should remain intact, even though a
social worker urged that at least some of the children be removed.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil said he has not seen or talked with his mother, who now
lives in Hamilton, in almost 20 years. She could not be reached for
comment, and has declined to talk with the Globe and other news
media about her son on several occasions in the past decade. McNeil
also says he has not talked with most of his siblings in 10 to 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he contemplates with some relish building a life without the
retardation label, McNeil has set up a veritable war room in his
kitchen, a telephone near the kitchen table, and documents piled up
around the small white house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a life back,'' said McNeil, who recently married. ``I
am not asking for something to be handed to me, but to be
compensated for damages that were allowed to be done to me. I will
give them a chance to undo all this.''
</P>
<P>
   After having received literally hundreds of McNeil's telephone
calls and letters, many local and state lawmakers and state and
federal agencies know McNeil by name. His badgering has burned some
bridges, with many of his allies calling McNeil his own worst
enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In November, McNeil filed a civil lawsuit in federal court
against the Department of Mental Retardation, the Massachusetts
Rehabilitation Commission, the Department of Mental Health, the US
Small Business Administration, the US Department of Education, and
the US Department of Health and Human Services. He also sued
several lawmakers, as well as the agencies he said knew about his
plight as a child.
</P>
<P>
   He is asking that the state and others help him get out of debt
and work to rebuild his laundry business as a rehabilitative
training center. He said he wants to help others who wear labels by
training them to staff and run commercial laundries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my job back because I am good at it,'' he said. ``You
come out of voke school, but there is no way to implement your
trade and be paid because you are labeled worthless.'' At McNeil's
Laundry Service, ``you can come out of an institution or a drug
rehab center (and) if you produce, you will get paid.''

FALLING ASLEEP ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time: Pay a visit to Dr.
Richard Ferber, one of the unsung heroes of Boston's world-renowned
medical community, a man who has brought rest to weary young
parents across the nation and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   His sleep laboratory, tucked into a corner of Children's
Hospital, has become a mecca. His book, ``Solve Your Child's Sleep
Problems,'' is an enormous seller. His word is gospel among the
overwrought, overtired set.
</P>
<P>
   His claim to fame: He has picked up where Dr. Benjamin Spock
left off, devising what is being hailed as a virtually foolproof
set of methods to lure even the youngest of children into a full,
uninterrupted night of sleep. For parents awakened repeatedly by a
crying baby, then left to stagger hopelessly through each day, day
after day, in a sleep-deprived daze, every instructive word of
Ferber's may as well be a bar of gold.
</P>
<P>
   So I thought it time to pay a call. He greeted me at the door of
his laboratory unassumingly enough, a slightly built, bespectacled
man of 54 with silvery hair, a white beard, and a voice so soft it
seemed to float across the air on a puffy summer cloud. And that is
where my troubles began.
</P>
<P>
   He guided me through the three bedrooms of his lab, with
infrared surveillance equipment and monitors meant to be attached
to various parts of a sleeping person. He showed off the control
room, then pulled out a massive ream of graph paper filled with
squiggly lines _ a study depicting the breathing patterns and
motions of a patient in a single night's sleep. ``When someone's in
this zone,'' he said, becoming visibly pleased, pointing to a page
of particularly pronounced squiggles, ``they're sleeping very well.
You need this sleep to function well.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued to page through the study, showing the troughs and
waves that indicated heavy snoring, the flat line that signaled an
awakening, the jagged peaks that depicted a dream. They went on
forever, and he seemed willing to go with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many pages is one of these studies?'' I asked, my mouth
becoming dry and my head getting ever so light. I blinked hard
twice just to make sure I still could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven-thousand,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could we sit and talk about your book?''
</P>
<P>
   He brought me into his office, where the shades were
inexplicably drawn and the soft whirring of warm air provided the
backdrop to our talk of sleep. I reminded myself why I was here.
Ferber's star has risen so high that his theories were the subject
of an episode of the situation comedy ``Mad About You.'' His life
and work were analyzed in a full-length New York Times Magazine
profile. His most popular method has been summed up in a
universally used nickname: Ferberizing.
</P>
<P>
   After we sat down in soft chairs, he detailed the most common
problem. Average people, babies included, awake many times during
the night, sometimes so briefly they don't recall it in the
morning. Many babies, however, grow accustomed to being rocked to
sleep or having their backs and necks gently rubbed. They
routinely, naturally awake at night, alone in their crib, and they
have no idea of how to fall back to sleep on their own, so they cry
out _ literally _ for help.
</P>
<P>
   As he is talking, my head is in a fog created by his soft, easy
voice, my chin slinging toward my neck. He mentions stuffed
animals. I miss my Boo Bear. He is talking about special blankets.
I want my binky. My eyes are glazing.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly _ or is it gradually? _ I'm unsure what he's talking
about anymore, though I hear his voice rising up into the purr of
warm air, then drifting absently through the room. I am now in that
zone between asleep and awake. I might as well be seeing gentle
lambs trotting across a dewy meadow, doing pirouettes, their bodies
floating through a blue sky framed by lollipop trees. What's this?
The lambs, they're trying to say something. Come, they are saying,
beckoning with their little hooves. Come with us. Come to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   I can't. I won't. Ferber is still talking. The solution, he
says, is to condition babies to fall asleep on their own. To do
this, babies must be left to cry, and parents should go in at
lengthening intervals to provide some reassurance, but little
physical comfort: a reassuring visit after five minutes of crying,
then 10 minutes, then every 15 minutes. Eventually, babies will
fall asleep on their own, and having done so, will do it through
the night. Within a few days, sleep problems are cured.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they're cured all right. The interview is over _ I think _
but I am languid to the point of immobility. I'd like some water. I
want my Boo Bear. I need my binky. And now I know why tens of
thousands of parents call Ferber their miracle doctor.

   The tight security, however, does not extend to medical workers'
homes. One former medical director resigned after opponents
picketed his home and harassed his young children in school. Paul's
predecessor, whom administrators decline to identify, had
protesters picket her suburban home 13 times and once they snapped
photographs of her children when the front door swung open. Last
Halloween, three of the clinic's doctors were visited by
trick-or-treaters dressed as a fetus and a doctor with dollar bills
strung around his neck, according to Susan Webber, the clinic's
vice president of external affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maureen Paul is incredibly dedicated to this cause,'' said
Webber. ``She is a very courageous person.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She is also one of a dwindling breed. While there is no tally of
the number of doctors who perform abortions, the number of
facilities which do them has declined 14 percent between 1992 and
1996, down to 2,042 from 2,380, according to the Alan Guttmacher
Institute. In Massachusetts alone, the number of facilities has
dropped 20 percent, to 51 from 64, during the same period,
according to the Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are dropping for several reasons, including the
declining rate of unintended pregnancy, but one reason may also be
fear. In addition to the seven clinic workers _ three of them
doctors _ who have been murdered, there have been 16 attempted
murders and 13 workers wounded, according to the National Abortion
Federation. Although the NFA says that many doctors have reaffirmed
their committment to providing abortion in the wake of Slepian's
slaying, they're also checking their locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``More doctors are putting back on their bulletproof vests,''
said Vicki Saporta, NAF's executive director. ``They are taking
more security precautions like getting alarms, cameras, and
lighting. Many are having conversations with their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the declining number of abortion providers,
according to abortion advocates, is that older doctors who were
committed to the procedure in part because they experienced
firsthand the days before abortion was legalized in 1973, are now
retiring. As the number of ob-gyn programs offering abortion
training has dropped to 12 percent from 23 percent in 1985, fewer
doctors may be able, much less willing, to do abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Antiabortionists maintain that the number of doctors doing
abortions is declining not because they don't know how to do them,
but because they don't want to. ``It is completely contrary to what
their mission is, which is to save lives,'' said Maryclare Flynn,
director of Massachusetts Citizens for Life. ``It carries a stigma
that might easily discourage doctors from going into the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many doctors who are retiring, Paul well remembers when
women couldn't get a legal abortion. She remembers because she was
one of them. She was 18, a sophomore at the University of Michigan,
and the product of a strict Catholic upbringing in Worcester. It
was 1968 and abortion was illegal. Paul got pregnant the first time
she had sex. When she called a family friend seeking money to go to
England where abortion was legal, the friend called her family. The
following day, her mother came and took her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father screamed at me that I was a whore, that I was
killing my mother,'' Paul recalled. ``I couldn't leave the house. I
couldn't make a phone call. Basically, I was a prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul's parents attempted to get her a therapeutic abortion at a
Boston hospital, but after a day of testing and interviews she was
turned down. Days later Paul ran away, married her boyfriend, and
went on to endure an unwanted pregnancy which she describes as ``a
terrible, terrible experience. I stood in the shower and cried
every day.'' After Paul gave birth to a girl and put her up for
adoption, her husband disappeared. When his parents declared him
dead several years later, Paul suspected he committed suicide.
After some spiritual wandering of her own, Paul turned to women's
health care. Four years later she got pregnant with a friend and
had a daughter on her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, what happened to me is a large part of why I do what
I do today,'' said Paul. ``I know that every time I do an abortion
on a woman who chooses it, I am saving her life literally,
figuratively. I know how important it would have been for me to
have had a legal abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   For years abortion was only a small piece of Paul's work. During
the decade she worked at UMass Medical Center she provided routine
obstetric and gynocological care and assisted in about 300 births
each year. Paul was also director of the University's Occupational
and Environmental Reproductive Hazards Program and earned
widespread recognition in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s, as the national debate over abortion
escalated and two doctors who performed abortions were murdered,
Paul felt a need to ``reaffirm my committment to abortion. I felt a
personal calling to be a part of the solution to the provider
shortage.'' When John Salvi pulled the trigger on the two
receptionists at the Boston clinics, Paul got herself a bulletproof
vest. And then she got to work.
</P>
<P>
   Already doing abortions one day a week at the former Preterm
Health Services, Paul began filling in for a doctor who left
Planned Parenthood after the shootings. She also helped develop a
training program in abortion for ob-gyn residents at the UMass
Medical Center. For Paul, the answer to abortion-related violence
is not ``more armored camps,'' she said. ``The answer is to keep
abortion from being marginalized by bringing it back into the
mainstream of American medicine. And that means more doctors doing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And then a backlash began. Two months after the Salvi shootings,
the Pro-Life Action hotline mentioned Paul for the first time and
urged listeners to pray for her. And for the first time, Paul was
scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time my name had been broadcast across the
state,'' Paul said. ``I was terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   But not terrified enough to retreat. Security measures do not
come easily to Paul and until now, at least, she has resisted some
of the heavier hardware that has become standard for other
physicians. She studied karate for over a year, but stopped because
it took too much time. An ebullient, extroverted woman, Paul is by
her own assessment ``the antithesis of Zen'' and the constant
watchfulness counseled by security advisers has taken some doing.
</P>
<P>
   When Paul talked to her daughter about how to respond to her
inclusion on the Web site, Paul told her with a sigh, ``Oh, well.
They really haven't harassed me much,'' recalled her daughter, who
asked not to be identified. ``I said, `Mom. This is harassment.'
She is learning to be more alert. To be more watchful. But it's
evolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The evolution is quickening. In a recent meeting in her office
with a midwife who plans to do abortions, Paul ticked off security
measures like a pro. ``My advice is to put things in place before a
crisis,'' Paul told the midwife, who declined to be identified.
``Watch for strange cars in the 'hood. Vary your route to work.
Know your police and fire departments. Look out for packages.''
</P>
<P>
   While Paul declines to specify the additional security measures
she has taken since her name was included on the Web site, it is
clear that her greatest source of security comes from her community
of friends and family. The night after she was mentioned on the
hotline, a dozen friends showed up at her door. One brought a
bulletproof vest. One brought a can of mace. One called the hotline
and jammed it with messages, while another walked the neighborhood
rallying support should picketers ever show up. Paul's daughter
came home.
</P>
<P>
   Paul held a second, larger meeting last month and organized a
phone tree in case of emergency. One thing she is particularly
haunted by is the prospect of being trapped alone in her home with
picketers outside. Last month she met with the three other
occupants of her building to let them know that she had been
included on the Nuremberg list and was met with a firm expression
of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of community support is what makes me feel safe,''
said Paul. ``The hardware helps. But it's not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is something. Security experts from Planned Parenthood
and the National Abortion Federation visited Paul's condominium
last month, pacing around the outside of her handsome Victorian
building and peering out her windows. They talked about cameras and
car ignitions and alarms and lighting. And while they had some
suggestions about how to make her beloved atrium more secure, they
did not, as she had feared, forbid her from sitting there. So,
after a few weeks of looking at the brick wall, she's gone back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I will not give up for the stupid snipers is my
atrium,'' Paul said. ``When I give this up, that will be a measure
of the last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Dr. Maureen Paul poured herself a glass of juice
and sat down in front of her window.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a relief to learn that official sponsors are already lined
up to welcome in the new millennium in New York's Times Square a
year from now. I was concerned the new century just might not
arrive if it weren't adequately bribed by the likes of the official
bubbly, Korbel, and the official plastic money, the Discover card,
and the official TV hawker, who else but Home Shopping Network?
</P>
<P>
   At first, I confess, I was a little surprised that the corporate
world would have the gall to attempt to claim for itself a natural
event that in truth should be far beyond the clutches of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Well, call me a doofus. As the news from Times Square indicates,
the year 2000 will usher in not only a new century but also a new
era in corporate advertising. The competition for consumers' eyes
has never been hotter, and traditional avenues such as network
television are failing to provide that old-time punch. So it makes
perfect sense that extraordinary efforts are under way. I am not
surprised that companies are now serious about beaming corporate
messages onto the moon for the entire world to see aglow in the
night sky. What harm is there if future generations of children
grow up believing that the man in the moon actually does wear
glasses and goes by the name Bill Gates?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is no limit to the opportunities for corporate
advertising in the new century. Companies already are abuzz with
plans for sponsoring the great events of the next hundred years.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the millennial stock market crash. Of course the Big
Blowout may not strike for several years yet. The froth in the
market could long outlive the Korbel bubbles of the year 2000
celebration. After all, investors aren't yet convinced that stocks
are overpriced. For example, Amazon.com climbed above $360 from $24
last year, without earning a penny.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Big Blowout does hit, sponsors intend to swoop in
for a golden advertising opportunity. Already on board: Kleenex,
the official tissue of the sobbing masses. The World Psychiatric
Association also has paid a hefty sponsorship fee. Its jingle: If
You Believe This Blowout is Just Another Buying Opportunity, Please
Have a Seat on the Couch _ You're Delusional.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000 computer bug is also attracting sponsors. Of
course, no giant computer or software company has rushed forward to
emblazon its name on this looming high-tech meltdown. Instead,
nontechnology companies are seizing the chance to elbow into the
forefront again at long last. The Y2K official sponsor is the Dixon
No. 2 pencil. Jingle: If You'd Only Stuck With Us, Geek.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also are storming ahead with plans to sponsor the next
inevitable war with Iraq. What business wouldn't want to bask in
the reflected patriotic glory of another thumping of the dictator
Saddam?
</P>
<P>
   Though the chest-pounding in Baghdad is getting louder by the
minute, it could still be sometime in the next century before
American troops are again marching through the sand. Nonetheless,
the bidding for sponsorships is already intense. Leading the pack
is Caterpillar, the earthmoving and construction machinery company.
Clearly it is a perfect candidate to sponsor the next desert war _
especially if Iraq emerges in ruins. The Caterpillar jingle: Nation
Builders From the Rubble Up.
</P>
<P>
   In an inspired bit of product promotion, Cheetos has also paid
handsomely to be an official sponsor of the coming US-Iraq clash.
Certainly it's just as seemly for the cheesy snack to cash in on

NOW DAVIS HAS TO WALK CENTER LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A day after declaring he will govern
``neither from the right nor from the left,'' Gov. Gray Davis'
inaugural rhetoric now gives way to a more difficult task: proving
he can make the hard choices of governing from his centrist perch.
</P>
<P>
   Those choices will become apparent this week when Davis puts
substance to his administration during his first State of the State
address Wednesday and the release of the state budget Friday.
</P>
<P>
   And, with those on the liberal left and conservative right
poised to pounce, Davis, the state's first Democratic governor in
16 years, may need to heed the words of populist and former Texas
Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower, who said, ``The only thing
in the middle of the road are yellow stripes and dead armadillos.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, including former Gov. Pete Wilson, wished Davis
luck Monday as he began his term as California's 37th governor. But
GOP leaders will take a harder line as Davis lays out his policy
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans alike will be closely watching the
budget unveiling Friday _ especially with the state facing a
projected $2 billion to $3 billion shortfall. Will Davis grant tax
cuts? Raise the cost-of-living adjustment for welfare recipients?
Give state workers a pay raise?
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that, on Friday, we're going to get a glimpse
into what kind of governor Gray Davis is going to be,'' said state
Sen. Jim Brulte, a Republican from Rancho Cucamonga, near Los
Angeles. ``He campaigned as a moderate, and his speech was clearly
moderate in tone, but on Friday he has to present his budget, which
is a concrete document that expresses his priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Davis' inaugural speech was short on details, it clearly
expressed the moderate path he intends to take. But political
analysts warn of the main pitfall of positioning yourself in the
center: you take heat from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Davis administration officials know they have more to fear than
Republican opposition. Liberal Democrats wonder just how centrist
he intends to be, and whether he'll block progressive initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is going to have to veto some things,'' said
state Assemblywoman Carole Migden, a Democrat from San Francisco
and chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee. ``We're certainly
not going to have this protective shield to prevent him from taking
action. But I think we don't want to try to embarrass him or get
too wild-eyed or get more ambitious on ideas he may want to roll
out in years three or four.''
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic Chair Art Torres praised Davis' attempt to
steer a course between the two parties. ``The best place to govern
is from the center, because that's where the people of California
are,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural speech, Davis stressed themes of unity and
diversity, drawing fawning applause from a diverse crowd that
included veterans, teachers, Native American leaders, and many
African American and Latino politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through his speech, he declared the ``era of wedge
politics'' over _ a pointed stab at Wilson and his support of
anti-affirmative action and anti-illegal immigration measures.
While all the political leaders and Davis supporters on stage rose
for a raucous ovation, Wilson, a tight grin on his face, stayed
seated with his wife, Gayle.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Davis vowed to carry out several campaign
promises: He will sign a new assault weapon ban. He will allow the
top 4 percent of students in every high school to go to the
University of California system. He will extend a moratorium on
undeveloped offshore oil leases. He will veto any new restrictions
on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis did not reveal details about his plans to fix the
state's public schools _ touted as his top priority _ except to say
he seeks a ``higher expectation approach'' and wants new
accountability measures.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans have applauded Davis' moderate rhetoric,
many have been alarmed by Davis' appointments, especially his
choice of two former Jerry Brown officials _ Mary Nichols and
Winston Hickox _ who will head the Resources and Environmental
Protection agencies, respectively. Skeptics have also questioned
Davis' pick of San Francisco Supervisor Jose Medina, a former
community activist with little transportation background, to be
director of California Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sounding like a moderate in his speeches, but what is
interesting is that his administration isn't looking very
moderate,'' said GOP political analyst Tony Quinn.

CONGRESS'S TWISTED PRIORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- It at least meets the minimal requirements for
farce that an impeachment that had to be marketed as not really
impeachment should now be followed by a trial that wouldn't really
be a trial.
</P>
<P>
   And that farce ought to be minimally tolerable for the rest of
the country because it is Congress's problem, not necessarily of
importance to people who have real lives.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the political forces obsessed with President Clinton
are attempting to arrange things so that a president can't be
president because of Congress's inability to deal with its problem
_ an impeachment case that can't be made or even presented without
transforming the Republican Senate into a sibling of the Republican
House.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic tip of this iceberg is the suggestion that the
president should not be allowed to present his policy agenda to
Congress and the country from the well of the House in two weeks
simply because Congress might still be wrestling with procedural
absurdities involving a possible Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable twisting of logic and fact, one of the early,
bipartisan Senate maneuverers, Slade Gorton, Republican of
Washington, says it would be ``unseemly and distracting'' for the
president to present the State of the Union message in these
circumstances. Unseemly and distracting for whom?
</P>
<P>
   Another maneuverer, Bob Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey,
suggests postponement on the absurd grounds that without a
resolution the state of the union will be ``unclear.'' To whom?
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon's principal maneuvering collaborator for the moment,
Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, is much closer to what
matters to the country when he warns that Jan. 19 may be the
drop-dead date after which the same partisan stain that soiled the
House last month will begin to spread over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why President Clinton would be nuts,
constitutionally as well as politically, to follow a nonimpeachment
impeachment and a nontrial trial with acquiescence to any effort to
make him a nonpresident president.
</P>
<P>
   The first political rule of his office is that no incumbent
should ever sink to the level of a dysfunctional Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That also happens to be where the country is: appalled at what
is going on here and insistent that their concerns be addressed. If
push comes to shove, Democratic leader Dick Gephardt should arrange
a big show for Clinton in his St. Louis district, and the president
should deliver his State of the Union there.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the latest maneuvering lurks the political agenda of the
right, who would subvert what was designed to be a rare, solemn,
consensus-driven constitutional process one last way. Just as
impeachment was dumbed down to censure-plus in the House, and just
as a nontrial trial looms in the Senate, so removal from office via
conviction is to be replaced by forced resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, the House impeachment vote in December was
supposed to be accompanied by a vigorous resignation movement. That
was short-circuited by the bombing of Iraq, a demonstration of
Clinton's incumbency that was so obvious and powerful that it has
become part of right as well as left conspiracy lore.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks later, his In Box is stuffed with important
material that the last, more Republican Congress couldn't handle:
HMO abuses, school-construction financing, campaign-finance reform,
long-term restructuring for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, the country got a better look at the president's
proposal to use targeted tax credits to help two million families
cope with the nightmare of long-term care of seriously ill
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Every day Clinton spends pushing this stuff not only responds to
people's concerns but demonstrates that the president remains
committed to governing while others want all wheels to stop
turning. And it keeps resignation from gaining a political foothold
via Clinton's own inactivity. Above all, an assertive president is
essential for the complex, delicate tasks required to help manage a
fragile international economy.
</P>
<P>
   Removing a president was designed to be so difficult that only
national consensus could lead Congress to do it. If Clinton does
his duty, this cannot be accomplished through the back door of
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the interest groups on the right and aggressive
House Republicans with their Hail Mary recovery strategy _ a real
Senate trial, complete with live witnesses, that gradually either
persuades or wears down public opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But this is precisely the trial that many Senate Republicans
fear (and most Democrats hope) will transform them in the public's
view into the House impeachment mob _ to no end beyond their
deserved embarrassment and condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why all this is for the moment Congress's
self-created problem.
</P>
<P>
   The president should let the Senate wrestle with it, minimizing
his own involvement with the maneuvering and maximizing his public
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   He should give a State of the Union address in two weeks and,
more important, let his own priorities speak volumes about
Congress's.

THEY'VE EARNED THIS MAN'S VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Eclipse Award ballot is due Tuesday. Here's how one turf
writer voted:
</P>
<P>
   --Horse of the Year: Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away went over the hill in his last two races, but the
seven straight he won from February through September (including
five Grade I events) clinched it for him. Awesome Again won all six
of his starts, including the Breeders' Cup Classic, but he didn't
begin his season until May and didn't do enough. Silver Charm could
have beaten Skip Away for this award had he won the Classic, but
Awesome Again outfinished him. Skip Away should have been Horse of
the Year last year, too.
</P>
<P>
   --Two-year-old Colt: Answer Lively.
</P>
<P>
   Answer Lively ran a nice race as the favorite to capture the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile for his fourth win in seven starts. In a
less-than-stellar year for 2-year-old males, that was good enough.
No Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner ever has won the Kentucky Derby,
and no 2-year-old champion has won the Derby since Spectacular Bid
in 1979. Don't expect Answer Lively to break that double jinx. His
dam, Twosies Answer, used to run in New England and was strictly a
sprinter. Exploit captured all four of his races and, as a son of
Storm Cat, is a Derby contender. However, he did not start until
August and did not win a Grade I race.
</P>
<P>
   --Two-year-old Filly: Silverbulletday.
</P>
<P>
   Now we're talking. She took the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies,
running faster than the boys in the Juvenile Colts, and won six of
her seven starts. This is a serious racehorse, and the big problem
for trainer Bob Baffert, who also has Exploit, will be coming up
with a reason to put her in the Kentucky Oaks instead of the Derby.
Excellent Meeting, a stablemate of Silverbulletday, chased her home
in the Breeders' Cup and is probably the second-best 2-year-old
filly, bestowing upon Baffert, who also trains the returning Silver
Charm, an embarrassment of riches.
</P>
<P>
   --Three-year-old Colt: Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet came within a nose of becoming the first Triple Crown
winner since Affirmed in 1978. He did not race again after Victory
Gallop nipped him in the Belmont, but, after such an effort in the
Famed Triad, so what? Victory Gallop had a shot at the title but
did not win after the Belmont. Coronado's Quest made a run, winning
five straight including the Haskell and Travers, but lost his last
three. And, as if enough isn't enough, Real Quiet is trained by
Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   --Three-year-old Filly: Banshee Breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze lost the Breeders' Cup Distaff by a nose to
5-year-old Escena. She won three straight Grade I races, beating
older horses in the Spinster, and finished with an outstanding mark
of 10-6-2-2. Anyone who votes for Jersey Girl, winner of all seven
of her starts, including three Grade I contests in succession, will
not hear any criticism from this voter. However, she did not race
after Aug. 1 because of a leg fracture, never faced older horses,
and six of her victories were at a mile or less.
</P>
<P>
   --Male Turf: Buck's Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Buck's Boy went wire-to-wire to tally in the Breeders' Cup Turf.
Almost impossible to catch if attaining an easy lead, Buck's Boy
also won the Grade I Turf Classic at Belmont and the Hong Kong
Jockey Club, a Grade I in Canada. With a record of 10-6-2-1, Buck's
Boy stands out.
</P>
<P>
   --Female Turf: Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   This is the only category that the Breeders' Cup doesn't help
decide, and that has been corrected by the creation of the
Breeders' Cup Filly and Mare Turf, which will be introduced for
this year's running. The key race for turf fillies was the Yellow
Ribbon at Santa Anita Nov. 8, which brought together the best of
the lady grass runners, and Fiji prevailed with ease to run her
record to six wins in seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   --Sprinter: Reraise.
</P>
<P>
   Reraise whistled to victory in the Breeders' Cup Sprint. Before
that, he won the Kentucky Cup Sprint, a Grade II test, at Turfway
Park by 12 lengths. He won four of five starts and finished second
in his only loss.
</P>
<P>
   --Handicap Male: Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   --Handicap Female: Escena.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to winning the Breeders' Cup, Escena, a noted
front-runner, seized Grade I victories at Oaklawn and Hollywood and
earned a 9-5-3-0 record. She ran a very game race against a very
tough opponent, odds-on choice Banshee Breeze, to win the Breeders'
Cup. Sharp Cat was terrific, winning all four of her starts with
ease, but she had a nervous attack while training for the Breeders'
Cup and was scratched. Again, a vote for Sharp Cat is beyond
rebuke, but she just didn't compete enough to get the nod.
</P>
<P>
   --Steeplechase: Flat Top.
</P>
<P>
   Flat Top won three straight to end the season, including the
Grade I Grand National, which is sponsored by the Breeders' Cup, at
Fair Hill and the $100,000 Colonial Cup at Camden. It is no leap of
faith to say he is the best of the jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   --Outstanding Jockey: Gary Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to believe, but Stevens is in the Hall of Fame
without ever having won an Eclipse Award. He doesn't ride as much
as the other top riders, but this year he led the standings with
$19 million. Pat Day and Jerry Bailey, both of whom accept far more
mounts, each won $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Outstanding Apprentice Jockey: Shaun Bridgmohan.
</P>
<P>
   Riding in top company at New York, he had the most victories,
174, and earned the most purse money, more than $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Trainer: Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Who else can it be? In addition to training all of the fine
steeds mentioned above, he dominated the standings with $15 million
in purses.
</P>
<P>
   --Owner: Frank Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   Owner of Awesome Again, Stronach enjoyed a fine year as his
stable won 92 races and topped the charts with nearly $7 million in
earnings.

   &UR; FOCUS: CHRISTIANITY AT 2000: &LR;  (Available by 2 p.m., Fri., Jan. 8) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mideast Christians are a divided lot, economically and
geographically. And although they are a minority, it would be wrong
to underestimate their endurance.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: LORD'S LANGUAGE: The Syrian Orthodox Christian community
is so small that observers question whether its traditions will
continue to exist.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TIMELINE: Graphic showing a look at events from A.D. 44
through A.D. 100.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: HISPANIC ROCK: &LR;  (Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Jan. 7)
</P>
<P>
   An explosive new wave of Latin-influenced groups is poised to
take pop music's language barrier by storm.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: GRAMMY: Report/commentary on Grammy nominees announced
Tuesday morning. Surprises and sure things. Reaction, quotes from
industry. Awards ceremony is scheduled for Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: ``How Stella Got her Groove Back''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: Bloque, ``Bloque''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL: HOLY LAND: &LR;  The celebrations surrounding the approach of
the Year 2000 will put the spotlight on a small Middle Eastern town
seen by many as the cradle of Christianity. During 1999, tourists
from throughout the world will flock to Israel to visit the Holy
Land. Here are some of the most popular sites in the Old City of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: If the return to space by John Glenn and
the start of construction of the international space station has
put you in the mood for space travel, a new exhibition in Chicago
may be a good first stop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD: OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER: &LR;  Oysters Rockefeller is an American
classic. Maybe it's the name, based on the richness of a
Rockefeller. If the measure of a classic dish is that it endures,
this one meets the test. When you flipped the calendar to 1999, the
dish turned 100 years old. Though it was created in New Orleans,
hundreds of chefs have left their mark on the dish over the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: COOKING WITH LIDIA: Lidia Bastianich is cooking Sunday
lunch in Julia Child's kitchen and it's hard to tell which of the
women is more excited. ``Lidia's Italian Table,'' a 26-part public
television series, will begin airing Jan. 9 on PBS. A companion
book, ``Lidia's Italian Table'' (William Morrow), was published
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: The Internet ensures that a cook who surfs the
Web will never be without inspiration for a menu, a solution to a
problem or an idea for a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: NUTRITION: No matter the reason or the particular diet
philosophy you plan to follow, there's one dietary goal that's good
for everyone: Eat more fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEELS: &LR;  Buying an Acura 3.2 TL sedan gets a little easier and more
affordable for 1999. Completely redesigned, the midsize sedan is
now equipped with most of its former options as standard equipment
and is priced at more than $5,000 less than a comparably equipped
'98 model.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: PROFILE: Acura 3.2 TL. Facts about Acura's 3.2 TL.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: THE MECHANIC: Your car gives you a couple of ``I need
brakes'' warning signs before the brakes get to the dangerous point
and can't stop the car anymore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: &LR;  Desktop pilots have three new flight
simulators to consider for hair-raising airborne excitement. These
state-of-the-art computer programs offer near-photographic scenery
of the European countryside and remarkable cockpit re-creations of
a half-dozen famed planes.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: We have laws to help when our Lincoln is a
lemon. But when our Microsoft Windows doesn't work, we have to rely
on toll-free help desks and on-line advice. A book, ``Bad Software:
What to Do When Software Fails,'' brings consumer rights to the
Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: DVD-ROM: IBM has entered the field of DVD-ROMs with World
Book Discoveries, a massive encyclopedia devoted to the student of
history and, more or less incidentally, to the student of Gallic
software design.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: You have a brand-new computer, fully equipped
with enough RAM memory to run a respectable space program and with
the fastest analog modem money can buy. But using the Web is still
like running in mud. Here are some ways to get more from what you
already have to speed up your Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS: &LR;  Sad, sad, sad. Tracing what seems a grand and irrevocable
arc through an American life that, finally, became an American
tragedy, music historian Peter Guralnick has produced the second
half of his colossal biography of Elvis Presley. To read it _ to
ride that downward spiral as the pure unleashed icon devolves into
a drugged-up, constipated kitsch machine _ is to marvel. And to
mourn.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: MONROE: It's hard to imagine another book about
screen idol Marilyn Monroe. What could possibly be new about the
troubled, talented sexpot? Incredibly, though, this biography by
meticulous researcher Barbara Leaming (``Katharine Hepburn,''
``Orson Welles'') actually sheds new light on the life, career and
death of one of America's most enigmatic screen actresses.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: COEN: Wacky extremes pervade Ethan Coen's often
funny, sometimes disturbing collection, ``Gates of Eden'' _ just as
they do the films he makes with his brother, Joel, among the better
of which are ``Blood Simple,'' ``Miller's Crossing'' and the
superlative ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: AMIS: Kingsley Amis is something of a renegade
from that contentious tribe of linguistic experts. A noted novelist
who once taught English at Cambridge, he was also once a
journalist. But in his posthumously published ``The King's
English,'' Amis often scoffs at rules loved by newspaper
glossocrats and ``parlor grammarians.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH: FOOD POISONING ALERT: &LR;  Nearly a year after the
U.S. Department of Agriculture handed over many of its food
monitoring tasks to the meat and poultry industry, there has been a
sharp rise in reports of meat products contaminated with a deadly
strain of E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: LIVER: Liver transplants between parents and children have
been done since the late 1980s. But in the past couple of months, a
few select transplant teams across the nation are also reporting
success in the far more difficult adult-to-adult transplants.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEALTH BRIEFS: Using fertility drugs is expensive and
time-consuming. It can lead to painful frustration and unsettling
intrusion in the bedroom. But it doesn't have to carry the risk of
delivering a litter of children.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOCUS: CHRISTIANITY AT 2000: &LR;  (Available by 2 p.m., Fri., Jan. 8) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mideast Christians are a divided lot, economically and
geographically. And although they are a minority, it would be wrong
to underestimate their endurance.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: LORD'S LANGUAGE: The Syrian Orthodox Christian community
is so small that observers question whether its traditions will
continue to exist.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TIMELINE: Graphic showing a look at events from A.D. 44
through A.D. 100.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT: HISPANIC ROCK: &LR;  (Available by 2 p.m., Thu., Jan. 7)
</P>
<P>
   An explosive new wave of Latin-influenced groups is poised to
take pop music's language barrier by storm.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: GRAMMY: Report/commentary on Grammy nominees announced
Tuesday morning. Surprises and sure things. Reaction, quotes from
industry. Awards ceremony is scheduled for Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: VIDEO REVIEWS: ``How Stella Got her Groove Back''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CD REVIEWS: Bloque, ``Bloque''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL: HOLY LAND: &LR;  The celebrations surrounding the approach of
the Year 2000 will put the spotlight on a small Middle Eastern town
seen by many as the cradle of Christianity. During 1999, tourists
from throughout the world will flock to Israel to visit the Holy
Land. Here are some of the most popular sites in the Old City of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL BRIEFS: If the return to space by John Glenn and
the start of construction of the international space station has
put you in the mood for space travel, a new exhibition in Chicago
may be a good first stop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FOOD: OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER: &LR;  Oysters Rockefeller is an American
classic. Maybe it's the name, based on the richness of a
Rockefeller. If the measure of a classic dish is that it endures,
this one meets the test. When you flipped the calendar to 1999, the
dish turned 100 years old. Though it was created in New Orleans,
hundreds of chefs have left their mark on the dish over the
decades.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: COOKING WITH LIDIA: Lidia Bastianich is cooking Sunday
lunch in Julia Child's kitchen and it's hard to tell which of the
women is more excited. ``Lidia's Italian Table,'' a 26-part public
television series, will begin airing Jan. 9 on PBS. A companion
book, ``Lidia's Italian Table'' (William Morrow), was published
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: CYBERSPICE: The Internet ensures that a cook who surfs the
Web will never be without inspiration for a menu, a solution to a
problem or an idea for a recipe.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: NUTRITION: No matter the reason or the particular diet
philosophy you plan to follow, there's one dietary goal that's good
for everyone: Eat more fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHEELS: &LR;  Buying an Acura 3.2 TL sedan gets a little easier and more
affordable for 1999. Completely redesigned, the midsize sedan is
now equipped with most of its former options as standard equipment
and is priced at more than $5,000 less than a comparably equipped
'98 model.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: PROFILE: Acura 3.2 TL. Facts about Acura's 3.2 TL.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: THE MECHANIC: Your car gives you a couple of ``I need
brakes'' warning signs before the brakes get to the dangerous point
and can't stop the car anymore.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: &LR;  Desktop pilots have three new flight
simulators to consider for hair-raising airborne excitement. These
state-of-the-art computer programs offer near-photographic scenery
of the European countryside and remarkable cockpit re-creations of
a half-dozen famed planes.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH BRIEFS: We have laws to help when our Lincoln is a
lemon. But when our Microsoft Windows doesn't work, we have to rely
on toll-free help desks and on-line advice. A book, ``Bad Software:
What to Do When Software Fails,'' brings consumer rights to the
Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: DVD-ROM: IBM has entered the field of DVD-ROMs with World
Book Discoveries, a massive encyclopedia devoted to the student of
history and, more or less incidentally, to the student of Gallic
software design.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: You have a brand-new computer, fully equipped
with enough RAM memory to run a respectable space program and with
the fastest analog modem money can buy. But using the Web is still
like running in mud. Here are some ways to get more from what you
already have to speed up your Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS: &LR;  Sad, sad, sad. Tracing what seems a grand and irrevocable
arc through an American life that, finally, became an American
tragedy, music historian Peter Guralnick has produced the second
half of his colossal biography of Elvis Presley. To read it _ to
ride that downward spiral as the pure unleashed icon devolves into
a drugged-up, constipated kitsch machine _ is to marvel. And to
mourn.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: MONROE: It's hard to imagine another book about
screen idol Marilyn Monroe. What could possibly be new about the
troubled, talented sexpot? Incredibly, though, this biography by
meticulous researcher Barbara Leaming (``Katharine Hepburn,''
``Orson Welles'') actually sheds new light on the life, career and
death of one of America's most enigmatic screen actresses.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: COEN: Wacky extremes pervade Ethan Coen's often
funny, sometimes disturbing collection, ``Gates of Eden'' _ just as
they do the films he makes with his brother, Joel, among the better
of which are ``Blood Simple,'' ``Miller's Crossing'' and the
superlative ``Fargo.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: AMIS: Kingsley Amis is something of a renegade
from that contentious tribe of linguistic experts. A noted novelist
who once taught English at Cambridge, he was also once a
journalist. But in his posthumously published ``The King's
English,'' Amis often scoffs at rules loved by newspaper
glossocrats and ``parlor grammarians.''
</P>
<P>
   WITH: N.Y. TIMES BEST SELLERS LIST
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH: FOOD POISONING ALERT: &LR;  Nearly a year after the
U.S. Department of Agriculture handed over many of its food
monitoring tasks to the meat and poultry industry, there has been a
sharp rise in reports of meat products contaminated with a deadly
strain of E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: LIVER: Liver transplants between parents and children have
been done since the late 1980s. But in the past couple of months, a
few select transplant teams across the nation are also reporting
success in the far more difficult adult-to-adult transplants.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HEALTH BRIEFS: Using fertility drugs is expensive and
time-consuming. It can lead to painful frustration and unsettling
intrusion in the bedroom. But it doesn't have to carry the risk of
delivering a litter of children.

MCCAIN HAS CASE FOR CHARACTER  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE JAN. 5 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - John McCain remembers a time when parents wanted their
children to grow up to become president. It really wasn't all that
long ago. But after countless scandals and the tawdry conduct about
which President Clinton has lied, politics is one of the last
callings a lot of parents would wish on their child.
</P>
<P>
   In setting his sights on a likely run for the Republican
presidential nomination, the Arizona senator wants, among other
things, to restore the humble respect that Americans once held for
the office. Some may remember that Ronald Reagan viewed the
presidency with such respect that he dressed formally and never
took off his coat while in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Friday to a national gathering of about 300 Republicans
in Phoenix, McCain asked the audience to consider not whether they
are personally better off than a few years ago, but whether they
are as proud of the country. For many, the answer is obvious. But
is this a theme that will play with the American public if McCain
officially seeks the presidency?
</P>
<P>
   With the public giving an impeached Clinton an approval rating
approaching 70 percent, it's hard to discern a boiling national
outrage that McCain can tap. Republicans are angered by Clinton's
character flaws and behavior, but the rest of the country doesn't
seem to equate character _ or the lack of it _ with the ability to
lead. Even McCain admits that he is baffled by Clinton's political
popularity while at the same time the public holds the president's
personal character in low esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with his public and military service, including
having spent more than five years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
McCain can make a strong case for character. The former naval
aviator has also built a reputation in the Senate as a maverick by
taking the lead on such issues as tobacco legislation and
campaign-finance reform. However, these last issues have not
endeared McCain to some conservatives, who think the government
should keep its hands off the tobacco industry and campaign
spending.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is on solid ground with fellow Republicans in
attacking the Clinton administration for its confused foreign
policy. McCain, more than most, also can make the case for not just
more, but effective, military spending. He rails against pork
barrel spending that results in billions wasted on the continued
production of unwanted C-130 cargo planes and submarines while
10,000 military families survive on food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also hits the right notes with Republicans with his calls
for limited government, freedom, free markets and a fairer and
flatter income tax. McCain's formal entry into the presidential
race would be a welcome development, providing Republicans with a
clear, sometimes unconventional voice and Arizona some national
recognition. But such a move would also subject McCain to renewed
scrutiny into his efforts, along with four other senators, to help
Phoenix businessman Charles H Keating Jr. in his battle with
federal regulators in the savings and loan scandal of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also is faced with the huge task of raising, by one
estimate, $60,000 a day to mount a viable campaign. The money
figures to come easier for such potential Republican contenders as
Texas Gov. George W. Bush and millionaire publisher Steve Forbes.
Other possible candidates include former Vice President Dan Quayle,
who now lives in Phoenix, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander,
and Elizabeth Dole, who stepped down yesterday as president of the
American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Since the next Republican nominee may well come from this group,
it's not too early for party members to begin asking which
candidate stands for the right issues and is electable. &QL;

TIME HAS COME FOR MILLENNIUM CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Richard Landes thinks people had a perfectly reasonable
response to his Center for Millennial Studies when it came into
being in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those few who even knew we existed, we looked kooky,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when he proposed the project to his bosses at Boston
University, where he is a professor of medieval history, Landes
recalls that they told him: ``It's OK if you want to do this, but
don't say you're at BU.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the countdown to 2000 begins in earnest, the Center for
Millennial Studies is all the rage. Media outlets from around the
world call for interviews, computer enthusiasts bookmark its Web
site (www.mille.org) for updates on the Y2K bug, and researchers
increasingly turn to the center for information about the
end-of-century proliferation of survivalists, conspiracy theorists,
UFO sighters, and religious zealots who are preparing for the
impending apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and last summer Landes and his band of young employees were
invited to move from their cramped quarters in Brookline into a
rent-free, three-room office on the BU campus. They do run the
Center for Millennial Studies at Boston University, after all.
</P>
<P>
   The center has come a long way in a short time. While other
academics and organizations are studying specific social,
technological, or religious issues surrounding the new millennium's
approach, the operation on Commonwealth Avenue appears to have
become the most extensive and ambitious anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Its stated intent is to provide analysis about current events
and compare them to previous millennial changes and, most
important, to create a comprehensive archive that will allow
scholars in the future to obtain specific data about a period that
already is drawing more interest by the day from educators,
journalists, and historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to start a new field, like sociology,'' says
Beth Forrest, 28, the center's program coordinator. ``We're trying
to create a lens through which we can look at events and connect
them more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the place where, in the next few years and far
beyond, anyone who wants information about what occurred will look
in our computers, at our files,'' adds Landes, whose passion for
his new mission mirrors that of some of the people he studies.
</P>
<P>
   In December Landes, 49, traveled to Jerusalem to spend New
Year's Eve at Temple Mount, interviewing a group of fundamentalist
Jews awaiting the arrival of the Messiah. He plans to be in
Jerusalem as often as his budget will allow in the coming year,
because he thinks it will be ground zero of religious millennial
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he says he will be in the holy city on Dec. 31,
1999, when he expects tens of thousands of pilgrims from all over
the world will converge to await salvation, destruction, the
arrival of celestial beings, the second coming of Christ,
Armageddon, or some other tumultuous permutation of apocalyptic
visions.
</P>
<P>
   Religion _ mainly Christianity, but other faiths as well _ is
one of two subjects that pervade millennial study. Many religious
zealots, and an array of more mainstream believers, attach great
significance to the arrival of the 21st century, though they don't
seem to agree on what exactly will happen.
</P>
<P>
   The second dominant theme, which Landes predicts will eclipse
President Clinton's impeachment trial as the major news event of
the coming year, is Y2K, the term coined to describe many
computers' inability to deal with dates after Dec. 31, 1999. Some
observers, including serious programmers, warn of widespread social
disruption as utilities, banks, and other essential services
collapse if the problem isn't repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Landes and his colleagues are tracking some extreme folks. Like
the ones in Indonesia who are hunting out witches to prevent them
from doing any millennial mischief, or the ones in the American
West who believe Y2K is an omen that the earth is nearing its end,
its destruction to come at the hands of aliens sent by God to
punish humanity for ruining the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the center's time is spent on more concrete matters,
however.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Landes says he hopes his research will persuade
municipalities, businesses, and individuals to take the Y2K problem
even more seriously than some already do. And he says the center's
monitoring of religious organizations could serve as an early
warning system against violence, anti-Semitism, and other negative
responses that he expects among some who will be dispirited and
angry if their expectations aren't realized in the new century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointment is the big black box in millennium studies,''
says Landes, who bases this assessment on his study of previous
millennial movements. ``I don't know how widespread, obviously, but
there's a good possibility that there will be scapegoating,
paranoia, violence, all sorts of things. If you think it's your
moment, and God is on your side, the letdown could be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest to the center are those who function at
the intersection of religious millennialism and the Y2K problem.
They include small groups with fanatical views who are making
arrangements to survive the chaos that a systemic computer failure
could bring, as well as clerics with large followings who see great
portent in the timing of high-tech's potential meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, for instance, has produced a video
(available for $28) on which he says that ``Y2K may be God's
instrument to shake this nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He preaches that the consequence could be a worldwide revival
preceding ``the Rapture of the Church,'' and adds that he
``wouldn't be a bit surprised'' if the Lord descended in 2000. Some
evangelical Christians believe the Rapture is when Christ returns
to Earth to take the redeemed to heaven, leaving all others to
suffer with the Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the center foresee more discussion of this sort,
some of it in mainstream churches, as the millennium draws closer.
They say that's partly because people's imaginations _ and behavior
_ will be affected by the mysteries and possibilities that 2000
evokes, but also because of heightened media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just such a huge symbol that it's easy to get attention
by hanging anything you want onto it,'' said David Kessler, 32, the
center's executive administrator. ``The more news there is about
it, the more people seem to want to do something, anything, in
response.''
</P>
<P>
   The center is in three connected rooms that could be mistaken
for a dorm suite, if they had more furniture. It is filled with
overflowing boxes, wall posters, aging office equipment, and an
enthusiastic young staff. It sometimes seems to function less like
a specialized repository for select segments of history than the
scholarly equivalent of a vacuum cleaner, sucking in anything and
everything that might be pertinent and filing it away for some
unspecified use in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material the half-dozen employees accumulate comes
in the form of newspaper clippings about topics as diverse as
modern fashion, magic, and ``environmental doom,'' along with
videotapes, Internet postings, pamphlets, and other literature
produced by religious sects, survivalists, conspiracy theorists,
and others who link their activities to the turn of the centuries.
Landes and his colleagues also periodically travel around the
country (and sometimes the world, as budgets allow) conducting
their own interviews to add to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Landes opened the center's doors with a grant from the Franklin
Mint (for which he works as a consultant), and it has since
received support from BU, the Lily Endowment for the Arts, the Open
Society Institute, the Massachusetts Endowment for the Humanities,
and individual contributors. Officials say they operate on a
shoestring budget, and soliciting funding clearly is an ongoing
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Landes conceived of the center while driving on a Los Angeles
freeway in 1994 with Steven O'Leary, a communications professor at
the University of Southern California who had just published a
book, ``Arguing the Apocalypse: A Theory of Millennial Rhetoric.''
The two friends turned their idea into reality when they raised
enough money two years later; though they decided to place their
headquarters in Boston, O'Leary still works with Landes from the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to maintaining a voluminous and entertaining Web
site, the center publishes a quarterly newsletter, hosts a monthly
discussion group, runs periodic educational programs, and sponsors
an annual conference. The last one, in Boston last month, indicated
that millennial scholars can maintain their sense of humor while
tackling momentous issues. Seminars were given titles like ``Dating
and the Millennial Imagination,'' and ``Christians Who Kill, and
the Women Who Love Them.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the grants keep coming, Landes hopes his brainchild
will thrive long after he moves on to other projects. In any case,
he figures operations will continue at least two more years _ since
the new millennium technically begins Jan. 1, 2001, notwithstanding
the popular conception that it starts in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the center already is planning its conference for 2002.
The tentative title: ``Disappointed Millennialism.''

MEEHAN MAY EXCEED TERM LIMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ What's wrong with this political picture?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while many of his congressional colleagues were
relaxing in warmer climes, Representative Martin T. Meehan held a
fund-raiser at the Lowell Doubletree Hotel, where he collected
$38,000 to add to his $1.1 million campaign war chest.
</P>
<P>
   But for what? When he ran for Congress in 1992, Meehan pandered
to the angry anti-politics of the time with a solemn pledge: If
elected, he would serve no more than four terms.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday in Washington, the 42-year-old Lowell Democrat will be
sworn in for that fourth term. Thus it would seem to be time to put
electoral politics aside, to start distributing campaign funds to
favorite charities, and to work on landing a lucrative
private-sector post.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a lame-duck congressman has no need of stockpiling
more campaign cash, particularly since a new state law prohibits
using federal campaign funds in state elections.
</P>
<P>
   Put it all together and what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   Simply this: Meehan has put his term-limits pledge on the
chopping block, and he concedes the odds are good that the ax will
fall. Pressed on his plans, the fast-talking Meehan shifts to the
slow, cautious cadence of a man searching for a path out of a
morass of his own making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made a firm decision to run again, but I am taking a
serious look at it,'' he said. ``I'm talking to people in every
section of my district to decide what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most say run, he said. But one crucial constituent still hasn't
signed off: his wife, Ellen Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to talk to Ellen about it,'' Meehan said. ``Frankly,
Ellen is leaning no, and I'm leaning yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellen, who as a candidate for the Legislature in 1992 shunned a
similar term-limits pledge, may not prove an easy sell, since she
wants her husband to explore the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has enormous potential in the private sector,'' she
said. ``Private companies would value his talent, energy, and
dedication. The public sector can be a pretty thankless arena.''
</P>
<P>
   What's at stake for Meehan is whether to give up a high-profile
perch that would make it easier to launch a gubernatorial bid in
2002. A quiet legislative move in November that cut him off from
using his congressional funds for a state campaign makes holding
that post all the more important. In a reelection bid next year,
Meehan could legitimately spend heavily on Boston television ads
that would pay statewide benefits, much as Representative Joseph
Kennedy did in 1996 in a race against a nonentity.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what the family council decides, Meehan now rues
his 1992 pledge. ``Arbitrarily limiting myself to eight years was a
mistake,'' he said. ``I am obviously more effective today than I
was when I arrived. And my district would be better off with a
member of Congress who utilizes his or her seniority to the
advantage of the district.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at national trends, Meehan sees numerous reasons to
stick around. ``I have been part of the minority party for the last
four years, and finally I think the Democrats are going to take
back the House in 2000,'' he said. If so, he would have the
opportunity for real progress on his pet issues of tobacco and
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Being in the majority would let him do more for Massachusetts,
Meehan asserted, noting that he would probably win a subcommittee
chairmanship on the House's National Security Committee, a good
post from which to help Raytheon, the state's largest private
employer.
</P>
<P>
   By shrewdly playing the reluctant candidate ready to quit the
public stage, Meehan has all but guaranteed that if he does run
again, the district media moguls, public officials, and politicians
will hail his decision.
</P>
<P>
   As for the voters, Meehan cites a public-opinion poll he
conducted: ``Seventy-five percent of my district says I should run
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he first took the pledge, Meehan has had a high-profile
career, emerging as a national leader on two of the most highly
watched issues before Congress: campaign finance reform and
tobacco. His spot on the House Judiciary Committee made him one of
Congress's most televised figures during the recent impeachment
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   He's proven a smart fit in Washington: savvy enough to get out
in front on hot issues, independent enough to avoid becoming a
predictable partisan voice, pragmatic enough to craft alliances
with Republicans. All in all, it's the most promising start since
Paul Tsongas went to Congress in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   But what flak can Meehan expect if he does run again? Listen to
the lament of the state's zealous term-limits leader, who exacted
Meehan's pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I don't think it will hurt him, and I think he
has taken the measure of that,'' said Dorothea Vitrac, who served
as executive director of LIMITS. ``The constituency has a really
short memory, and they don't seem to put two and two together.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the man stung most by his pledge, then-Representative
Chester G. Atkins, offered aid and comfort. Despite their bitter
Democratic primary battle, in which Meehan pummeled Atkins on term
limits, the former congressman is taking a high-minded approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become a real leader in the Congress,'' said Atkins.
``He has really hit his stride, and I think that has been important
on a variety of issues for Massachusetts and the 5th District. And
I think it has been important for the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   So important, Atkins said, that he'll help Meehan weather any
political turbulence that might occur if he flipflops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he should be locked into a commitment that was
made in the heat of combat when the world has changed dramatically
since then,'' Atkins said. ``That would be a bad thing for
Massachusetts and a bad thing for Congress, and to the extent to
which he needs to hear from a variety of people that it is OK for
him to reconsider that pledge and that it is in the state's and
Congress's interest, I am happy to express that.''

<P>
   When Maureen Paul renovated her condominium a few years ago, she
created a dream spot for herself. It is a third-floor atrium framed
by windows and skylights, a glass-encased retreat that commands a
sweeping vista of neighboring rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   Paul does not sit there anymore because she is afraid she will
be murdered. That is because Maureen Paul is a doctor who performs
abortions. A petite woman with crackling blonde hair, Paul has
provided women's health care for nearly two decades without
flinching. But when she sits at the round wooden table in her
atrium she thinks of the sniper who trained his sites on Dr.
Barnett Slepian through his kitchen window in October and shot the
Buffalo doctor through the back. Now, Paul drinks her coffee facing
a brick wall in her tiny kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very, very uneasy sitting at this table,'' said Paul,
sighing as she gazed at her neighbors' eaves. ``And it really makes
me angry because, wow, this is the space I created for me. I don't
get to be home very often and so it really, really disturbs me that
I have to think about getting shot in a place I love.''
</P>
<P>
   To be a physician who performs abortions these days is to have a
job like no other. It is to pull on your bulletproof vest when you
go to Starbucks to get coffee. It is to vary your route to work
every day and to leave a car length behind the car in front of you
when you come to a stoplight, just in case. It is to have
protesters scream your name at your car window when you get to work
and to train their video cameras silently upon you when you leave.
It is to know that your children may be being watched. It is to
know that you could be next.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, 49, who practiced at the University of Massachusetts
Medical Center in Worcester for a decade before becoming medical
director of Planned Parenthood in Boston in July, is a woman not
easily frightened. But what was once a tiny trill of protest over
what she does has become an angry chorus she can no longer ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The initial grumbling could be heard in early 1995 when Paul's
name was mentioned on the Pro Life Action Line, a recorded message,
urging her to ``worry more about her immortal soul than training
abortionists.'' Soon afterwards a few pieces of antiabortion mail
showed up at her home, meaning her address was no longer secret.
When she started her current job and clinic picketers learned her
car and name, they appeared at her window screaming, ``Maureen,
Maureen! Stop killing the babies!''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, their calls reached a crescendo when Paul's name
appeared on a controversial antiabortion Web site called the
Nuremberg Files. The site, which lists health care workers' names
and locations under the heading, ``Abortionists: The Baby
Butchers,'' is regarded by many as a thinly veiled ``hit list.''
The names of those who have been killed _ seven since 1993 _ are
crossed out with a dark line. The merely wounded appear in an eerie
gray type while the rest are in black.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of Slepian, the first abortion-related killing in a
private home, sent a shudder through the nation's medical community
unlike any other act of violence in America's long-running
guerrilla warfare over abortion. In response, the US Justice
Department posted a $500,000 reward for Slepian's killer and
created a national task force to investigate abortion clinic
violence. But for Paul, who is divorced and lives alone in a Boston
neighborhood not far from her daughter, life may never be quite the
same again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a decision a long time ago that I will not stop the
work that I do. Terrorism must not be allowed to work,'' Paul said.
``But it is time for me to get my ducks in a row. Until now,
security has been episodic for me. When something happened, I
responded. Now, security must become my way of life. I am learning
to be vigilant all the time. All the time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a condition not unfamiliar to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a woman, I am no stranger to being vigilant,'' Paul added.
``But I never, never expected to have to do this because I am a
physician. That, to me, is shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a dank fall afternoon and Paul has just completed clinic
duty at Planned Parenthood's bunker-like Boston office. She has
performed 17 abortions this day, a fraction of the 9,800 abortions
done this year at the Boston and Worcester clinics. Each procedure
takes only about 10 minutes, but Paul makes a point of talking at
length with each woman. Still dressed in blue scrubs and sneakers,
a security badge clipped to her waist, she is sitting in her small
subterranean office doing paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel tired, definitely tired. But I absolutely love my
work,'' Paul said, pushing her boxy black glasses back up her nose
with a grin of enthusiasm. ``Each abortion is one woman's story and
some of those stories are difficult for them. It is really
important work to help women who have chosen to have an abortion
through that experience so that they come out the other side
feeling that they have made the best choice for their lives. It's
just wonderful to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Performing abortions is just part of the job. Paul does
abortions two days a week. Another two days a week she provides
routine gynecological care including pap smears and minor surgery.
The final day of the week is for administrative matters and
overseeing the clinic's medical staff. At night she edits a
textbook on abortion which will be released in the spring, and
works on articles. It is a small sadness to her that after
delivering hundreds of babies a year over a career of two decades,
she is no longer able to do deliveries because Planned Parenthood
does not offer obstetrical care.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is not a job for the faint of heart. Like most any ob-gyn
doctor, Paul has done occasional abortions throughout her career,
sometimes just a handful a year, sometimes more. Either way, she
received virtually no harassment from antiabortion advocates until
she started working for the clinic. Now, when Paul waits for the
electronic garage door beneath the clinic to open each morning,
protesters sometimes push their faces against her car window and
scream her name, ``and you sit there as the door slowly opens and
it is the longest 30 seconds of your life,'' Paul said. Once when
she was getting into her car parked on a street, opponents began
shouting at her from a traffic island. Paul, unable to hear them at
first, and thinking they might be friends, called a greeting back.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cotter, president of Operation Rescue in Boston, said that
Paul is not one of the doctors his group has picketed, yet. Cotter,
who made the Pro Life Action Line recording about Paul's soul, said
that what he meant was, ``Those who do abortion are seriously
jeopardizing their soul. In other words, she will probably go to
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he says he does not advocate violence against doctors,
Cotter said they should not be surprised if violence is done to
them. ``It is a consequence of what they do,'' said Cotter.
``Living in fear for their lives is a consequence of a life of
evil, of killing babies. They themselves perform the first instance
of violence by killing children and occasionally someome reacts
with violence against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many antiabortionists, in fact, condemn the slaying of Slepian
or any doctor who performs abortions and dismiss the Nuremberg Web
site as the work of an extremist. At the same time, they say
doctors should not be surprised that violence is being done to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence begets violence, we all know that,'' said Steve
Sanborn, spokesman for the American Life League, one of the largest
antiabortion lobbying groups. ``And abortion is violence. It is
violence against the most innocent human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is that abortion providers are walling themselves in.
The Planned Parenthood office in Boston, for example, which is
picketed every day that abortions are performed, is a monument to
modern security. In fact, clinic administrators selected the site
shortly after one of its receptionists and another at a different
clinic were murdered in 1994, in part because of its bunker-style
structure. All the glass is bulletproof. Black-clad guards monitor
the front entrance. Every visitor is searched and must pass through
both a metal detector and a trap sealed by locked doors. Staff wear
security badges. And that's just what they'll admit to.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... to do.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a recurring phrase in Saul Bellow's novel ``Humboldt's
Gift'': ``Finding without seeking.'' That might be the motto of
Guralnick's career. ``It's purely accidental that I wrote about
music,'' he says. He'd long wanted to be a writer _ but of fiction.
He's written a half-dozen novels, one of which, ``Nighthawk
Blues,'' was published in 1980. His coming to write about music was
a happy conjunction of missionary fervor and institutional
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was about 20 all these underground publications started
up: The Phoenix, Crawdaddy, ultimately Rolling Stone. I knew a
number of people who worked for them, and nobody was going to miss
how much I loved blues since I talked about it all the time. So
they'd say to me, `How would you like to write about Muddy Waters?
or Howlin' Wolf? or Chuck Berry? or Jerry Lee Lewis?' I just jumped
(at the chance), because they simply weren't written about. You
can't realize this today, when we almost drown in popular culture.
But at that time, you just didn't see, say, Big Joe Turner's name
in the newspaper _ or anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which rather amazes Guralnick in retrospect. ``I was just
so cripplingly shy,'' he says of his 20-year-old self, but when an
opportunity arose to interview bluesman Skip James in 1964, he knew
he couldn't refuse. He had an obligation to the music. ``It just
felt like greatness such as this will not pass my way again.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Elvis piece came three years later, in The Phoenix.
That, too, he wrote hoping to make converts. Elvis had long since
stopped being taken seriously. If Skip James's problem was too few
people having heard of him, Elvis's was too many having heard of
him. A year later, Guralnick wrote about the famed ``comeback''
special on NBC. Then, finally, in 1971 he saw Elvis in person, at
Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gotten press seats, but I didn't want to write
about it,'' Guralnick explains. ``We rode the subway in from
Chestnut Hill, my wife and I, and there we were on a streetcar
where everyone else was going to this Elvis concert, too. It was a
validation. For so long, being an Elvis fan was uncool. But here
were all these people who were excited about going. That was great,
the feeling of anticipation and eagerness everybody had. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat way off at the other end of the Garden and watched
Elvis through binoculars. It was totally exciting as a pageant. The
Garden was just taken over by this incredible enthusiasm for Elvis.
Musically, everything was taken just a little too fast, and the
only song that got to me _ as a song _ was `Funny How Time Slips
Away.' I've always loved that song, and the way he sang it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have missed the experience for the world, but I had
no impulse ever to repeat it. I would have gone back every night
for a year to hear him in the early days, but this was more about
the spectacle. By then, he had already been translated into a
symbol, and the music just took a back seat to everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting beyond symbol and spectacle is Guralnick's aim in
``Careless Love.'' (Coincidence or no, his favorite Elvis song is
``Trying to Get to You.'') That would be a difficult enough task by
itself, but it's made all the harder by the story Guralnick has to
tell, an almost unremittingly grim tale of personal and artistic
decline. ``It was a huge challenge,'' Guralnick admits, ``an
extremely different kind of challenge from (that posed by) the
first book.'' ``Last Train'' was about a triumph no one ever could
have imagined (including Elvis). ``Careless Love'' is about that
triumph's consequences, something no one would ever want to
imagine. ``It's not that he opted out. It's that he became almost
paralyzed by his fear of failure,'' Guralnick says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the aims of the narrative is to pose the suggestion
that things could have been different, and I'd keep saying to the
people I'd interview during my research, the people who'd been
around him, `Look, didn't it ever occur to you to do anything? How
could everybody just stand by and not say or do anything?' They'd
all respond the same way: `The possiblity of change was always
there. We just kept waiting for it _ for something _ to happen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Put like that, it makes sense. Elvis had come through so many
times before: inventing himself in the first place, the triumphant
return from the Army, the comeback special in '68, conquering Las
Vegas _ why couldn't he do it again? The power of his charisma was
such that everyone around him utterly deferred to it _ and believed
in it. Yet, in a sense, he was the one the most mesmerized by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick ended up devoting 11 years and two books to Elvis's
life _ he'd begun the biography assuming it would require six and
produce one. His next projects look to be more manageable: a
biography of singer Sam Cooke (``something I've been working on,
intermittently, for the last 15 years'') and the novel he had half
completed when he started the Elvis biography (``I'd like to go
back to it and see if it's worth finishing!'').
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick's commitment to the American musical past is obvious,
but he hasn't shut himself off from the sounds of today. His first
preference remains the blues _ a recent Muddy Waters collection,
``The Aristocrat of the Blues,'' has been getting a heavy workout
on his CD player _ but no genre or performer has a monopoly on his
ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty wide,'' Guralnick says of his current listening.
``My daughter taped Liz Phair's first album for me, and I thought
that was interesting. I like Lucinda Williams very much. It could
be this new Steve Earle album, a bluegrass album, which just knocks
me out. I love Peter Wolf's new album. I think Alvin Youngblood
Hart is just terrific. This Geoff Muldaur album out on HighTone.
Chris Thomas _ I'm going to do a thing with him at Passim in
February. I liked that Paul Simon album, `Capeman.' Dylan's last
album, `Time Out of Mind.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not wide in the sense that _ well, somebody like Beck or
Prince I admire, but it's not a groove I feel, though I recognize a
lot of the stuff in there. Or let's say with rap, it's not a
question of saying, `Oh, that's terrible!' I firmly believe you
can't honor the past without respecting the present. It simply
cannot be true that everything good happened back then.''

MADDENING RULES AND MILLENNIAL BUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world is filled with word watchers fighting doggedly on
behalf of doomed causes, and Sharon Stelzer is married to one of
the most steadfast, a veritable Horatius at the bridge. Her
husband, she writes, is trying to banish mad as a synonym for
angry, arguing that it really means ``insane.'' Even if this is
correct, she asks, ``Does anyone in the 1990s really refer to a
mentally unbalanced person as mad?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, your husband is _ how shall I say it? _ off his rocker.
Nutty, squirrelly, bonkers, daft, half a bubble off plumb. That
bridge he is defending was a rickety temporary structure, and it
collapsed decades ago; it's time for him to give it up and come
back to our side of the river.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, though: I'm mad at him is not exactly formal English
_ so little English is, these days _ but mad has been used this way
for a long, long time. The OED gives citations from 1300 into the
1970s, and these, of course, are only instances where mad got
written down; there's no telling how common it was among everyday
14th-century people, though probably they were as liable to
annoyances and rages as we are today.
</P>
<P>
   The Indo-European root from which mad evolved is a word meaning
``changed,'' and it's not hard to see how mad would encompass both
meanings: Rage is a sort of madness, a profound personality change,
though usually a temporary one. Furious has a similar reach,
stretching from ``angry'' to ``irrational'' _ a furious storm is
raging, but not literally angry, and the hero of ``Orlando
Furioso,'' Ariosto's 16th-century epic poem, was not furious but
raving, out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many English usages, though, mad caught the attention of
early-20th-century language commentators, and some of them decided
it was unsuitably slangy. Mad, they decreed, should be limited to
describing the insane. But that wasn't because mad was a neutral,
clinical term at the time: As a synonym for ``crazy,'' mad ``has
always had some tinge of contempt or disgust,'' says the OED, and
is ``inappropriate . . . in referring sympathetically to an insane
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, although mad can mean literally insane, we almost always
now use it hyperbolically: She's mad for cheesecake, he's mad about
you. If you tell a friend your Aunt Jean is mad as a hatter or
nutty as a fruitcake, he may think she collects rubber bands or
wears funny clothes, but he will not assume you are talking about
bipolar disorder, clinical depression, or another serious
condition.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the jobs mental health advocates have taken on
in recent decades is policing the language in an effort to reduce
the stigma of mental illness. And they have made some headway,
notably against the casual use of schizophrenic to describe someone
with conflicting views or feeling, a habit they say both
misrepresents and trivializes a serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to more general words for madness, getting us
to change our ways will be a tough sell, because all of us are
irrational some of the time, and we know it. Words like crazy and
psycho and even insane spring naturally to our lips when we're
looking for hyperbolic descriptions of one another's erratic
behavior, even if we have friends and relatives with genuine mental
illnesses and we know the difference.
</P>
<P>
   The logical solution, I think, is to reserve the clinical terms
for real mental illness, and simply admit that all the figurative
uses of crazy and mad and wacko are with us to stay; irrationality
is part of the human condition, not the exclusive province of an
unhappy minority.

   We're in for at least two years of millennium saturation _ first
from the people who'll be celebrating a year from now, then from
the dissenters who say the new millennium doesn't start till Jan.
1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But we haven't got the spelling down yet: Here's an expensive
New Year's party invitation offering a ``countdown to the
millenium,'' a common mistake surely encouraged by the malign
influence of Millenium face cream and the Mazda Millenia.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rule: You want two n's most of the time. Millennium
(from the Latin mille, thousand, and annus, year), needs both, as
do its relatives millennial and millennialist. But here's the
tricky part: Some related words _ including millenarian, a believer
in the millennium _ have only one n. Their origin is the Latin
adjective millenarius, ``made up of 1,000,'' so annus _ the source
of millennium's double n _ doesn't influence the spelling. It won't
come up often, but if you'll be wearing a party hat for New Year's
Eve 1999, you can call it millenary millinery.

   (itals)`` . . . to see how in America a fellow can start out
with nothing and, you know, make good.''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   --Elvis Presley, explaining why Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev
might want to visit Graceland, March 13, 1960
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story seemed so simple once. Dozens of quickie bios and
as-told-tos could, and did, recite it by rote.
</P>
<P>
   First he was seen as a threat: mongrel American id brought to a
roiling rock 'n' roll boil. Next, the British Invasion, and his
long sleepwalk through Hollywood, made him an irrelevance. Then
came the grotesque burlesque of his Vegas phase: the cape, the
rhinestones, the running to fat. By the time he died, in 1977, only
42, what had once seemed like a force of nature had been reduced to
supermarket-tab totem.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, Elvis Presley retains his place by the
checkout counter. This makes perfect sense, as no figure since
Abraham Lincoln has exerted such a powerful hold on the American
imagination. Love Elvis or laugh at him, he remains as ubiquitous
in death as in life. What has changed is our understanding of him.
A picture of a far more complex Elvis has emerged: both wildly
ambitious and profoundly humble, wise beyond his years and
hopelessly immature, intensely spiritual and thrillingly carnal, a
one-man musical melting pot who drew on everything from bluegrass
and gospel to Tin Pan Alley and opera in the process of doing more
than any other individual to reconfigure the sound of the second
half of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   No one has contributed more to this richer, more nuanced
understanding of Elvis than Peter Guralnick. The first LP Guralnick
owned, some 40 years ago, when he was 15, was an Elvis record. A
decade later, in 1967, he wrote about Elvis for the first time
(Guralnick sent a copy to Graceland and got a Christmas card back).
A decade after that, he supplied the Elvis chapter for ``The
Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock &AMP; Roll.'' Then in 1994
came ``Last Train to Memphis: The Rise of Elvis Presley,'' which
recounted its subject's life up to the summer of 1958, when he
entered the Army and his mother died. ``This book cancels out all
others,'' said no less an authority than Bob Dylan. Now there's the
biography's concluding volume, ``Careless Love: The Unmaking of
Elvis Presley.''
</P>
<P>
   What sets apart Guralnick's writing on American vernacular music
_ he's published books about blues, country, rockabilly, soul
music, and blues great Robert Johnson, as well as Elvis _ is more
than just its author's encyclopedic knowledge and catholicity of
taste. It's his enthusiasm for his subjects. ``I've never written
about someone whose work I don't admire,'' Guralnick says.
</P>
<P>
   It sometimes seems as if most everything written today about
popular culture consists of shameless hype or cynical putdowns.
Either way, it's all about attitude. Without any diminution of
critical intelligence, Guralnick's writing is all about
appreciation. When Colonel Tom Parker, Elvis's legendarily
tightfisted manager, complimented him on ``Last Train,'' Guralnick
could, and did, honestly reply that he'd written it out of love,
not money. (That that love is by no means unworldly is indicated by
Guralnick's eagerness to report the colonel's rejoinder: ``There's
nothin' wrong with money.'')
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick called his second book ``Lost Highway'' (1979), and
its titular road has offramps in Nashville and Memphis, Muscle
Shoals and Macon, the Mississippi Delta and the South Side of
Chicago. Yet in his reedy voice one doesn't hear the furry
consonants and elongated vowels of any of those places but rather
the clipped twang of someone born in Boston, bred in suburban
Brookline, and educated at Roxbury Latin and Boston University
(with a couple of years away at Columbia).
</P>
<P>
   If Guralnick's accent betrays his Boston origins, then his
points of conversational reference both underscore those origins
and conjure up memories of a looser, funkier city: Paperback
Booksmith (where Guralnick worked for several years in the
mid-'60s), Skippy White's and Big John's Oldies But Goodies Land
record stores, Boston After Dark and The Real Paper (Guralnick
wrote for both publications), the Sugar Shack.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the last-named establishment, the late, lamented
Boylston Street soul and R&AMP;B club, that Guralnick realized how
deeply not just the music but the whole music scene had come to
matter to him. This was in the mid-'70s. He had published his first
book, ``Feel Like Going Home: Portraits in Blues and Rock 'n'
Roll'' (1971), then spent four years getting a master's degree in
creative writing at BU. He had just started to write a little about
music again and was looking for a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I have this lunch with the head of the English
department at some prep school _ I can't even remember which one _
and it was very nice. We talked about `Tristram Shandy,' which is
one of my favorite books, and ate our meal. Then that night I went
down to the Sugar Shack, where Bobby Blue Bland was playing. And
the Sugar Shack was just this great, glittery place, a basement _
you know, it was the night life (`ain't no good life, but it's my
life') but I didn't know it!
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, I hung around after the show because there was
supposed to be a horn rehearsal around 2:30. I'm sitting there,
waiting, waiting, and eventually there was no rehearsal. But while
I'm sitting there, it came to me in this blinding flash _ maybe it
was just a very fatigued flash _ that I would actually rather sit
around all night waiting for a band rehearsal that never even takes
place than teach English at a prep school. So that was the end of
any ambitions I had, and that was when I sort of said, OK, I don't
know why it is, because I'm not part of it, but it's not even just
the music: A portion of me is drawn to the life.''
</P>
<P>
   Guralnick's domestic life has been far removed from that world.
He and his wife, Alexandra, have been married 35 years and live in
a 200-year-old house in Essex County near the New Hampshire border.
Their children, Jacob and Nina, are both grown, which comes as a
surprise, because Guralnick's fine-boned features and small, wiry
frame give him the elfin appearance of one considerably younger
than 55.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to that effect is his relaxed, easy manner.
Guralnick possesses the cheerful calm of a man who not only knows
what he most loves in the world but has found a way to get someone
to pay him to pursue it. ``I'll tell you,'' he says, ``the thrill
of my life is just that I've gotten to do exactly what I wanted to
do.''

`KA' OFFERS DIZZYING LOOK AT INDIA'S CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
KA 
Stories of the Mind and Gods of India 
By Roberto Calasso (translated , from the Italian , by Tim Parks) 
Knopf, 446 pp., $27.50 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ka'' is another mirrored panel in a great hall of myth and
history that is being built by the Italian publisher, editor,
writer, and polymath Roberto Calasso, who is making an unparalleled
literary attempt to reproduce the architecture of the human mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ka'' is the third of the panels to appear in English,
following Calasso's survey of Greek and Roman myth in ``The
Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony'' (published in Italian in 1988 and
translated in 1993) and his study of Talleyrand, the French
Revolution, and the birth of the modern in ``The Ruins of Kasch''
(first published in 1984 and translated a decade later).
</P>
<P>
   ``Ka,'' which first appeared in Italy two years ago, surveys the
literary and mythical culture of India. It is a labyrinthine book,
both dense and vertiginous, and much of it is presented in a guise
of deceptive simplicity. It is wide-ranging, assimilative; the
glare of mirrored and interactive illumination becomes so brilliant
that you can't look at it any more _ and you can't look at anything
else, either, until the retina adjusts to mundane existence. Anyone
who tells you he understands all of ``Ka'' is either a liar or a
fool, but no one will read it without reward, because above all it
is a book about keeping the consciousness open, alert, and
receptive _ a state which reading ``Ka'' requires.
</P>
<P>
   One of Calasso's sources is the incomprehensibly vast corpus of
Indian classical literature _ the Brahamanas, the more than 1,000
Vedic hymns, the Puranas, and the epic ``Mahabharata'' (most of
which he cites in translations into modern languages). Calasso also
refers to the work and opinions of leading Western Indologists,
supplies a note on Sanskrit pronunciation, and offers a 33-page
glossary that proves an invaluable thread to a reader twisting
through the maze.
</P>
<P>
   The other of Calasso's resources is everything else he knows,
and his is an astonishingly well-stocked mind. In the text there
are references to the sweep and detail of Greek and Roman myth
(just as the Vedas are cited in ``The Marriage of Cadmus and
Harmony''), as well as to such diverse figures as Wittgenstein,
Proust, Wagner, Plato, Balzac, Locke, Kafka, and Gilda (``The
protagonist of `Gilda' by Charles Vidor, 1946''); the range of
uncited references is even larger.
</P>
<P>
   Calasso's method is similar to that of his earlier books. ``Ka''
advances in intricately woven short sections that are interwoven
into larger ones. The book is like a necklace of beads in which
different colors and shapes catch and reflect the light in
individual ways but also cumulatively reveal patterns. (No praise
can be too high for the precision of the translation by the British
novelist Tim Parks, who also translated ``The Marriage of Cadmus
and Harmony.'')
</P>
<P>
   One of Calasso's objectives is to evoke the primal force of
these stories. He repeats these ancient myths, tales, legends,
sagas in vividly incantory style; the telling of the tale is all
the interpretation it needs. His manner is both chronological and
circular: We see, even feel, how subsequent generations over
millennia absorbed these stories and the ways they embody human
concerns. Each new cycle of stories both assimilates its
predecessors and strikes off in new directions; at the same time
the old patterns recur, transformed. In part, the interaction of
the stories creates meaning and interpretation. Calasso is our
unseen, unheard guide.
</P>
<P>
   At other moments, though, Calasso steps forward as historian,
analyst, interpreter. The following passage is characteristic.
``The first pact between mind and matter was sealed upon the
waters. Even the gods of Olympus were terrified of breaking an oath
made on the waters of the Styx. There is a perennial bond between
the waters and the truth. But why should what is fluid, elusive,
and mutable coincide with the unshakable precision of the word that
enounces things as they are? This is the mystery, the ultimate
obscurity of Varuna, and it is what makes him more remote than any
other god. Between the word and the waters another element slips
in, an element in which water and word flow together and mingle:
consciousness, the raw sensation of whoever is awake and knows
himself alive. This sensation is more amazing than any marvel the
eye will ever see. In this regard the rsis (seers) were not so far
away from Wittgenstein: that the world exists is far more amazing
than any how the world exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Calasso create a hall of mirrors where the panels
are angled to recede into, or advance upon, infinity, but the
mirrors turn to face outward as well as inward; they are on pivots,
and as Calasso sets them spinning, our heads spin too. Fortunately
it all does come back to the stories. ``It was as if everybody were
suddenly tired of doing things that had meaning. They wanted to sit
down, in the grass or around a heap of smoldering logs, and listen
to stories. . . .'' After Calasso's account of the life of the
Buddha, the book ends as it began, with the giant, primordial eagle
Garuda, stirring to take flight again, and ask again the question
``Who (Ka) is the god to whom we should offer our sacrifice?''

WHY EAGLES LOVE WABASHA, MINN. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you want to see a bald eagle in the wild, the place to head
is Wabasha, Minn. Wabasha is home to one of the largest
concentrations of wintering bald eagles in the lower 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, 800 eagles could be spotted around this small
southeastern Minnesota town, where a new National Eagle Center is
slated to be built next year.
</P>
<P>
   The present center staffs an outdoor eagle observation deck on
weekends through March. It's free and open every day.
</P>
<P>
   Why, you may wonder, is Wabasha so important to the eagles?
Food. Rivers north of Wabasha freeze over in winter, but the
Mississippi in Wabasha doesn't. Just north of Wabasha, the
Mississippi River channel narrows to form the base of Lake Pepin.
Since the channel leaving Pepin is narrow, it creates a strong
current to keep the Mississippi ice-free for a three-mile stretch
through Wabasha. The open water means good fishing for the eagles,
and the eagles know a good opportunity when one comes along. They
can also be seen near dams and locks, which create water movement
and prevent ice from forming.
</P>
<P>
   The eagles of Wabasha feed on gizzard, a nongame fish, which is
abundant in the Mississippi during winter. This makes Wabasha a
win-win situation for the eagles, fishermen (since the eagles don't
compete with them), and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   For the latest eagle report, call 651-565-4989, and for lodging,
call the Wabasha Chamber of Commerce at 800-565-4158. ElderHostel
is having an EagleWatch program Feb. 28-March 5, and famed natural
photographer Arthur Morris will present seminars on how to
photograph birds and nature on March 5-7. For reservations, call
800-565-4158.

<P>
   What's it like to drive an electric car? You can find out by
renting one from Budget Rent a Car in Los Angeles International
Airport. Budget has electric's from DaimlerChrysler, Ford, GM,
Honda, Toyota, and others. An introductory rate of $39.95 a day is
being offered. (Do you have to return them on ``full,'' or will
Budget plug them in?) By spring, Budget expects to have 60
electrics in its fleet and eventually to expand the fleet to other
California locations. In Europe, Budget offers electrics in Paris
and Lyon, methane-powered vehicles in Sweden, and liquid petroleum
gas ones in the United Kingdom.

Auld Lang Syne &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You most likely sang it on New Year's eve, and now the song of
friendship recognized throughout the world is heading home. A rare
single-sheet manuscript of Robert Burns's most famous poem, ``Auld
Lang Syne,'' was purchased at auction at Christie's in New York by
the Glasgow City Council. Only one of seven signed copies, it will
now be on public display in Glasgow's Mitchell Library. The library
already has a Robert Burns Collection. The poem will also be read
later this month at Robert Burns celebrations throughout the world.

A note of caution &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Airplane travelers should be wary of taking the hormone
melatonin too often for jet lag, according to the Travel Medicine
Service at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. Available over
the counter in drugstores as a food supplement, melatonin has
become a popular pill for combating sleepiness, fatigue, and
decreased mental alertness resulting from jet lag. ``Research
indicates that melatonin is effective for short-term treatment of
jet lag, but we don't know yet whether long-term use is safe,''
said Dr. Clifford Dacson, a Baylor physician. Baylor recommends
seeing your doctor for recommendations.

The package for guests 50 and older offers a room rate of $49 a

WATERVILLE VALLEY: WHAT A DEAL! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERVILLE VALLEY, N.H. _ Confessions of a fiscally responsible
skiing addict: Some might call us, if not exactly cheapskates, at
least cheapskiers.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we tend to buy most of our ski tickets at a discount in
July, and come the winter we are apt to go out of our way to buy a
particular brand of gas, fuel up with whatever doughnuts are paying
off that week, and maybe even stop for an 8 a.m. candy bar, the
kind that we don't even eat _ all to get the discount coupons that
came with those products. Thus, where we ski often depends on what
day of the week it is. You know, twofers here on Tuesday, there on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   We prefer to think of ourselves as frugal freestylers _ the more
more we save, the more we can ski.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what brought us with some regularity last year to
Waterville Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Waterville Valley has long been one of the class resorts of New
Hampshire and New England. It's been a summer escape since the
middle of the last century. It started attracting winter visitors
who hiked Mount Tecumseh, which is on the opposite side of the
valley from where today's ski area is located on Snow's Mountain,
and skied its logging roads in the 1930s. There was a T-Bar on
Tecumseh in 1952. Things really took off when Tom Corcoran bought
the Waterville Inn and 425 acres in 1966 and proceeded to build the
ski area, and its village in the valley, into one of the region's
most popular destination and day resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Its prime location, two hours from Boston, gave skiers an
option: Come for the day. Or come to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away miles off the interstates and miles from the
fast-food outlets and the strip malls and the bustle of everyday
life, the valley folk like to think of themselves as ``in the
prettiest cul de sac in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And visitors flocked there.
</P>
<P>
   But Corcoran ran into tough financial times and the area went
into bankruptcy, and through the mid-'90s there were four owners in
four years. In 1996, Waterville Valley, along with Cranmore
Mountain Resort in North Conway, was purchased by George Gillet Jr.
and Booth Creek Ski Holdings, who owns 10 resorts across the
country and recently bought nearby Loon Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback began.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in an attempt to lure back some of its customers and
show off some of its improvements to customers new and old,
Waterville Valley for the first time offered a $10 ticket for
children. Any child age 6-12 (under that is free). Any day. The
kids came in droves, bringing in adults at the going rates, which
this year are $40 on weekdays and $46 on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention that we are at times on the lookout for bargains?
Ten bucks a kid? When sometimes there are a half-dozen in that age
group skiing with us and some mountains get upward of $25 per?
</P>
<P>
   We came. We saw. We came again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as erstwhile New Hampshire skiers, we had skied Waterville
in the past. Had some good times. But for various reasons it wasn't
at the top of our got-to-ski list. For the year before last,
Waterville chopped off the top of its summit quad _ the better to
keep it running regularly in the wind at the top _ and that move
paid big dividends. That lift, down more than three dozen days the
year before, was stopped by wind four days last year, and those
were days that other areas had problems, too. That helped a lot.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, the more we came, the more we saw, the more we
liked Waterville. We weren't alone. The area's total of skier
visits took a huge bump last season _ partly because of the $10
tickets, and partly because of what everyone found.
</P>
<P>
   There is capital for projects again, and Waterville Valley,
which retained a core of longtime and loyal and talented employees
through the difficult years, went to work.
</P>
<P>
   There was the new. They added a fast and friendly chairlift _
dubbed Quadzilla in a name-that-quad contest _ to service the
largely novice terrain in the Valley Run area. There was the added
snowmaking on Lower Bobby's Run, for the bump bashers, and on
Stillness, a rolling easier trail serviced by the new quad.
Stillness, little used through the years, should help clear some of
the novice area congestion as skiers come to realize it is there as
an option.
</P>
<P>
   For all the work on the mountain, some of the most talked- about
and appreciated improvements came between the skier dropoff area
and the base lodge. A new, much wider entranceway was built leading
into the area's courtyard and the skiers loved it. This year,
Waterville Valley is following up and putting most of its efforts
into the base lodge. In the past, it's been confusing getting into
the lodge: Go through this door, and battle through those lined up
for ski lessons? Or this one and head up the narrow stairs to the
right? Or negotiate the snow and go around the left to sneak up on
the lodge from the side?
</P>
<P>
   A wide new entrance, and a few other changes, should greatly
help the flow and feel of the lodge itself. The upstairs lounge has
been moved out of the building with a dual purpose: allowing for a
200-seat restaurant and lounge in what used to be the racing club
headquarters, and freeing up all kinds of space in the base lodge.
Food will be served upstairs as well as down in the lodge. There
will be a new entrance, too, from the mountain side. In T-Bars, the
new restaurant/lounge, there will be plenty of room for a display
honoring Waterville's history _ including the early days, the
ground-breaking freestyle days and the World Cup racing days.
</P>
<P>
   All of which wraps the new around Waterville's tried and true
old. Around the Tippecanoe and the And Tyler Too trails. Around
fast and rolling Ciao and Gema on the other side of the mountain.
Around the double-diamond True Grit, the bumped-up and
chairlift-following favorite of at least one of those 12-and-under
skiers in our crew.
</P>
<P>
   One of our best ski days last winter consisted of a weekday
moguls lesson in the morning, followed by a cross-country trip up
Tecumseh with a sandwich for lunch at the top. The Schwendi Hut,
just off the Sunnyside Triple or the summit quad, is a great place
to catch a late morning break and bite before the lunch crowd comes
in _ and deserts the trails. For a real treat, make plans to come
back at night. On Saturday nights and a few other selected times
during the year, a five-course meal is offered up in the
mountainside restaurant. You get there via a half-hour trip up the
mountain behind a grooming machine. The cost is $65 per person
(don't worry, we're on the lookout for coupons).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on mountain activities are only part of a Waterville
Valley getaway. It's the proverbial
park-your-car-and-leave-it-parked family experience. For a weekend.
For a week.
</P>
<P>
   For long-term visitors, there is everything to do and, if so
desired, there is nothing to do. There is cross-country skiing
galore on the 105 kilometers of trails of the Nordic Center. There
are moonlight tours every Saturday evening and gourmet lunch tours
on Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   There is snowshoeing. There are sleigh rides and there is indoor
ice skating with hockey games apt to break out and there are even
college hockey games to watch. There is a teen center.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Town Square full of shops and dining
establishments, from the sandwiches and wine selection at Jugtown
to Legends to Chili's for Mexican fare to Olde Waterville Pizza Co.
There's the new Diamond's Edge North, brought to the Town Square by
the people who run a you-can-only-get-there-by-boat restaurant on
an island in Casco Bay out of Portland. There's the Valley Inn and
others for dinner. There are the indoor-outdoor pools of the Black
Bear Lodge and there are the common areas of the assorted hotels
and condominium groups for quiet reading. There are the refurbished
three-bedroom condos in Town Square. There is the Athletic Center.
</P>
<P>
   There are _ and we love this part _ the deals.
</P>
<P>
   There is the early and late season snowmaker's special. Before
Dec. 24 and after March 19, ski-and-stay packages start at $49. The
popular Winter Unlimited packages, with lodging and skiing and
other activities included, are back starting at $69 per person. In
January, children under 12 ski and stay free when others are on the
Winter Unlimited plan. There are weeklong plans as well. There are
the interchangeable tickets with Loon and Cranmore and there is the
Value Card that rewards frequent skiing at any one of those areas,
which all pride themselves on being unique.
</P>
<P>
   And the $10 kids ticket? Yeah, that's back. We'll be back, too.

A CELEBRATION OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRAVEL, 1999 STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By George, it's going to be a great travel year!
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're into great adventures, theme resorts or parks,
history, culture, music, or cruising, it's going to be a memorable
travel year. It's the year in which George Washington's life, and
the lives of other luminaries, will be celebrated. And if you
haven't made your plans to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000,
you'd better do it now because many of the bashes are already sold
out. The clock is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   While lots of attention will be given to the turn of the
calendar, this could also be a good excuse to create a new you by
taking in a spa vacation or a learning adventure for a renewal of
body and mind. This could also be the year for a spiritual journey.
Israel is playing on the theme it is the destination for the
millennium, and Rome will be the focus of a holy year in 2000. But
why not see these places this year, before the crowds arrive?
</P>
<P>
   How we plan our vacations is also changing. The Internet
continues to grow in popularity as a means of booking flights and
trips. Many travel agencies are being forced out of business
between the growing use of the Internet and cutting of commissions
by the airlines for booking flights. While the Internet is proving
a great source of instant discounts on flights, there's still
nothing like some professional advice from a knowledgeable travel
agent.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to where to go, a recent survey of the American
Society of Travel Agents showed no surprises. Orlando was named the
top domestic destination, followed by Las Vegas, New York City, San
Francisco, and Los Angeles. Internationally, the top three
destinations were London, Paris, and Rome. But don't limit yourself
to someone else's choices _ the travel dollar goes far, and with a
little planning, you can expand your horizons to just about
anywhere on earth.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best destinations is just across the border in
Canada. Maybe it's just too friendly, too close, to be thought of
as exotic, but Canada can provide the vacation of a lifetime,
especially now with our dollar being valued at $1.40 or more there.
The dollar is also buying more in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Cruises continue to grow in popularity. With the new megaliners,
a cruise can offer something for everyone in the family, making
vacation planning like a refreshing ocean breeze. Add to this the
competitive pricing, and cruise vacations are also proving great
value.
</P>
<P>
   Luring many landlubbers are the new 100,000-ton-plus liners the
Carnival Destiny and the Grand Princess and the slightly smaller
Disney Magic. While Mickey's liner is proving innovative, the sheer
size and features of the Destiny and the Grand Princess are
attracting more vacationers to discover the pleasure of a seagoing
experience. But even these majestic liners will soon be dwarfed by
the new ``largest cruise ship in the world'' titleholder, Royal
Caribbean's Voyager. This liner, at 136,000 tons _ about one-third
larger than the Destiny and Princess _ will give even new reasons
for going to sea. The Voyager will truly be a resort on the water,
a destination in itself. Besides all the usual amenities, there
will be a multitude of dining options, an ice skating rink (big
enough to hold an Ice Capades show), a rock climbing wall, a
meandering four-story atrium with a promenade view and interior
cabins facing the promenade. (The latter design feature alone will
set the Voyager apart from all other ships, according to Travel
Weekly writer and cruise book author Fran Golden.) The
3,100-passenger ship will debut in November.
</P>
<P>
   And for old salts, there will be other new seagoing experiences.
Clipper Cruises will introduce the ...., the world's largest
sailing vessel with six masts. Norwegian Cruise Lines will present
its newest vessel, the ...., and is now cutting the popular Majesty
in half and expanding the Boston-to-Bermuda vessel by some 100
feet; a new line, World Cruises, will begin bargain-priced
around-the-world cruises in December. And that's just a sampling.
</P>
<P>
   On land, its the year for George Washington, Johann Strauss,
gastronomy, and anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The life and contributions of George Washington will be
celebrated this year, the 200th anniversary of his death.
Throughout Virginia, where he lived at Mount Vernon for 45 years,
many celebrations are planned. The state has produced a map
highlighting sites associated with his accomplishments (for a free
copy and a ``Virginia Is for Lovers Travel Guide,'' call
800-932-5827). At Mount Vernon, special events include new tours of
the mansion and grounds, candlelight tours of the mansion,
patriotic concerts, a re-creation of Washington's presidential
office, and nighttime hours each Friday and Saturday, April through
August (for more information, call 703-780-2000). Through Feb. 22,
the New York Historical Society is featuring an exhibit:
``Treasures from Mount Vernon: George Washington Revealed.'' Among
the treasures are Washington's false teeth, which, contrary to
legend, are not wooden; letters from Washington to his wife,
Martha; four of his swords; and the iron key from the Bastille,
sent to him in 1790 by the Marquis de Lafayette. The exhibit will
also be seen in Los Angeles, Richmond, Atlanta, and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Virginia, Williamsburg, the original capital of the
Virginia Colony and one of America's first planned cities, will
mark its 300th year (May 1-2 is the official 300th birthday
celebration). Many events are planned, especially in historically
restored Colonial Williamsburg, which, along with the nearby
Jamestown Settlement, the Colonial National Historic Park, and the
Busch Gardens theme park, provide a unique historical, cultural,
and fun experience. For anniversary and activities information,
call the Williamsburg Area Convention and Visitors Bureau at
800-368-6511.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, masters of music and literature are being celebrated.
Vienna is marking 1999 as the Year of the Waltz King Johann
Strauss. Strauss, considered the most significant Viennese composer
of all time (even topping his father, Johann Strauss Sr., composer
of the Radetzky March), is best known for his ``Blue Danube'' waltz
(Austria's unofficial national anthem) and the operetta ``Die
Fledermaus.''
</P>
<P>
   Vienna, one of Europe's most romantic cities, is expecting a
surge in tourism and is planning many events throughout the year to
honor Strauss (who even performed his musical magic on tour in
Boston). This year marks the 100th anniversary of his death on June
3, 1899. For information, write to the Austrian National Tourist
Office, PO Box 1142, New York, NY 10108; or telephone 212-944-6990.
</P>
<P>
   Weimar in Germany is the 1999 European City of Culture, an honor
that coincides with the 250th anniversary of the birth of one of
its most famous sons, the poet and intellect Johann Wolfgang von
Goethe. Goethe, who was accomplished in many fields, is best known
as a writer of the poem, ``Faust,'' the story of a 16th-century
doctor who, according to legend, sold his soul to the devil in
return for the gifts of youth, knowledge, and magical power. For
information on the city and events, write to the German National
Tourist Office, 122 East 42nd St., New York, NY 10168; or telephone
212-661-7200.
</P>
<P>
   Near Weimar is Ettersberg Mountain, on which stands Buchenwald,
the national memorial site that is testimony to the darkest time in
German history and a permanent appeal to the conscience of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, Nova Scotia has two events that are listed among the
American Bus Association's top events in North America for 1999.
Encampment '99, July 23-25, marks the 250th anniversary of the
Fortress of Louisbourg's return to France in 1749. More than 2,000
living history enthusiasts, all in 18th-century attire, are
expected to attend for battlefield reenactments, music, dance, and
more. The fortress is quite a sight and worth a visit even without
the celebrations. It was once captured by New Englanders _ even
Paul Revere was there _ and some say their success in taking the
fortress inspired them to take on the British a few years later.

BROWN PROMISES TO SPEAK THE `TRUTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN and VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Saying soothing words are ``the enemy of
change,'' Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown has pledged a tough-love
approach to city problems that relies on the ``courage and the
willingness to speak truth to one other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I will not do is engage in denial _ denial by
pretending that things are better then they are or denial by
creating an impression that just around the corner everything will
be fine,'' said Brown, who was sworn in Monday as the city's 47th
mayor at a ceremony at the Paramount Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who moved to Oakland three years ago from San Francisco,
also lauded the ``incredible possibilities'' of his adopted city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's integrated, it's international, it's artistic, rich and
poor at the same time,'' Brown said. ``It's a place of creativity.
It's got hope. There is Oakland.''
</P>
<P>
   To the crowd's delight, Brown seized on the chance to turn a
famous _ and in Oakland, infamous _ quote about the city by writer
Gertrude Stein on its head. ``There's a there there all right,'' he
said. ``That's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   From the get-go, Brown, 60, served notice that he considered his
speech a special endeavor. ``I actually wrote it out,'' he began.
``I think I've only written about four speeches in the last 20
campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who began his political career in 1969, served two terms
as California's governor, campaigned for the U.S. Senate and three
times ran for the Democratic presidential nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The new mayor addressed himself to two different groups: those
living in Oakland and those who view it critically from the suburbs
or the city across the bay. To Oaklanders, he promised to talk
straight, ``the way we talk when we're not on a political
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   His bracing message: the best way to make Oakland better is to
quit sugarcoating its failings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret,'' he said, ``that we are frustrated, even
angry, at the gap between Oakland's inherent capacity and the stark
reality of above-average crime, below-average schools and a
downtown still struggling to recapture its glory.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the situation called for candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a time for denial,'' he said. ``It's very easy,
sometimes cozy to live in denial, but it doesn't get you anywhere.
Let us rather summon the power of truth so that we can strip away
the heavy obstacles that block our path. Soothing words in this
instance are the enemy of change.''
</P>
<P>
   He administered one astringent indictment after another: the
falling but still high homicide rate in Oakland, the outrageous
percentage of 10th graders who cannot read at grade level, an
urbanscape of barred windows and razor-wire fences ``that does not
indicate the convivial spirit _ that's an understatement.''
</P>
<P>
   But he followed up each bitter dose of reality with the promise
_ and occasionally the specific proposals _ of change.
</P>
<P>
   To make the streets safer, he pledged to immediately begin
filling vacancies on the police department, recruiting cops who
will live as well as work in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   And he served notice to lawbreakers: ``Crime and disrespect for
the rights of others won't be tolerated _ period. That's all there
is to it.''
</P>
<P>
   To bolster public education, he said he wants to help parents
and teachers form alternative public charter schools _ schools
given waivers from state guidelines to allow more local control and
creativity. Rejecting gradualism that accepts glacial change, he
said, ``parents can't be expected to wait forever'' for good
schools.
</P>
<P>
   From now on at City Hall, Brown announced, decisions will be
made not on the basis of ``who has the best lobbyist or who brings
the most people to City Hall, but what's best for all the people,
what's best for the city as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he will make sure the urban problems that beset
Oakland will get the attention of national and state leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will seek in Washington for what is our due and will claim
at the state Capitol all that is ours,'' he said. ``In the circles
of national and state power, the voices of Oaklanders will be
heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brown said Oakland doesn't need to go begging for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the strength and character to affect those aspects of
city life that are within our grasp: what our children learn, the
peace and security of our neighborhoods, the vibrancy of downtown
and the creativity and the craft we can share with each other,'' he
said. ``Given the riches of the city, there should be no excuses.''

   The last solar eclipse of the century takes place on Aug. 11,
and many say Turkey is the best place to see it. Certainly one of
the easiest and most comfortable ways to catch the eclipse is on a
cruise. Norwegian Cruise Line's newest ship, the Norwegian Sky,
will set sail on Aug. 9 on a European cruise that includes an
eclipse-viewing opportunity. On board will be Buzz Aldrin, who
walked on the moon in 1969. NCL's Norway will also rendezvous with
the Sky for this celestial event.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a year for new adventures. Adventure travel is
one of the fastest-growing segments in the industry. This type of
travel does not necessarily mean risk taking, and a survey by the
Adventure Travel Society proves this. The most popular forms of
adventure travel, the society said, included wildlife viewing (25
percent), fitness walking (22 percent), camping (15 percent),
fishing (8 percent), hiking (4 percent), river running (4 percent),
backpacking (3 percent), and other activities making up the
remaining 15 percent. Mountain Travel-Sobek, which is marking its
30th anniversary of adventurous touring, is featuring new tours to
Tibet, the Russian Far East, the Arctic, and Corsica, but is also
offering some adventures from its original days such as
back-to-back climbs of Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro, and a kayak
journey in remote Greenland (888-687-6235). Mountain climbing is
big on the minds of Toronto-based Blyth &AMP; Company Adventures
(800-387-1387), which is planning five such trips on New Year's
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of risks, maybe rejuvenation is best for your body at
one of the many spas that can be found not only in New England but
throughout the world. If health is your concern, maybe a visit to
Hershey, Pa., that heavenly chocolate capital of America, should be
on your mind. A recent study of Harvard male graduates found that
those who indulged in chocolate _ and candy _ regardless of how
voracious their appetite for the goodies, live almost a year longer
than those who abstain.
</P>
<P>
   Theme parks and theme hotels are also big this year. Just when
you thought there was nothing new in Orlando, Universal Studios
comes along with a huge expansion this year. Universal says its
Islands of Adventure will be the most technologically advanced
theme park ever created. The park, adjacent to Universal Studios
Florida, will also become the permanent home to characters such as
The Cat in The Hat, Spider-Man, Popeye, The Incredible Hulk,
Sinbad, and the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park. The park will also
feature new thrills _ its Dueling Dragons will be the first dual
coaster in the world designed and built so that its two coasters
furiously speed toward each other. I'll take my green eggs and ham,
thank you. And, in case you'd rather join me for green eggs and ham
than take that dueling coaster ride, you can do so at one of the
island's restaurants, where such treats will be served _ even
dragon-scale ale, Dagwood sandwiches, and pizza predattoria.
</P>
<P>
   And Disney World isn't sitting idly by. Among new attractions
for '99 is an expanded Animal Kingdom with a new 23-acre Asia
section, complete with 12-foot-long Komodo dragons; a return next
summer of the original Main Street Electrical Parade, still my
favorite Disney parade; the Rock 'n' Roller Coaster, a high-speed
thriller at Disney-MGM Studios; a replacement for Mr. Toad's ride,
The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh; and, believe it or not,
Test Track, a long-delayed ride at Epcot, which, if it hits speed,
will include a 65-mile-an-hour ride as riders are shown how General
Motors builds and tests its vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas, now the capital of theme resorts, will have still
another this fall: the $760 million Paris-Las Vegas Casino Resort.
The Parisian-themed resort with authentic replicas of French
landmarks, including a 50-story Eiffel Tower, will be Hilton
Hotel's largest construction project to date.
</P>
<P>
   Even Israel is getting a theme resort. Herods, the first theme
resort in the Middle East, will open in the fall. This Sheraton
resort being built on the beachfront at Eilat will mix history _
real and imagined _ with lush surrounding, a lavish spa, and
fun-filled experiences. Even the staff will be dressed in tribal
attire.
</P>
<P>
   Among other happenings in '99:
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana will be marking 300 years of French heritage. One of
the biggest events will be in Baton Rouge, the capital, where a
March 5-7 celebration includes historical reenactments, the arrival
of the sailing vessel the Bluenose from Nova Scotia, and a lot
more. For information, call 800-870-4959.
</P>
<P>
   In Scotland, Glasgow will be the City of Architecture and Design
and promises innovative new architecture, creation of imaginative
public spaces, and restoring Charles Rennie Mackintosh's former
Herald building into The Lighthouse, Scotland's Center for
Architecture, Design and the City. Events are planned thoughout the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Where Scotland stops, the Orkney Islands are said to begin, as
well as a good deal of Canada. Many Canadians trace their heritage
to these islands just off the most northerly parts of Scotland. In
May and June, a major homecoming is planned (for information, call
the Great Canadian Travel Co. at 204-949-0199).
</P>
<P>
   The Tall Stacks are returning to Cincinnati Oct. 13-17. This
riverboat extravaganza that draws the nation's grandest riverboats
recalls a bygone era when steamboats were the only way to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary is marking 1999 as the ``Year of the Pleasures of the
Palate'' with multiple food tastings, culinary competitions, and
other events (for information, write to the Hungarian Tourist
Board, 150 East 58th St., New York, NY 10155; or telephone
212-355-0240).
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth is planning a major cattle drive in June. A sight not
to be missed.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the oldest rodeos will mark its 100th anniversary in
October. The American Royal in Kansas City promises thrills for all
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Antwerp will mark the 400th anniversary of the birth of Anthony
van Dyck with an impressive exhibition featuring 80 of his works,
May 15-Aug. 15. The exhibit will also be seen in London, Sept.
16-Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Danish Theatre is commemorating its 250th anniversary.
Both the Royal Danish Ballet and the Royal Danish Opera have made
significant contributions in the arts over the years, and both will
be having anniversary celebrations throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh, N.C., is celebrating being named one of the top 10
business cities in the country by Fortune magazine. This
200-year-old city with some 20 free attractions and the first
state-supported art museum in the country will open this year the
first children's museum devoted to global learning and awareness.
Exploreis will open in August. And in the fall, the North Carolina
Museum of Natural Sciences will move into a new building. Housed in
the $30 million site is the world's only mountable specimen of the
Acrocanthosaurus, a 112-million-year-old carnivore that once roamed
from Texas to Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in the travel world, it's the 30th year for the slogan
``Virginia Is for Lovers,'' and since its inception the phrase has
been widely imitated to become part of the global language. New
York didn't begin its ``I Love New York'' campaign until 1977, and
that state is still one of the top three markets for Virginia.
Other 1969 slogans included ``It's the Real Thing,'' ``The Big
Mac,'' and ``One Giant Leap for Mankind,'' but the people in
Virginia note that you won't find any of those on mugs, bumpers, or
T-shirts today.

   With the bull market on a four-year stampede, is it time for
investors who've enjoyed the ride to sell some of their stock funds
and replace them with safer bonds or money-market funds? Or is it
time to load up on more turbo-charged funds, funds that invest in
fast-growing technology and Internet stocks?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if you've missed the market's run-up, is it too late
to invest in stock funds now?
</P>
<P>
   Questions like these beset nearly every investor. But investing
in mutual funds can be the right choice _ whether the market is
heading up or down.
</P>
<P>
   And if you invest in solid funds that have proven themselves in
both bull and bear markets, you'll almost certainly come out ahead
of the game.
 &UR; WHY PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE MARKET? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertainty of today's market, many people want to
know: Which way is the stock market headed next, and what can we
expect in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite their frequent pronouncements, none of Wall
Street's highly paid analysts have more than a hunch about which
way the stock market will go today, tomorrow or six months from
now. In fact, you're probably better off paying no attention to
predictions about which way the market is going, because nobody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just one example of the experts' fallibility: In 1979, Business
Week ran a cover story: ``The Death of Equities.'' The story argued
that the stock market was never again going to offer the kind of
gains it had in the past. Three years later, the biggest bull
market in history began.
</P>
<P>
   While you should ignore the predictions, do bear this in mind:
Through recessions, wars and all other matter of calamities,
stocks, on average, have returned an annualized 11 percent since
1926. That compares to 5.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.7
percent for ``safe'' cash investments such as short-term Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposits and money-market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation has averaged 3.1 percent. After inflation,
stocks have actually been less likely to lose money over five-year
periods than bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Over all five-year periods since 1926, stocks have outperformed
bonds and cash more than three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But before you put all your money into stocks, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks are far more volatile than bonds, meaning their returns
bounce around more from month to month and year to year. Cash is
the least volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In their worst year (1931), stocks plunged 43 percent, while
long-term corporate bonds lost only 8.1 percent in their poorest
year (1969), and the worst return on cash was a minuscule loss of
0.02 percent (in 1938).
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks have fallen by at least 20 percent about once every
five years since 1926. There's nothing unique about this year's
decline. On average, it has taken two years and five months to
break even for an investor who put money into stocks just before a
20 percent or greater drop.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 crash (when stocks lost 86 percent of their value
over three years), though, it took until 1944 to break even. And
after the brutal 1973-74 bear market (when stocks fell 48 percent),
it took more than three years to break even _ and 10 years to break
even after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: Stocks are great long-term investments; bonds
and cash make more sense for shorter time periods. Think of stocks
as a roller coaster, bonds as bumper cars and cash as a carousel.
And tune out prognostications about which will do best in the short
run.
 &UR; BEFORE YOU GET STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to invest in stock funds, there are a few
things you should do before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you pay off high-interest debt such as credit
cards. Next, amass a cash cushion equal to at least three months of
your after-tax salary in a bank CD or a money-market account. Or,
if you are bolder, take out a home-equity line of credit that you
can tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've taken those steps, there are two things you'll need
to determine about yourself: Can you tolerate fear-inspiring market
declines like the recent one without selling your stock funds? And
how long will it be until you'll need your money?
</P>
<P>
   To find out how much risk you can handle, answer the following
two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. The news media is filled with stories quoting experts who
predict stocks will lose money in the coming decade. Many suggest
investing in real estate. You would:
</P>
<P>
   a. consider selling some stocks funds and buying real estate
</P>
<P>
   b. be concerned, but stick to your long-term goals
</P>
<P>
   c. dismiss the articles as a sign of unwarranted pessimism over
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Which of the following statements best describes you:
</P>
<P>
   a. I often change my mind and have trouble sticking to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   b. I can stay with a strategy as long as it seems to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   c. Once I make up my mind to do something, I tend to follow
through with it regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``a'' both times, consider yourself a low-risk
investor. If you answered with one ``a'' and one ``b,'' or two
``b's,'' or one ``a'' and one ``c,'' you're a medium-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered with at least one ``c'' and no ``a's,'' you're a
high-risk investor _ able to hold on to stocks no matter how rough
the market gets.
 &UR; HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STOCKS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some stockbrokers and financial planners would have you believe
that figuring out how much to invest in stocks and lower-risk
investments is as difficult as calculus. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Following are two tables: one for investing for retirement and
the second for investing to meet all other goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table for retirement calls for you to invest a larger
portion of your money in stocks. That's because most people can
expect to live to be 85 or 90 years old _ a long time for your
money to grow, even in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)
 &UR; .........................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ........................LOW...............MODERATE.........HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs.........100 percent....100 percent....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs..............70.............80............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs...............60.............70............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 6 yrs................40.............50.............85 &QL; 
 &UR; Early retirement (age 65-75).35..........45.............60 &QL; 
 &UR; Late retirement (over age 75).30.........40.............50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW MUCH TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR ALL GOALS EXCEPT RETIREMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
you'll need the money)
 &UR; ....................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ....................LOW............MODERATE............HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs....80 percent........100 percent.....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs........60.................80.............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs.........55.................70..............90 &QL; 
 &UR; 4 to 6 yrs..........30.................40..............60 &QL; 
 &UR; 2 to 4..............10.................25..............35 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 2...............0..................0...............0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this knowledge, and details that I'll give you on
which funds to buy in the next article, there's no need for you to
buy a fund with a sales charge, or to pay a stock broker or
financial adviser to help you select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, once you become accustomed to the ups and downs of
the market, you may find you're more able to tolerate them. If so,
take the risk test again and see if you should increase the
percentage of your money you put into stock funds.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: GETTING STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know you need to get started investing _ or
that you need to invest in a more methodical way. It's another
thing to actually pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination is the enemy of investors. You know all the
excuses: Either you don't have enough money, you'd rather spend it
on something else, the market seems too risky just now or you're
already so far behind that starting would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel better about making a move if, instead of plunging
in, you take a tentative step or two. Invest a modest but fixed
amount from your salary in shares of stock funds every month.
</P>
<P>
   Funds often allow a monthly (or quarterly) minimum investment of
as little as $25 or $50, as long as you agree to make regular,
automatic investments via your checking account. Having the fund
company take the money out of your bank account each month is a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work, your
employer will similarly invest money straight from your paycheck.
And most companies match at least part of your investment, offering
an instant, substantial return.
</P>
<P>
   Money you don't see is money you won't spend and money you soon
will find you hardly miss. If you have to sit down and write a
check to a mutual fund every month, it's much easier to find
something else you'd rather spend the money on than your future.
</P>

A WEDDING IN THE CARIBBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MARINA CAY, British Virgin Islands _ Sprinkle, sprinkle,
little shower. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Whether the plumbing is mechanical or natural _ cistern-pumped
or raindrops _ this is a heavenly shower stall, attractively tiled
and out on an unroofed ledge as the jadely Caribbean spreads below,
rimmed by hilly islands. Spume with a view.
</P>
<P>
   Same for the rooms attached to the shower, the roomy Jasmine
Cottage on the woodsy crest of Marina Cay. There isn't much chance
that this isle, a green mound in the sun, will be overrun because
it could fit beneath the shoulder pads of an NFL tackle (say,
Zefross Moss of the Hartford-to-be Patriots). Seven acres is all.
Accommodations for 16. No phones, TV, or faxes.
</P>
<P>
   Just fixes of tranquillity. Swimming in a lucid sea of varying
greens and blues, caressed in seductive temperatures, is such a
high that the FDA may accuse me of abuse of a substance called
saltwater.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Goss, the manager, has pointed out a wrinkled croquet
court amid sea grape, cactus, and palms, ``in case landlocked
action is absolutely required.'' The grub is good, served on a
wooden veranda by the sea, a gingerbready 19th-century replica. And
the grog is Pusser's rum, mother's milk to Admiral Horatio Nelson's
boys at Trafalgar in 1805 and other bygone British naval battle
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every warship's purser handed out the daily ration, part of
those Limey tars' room-and-board scholarships,'' explains an old
pal, Joanna Tobias, resident of a close-by island, Tortola. ``Over
the years `purser' lost the `r' in pronunciation _ like the Boston
accent _ and it came out Pusser when the booze was
commercialized.''
</P>
<P>
   Joanna, whom I remember winning amateur tennis tournaments in
Dallas, likes the languid pace of the British Virgins even though
the winds can be fast-lane fierce, and she and husband Charles
Tobias have had their tops blown a couple of times by hurricanes.
``Tin roof blues,'' she says with a smile, evoking the old jazz
standard. ``But it makes business for the local contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   However, nobody built these islands' mysterious architectural
masterpiece, called The Baths. Volcanic explosions eons ago left
neighboring Virgin Gorda with a bewildering and beguiling tumble of
gigantic slabs and boulders in world-weary tones of gray, ecru, and
ash, a whimsical pileup at water's edge, lying at the bottom of a
steep, wiggly path. Leaning, balancing, supporting, blocking,
pushing against one another, straining for supremacy as a palace
thrown together by careless gods, these erratically-shaped chunks
seem rocks on a binge, a totally stoned Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   They offer dark, narrow passageways, low- and high-ceilinged
halls, chambers, and cubbyholes, secret pools _ an explorer's
dream, a claustrophobe's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call The Baths nature's funhouse,'' says a visitor, the
Rev. A.M. Popo from New Mexico. ``We have some formations like this
at home, but not with an ocean view. It'd be a nice place for a
wedding. I prefer seaside weddings. If the groom can walk on water
_ or at least not drown trying _ he's a keeper, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   I agreed with her. But the wedding in question _ she arrived to
officiate, I as a friend of the bride _ was scheduled for another
end of the island, a hilltop resort called Biras Creek, but with
plenty of ocean and sea to gaze down upon.
</P>
<P>
   Popo, known in some circles as the ``Marryin' Ma'am,'' much in
demand for such occasions, was also invited by the bride, Alexa
Terni, and OK'd by the groom, Jeremy Martindale, two young
Americans in a foreign land. Perhaps it was love at first bite as
the couple met over a souffle _ his or hers, I don't know _ in the
kitchen of Virgin Gorda's posh resort, Little Dix Bay, where both
are chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rub two chefs together and you get _ I hope _ an eternal
flame, or at least a pilot light,'' says Popo. ``Certainly there
should be none of the usual complaints about whatever newlywed's
cooking. Might I put a line in the ceremony: ` `Til hunger do us
part' ''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' another guest, Matt Burke, suggested, ``with this
range I do wed''?
</P>
<P>
   We wondered about the island's name, Virgin Gorda, and Joanna
had the answer. `` `Fat Virgin,' in Spanish. Columbus, of Columbus
Day fame, named it as he approached in 1493, his second voyage to
the New World. From his direction it looked like a rotund woman.
Virginal possibly because it appears her legs are tightly together.
He didn't explain that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a three-stop boat ride from Marina Cay to the nuptials,
aboard a handsome cabin cruiser operated by Little Dix Bay's Elton
George and Terry Leonard. First to Beef Island, the airport site,
to collect more guests. Then to Little Dix (never found out if
there's a Big Dix Bay) for the wedding party, and on to Biras
Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The bride in lacy white (satin cap replacing her professional
toque) was as lovely as the cloud-shirred sunset. The groom did not
fumble the ring, a good thing because they were at the lip of a
stone terrace hundreds of feet above Atlantic surf. His niece,
7-year-old left-hander Olivia Martindale, strewed rose petals
brilliantly. You don't see many southpaw flower girls. Popo was
eloquent.
</P>
<P>
   All very nice, and I forgave them the brain-clankling steel band
at the reception. Could be all that steady pounding on oil drums
has something to do with the local fondness for rum.

know: Which way is the stock market headed next, and what can we
expect in the future?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite their frequent pronouncements, none of Wall
Street's highly paid analysts have more than a hunch about which
way the stock market will go today, tomorrow or six months from
now. In fact, you're probably better off paying no attention to
predictions about which way the market is going, because nobody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just one example of the experts' fallibility: In 1979, Business
Week ran a cover story: ``The Death of Equities.'' The story argued
that the stock market was never again going to offer the kind of
gains it had in the past. Three years later, the biggest bull
market in history began.
</P>
<P>
   While you should ignore the predictions, do bear this in mind:
Through recessions, wars and all other matter of calamities,
stocks, on average, have returned an annualized 11 percent since
1926. That compares to 5.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.7
percent for ``safe'' cash investments such as short-term Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposits and money-market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation has averaged 3.1 percent. After inflation,
stocks have actually been less likely to lose money over five-year
periods than bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Over all five-year periods since 1926, stocks have outperformed
bonds and cash more than three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But before you put all your money into stocks, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks are far more volatile than bonds, meaning their returns
bounce around more from month to month and year to year. Cash is
the least volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In their worst year (1931), stocks plunged 43 percent, while
long-term corporate bonds lost only 8.1 percent in their poorest
year (1969), and the worst return on cash was a minuscule loss of
0.02 percent (in 1938).
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks have fallen by at least 20 percent about once every
five years since 1926. There's nothing unique about this year's
decline. On average, it has taken two years and five months to
break even for an investor who put money into stocks just before a
20 percent or greater drop.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 crash (when stocks lost 86 percent of their value
over three years), though, it took until 1944 to break even. And
after the brutal 1973-74 bear market (when stocks fell 48 percent),
it took more than three years to break even _ and 10 years to break
even after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: Stocks are great long-term investments; bonds
and cash make more sense for shorter time periods. Think of stocks
as a roller coaster, bonds as bumper cars and cash as a carousel.
And tune out prognostications about which will do best in the short
run.
 &UR; BEFORE YOU GET STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to invest in stock funds, there are a few
things you should do before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you pay off high-interest debt such as credit
cards. Next, amass a cash cushion equal to at least three months of
your after-tax salary in a bank CD or a money-market account. Or,
if you are bolder, take out a home-equity line of credit that you
can tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've taken those steps, there are two things you'll need
to determine about yourself: Can you tolerate fear-inspiring market
declines like the recent one without selling your stock funds? And
how long will it be until you'll need your money?
</P>
<P>
   To find out how much risk you can handle, answer the following
two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. The news media is filled with stories quoting experts who
predict stocks will lose money in the coming decade. Many suggest
investing in real estate. You would:
</P>
<P>
   a. consider selling some stocks funds and buying real estate
</P>
<P>
   b. be concerned, but stick to your long-term goals
</P>
<P>
   c. dismiss the articles as a sign of unwarranted pessimism over
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Which of the following statements best describes you:
</P>
<P>
   a. I often change my mind and have trouble sticking to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   b. I can stay with a strategy as long as it seems to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   c. Once I make up my mind to do something, I tend to follow
through with it regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``a'' both times, consider yourself a low-risk
investor. If you answered with one ``a'' and one ``b,'' or two
``b's,'' or one ``a'' and one ``c,'' you're a medium-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered with at least one ``c'' and no ``a's,'' you're a
high-risk investor _ able to hold on to stocks no matter how rough
the market gets.
 &UR; HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STOCKS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some stockbrokers and financial planners would have you believe
that figuring out how much to invest in stocks and lower-risk
investments is as difficult as calculus. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Following are two tables: one for investing for retirement and
the second for investing to meet all other goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table for retirement calls for you to invest a larger
portion of your money in stocks. That's because most people can
expect to live to be 85 or 90 years old _ a long time for your
money to grow, even in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)

</P>
<P>
   Armed with this knowledge, and details that I'll give you on
which funds to buy in the next article, there's no need for you to
buy a fund with a sales charge, or to pay a stock broker or
financial adviser to help you select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, once you become accustomed to the ups and downs of
the market, you may find you're more able to tolerate them. If so,
take the risk test again and see if you should increase the
percentage of your money you put into stock funds.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: GETTING STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know you need to get started investing _ or
that you need to invest in a more methodical way. It's another
thing to actually pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination is the enemy of investors. You know all the
excuses: Either you don't have enough money, you'd rather spend it
on something else, the market seems too risky just now or you're
already so far behind that starting would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel better about making a move if, instead of plunging
in, you take a tentative step or two. Invest a modest but fixed
amount from your salary in shares of stock funds every month.
</P>
<P>
   Funds often allow a monthly (or quarterly) minimum investment of
as little as $25 or $50, as long as you agree to make regular,
automatic investments via your checking account. Having the fund
company take the money out of your bank account each month is a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work, your
employer will similarly invest money straight from your paycheck.
And most companies match at least part of your investment, offering
an instant, substantial return.
</P>
<P>
   Money you don't see is money you won't spend and money you soon
will find you hardly miss. If you have to sit down and write a
check to a mutual fund every month, it's much easier to find
something else you'd rather spend the money on than your future.

CONGRESS'S TWISTED PRIORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON &UR;  &LR; -- It at least meets the minimal requirements for
farce that an impeachment that had to be marketed as not really
impeachment should now be followed by a trial that wouldn't really
be a trial.
</P>
<P>
   And that farce ought to be minimally tolerable for the rest of
the country because it is Congress's problem, not necessarily of
importance to people who have real lives.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the political forces obsessed with President Clinton
are attempting to arrange things so that a president can't be
president because of Congress's inability to deal with its problem
_ an impeachment case that can't be made or even presented without
transforming the Republican Senate into a sibling of the Republican
House.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic tip of this iceberg is the suggestion that the
president should not be allowed to present his policy agenda to
Congress and the country from the well of the House in two weeks
simply because Congress might still be wrestling with procedural
absurdities involving a possible Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable twisting of logic and fact, one of the early,
bipartisan Senate maneuverers, Slade Gorton, Republican of
Washington, says it would be ``unseemly and distracting'' for the
president to present the State of the Union message in these
circumstances. Unseemly and distracting for whom?
</P>
<P>
   Another maneuverer, Bob Torricelli, Democrat of New Jersey,
suggests postponement on the absurd grounds that without a
resolution the state of the union will be ``unclear.'' To whom?
</P>
<P>
   But Gordon's principal maneuvering collaborator for the moment,
Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, is much closer to what
matters to the country when he warns that Jan. 19 may be the
drop-dead date after which the same partisan stain that soiled the
House last month will begin to spread over the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why President Clinton would be nuts,
constitutionally as well as politically, to follow a nonimpeachment
impeachment and a nontrial trial with acquiescence to any effort to
make him a nonpresident president.
</P>
<P>
   The first political rule of his office is that no incumbent
should ever sink to the level of a dysfunctional Congress.
</P>
<P>
   That also happens to be where the country is: appalled at what
is going on here and insistent that their concerns be addressed. If
push comes to shove, Democratic leader Dick Gephardt should arrange
a big show for Clinton in his St. Louis district, and the president
should deliver his State of the Union there.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the latest maneuvering lurks the political agenda of the
right, who would subvert what was designed to be a rare, solemn,
consensus-driven constitutional process one last way. Just as
impeachment was dumbed down to censure-plus in the House, and just
as a nontrial trial looms in the Senate, so removal from office via
conviction is to be replaced by forced resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone forget, the House impeachment vote in December was
supposed to be accompanied by a vigorous resignation movement. That
was short-circuited by the bombing of Iraq, a demonstration of
Clinton's incumbency that was so obvious and powerful that it has
become part of right as well as left conspiracy lore.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks later, his In Box is stuffed with important
material that the last, more Republican Congress couldn't handle:
HMO abuses, school-construction financing, campaign-finance reform,
long-term restructuring for Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, the country got a better look at the president's
proposal to use targeted tax credits to help two million families
cope with the nightmare of long-term care of seriously ill
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Every day Clinton spends pushing this stuff not only responds to
people's concerns but demonstrates that the president remains
committed to governing while others want all wheels to stop
turning. And it keeps resignation from gaining a political foothold
via Clinton's own inactivity. Above all, an assertive president is
essential for the complex, delicate tasks required to help manage a
fragile international economy.
</P>
<P>
   Removing a president was designed to be so difficult that only
national consensus could lead Congress to do it. If Clinton does
his duty, this cannot be accomplished through the back door of
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the interest groups on the right and aggressive
House Republicans with their Hail Mary recovery strategy _ a real
Senate trial, complete with live witnesses, that gradually either
persuades or wears down public opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But this is precisely the trial that many Senate Republicans
fear (and most Democrats hope) will transform them in the public's
view into the House impeachment mob _ to no end beyond their
deserved embarrassment and condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why all this is for the moment Congress's
self-created problem.
</P>
<P>
   The president should let the Senate wrestle with it, minimizing
his own involvement with the maneuvering and maximizing his public
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   He should give a State of the Union address in two weeks and,
more important, let his own priorities speak volumes about
Congress's.

LET'S HEAR IT FOR BONHOMME! 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   How can you not love a 7-foot snowman who dances, chats, and
brings cheer to everyone he encounters? And how can you not love
the event he represents _ the Quebec Winter Carnival?
</P>
<P>
   The carnival, to be held Jan. 29 to Feb. 14 in Quebec City, is
recognized as the world's biggest winter celebration and the
world's third-largest carnival (after those in Rio and New
Orleans). And its jovial snowman-spokesman, Bonhomme Carnival, is
one of the world's most easily recognized figures, with his bright
red stocking cap, multicolored sash, and massive white body. He has
a nice residence, too: an ice palace with colored lights shining
through its shimmering walls.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec City's first winter carnival was held in 1894 and
sporadically thereafter until 1955, when a group of businessmen
decided that an annual carnival would brighten winter days and make
cash registers ring. Mission accomplished: The 45th Winter
Carnival, to be held at a variety of sites, promises to be grand
indeed, with a flurry of activities, shows, and exhibitions. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   --Sporting events. In winter, Quebec is always alive with
skiing, skating, sledding, and snowmobiling. In fact, for the 17
days of the carnival, the Plains of Abraham are transformed into a
family playground. But there is also the International Canoe Race,
in which teams from around the world attempt to cross the mighty
St. Lawrence River between Quebec City and Levis. Then there's the
Roll in the Snow, an invigorating event for people foolishly
dressed only in bathing suits. Add to those events the Provincial
Dogsled Racing Championship, the Soapbox Derby, the Car Race on
Ice, and the Cross-Country Skiing Classic.
</P>
<P>
   --Night parades. Each year, more than a quarter-million
spectators bundle up to watch the glittering event, with its
floats, marching bands, and clowns winding wonderfully through the
streets of the city. This year's parades are on Feb. 6 and 13.
</P>
<P>
   --Fine art. The International Snow Sculpture, one of the most
popular activities, is truly a fine art exhibit. Some 45 teams of
artist-sculptors from around the world use their skill to create
whatever their imagination allows _ from magnificent buildings to
whimsical animals to a giant scissors cutting out ``paper'' dolls.
There are also exhibits of traditional sculpture and photography as
well as a popular symposium.
</P>
<P>
   And through it all, there's Bonhomme Carnival, welcoming
visitors at opening ceremonies, appearing at events, greeting
participants, and holding a dance called Bonhomme's Ball. After the
carnival, he goes globetrotting, spreading the word about Quebec
City all over North and South America, Europe, and Asia. You're a
good man, Bonhomme!
</P>
<P>

or visit www.quebec-region.cuq.qc.ca. For more information on the
province of Quebec, call 800-363-7777. For lodging information,
call 888-737-3789. For ski lovers, Mont-Sainte-Anne is just 25
miles from Quebec City; call 800-463-1568. The Quebec tourism
people say that with current exchange rates, the US dollar goes at
least 40 percent further across the border.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: Jose McIntyre's restaurant-lounge on Milk Street in
Boston has a Mexican-Irish theme and is run by an Australian. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``Souvenirs are perishable; fortunately, memories are
not.'' _ Susan Spano. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Museum of the month: The four-year-old Ramen Museum in Yokohama
attracts more visitors than the National Art Museum, according to
the JAL Newsletter. On display are many types of ramen _ a tasty
noodle _ from around the world, including an instant version with
Arnold Schwarzenegger on the cup. Three-hundred Japanese noodle
bowls are also displayed. The lower floor, meanwhile, reproduces a
Japanese street at dusk, with 88 miniature buildings. And there are
nine on-site ramen restaurants that draw so many diners that the
lines stretch for blocks. At the gift shop, you can even buy ramen
jewelry, key chains, and ``emergency ramen,'' lasting up to three
years. The man behind it all, Yoji Iwaoka, hopes to bring a similar
museum to Las Vegas. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of ramen: The Japanese really do love the stuff. They
consume 5.3 billion servings a year, in about 600 varieties. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gaining something in the translation: The American slogan for Salem
cigarettes, ``Salem _ Feeling Free,'' was translated for the
Japanese market into ``When smoking Salem, you feel so refreshed
that your mind seems to be free and empty.'' (With thanks to
frequent contributor Mike Schuster of Foxborough and
Mailbits.com.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oh say can you sing: The national anthem of Greece has 158 verses. &QL; 
 &QL; 
On the menu: Alain Raye, the new chef of Julien at Le Meridien
Boston, is the former chef-owner of three Michelin-starred
restaurants in France. And although his cuisine may have a
classical French accent, it is constantly evolving. Some samples
from his new menu: Atlantic salmon with spinach, roasted potatoes,
and Asian flavors; sauteed Maine lobster with green lentils,
candied lemon zest, and an old port sauce; and roasted rack of lamb
with nicoise olive crust and a compote of eggplant and vegetable au
gratin. If that has whetted your appetite, as it has ours, call
617-451-1900, ext. 7120, for more information or reservations.

THEY'VE MADE ALL THE WRONG MOVES

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There wasn't much of a reception for the Patriots when they flew
home from Jacksonville Sunday night. Maybe Bob Kraft could have
hired cardboard fans to greet the disheartened Patriots at
Providence airport.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Patriots crept back to New England under the quiet
cover of darkness, and Monday many returned to Foxboro Stadium to
say good things about coach Pete Carroll and empty their lockers
for the long, cold offseason.
</P>
<P>
   And what an offseason it should be. While Bill Parcells and the
hated New York Jets prepare for a home playoff game that should
send them into the AFC Championship, the Patriots will go about the
business of getting well for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the healing comes naturally. The bones in Drew Bledsoe's
right index finger will recover, as will the fracture in Terry
Glenn's ankle. Ted Johnson's torn biceps will mend and he'll return
to prowl the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   But what do we do about the emotional scarring? How can the
loyal Patriot fan base ever feel the same way about this franchise?
New England football fans have filled every seat in dreadful
Foxboro Stadium since Kraft bought the team, yet he is moving the
team because he claims he can't compete at a championship level
without a new stadium. Compounding the planned flight, he insults
the fandom by pretending he's merely relocating to a nearby New
England city. We all know that Hartford is really a slum suburb of
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And what about coach Pete Carroll? The injured Patriots were
routed in three of their last four games (an aggregate minus-50 in
the three losses), beating only a curious 49ers team that decided
Dec. 20 would be their ``bye week.'' New England's mugging in the
Meadowlands was abject humiliation, and only Carroll could make
Sunday's stinkbomb in Jacksonville sound like a gutty overtime loss
on the frozen tundra of Lambeau Field.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll spoke of Sunday's effort as ``an indication of what this
group's about, whether you see it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Please. Could Daddy Pete stop giving his boys credit for trying?
These are professional athletes. They're paid to ``try.'' They're
paid to ``compete.'' They do not deserve compliments for this. And
be wary of players who rally 'round the head coach, because some of
them are the ones who want to keep the gravy train rolling. If
there's one trademark of this Carroll regime, it's lack of
accountability. Pete has thus far been a two-year substitute
teacher. The students can do what they want.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Get arrested. Dive off the stage. Skip offseason
conditioning. Rip the coach in the locker room and in the papers.
Let your man beat you on the other side of the ball. Daddy Pete
will still love you.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Did you watch the 49ers and Packers after the Patriots-Jaguars
game? It looked like those teams were playing a different sport.
Realistic New England fans should be relieved that the Patriots
don't have to go to Denver this weekend for a truly bloody finish.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they were hurt. Key players _ none more obvious than Bledsoe
_ were absent down the stretch. But the Jaguars also were peppered
with injuries yet managed to dismantle New England's team with
ease. Think about this, Patriot fans: Your 1998-99 warriors gave up
more points than they scored. Ouch. In 17 games, the final tally
was Opponents 354, Patriots 347.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Joe Morgan was fired by the Red Sox after keeping
the woeful 1991 Townies in the race until late September? Joe's
parting shot was, ``These guys aren't as good as everybody thinks
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that's what we're looking at now?
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is the fact that the Patriots have gone downhill
the last two years (yes, since Parcells left). And since they got
rid of that bully who didn't know talent, their draft crop has
yielded some sideline chattel, plus three first-round picks: Robert
Edwards (who may be Troy O'Leary with shoulder pads), Chris Canty
(who should be released), and Tebucky Jones (now we know what
``press corner'' means: ``a guy who can be called for pass
interference on every play'').
</P>
<P>
   Aren't we all glad that Kraft showed Parcells who was boss two
years ago? Thank God we've turned things over to people who really
know talent.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are a mess. The team is leaving town. The coach
should be leaving town. And the owner is ``lyin' and laughin' ''
all the way to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Fans should be outraged about the Patriots. The good news is
that they'll soon be Hartford's problem.

SLOPPY FIESTA AN ENDLESS BUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ OK, it's Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no argument. Tennessee has won its first national
championship in football since the Truman Administration, defeating
Florida State, 23-16, before a record crowd of 80,470 at Sun Devil
Stadium in the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The game Tuesday night no doubt will be recounted in song and
story in any city or hamlet where orange is the favorite color. The
rest of us, should we ever be forced to dwell on it, will remember
only one thing _ that we could not wait for it to end.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Tee Martin hooked up with Peerless Price for a
79-yard fourth-quarter touchdown that gave the Volunteers an
insurmountable 20-9 lead, all the general interest had been drained
out of this sloppy mess of a national championship game. It was so
bad in spots, so dreary, so downright insulting, that you almost
felt like lobbying for Ohio State, Tulane, or even Mt. Union to be
declared the new No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was it? Well, they told us that side judge Colin
McDermott had to miss the second half because of a ruptured right
calf tendon. I'll bet. He probably couldn't stand to watch any
more.
</P>
<P>
   He had, after all, just officiated a first half that was
historic in its interminable ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Things I Could Have Done In The Same Time It Took To Play The
First Half:
</P>
<P>
   --Settled the NBA labor dispute
</P>
<P>
   --Run a marathon
</P>
<P>
   --Written biographies of Charlemagne, Martin Luther, and Jerry
Garcia
</P>
<P>
   --Composed an entire Broadway score
</P>
<P>
   --Learned to speak Finnish
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if there weren't any good plays, because there were.
Martin hooked up with the Peerless one for 76 yards, a play that
went from one 12-yard line to the other (how's that for elegant
symmetry?). No one can say that wasn't a good play. There also was
a breathtaking 51-yard punt return by Florida State's Peter
Warrick, a run he began by swivel-hipping past three air-grasping
defenders. Trust me when I say this was a very sweet play.
</P>
<P>
   However . . .
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, however. That first half was, generally speaking, a
pathetic eyesore of a travesty of a fiasco. There was no rhythm, no
flow, no sense of purpose. It was all about false starts and
roughing kickers and holding and personal fouling. It also was
almost undoubtedly about a pair of teams that had been idle for far
too long, and who were a bit too anxious to make good. Florida
State had 8 penalties for 67 yards. Tennessee had 6 for 30. On its
first possession, Florida State had a second and 40, and, no, I am
not making this up.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should we forget the inventive Florida State possession
following Warrick's spectacular return. Sebastian Janikowski kicked
a 34-yard field goal to end it, and thus Florida State, thanks to
penalties and general tomfoolerry, had the following scoring,
you'll pardon the expression, drive: 10 plays, 10 yards. In 4:33,
and no, I am not making this up, either.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties were more than simply disruptive. One was
virtually catastrophic. At the tail end of the aforementioned
76-yard pass play, Tennessee had gotten bogged down and was willing
to settle for a 24-yard Jeff Hall field goal. But no. FSU was
nailed for roughing the kicker as the ball went between the
uprights. Tennessee took the penalty and Martin wound up hitting
Shawn Bryson for a 4-yard touchdown pass to open the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   You had to wonder what Ohio State coach John Cooper was thinking
as he watched all this. His only hope to get a title via the polls
was a fumbling, stumbling game in which both teams looked like
refugees from the Ivy League. And here it was. The only problem was
that he needed Florida State to win such a game, and early in the
second period it was trailing, 14-0, the result of the touchdown
pass and a 54-yard interception return by cornerback Dwayne
Goodrich.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you love to have been the proverbial fly on the
Cooper den wall as he watched Florida State's offense perform as if
Bobby Bowden had morphed into all five Marx Brothers? You might
expect that the vaunted Seminoles would line up and try to knock
the snot out of the Vols _ especially since they were starting an
inexperienced quarterback named Marcus Outzen. But the 'Noles did
nothing of the sort.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and/or offensive coordinator Mark Richt apparently came
into the game believing that trickeration was the only way to go.
Now, I love razzle and dazzle as much as, and probably more than,
the next guy, but some of the Florida State stuff was just plain
goofy. How do you think they arrived at that second and 40, anyway?
By throwing a second pass behind the line of scrimmage and seeing
it turn into a big loss; that's how. It was almost as if the 'Noles
had too much respect for the Vols. Next time, I have two words for
the 'Noles: Smash and Mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The second half was better to watch, if only in the sense that
nothing could have been worse than the first. You had to like
Florida State's chances. It was trailing by only 5, and had given
up a mere 45 points in 540 minutes of 1998 second-half play. And
drove to the Tennessee 32. But Darwin Walker sacked Outzen for a
key 10-yard loss, forcing a punt. That's when Martin found his
favorite target, Peerless LeCross Price, for the 79-yarder that
brought Tennessee a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   And believe me when I tell you it was not one millisecond too
soon.

PLAYER TURNOVER IS NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. . . . now let's get to the players.
</P>
<P>
   There has been, and will continue to be, much speculation about
the future of Patriots coach Pete Carroll and, to a lesser degree,
vice president of player personnel Bobby Grier. It has been said
that the latter will decide the short-term future of the former, or
at least advise owner Bob Kraft on the matter, and that an
evaluation of both will take place within the next two to three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Why Kraft needs three weeks to decide about them is beyond me,
but that's a topic for another day.
</P>
<P>
   As for today, the topic is the players who wear the New England
uniform and the fact that more than a few of them should no longer
hold that privilege come September.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Patriots have been unable to run the ball when
they needed to. Running backs have been blamed for this. Offensive
coordinators have been blamed for this. Line coaches have been
blamed for this.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only one thing has been consistent during these seemingly
endless struggles: the men doing the blocking.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems from here that one thing is sure. This was not the
fault of Curtis Martin. It is not the fault of Robert Edwards. This
was not the fault of Larry Kennan. It is not the fault of Ernie
Zampese. This was not the fault of Fred Hoaglin. It is not the
fault of Paul Boudreau.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots can't run the ball because their offensive line
can't run-block. They can pass-block as well as anybody. But as a
group they cannot run-block. Not even a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   They can't do this because they are not physical enough at the
line of scrimmage, and one has to assume that is so because they
can't be, not because they choose not to be.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that they are not trying. Clearly when a run is called
for, they are trying to knock people back. But 1,000-yard rusher or
no 1,000-yard rusher, they aren't succeeding, especially when they
need to most, and that is because the most physical run-blocker
they have is Zefross Moss, and we're not talking about Arnold
Schwarzenegger here when we're talking Zefross Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago the Patriots paid about $5 million to ensure
that they wouldn't lose guards Max Lane and Todd Rucci. By
midseason Lane was on the bench and Rucci was being platooned with
untested youngsters named Heath Irwin and Damon Denson.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin and Denson did enough that by the 16th game of the season,
Carroll was platooning all four of them as if this were a Little
League game in which every kid had to play at least an inning.
Then, when crunch time came in Jacksonville, Lane suddenly
resurfaced and played nearly the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, this is absurd. Either Lane and Rucci can do the job
or they can't. If they can't they must go, because you can't pay
guys who can't run-block $2.5 million apiece to watch other guys
who can't run-block play for less in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, meanwhile, has had minimal impact since he got here, and
All-Pro Bruce Armstrong finally appears to be showing his age at
33. He has been one of the best left tackles in football for at
least half of his 12 seasons and is still the best the Patriots
have. He may not be what he was, though he's still good enough to
start for most teams. Perhaps it is time he is shifted to the right
side and a younger, quicker man moves to left tackle, as Dallas did
with Erik Williams and Larry Allen quite successfully.
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen, the Patriots have to go out and pay the
price for a veteran tackle, because Ed Ellis is not the answer (and
don't even bring up Scott Rehberg). Then they have to handle
Armstrong with the respect he deserves _ unlike the tawdry way his
teammates treated him when they took away his captaincy for the
playoffs with a frivolous vote that Carroll allowed a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   In their youth and self-absorption, the young men in the locker
room voted Drew Bledsoe and Ted Johnson postseason captains _ two
guys who wouldn't even dress for the game. This irked Armstrong no
end, and while some may say that was petty on his part, he is a
proud man who has done more in his career than most of them will
ever accomplish. He deserved far better from them and from Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll never should have allowed that to happen because
Armstrong is one of the few players in that locker room who would
tell his teammates what they didn't want to hear. Once he was voted
out, he said little, and who could blame him?
</P>
<P>
   Tackles aside, the guard situation is the most glaring problem,
and kidding themselves about the futures of the four players they
have will not change anything for the Patriots, only delay the
inevitable. Somebody has got to go and somebody new has got to
appear, and if that is a salary cap problem, then let the boy
genius, Andy Wasynczuk, figure it out since he's the guy who helped
create this fiscal mess in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   As for center, Dave Wohlabaugh is a free agent and will get a
lot of play. It has been much ballyhooed in these parts that he is
one of the best centers in football. Fact is, he's more than
serviceable but not even the best center in the AFC East. That
distinction belongs to the Jets' Kevin Mawae.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he should be re-signed if the price is reasonable,
because next to left tackle, center is the hardest spot to fill.
Wohlabaugh will improve over time, especially if forced to play
more physically. But he needs guards next to him who can knock
people off the ball and win the line of scrimmage. The place to
find such players is in free agency, and the first place to look is
Green Bay, where both right guard Adam Timmerman and right tackle
Earl Dotson become free agents in February. Or they could look to
Jacksonville tackle Brian DeMarco or Minnesota tackle Korey
Stringer.
</P>
<P>
   What can't be done again is to stand pat with guys who have been
unable for four years to get a yard when they needed it, through
two sets of coordinators, position coaches, and backs. Put the
blame where it belongs for this. On the players.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's move on to wide receiver. Go get one. Go get one like
Green Bay's Antonio Freeman or San Francisco's Terrell Owens. Pay
him what it takes and tell Terry Glenn he is their partner and the
other guy is The Man until Glenn shows he can stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of cases, Glenn stays healthy, and Owens or Freeman
or even J.J. Stokes is acquired, giving Bledsoe two explosive deep
threats plus reliable Troy Brown as the third receiver (all he does
is make plays when someone remembers to put him on the field).
</P>
<P>
   A true threat to Glenn's status as chief weapon would put
pressure on him to produce more consistently and find a way to stay
on the field. This is called competition.
</P>
<P>
   (Aside: Do not, repeat, DO NOT try to sign Carl Pickens. He is
as dangerous as the other receivers on the field but equally as
dangerous to his own team off it. He is selfish with a capital S,
and under Carroll's philosophy of each guy being responsible for
himself, he'd be a coach killer.)
</P>
<P>
   Now let's move across the line of scrimmage. The Patriots missed
the chance to get Vonnie Holliday last year because they made a
fundamental drafting error. They made their second first-round pick
before they made their first first-round pick, mentally writing in
Tebucky Jones's name before they had made their first selection.
</P>
<P>
   When Holliday slid to them, they didn't adjust and took Edwards
knowing Jones was the second choice and likely wouldn't be there in
the second round. Holliday rushing the quarterback here instead of
in Green Bay would have been a welcome sight to the Patriots'
secondary and to Willie McGinest and Chris Slade.
</P>
<P>
   That is now ancient history but it is a mistake that best not be
repeated this year, the last one in which the ransom for Bill
Parcells will be paid. To date, the Patriots have received five
picks for Parcells and the loss of Curtis Martin. That has netted
them Edwards and Chris Floyd for Martin and Denson, Tony Simmons,
and Sedrick Shaw for Parcells. Those have not been fair exchanges
or anything close.
</P>
<P>
   They now have one last chance, at the bottom of the first round,
the final Parcells payoff. If they don't get a player with that
pick, it was all for naught.
</P>
<P>
   If they can package that pick and their own No. 1 (21st overall)
to move up significantly and get an impact player, they should do
it, because they don't have enough of them. If they can't, they
need to seek a defensive lineman in free agency and then use those
picks for a receiver or offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   However they do it, they need a defensive lineman who can make
an impact. McGinest may yet be that guy if he can stay healthy, but
he cannot do it alone, and if they insist on putting Slade in
coverage more than 50 percent of the time they need somebody else
to pressure the quarterback besides safety Lawyer Milloy. Half the
reason the secondary struggled was that opposing quarterbacks had
enough time to eat lunch before they ate the secondary's lunch
passing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, if they truly believe that Todd Collins is damaged
goods, they need to find another full-time linebacker to team with
Slade and Ted Johnson, because Tedy Bruschi is not the answer. He
is a good situational player who can make some things happen in the
right circumstance. But he is not an every-down player, as he made
clear the last few weeks when pressed to play full-time after
Collins was injured.
</P>
<P>
   If half of those things can be done, the Patriots will be
greatly improved. If none are, their slow slide will continue. If
the Pats stand pat again, it's all over but the shouting, and that
shouting will be aimed at Pete Carroll and Bobby Grier.

 HEROIN USE HAS GROWN IN THE 1990s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA and ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The heroin that killed singer Boz Scaggs' son on
New Year's Eve is a potent form that during the 1990s has lured
more people from various walks of life into using a drug once
associated only with skid-row junkies.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, when street-grade heroin was 3 to 5 percent pure,
injecting it was the only way to get high.
</P>
<P>
   But during the past decade, purity has shot up to as much as 50
or 60 percent, while the price has fallen to as little as $40 a
gram. The result: More people have been willing to snort and smoke
it.
</P>
<P>
   While those methods don't produce as strong a high, they are
less intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known Monday what method Oscar Scaggs used to ingest
the fatal dose of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting more common now, and people are not shooting it
as much anymore. We're finding a lot more people who are smoking
it. They call it `Chasing the Dragon,''' said police Inspector Matt
Hanley, a 10-year veteran of the city's narcotics division.
</P>
<P>
   The ``dragon'' refers to the way the heroin smoke swirls up from
a heated base _ usually empty pen tubes or straws _ as users draw
it into their lungs.
</P>
<P>
   David E. Smith, founder of the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic, said
he's convinced that heroin dealers are targeting young people as
aggressively as cigarette makers have. Smith had been working with
the 21-year-old Scaggs on keeping him off heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids don't know whether it's 6 percent or 60 percent. It's
buyer beware,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He said heroin dealers have learned how to attract customers by
flooding the market with the cheap, potent product. Once people are
hooked, the dealers can cut it and raise the prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the tobacco industry, it's in a very immoral way
marketed to youth. They must have gone to the same business
school,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Quitting heroin is extremely difficult, and few people manage it
successfully. Instead, many experts believe in methadone
maintenance as a way to keep addicts' cravings at bay, allowing
them to return to somewhat normal lives. However, methadone is
strictly regulated by the federal government.

<P>
   PHOENIX - ``OH, no,'' my husband said immediately as he walked
through the front door. ``Not again. I'm not doing this again!''
</P>
<P>
   ``But this time it's real,'' I stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every vision you have of the Apocalypse is real,'' he
retorted. ``Remember when you insisted on renting ``Armageddon''
and ``Deep Impact'' on the same night and I caught you the next day
trying to dig a basement underneath the house?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for our own safety!'' I protested.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you bought those titanium bicycle helmets that we were
supposed to wear all of the time in case a meteor smacked us in the
head?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a precaution!'' I argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you spent the house payment on 40 cases of Ensure?'' he
continued. ``What was it this time? What did you see? Did Oprah
have Pat Robertson on again?''
</P>
<P>
   I ran to the coffee table and presented my evidence, handing him
the latest issues of both ``Vanity Fair'' and ``Esquire.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got these in the mail today,'' I said sternly. ``There are
stories in each of them about the Year 2000 computer bug problem!
It's coming and we have to be prepared!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what is all of this?'' he asked, pointing to the heap on
the dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I said, mistaking his query for genuine interest,
``this is our one-month food supply!''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to live for a month off this?'' he said,
looking over my rations. ``All you have here is chocolate-covered
raisins, Dots and seven, eight boxes of Bugles!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' I agreed, throwing my hands up. ``Walgreens was out
of Funyons ALREADY! People are catching on!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this . . .'' my husband said, picking up one of the items
from the table, ``a breast pump? I'm not drinking that!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Silly!'' I laughed. ``That's a filter so we can turn our urine
into water!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling your mother,'' my husband said, reaching for the
phone. ``And we're sending you back to that doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' I told her over the phone, ``this problem is serious.
You need to start stocking up on food now!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever think,'' she replied, ``that maybe JESUS IS
COMING BACK? Don't worry about me. I've been to confession! But
you've got enough sin on you to sink a ship, so if I were you, I'd
leave the breast pump alone and go back to church! Besides, this
whole thing was cooked up by Bill Gates so we all rush out and buy
new computers!''
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, my mother also swears that the outtakes from
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' are real mistakes and that the government
continually switches around the Fourth of July holiday so that it
always falls on a three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you right now,'' she added, ``don't you dare drink
milk from yourself. That's disgusting and it's a sin!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right, Mom,'' I agreed. ``We're getting a cow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' my husband yelled from across the room. ``You just got
a puppy and it's not even housebroken yet! No, you cannot have a
cow. The last thing I want to do is wake up in the morning and step
in a doody pie as big as a hubcap!''
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, we don't need a cow,'' I conceded, hanging up the
phone. ``A goat, then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You just get freaked so fast,'' my husband said, trying to
reason with me. ``Remember what happened after you read another
article in ``Esquire'' about the impending stock market disaster?''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I'm a spooker. I get spooked easily. After I read the stock
market story, I scared one of my friends so badly that she was
ready to spike a ``For Sale'' sign in her front yard, had already
packed up her favorite things and was going to move into a tent in
her mom's back yard in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   When I discovered that each of Ronald Reagan's first, middle and
last names had six letters, I was positive that he was the
antichrist, though I really doubt that the Devil could be found
today somewhere in California, wearing diapers and calling
everybody ``Mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   When ABCO started accepting debit cards, I was convinced that it
was only a matter of time before I would have my Mark of the Beast
credit-card number tattooed on my forehead, and that I would
eventually have to pledge my allegiance to Satan before I could buy
a half-pound of tomatoes and some maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when my parents sent me to church camp one summer
and we watched a movie in which the people in it just vanished from
their driver's seats, playgrounds and work desks and just flew up
into the sky. The people left on Earth then either got crucified on
light poles and billboards or had their heads chopped off by
Satan's storm troopers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrifying film, and I now realize that it's not
something a 12-year-old needs to see. My view is that it's OK to
inform kids about maxipads and STDs, but let's save the Rapture
movie for driver's ed or pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   After I came back from church camp, I spent the next six months
wearing a Ziggy T-shirt that proclaimed ``I'm a C.O.G.! (Child of
God)'' as insurance to get beamed up and worrying that if my best
friend didn't come to school that day, I had been left behind
because my mom hadn't washed Ziggy the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, OK,'' I said to my husband as he picked a food dehydrator
up off the table and shot me a look. ``Maybe I did get carried
away. Maybe the world won't end in a year, maybe it won't end until
2028, when the Aztec calendar stops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bugles will be very old by then,'' my husband said calmly.
``They will have lost their snappy crunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't to eat,'' I mentioned simply. ``They were to put
on our fingers and poke the eyes out of looters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking them back,'' he said. ``And I'm taking the
remaining cases of Ensure back, too.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returned from Walgreens, he had a present for me.
``Here,'' he said as he handed it over. ``There's nothing about the
Apocalypse in the table of contents. If you have to read a
magazine, read this.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked down at ``Martha Stewart Living'' in my hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't read this!'' I said, thumbing through it. ``How did
you even buy it without proof that you owned a glue gun? Wait! I
just found Martha's instructions for making a gas mask with
parchment paper, baker's yeast and some ordinary twigs! This will
come in handy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'll get the glue gun,'' my husband said. &QL;

AT-HOME BEAUTY MAKEOVERS WITH FRIENDS INVIGORATES THE SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Now that the holidays are behind us _ the
parties, the year-end projects, the family obligations and all that
shopping _ it's time to relax, spend time with your best buddies,
catch up and just dish.
</P>
<P>
   How to swing it?
</P>
<P>
   My friends, I recommend a Beauty Wallow. An at-home party where
you invite your best pals, ask them to bring something decadent _
chocolate and Champagne are good for starters, or caviar if you're
all feeling flush _ and hire beauty pros to come in and work
miracles.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I went to a Beauty Wallow was in Las Vegas. My
friend Marilyn wanted me to meet her friends and the easiest way
was to have a beauty evening for her beauty editor pal (me). She
hired a manicurist, a facialist and a masseuse, posted their prices
and invited her friends to sign up for the services. We sat around
Marilyn's family room, munching on pate and crackers, drinking a
very good Merlot, gossiping up a storm, and getting buffed and
puffed to our hearts' content.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how you do it:
</P>
<P>
   1. Call your favorite salon and ask if anyone _ a hair cutter, a
manicurist, a masseuse/masseur (some women love to have a male
massage tech work on them) and a skin care specialist _ would like
to make a housecall.
</P>
<P>
   2. Once you've decided on a date and time, ask six or seven of
your friends over for some divine decadence, request sensual food
that can be eaten with the fingers (strawberries dipped in brown
sugar and creme fraiche is an excellent out-of-season choice) and
tell them to bring cash. And lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   3. Be sure your fellow Beauty Wallowers know the price list. A
ballpark figure for a half-hour massage, for instance, is $40; for
a manicure, $25; a pedicure, $40. Facials vary depending upon how
much room the hostess has and if there is a bathroom free.
</P>
<P>
   4. Book about four hours so everyone can have all the services
if they choose (each different one should take a half-hour), so an
ideal time to do this kind of party is from 1 until 5 p.m. on a
Sunday afternoon. Like Super Bowl Sunday, when everyone who loves
football is definitely not around.
</P>
<P>
   It's my feeling that women, especially busy women who have
careers and families, do not do enough nice things for themselves.
But the therapeutic advantages of a great massage and a glass of
bubbly with your best buds is essential if you want to start the
new year with your spirits high and your shoulders relaxed.

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE NEW WOLVES &QL; 
 &UR; Rick Bass (Lyons, $18.95)
</P>
<P>
   Bass begins this eloquent book with a question rooted in
memories from his childhood, when men from his grandfather's
generation would talk about having seen buffalo, or black bears in
the Texas hill country, or mountain lions. Now, to his surprise,
Bass is telling his own stories of loss, and he is not yet 40. So
many animals are gone. ``What might the next 40 years bring?'' he
asks. ``The vanishing of horses, or crows, or butterflies? What
God, or gods, will summon their return, and step forward with mercy
to aid not their prosperity, but their mere survival?'' His subject
here is the reintroduction this past year of captive Mexican wolves
into the mountains of eastern Arizona _ a prescient choice, given
subsequent news reports about the shooting of several of the wolves
by unknown hands. Bass investigates the animals, the controversy
that surrounds them, and the questions to which we do not yet have
answers, all with enthusiasm, compassion and fair-mindedness toward
the different interests involved. This is terrific background
reading about an experiment that has gone awry, but apparently will
not be abandoned. ``There is no map of the future,'' Bass writes.
``We can only watch and listen, and hope to learn from the past, as
well as from the present, that which we did not learn the first
time.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A BROKEN HEART STILL BEATS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Anne McCracken and Mary Semel (Hazelden, $25)
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind has a dumb sense of vast loss _ that is all,'' Mark
Twain wrote 10 years after Susy, his 24-year-old daughter, died.
``It will take mind and memory months and possibly years to gather
together the details and thus learn and know the whole extent of
the loss.'' Tissues, tissues, you'll need lots to make your way
through this book. It is an anthology of writings on the death of a
child. By the time they met, McCracken and Semel, who both had lost
young sons, were beyond grief self-help books. ``We needed more
sustenance than inspiration,'' McCracken writes, and in turning to
literature to find it, they began to compile their book. Here are
excerpts from Raymond Carver's ``A Small, Good Thing,'' Reynolds
Price's ``The Promise of Rest,'' Isabel Allende's ``Paula,''
William Maxwell's ``So Long, See You Tomorrow'' and many other
novels, stories, biographies and memoirs. They offer a look not
just at the agony of loss _ the unexplained sorrow that Peter De
Vries called a ``question mark twisted like a fishhook in the human
heart'' _ but also at the resilience within all of us, the ability
to go on. ``Like young children who lie awake in their beds at
night, fearful of the silence, Mary and I had started off feeling
alone,'' McCracken writes. ``But just as children draw comfort from
their tape players, filling their bedrooms with sound, we found
comfort in the voices of other writers. The darkness still
enveloped us, but we now had company. Good company. And if they
could make it through the night, so could we.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SHOCKED, APPALLED, AND DISMAYED! &QL; 
 &UR; Ellen Phillips (Vintage, $12)
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead. Tell them how you really feel. But first, let Ellen
Phillips give you a few tips on how to complain effectively. First:
Calm down, and resolve not to curse, accuse or threaten. Target the
top people in the company. Line up your facts, then hit them
between the eyes with your mighty indignation. Suggest that they
could lose your business, then tell them what you want, very, very
clearly. And finally, the most important rule of all: Never give
up. Phillips has written a 300-page pep talk on the art of writing
letters of complaint. Along with the three words suggested in her
title, you also might load your letter with ``exasperated,''
``unbearable'' and ``mental anguish'' _ Phillips uses them
liberally, and they are very effective indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SHELTER &QL; 
 &UR; Bobby Burns (University of Arizona, $35 cloth, $12.95 paperback)
</P>
<P>
   Burns, a graduate of Arizona State University, was teaching
fifth grade at a Phoenix public school when things began to go sour
for him. He hurt his back in an accident at school, and a few weeks
later, his car was stolen. To relieve stress, he began drinking
excessively and using drugs. Eventually, the pain in his back
forced him to quit his job and apply for welfare. His book begins
on the day he bought a one-way bus ticket from Phoenix to Tucson
and became a resident in a shelter for the homeless. This brief
memoir of his 42 days there will not make readers identify with him
_ his troubles are rooted in his past, which included a
dysfunctional family with a history of child abuse and rampant
alcoholism. Despite all his troubles, however, he creates a spare,
almost monotonal portrait of the shelter and his fellow residents
that is both fascinating and moving. He does not sentimentalize the
men or the barrackslike place in which they live _ we are made
aware not only of scams and ugly histories, but also of the smells,
sounds and animosities that create constant turmoil at the shelter.
Burns endures the discomfort and dangers of his new life and makes
decisions that he believes will win him a better one. Eventually,
he secures a teaching job on an Indian reservation, and in time
saves enough money to rent a modest room of his own. In an
epilogue, he revisits the shelter after several months, updating us
on the people he met there and on his own troubles, which are never
far away despite his determination to rise above them. &QL;

being sworn in not only as Florida's 43rd governor but also as the
state's No. 1 e-mail addict. He likes the speed, precision and
technology of e-mail. Like many Floridians of his generation,
e-mail has become a part of his life and business. Symbolically, it
also suggests the generational change that has taken place in state
politics with the Dec. 12 death of Gov. Lawton Chiles and the
departure from public life of Gov. Buddy MacKay. (Crowley, Palm
Beach Post)

   WEATHER _ DAYTON _ What's ahead? that depends on who you ask.
Forecasters are watching a front that could dump another heavy load

<P>
   One last look at '98
</P>
<P>
   Before our thoughts disintegrate _
</P>
<P>
   To begin:
</P>
<P>
   Page One _ not much fun.
</P>
<P>
   There was Saddam Hussein, a global pain;
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden in big, big trouble;
</P>
<P>
   And Boris Yeltsin, his ruble in rubble.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan swapped nuclear greetings
</P>
<P>
   Instead of holding bilateral meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A sad day, too, for Gingrich the Newt
</P>
<P>
   Who dramatically gave himself the boot;
</P>
<P>
   Same eject for the speaker-elect,
</P>
<P>
   After a little hint from Larry the Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   But hold your cliches; it wasn't all bleak _
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plunged into overseas affairs
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to head off global scares.
</P>
<P>
   To Beijing, China, for more than tea
</P>
<P>
   Reducing tensions diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   To Jerusalem, Gaza and Ireland too.
</P>
<P>
   The message the same:
</P>
<P>
   ``Want peace? Up to you!''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the story of the year
</P>
<P>
   Was Here!
</P>
<P>
   And how, my friends, did the media handle
</P>
<P>
   The scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Nonstop!
</P>
<P>
   Ratings zoomed, sanity plopped!
</P>
<P>
   Paula peaked in '98.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the same with Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes with all those sexual whoppers
</P>
<P>
   Turned us all into shameless evesdroppers.
</P>
<P>
   And would you believe it?
</P>
<P>
   Grand jury and all,
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ratings were wall to wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on what IS is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America smiled _ and nodded its head.
</P>
<P>
   He was still the Comeback Kid,
</P>
<P>
   Although his id had reportedly slid.
</P>
<P>
   And get this surprise:
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ken Starr's accusatory mouthful,
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment was at first very doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   But when the vote was finally reached,
</P>
<P>
   Bingo for the GOP! Clinton impeached!
</P>
<P>
   Coming up next? The trial of the century
</P>
<P>
   Unless they come up with something censure-y.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but what about impeaching the media?
</P>
<P>
   Critics saw them as seedier and seedier.
</P>
<P>
   If you couldn't get Clinton on ``high crimes,''
</P>
<P>
   Why not the media on high slimes?
</P>
<P>
   Some stories were duds _ ``Tailwind'' was one.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also some home-run fun.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,
</P>
<P>

<P>
   One last look at '98
</P>
<P>
   Before our thoughts disintegrate _
</P>
<P>
   To begin:
</P>
<P>
   Page One _ not much fun.
</P>
<P>
   There was Saddam Hussein, a global pain;
</P>
<P>
   Osama bin Laden in big, big trouble;
</P>
<P>
   And Boris Yeltsin, his ruble in rubble.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan swapped nuclear greetings
</P>
<P>
   Instead of holding bilateral meetings.
</P>
<P>
   A sad day, too, for Gingrich the Newt
</P>
<P>
   Who dramatically gave himself the boot;
</P>
<P>
   Same eject for the speaker-elect,
</P>
<P>
   After a little hint from Larry the Flynt.
</P>
<P>
   But hold your cliches; it wasn't all bleak _
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plunged into overseas affairs
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to head off global scares.
</P>
<P>
   To Beijing, China, for more than tea
</P>
<P>
   Reducing tensions diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   To Jerusalem, Gaza and Ireland too.
</P>
<P>
   The message the same:
</P>
<P>
   ``Want peace? Up to you!''
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, the story of the year
</P>
<P>
   Was Here!
</P>
<P>
   And how, my friends, did the media handle
</P>
<P>
   The scandal?
</P>
<P>
   Nonstop!
</P>
<P>
   Ratings zoomed, sanity plopped!
</P>
<P>
   Paula peaked in '98.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the same with Monicagate.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes with all those sexual whoppers
</P>
<P>
   Turned us all into shameless evesdroppers.
</P>
<P>
   And would you believe it?
</P>
<P>
   Grand jury and all,
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ratings were wall to wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on what IS is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   America smiled _ and nodded its head.
</P>
<P>
   He was still the Comeback Kid,
</P>
<P>
   Although his id had reportedly slid.
</P>
<P>
   And get this surprise:
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ken Starr's accusatory mouthful,
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment was at first very doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   But when the vote was finally reached,
</P>
<P>
   Bingo for the GOP! Clinton impeached!
</P>
<P>
   Coming up next? The trial of the century
</P>
<P>
   Unless they come up with something censure-y.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but what about impeaching the media?
</P>
<P>
   Critics saw them as seedier and seedier.
</P>
<P>
   If you couldn't get Clinton on ``high crimes,''
</P>
<P>
   Why not the media on high slimes?
</P>
<P>
   Some stories were duds _ ``Tailwind'' was one.
</P>
<P>
   But there was also some home-run fun.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa,
</P>
<P>
   Who could ask for anything ``mosa''?
</P>
<P>
   All these people, love 'em or hate 'em _
</P>
<P>
   And the media, without any weeding
</P>
<P>
   Engaged in a furious frenzy of feeding.
</P>
<P>
   In short, these stories
</P>
<P>
   Kept millions from snoozing,
</P>
<P>
   As they watched the evening news-ing.

   IMPEACHMENT-TRIAL (Washington) _ With the impeachment trial of

KOONTZ DELIVERS AGAIN WITH `SEIZE THE NIGHT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an extraordinary follow to his terrifying ``Fear Nothing,''
Dean Koontz returns to the once bucolic town of Moonlight Bay,
Calif., the home of his protagonist, Christopher Snow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seize the Night'' (Bantam Books. $26.95. 401 pages) opens with
Snow out riding his bike near midnight, accompanied by his dog
Orson. This is normal routine for Snow, because he has a ``rare
genetic disorder that leaves him dangerously vulnerable to light.''
So nighttime is Snow's time.
</P>
<P>
   As he nears his neighborhood, he hears his old girlfriend, Lilly
Wing, screaming her 6-year-old son's name. Snow learns that someone
has taken Jimmy from his bed and Snow and Orson set out in pursuit.
The trail leads to Fort Wyvern, a closed military base where Snow's
now-dead mother worked on genetic experiments hoping to find a cure
for Snow's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Orson leads Snow to one of the base's huge warehouses. Snow
descends to the warehouse's sublevels and encounters a man who
tries to kill him. Snow escapes only to discover that Orson is
missing. Heading for the base's residential area, Snow calls his
friend Bobby and asks him to come to the base and help in the
search for Jimmy and Orson. He decides to wait in one of the
bungalows until Bobby shows up. After a call to his girlfriend
Sasha, Snow looks out the window, spots a troop of 22 mutated
rhesus monkeys and knows he is in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As Snow notes, ``ordinary monkeys don't attack human beings.
Likewise, ordinary monkeys are active in daylight and rest during
the night. ... Those who roam the darkness in Fort Wyvern and
Moonlight Bay aren't ordinary. They're hateful, vicious, psychotic
little geeks. If given the choice of a plump tasty mouse sauteed in
a butter sauce or the chance to tear your face off for the sheer
fun of it, they wouldn't even lick their lips with regret at
passing up the snack.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the monkeys enter the bungalow as Snow tries to hide
in the kitchen's broom closet. When the monkeys hear the noise of
Bobby's approaching vehicle, they flee. Unable to find the missing
boy and dog, Bobby and Snow return to Moonlight Bay before sunup.
Back at Snow's house, they learn from Sasha that more children have
disappeared. The three enlist the the aid of two other friends and
plot a return visit to Fort Wyvern. Even knowing that something
evil has altered their world, nothing can prepare them for what
they will encounter at the base.
</P>
<P>
   Page by page, Koontz builds the tension until it is almost
unbearable. And that's when you realize that you haven't finished
the first half of ``Seize the Night.'' Koontz is a born storyteller
_ ``Seize the Night'' is well-paced, full of believable dialogue in
a plot almost too scary to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyer.'' By Gardner McKay. Little, Brown and Co. $24. 453
pages.
</P>
<P>
   From 1959 to 1962, Gardner McKay played Capt. Adam Troy on the
ABC series ``Adventures in Paradise.'' An Adonis who couldn't act,
McKay drifted away from Hollywood, moved to Hawaii and had a
variety of occupations, including writing plays. Now, McKay has
produced his first thriller and it is first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   The story unfolds as the first victim of a madman self-named
Toyer is brought to the Kipness Memorial Neurological Center for
Advanced Research. Her name is Virginia Sapien, and she is alive
but a vegetable because Toyer performed a ``cervical cordotomy'' on
her. Now _ one year later _ his ninth victim is brought to Kipness
and put in the care of Dr. Maude Garance, the physician for the
other victims.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Smith, a reporter for the Los Angeles Herald, dogs Garance
for information and eventually the two begin to work together in
hope of finding Toyer. Garance takes on the L.A. district
attorney's office, which doesn't want to get involved in the Toyer
case because the victims are still ``alive.'' As the tension
mounts, Toyer will play both Smith and Garance until they near the
point of physical and emotional breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   McKay has crafted a truly heinous villain. Both the reporter and
physician are worthy protagonists in a psychological thriller that
will leave the reader mentally drained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death Takes Up a Collection.'' By Sister Carol Anne O'Marie.
St. Martin's Press. $21.95. 252 pages.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth mystery featuring septuagenarian Sister Mary Helen
and her sidekick Sister Eileen, San Francisco's Sister Carol Anne
O'Marie is in top form.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of St. Patrick's Day, Sisters Mary Ellen and Eileen
are delivering Irish soda bread to all the benefactors of Mount St.
Francis College. Their last stop is St. Agatha's parish, where they
interrupt a very tense meeting between Monsignor Joseph Higgins and
his parish council. The nuns stay for tea but leave as soon as good
manners permit.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning they learn that the monsignor has been poisoned
and the nuns are suspects, along with the six parishioners at the
meeting. Police Inspectors Kate Murphy and Dennis Gallagher summon
the eight to the rectory and begin interrogating them. Having seen
the sisters involved in other murder investigations, the police
urge them to keep their noses out of this case, but the good
sisters can't do that. They learn that the monsignor had been
embezzling parish funds, had an affair with one of the council
members, refused to say masses for the recently deceased wife of
another council member, refused to give communion to another
member's daughter, etc. Everyone had a motive, except for Sisters
Mary Ellen and Eileen. But all had access to the poison _ ground-up
rhododendron petals.
</P>
<P>
   If only the nuns who shepherded me through 12 years of parochial
schools had had an ounce of the humor of Sister Carol Anne.
Settling down for a couple of hours in the company of the noisy but
never boring sisters is always fun.

<P>
   DENVER _ They used to joke in Denver that you could stand at the
top of 17th Street, one of the main thoroughfares in the city
center, and send a bowling ball down its entire length without it
meeting a single obstacle along the way. That, though, was 10 years
ago. Today, your ball wouldn't travel half a block.
</P>
<P>
   Something surprising has happened here, and the rest of the
United States is starting to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where once its inner-city neighborhoods were the preserves of
down-and-outs and office workers who fled hotfoot at sundown to the
suburbs, they stand now as a symbol of urban renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, significant numbers of Denverites are abandoning the
suburbs and settling again in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   They have been answering the developers' advertisements with
headlines such as ``Kiss the 'burbs g'bye.'' Such is the appeal
suddenly of one section of Denver's downtown, an area of once
abandoned brick warehouses now converted into fashionable lofts,
nicknamed LoDo, property prices are now higher there than in any
neighborhood of Denver bar one.
</P>
<P>
   To answer demand, the city has embarked on a $1 billion housing
construction spree with 1,334 new apartments being built or
converted in the center.
</P>
<P>
   It is a movement that seems especially counter-intuitive in
Denver. The galloping sprawl of its freeways, malls and suburban
homes across the high plains and into the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains has been typical of the American experience since the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   And new evidence has emerged to suggest that Denver may not be
alone in the U.S. in seeing a revival of its once-rotting inner
core.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae
Foundation, a federal housing agency, shows that 24 cities across
the country expect to see increases in the numbers living in their
downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers are small relative to the human flood still
fueling the growth of the suburbs, they nonetheless represent a
significant reversal in the decades-old trend of urban flight.
</P>
<P>
   Cities highlighted in the report include Houston, which is
forecasting a quadrupling of its inner-city residents by the year
2010 to reach 9,500. Chicago, Seattle, Boston, Portland,
Minneapolis and Cleveland are also preparing to accommodate growing
downtown populations.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, according to the report, now ``has a distinct, vibrant,
fashionable image,'' that should translate into a near tripling of
its downtown population from 3,480 to 9,250 by the end of the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dan du Bois can claim to be one of the LoDo pioneers. He moved
here with his wife from an outer Denver suburb a decade ago and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved down here on a lark really. Back in the suburbs there
was nothing to do at night and we didn't know any of our neighbors.
We moved into the city to see what it was like.''
</P>
<P>
   When they first arrived, they looked out onto a crumbling
concrete overpass with homeless families living beneath it. Now
both the flyover and the families have gone.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, standing on the flat roof of the loft
apartment which she bought in 1993, Barbara Gibson surveyed the
LoDo landscape that she has grown to love.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street stands the Karmen Western Wear factory, a
group of four warehouse buildings that would fetch a sky-high price
from developers if one day the family firm decides to sell. To the
north, she points out the lighting towers of Coors Field, the home
of the Denver baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 opening of Coors Field, built in historic brick and
cast-iron style, further contributed to the resurrection of the
LoDo area.
</P>
<P>
   When she first moved to Denver six years ago from northern
California, Barbara, a financial executive for Compaq computers,
spent six months in the suburbs and ``hated it.'' She heard about
the new lofts being converted in LoDo through a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to find a neighborhood. I'm not married and I
don't have kids and the type of neighborhood I wanted, you just
can't find in the suburbs. There isn't a day when I don't go out my
door here and see people I know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely people without children and with sufficient
income who are finding new appeal in inner-city living. ``The
demographics are really working in our favor,'' says Bill Mosher,
who heads the Downtown Denver Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important, he adds, are the so-called
``empty-nesters,'' members of America's baby-boom generation who
have now seen their own children leave home and who have new money
to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden they don't want to drive all the time,''
Mosher argues, ``they don't want to mow their lawns and they want
to be in the fun of downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   With restaurants, a performing arts complex, two sports grounds
and a soon-to-open aquarium, downtown Denver has indeed acquired a
new bustle. And, like many other cities, it has benefited from
tumbling crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Relating the bowling-ball joke, Mosher underlines the extent of
the change in 10 years. ``People forget that Denver back in 1988
was sick, sick, sick.'' LoDo, where half the warehouses were empty,
was known then as Denver's skid row, ``because that is exactly what
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   A pivotal force in LoDo has been Jerry Glick, a real estate
developer who used to make his living building homes and malls in
the suburbs. In the mid-eighties, he turned his attention to LoDo
and headed the effort that led to its designation in 1989 as a
historic district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've invested 15 years of my life in downtown because I
believe in the revitalization of the core. If the core dies, the
city dies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an office of exposed brick and heavy wooden beams inside what
was once a seed warehouse, Glick warns that emulating Denver's
success in other cities may not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he said, cities need extraordinary political will,
from the office of the mayor down, to lift up an inner-city area
once it has gone downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is really a local phenomenon, not a national
one,'' he commented. ``But could it be done in other places?
Yes.'' &QL;

   DENVER _ They used to joke in Denver that you could stand at the
top of 17th Street, one of the main thoroughfares in the city
center, and send a bowling ball down its entire length without it
meeting a single obstacle along the way. That, though, was 10 years
ago. Today, your ball wouldn't travel half a block.
</P>
<P>
   Something surprising has happened here, and the rest of the
United States is starting to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Where once its inner-city neighborhoods were the preserves of
down-and-outs and office workers who fled hotfoot at sundown to the
suburbs, they stand now as a symbol of urban renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, significant numbers of Denverites are abandoning the
suburbs and settling again in the heart of the city.
</P>
<P>
   They have been answering the developers' advertisements with
headlines such as ``Kiss the 'burbs g'bye.'' Such is the appeal
suddenly of one section of Denver's downtown, an area of once
abandoned brick warehouses now converted into fashionable lofts,
nicknamed LoDo, property prices are now higher there than in any
neighborhood of Denver bar one.
</P>
<P>
   To answer demand, the city has embarked on a $1 billion housing
construction spree with 1,334 new apartments being built or
converted in the center.
</P>
<P>
   It is a movement that seems especially counter-intuitive in
Denver. The galloping sprawl of its freeways, malls and suburban
homes across the high plains and into the foothills of the Rocky
Mountains has been typical of the American experience since the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   And new evidence has emerged to suggest that Denver may not be
alone in the U.S. in seeing a revival of its once-rotting inner
core.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Brookings Institution and the Fannie Mae
Foundation, a federal housing agency, shows that 24 cities across
the country expect to see increases in the numbers living in their
downtown areas.
</P>
<P>
   While the numbers are small relative to the human flood still
fueling the growth of the suburbs, they nonetheless represent a
significant reversal in the decades-old trend of urban flight.
</P>
<P>
   Cities highlighted in the report include Houston, which is
forecasting a quadrupling of its inner-city residents by the year
2010 to reach 9,500. Chicago, Seattle, Boston, Portland,
Minneapolis and Cleveland are also preparing to accommodate growing
downtown populations.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, according to the report, now ``has a distinct, vibrant,
fashionable image,'' that should translate into a near tripling of
its downtown population from 3,480 to 9,250 by the end of the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Dan du Bois can claim to be one of the LoDo pioneers. He moved
here with his wife from an outer Denver suburb a decade ago and has
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved down here on a lark really. Back in the suburbs there
was nothing to do at night and we didn't know any of our neighbors.
We moved into the city to see what it was like.''
</P>
<P>
   When they first arrived, they looked out onto a crumbling
concrete overpass with homeless families living beneath it. Now
both the flyover and the families have gone.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent evening, standing on the flat roof of the loft
apartment which she bought in 1993, Barbara Gibson surveyed the
LoDo landscape that she has grown to love.
</P>
<P>
   Across the street stands the Karmen Western Wear factory, a
group of four warehouse buildings that would fetch a sky-high price
from developers if one day the family firm decides to sell. To the
north, she points out the lighting towers of Coors Field, the home
of the Denver baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 opening of Coors Field, built in historic brick and
cast-iron style, further contributed to the resurrection of the
LoDo area.
</P>
<P>
   When she first moved to Denver six years ago from northern
California, Barbara, a financial executive for Compaq computers,
spent six months in the suburbs and ``hated it.'' She heard about
the new lofts being converted in LoDo through a newspaper article.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted to find a neighborhood. I'm not married and I
don't have kids and the type of neighborhood I wanted, you just
can't find in the suburbs. There isn't a day when I don't go out my
door here and see people I know.''
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely people without children and with sufficient
income who are finding new appeal in inner-city living. ``The
demographics are really working in our favor,'' says Bill Mosher,
who heads the Downtown Denver Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important, he adds, are the so-called
``empty-nesters,'' members of America's baby-boom generation who
have now seen their own children leave home and who have new money
to spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden they don't want to drive all the time,''
Mosher argues, ``they don't want to mow their lawns and they want
to be in the fun of downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   With restaurants, a performing arts complex, two sports grounds
and a soon-to-open aquarium, downtown Denver has indeed acquired a
new bustle. And, like many other cities, it has benefited from
tumbling crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Relating the bowling-ball joke, Mosher underlines the extent of
the change in 10 years. ``People forget that Denver back in 1988
was sick, sick, sick.'' LoDo, where half the warehouses were empty,
was known then as Denver's skid row, ``because that is exactly what
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   A pivotal force in LoDo has been Jerry Glick, a real estate
developer who used to make his living building homes and malls in
the suburbs. In the mid-eighties, he turned his attention to LoDo
and headed the effort that led to its designation in 1989 as a
historic district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've invested 15 years of my life in downtown because I
believe in the revitalization of the core. If the core dies, the
city dies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an office of exposed brick and heavy wooden beams inside what
was once a seed warehouse, Glick warns that emulating Denver's
success in other cities may not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, he said, cities need extraordinary political will,
from the office of the mayor down, to lift up an inner-city area
once it has gone downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is really a local phenomenon, not a national
one,'' he commented. ``But could it be done in other places?
Yes.'' &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mary Leonard is not the sort of English
professor to lash out at her students. So she took herself by
surprise when, during a recent online classroom discussion
conducted entirely by e-mail, she snapped at a particularly
obstreperous student for failing to register when his class
assignment was due.
</P>
<P>
   ``I posted a message about that last week, and if you can't
recall it that's your tough luck,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by the rebuke, the student responded testily that he saw
nothing wrong in asking a direct question of his teacher and
expected a direct answer. That remark only provoked further
reactions from the cyberspatial classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Eric, you've got some balls. That's our professor you're
talking to,'' came one message. ``What happened to you? Did
somebody pee in your breakfast cereal this morning?'' came another.
``Touchy, touchy,'' came yet another.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the whole discussion threatened to veer out of control and
only a hasty call to order by Prof. Leonard shook the class back to
its senses.
</P>
<P>
   What had occurred was an instance of an e-mail phenomenon known
as ``flaming'' _ an outbreak of insults and tantrums of a kind that
seems particularly common online.
</P>
<P>
   According to Prof. Leonard, who teaches at the University of
Wisconsin, the use of the Internet changed the character of the
whole discussion.
</P>
<P>
   With the benefits of speed and a certain technological
headiness, the computer encouraged intemperate language and stroppy
behavior of a kind that the conventions of face-to-face contact
would almost certainly have held in check.
</P>
<P>
   And ``flaming'' is only one peculiarity that the Internet
appears to have brought to the English language. According to
various researchers, the Internet may also be eroding the formal
structure of the language, introducing errors of grammar and
spelling and making them acceptable, and winnowing away at the
overall complexity of English _ in other words, dumbing it down.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns were at the forefront of a recent annual
conference of the U.S. Modern Languages Association, a body that
brings together university teachers of language or literature.
</P>
<P>
   Universities have been quick to embrace the Internet as a tool
of learning and research, believing it can spread knowledge far
beyond the traditional academy, but many of the conference papers
delivered in San Francisco sounded a more preoccupied note.
</P>
<P>
   As one conference forum asked in its title, could the Internet
be ``killing English with technology?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Internet first took off, some academics predicted
that it would lead to reduced linguistic complexity, reduced
politeness and reduced variability _ in other words, a greater
homogeneity in the written language,'' explained Susan Herring of
the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that that was necessarily seen as a bad thing. Some people
viewed it as a liberation. The language might not be as elegant and
polished, but it would be more vital.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Prof. Herring's research, not all the predictions
have come true. Looking at the transcripts of an Internet
discussion forum between computer scientists over an 11-year period
_ from 1985 to 1996_ she found that the complexity of the language
actually stayed constant and the number of errors, if anything,
fell.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, signs of growing informality, and a
distinct falloff in politeness.
</P>
<P>
   Prof. Herring concedes that her research was almost certainly
conditioned by the educational levels and professional correctness
of her subjects, and that other social groups were likely to give
different results.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies have shown that ``flaming'' is more common
among men than women, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, several professors at the conference reported that
the Internet acted a bit like a sounding board for the unconscious
_ loosening people's inhibitions as they lose sense of who their
audience is and let their fingers express thoughts before their
brains have time to repress them.
</P>
<P>
   That might explain, for example, why people rarely boast of
their exploits in the sex parlors of Bangkok at parties, but
willingly consign their intimate diaries to an easily accessible
Internet site (as revealed by Ryan Bishop and Lillian Robinson in a
paper entitled ``How My Dick Spent Its Summer Vacation.'').
</P>
<P>
   This ``unbuttoning'' effect can also have positive
repercussions, particularly in classrooms where the computer gives
more reticent students the time and space to express their thoughts
more fully.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jacobs of East Carolina University said he was struck by
how many women, traditionally less forthcoming in discussions,
would give long, coherent accounts of their thoughts and feelings
online. On the other hand, men who were vocal in class tended to be
less original or insightful in their e-mail. &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ We're all sick of the euro _ and trading in the new
currency hasn't even begun yet. But it is going to dominate the
political and economic agenda in 1999, so you may as well find out
what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Make it your New Year's Resolution to learn 10 interesting
things about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yes, this crazy idea was dreamed up in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the UK was not a member of what we called the Common
Market. We looked on as the usual sandal-wearing suspects (France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg _ plus Italy)
decided to make economic love, not war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 the European Summit approved a proposal to create an
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The plans were expected to take
10 years. Thirty years later...
</P>
<P>
   2. Half the U.K. population has no idea what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the BBC2 Money Program polled 1,000 representative
people and found 51 percent were unable to name the new single
currency. Good guesses included ``Curo'' and ``Eu.'' Fashionable
guesses included ``Ecru.'' Only hopeless people guessed
``Equarder.'' Asked how much one euro was worth in Real Money,
estimates varied from 1p to (pounds sterling)8. In fact it's about
70p.
</P>
<P>
   3. The euro will make life cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Because the U.K. is no longer isolated, we'll be aware how much
more we pay for food and clothes. With any luck, retailers will
have to respond by dropping prices. The Internet boom will also
mean you'll be able to order cheaper euro-goods from abroad using a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   4. You can carry a million pounds' worth of euros in one
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a 500 euro note, worth (pounds sterling)350. Which
would mean (pounds sterling)1 million in euros could conveniently
fit in a briefcase. A million pounds in (pounds sterling)50 notes
would take up four cases, which attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is the ideal way to carry your ill-gotten gains around
a Europe without internal borders. This is just one of many reasons
why the euro may displace the dollar as the international
criminal's currency of choice. To combat this, Europol _ the new
police force of Euroland _ started work last October.
</P>
<P>
   5. Those old-fashioned currencies are already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and workers from Paris to Pisa will handle their francs
and lire until 2002, but the business side of these currencies is
in effect dead. The value of each currency against the euro was
fixed last Thursday and that's where it will stay forever.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday, businesses across Europe will accept cash in the
local currency but will run all their payment and accounting
systems in euros. Government and corporate bond issues will be in
euros, although each issuer will still be able to set the interest
rates it pays on its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   6. You can impress your neighbors with a euro-mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays and Abbey National have the first euro-mortgage deals,
with an interest rate reflecting the European Central Bank rate of
3 percent across Euroland (except Italy). This gives a
euro-mortgage rate of about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good when you are paying U.K. variable rates of 7.6
percent, but if sterling collapsed against the euro, your payments
would be worth dramatically less. You would have to pay more each
month to compensate for the lower value of each pound paid.
</P>
<P>
   7. Six people have supreme power over 300 million others.
</P>
<P>
   Six executives control the European Central Bank (ECB), oversee
the single currency and set interest rates. They can't be sacked
for eight years, and officially they only have to report to the
European Parliament once a year. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   8. Delaying euro notes and coins until 2002 is a ploy to deter
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   When euros appear in 2002, Europeans will be used to the idea
and won't (allegedly) get confused. So it will be harder to palm
off faked notes, or short-change customers.
</P>
<P>
   Each country will have up to six months to phase out its old
currency in favor of universal euro notes plus coins bearing a
national symbol. All euro notes have gates and windows on the front
_ ``symbols of openness and cooperation in the EU.'' On the back
you'll see a bridge from a particular age _ ``a metaphor for
communication among the people of Europe.'' These are generic
bridges, so no one is offended. One of the original designs showed
a bridge that looked too French; it was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   9. Euroland is the size of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Britain, the single currency zone compares well to
the States. Its economic output was almost equal to the U.S. before
the launch of the euro, and most of Europe (though not Britain) is
now growing faster than the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the euro does challenge the dollar as a world currency, it
will take a long time to get there. Despite the dominance of the
U.S., sterling remained the most important currency until World War
II. Pro-euro commentators believe the dollar and the euro will each
handle 40 percent of world finance eventually.
</P>
<P>
   10. The euro symbol suggests civilization and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The E with two bars is a homage to the Greek letter epsilon,
representing the cradle of civilization, and, more prosaically, the
E of Europe. The two straight bars represent the stability of the
currency (we hope). &QL;

   LONDON _ We're all sick of the euro _ and trading in the new
currency hasn't even begun yet. But it is going to dominate the
political and economic agenda in 1999, so you may as well find out
what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   Make it your New Year's Resolution to learn 10 interesting
things about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   1. Yes, this crazy idea was dreamed up in the Sixties.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the UK was not a member of what we called the Common
Market. We looked on as the usual sandal-wearing suspects (France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg _ plus Italy)
decided to make economic love, not war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 the European Summit approved a proposal to create an
Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The plans were expected to take
10 years. Thirty years later...
</P>
<P>
   2. Half the U.K. population has no idea what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the BBC2 Money Program polled 1,000 representative
people and found 51 percent were unable to name the new single
currency. Good guesses included ``Curo'' and ``Eu.'' Fashionable
guesses included ``Ecru.'' Only hopeless people guessed
``Equarder.'' Asked how much one euro was worth in Real Money,
estimates varied from 1p to (pounds sterling)8. In fact it's about
70p.
</P>
<P>
   3. The euro will make life cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Because the U.K. is no longer isolated, we'll be aware how much
more we pay for food and clothes. With any luck, retailers will
have to respond by dropping prices. The Internet boom will also
mean you'll be able to order cheaper euro-goods from abroad using a
credit card.
</P>
<P>
   4. You can carry a million pounds' worth of euros in one
briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a 500 euro note, worth (pounds sterling)350. Which
would mean (pounds sterling)1 million in euros could conveniently
fit in a briefcase. A million pounds in (pounds sterling)50 notes
would take up four cases, which attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   The euro is the ideal way to carry your ill-gotten gains around
a Europe without internal borders. This is just one of many reasons
why the euro may displace the dollar as the international
criminal's currency of choice. To combat this, Europol _ the new
police force of Euroland _ started work last October.
</P>
<P>
   5. Those old-fashioned currencies are already dead.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and workers from Paris to Pisa will handle their francs
and lire until 2002, but the business side of these currencies is
in effect dead. The value of each currency against the euro was
fixed last Thursday and that's where it will stay forever.
</P>
<P>
   From Monday, businesses across Europe will accept cash in the
local currency but will run all their payment and accounting
systems in euros. Government and corporate bond issues will be in
euros, although each issuer will still be able to set the interest
rates it pays on its bonds.
</P>
<P>
   6. You can impress your neighbors with a euro-mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays and Abbey National have the first euro-mortgage deals,
with an interest rate reflecting the European Central Bank rate of
3 percent across Euroland (except Italy). This gives a
euro-mortgage rate of about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds good when you are paying U.K. variable rates of 7.6
percent, but if sterling collapsed against the euro, your payments
would be worth dramatically less. You would have to pay more each
month to compensate for the lower value of each pound paid.
</P>
<P>
   7. Six people have supreme power over 300 million others.
</P>
<P>
   Six executives control the European Central Bank (ECB), oversee
the single currency and set interest rates. They can't be sacked
for eight years, and officially they only have to report to the
European Parliament once a year. Scary.
</P>
<P>
   8. Delaying euro notes and coins until 2002 is a ploy to deter
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   When euros appear in 2002, Europeans will be used to the idea
and won't (allegedly) get confused. So it will be harder to palm
off faked notes, or short-change customers.
</P>
<P>
   Each country will have up to six months to phase out its old
currency in favor of universal euro notes plus coins bearing a
national symbol. All euro notes have gates and windows on the front
_ ``symbols of openness and cooperation in the EU.'' On the back
you'll see a bridge from a particular age _ ``a metaphor for
communication among the people of Europe.'' These are generic
bridges, so no one is offended. One of the original designs showed
a bridge that looked too French; it was scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   9. Euroland is the size of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Britain, the single currency zone compares well to
the States. Its economic output was almost equal to the U.S. before
the launch of the euro, and most of Europe (though not Britain) is
now growing faster than the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   If the euro does challenge the dollar as a world currency, it
will take a long time to get there. Despite the dominance of the
U.S., sterling remained the most important currency until World War
II. Pro-euro commentators believe the dollar and the euro will each
handle 40 percent of world finance eventually.
</P>
<P>
   10. The euro symbol suggests civilization and stability.
</P>
<P>
   The E with two bars is a homage to the Greek letter epsilon,
representing the cradle of civilization, and, more prosaically, the
E of Europe. The two straight bars represent the stability of the
currency (we hope). &QL;

LOS ANGELES SUBURBS READY FOR SECESSION

 (ATTN: California)   (This 600-word ``separate buy'' article is from The Independent
newspaper in London.)

 By ANDREW GUMBEL  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles is the city that everyone loves to
hate _ including, it seems, 200,000 of its own inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   That's how many people have signed a petition calling for the
secession of the San Fernando Valley, the suburban slice of Los
Angeles north of the Hollywood Hills, and the creation of what
could become the sixth largest city in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the rebellion will sound reassuringly familiar
to LA-bashers: the desire to get away from an unwieldy city
bureaucracy that sucks in tax money but does little or nothing
about shoddy schools, public transport, air pollution, inner-city
crime and all the other ills for which Los Angeles has become a
byword.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's the way the secessionists portray it. Their
drive is also being seen as a giant manifestation of that very
Californian ideology, Not In My Back Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Being a predominantly white, middle-class part of town, the
Valley is simply sick of shelling out for minorities and the poor
in the downtown areas and would much rather spend its tax money on
typically white, middle-class things like raising the tone of its
neighborhoods and nudging property values upwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valley is tired of being treated like a cash cow,''
acknowledges Richard Close, chairman of the Valley VOTE movement
which is spearheading the push for secession. So far his group has
been remarkably successful.
</P>
<P>
   The petition will _ if two-thirds of the signatures are verified
_ lead to a ballot initiative proposing secession some time in the
next couple of years. Independence wouldn't arrive in time for the
millennium, but could become a reality shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles area is full of smaller independent mini-cities
which believe they can manage their affairs better on their own _
Beverly Hills being perhaps the most famous example.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the push for cityhood is essentially a desire to
keep the riffraff out. The Valley, with its 1.6 million
inhabitants, is exceptional only because of its size.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overtly, secession is about better civic management, but in
reality it is about maintaining a white majority and protecting
house prices,'' said Jim Newton, an experienced political reporter
for the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley, with its estate agent mentality, is well-versed in
the art of secession already: several communities over the years
have chosen to split or rename themselves in an effort to up the
tone.
</P>
<P>
   When the eastern end of Canoga Park was hit by a crime wave in
the mid-1980s, the ritzier western end changed its name to West
Hills _ sparking a furious battle over where exactly the
demarcation line between the two should be drawn.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later the undesirably Hispanic-sounding neighborhood
of Sepulveda became North Hills, even though the highest hills in
the place were speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Two tiny fractions of North Hollywood turned into Valley Village
and West Toluca Lake because the word ``Hollywood'' evokes images
of crime and dingy streets. Never mind that West Toluca Lake was
nowhere near Toluca Lake _ it sounded good.
</P>
<P>
   Now the western half of Van Nuys, which is divided by a major
freeway, wants to split off from the eastern half because of drugs
and gang problems. ``We're embarrassed to say we live here,'' says
Steve Neuman, the real estate agent behind the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   With that sort of community spirit, the Valley may not just
become a separate city, it may become 25 separate cities. &QL;

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA _ It's 9:15 a.m. and, just as they have done every Sunday
since 1498, 24 child singers from the Vienna Boys Choir climb the
spiral stairs of the tiny Imperial Chapel of Vienna's Hofburg
Palace, former seat of the Habsburg rulers, and take their places
in the choir gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it is -5C and the quadrangle in front of the 13th
century church is like a skating rink. But the fur-wearing Viennese
mass-goers and intrepid Japanese tourists delighted to have secured
tickets to hear the angelic voices at close range are queuing.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointingly, the boys are concealed from view and the
tourists have to crane their necks to catch a glimpse. The
atmosphere is only slightly marred when a man enters the chapel
afterwards, brandishing CD recordings of the choir.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Reinhard Gabriel, in navy coat and sailor hat,
gets ready to go home for Sunday lunch with his father, Helmut.
Next year he sets off on a tour covering every major European city,
but Gabriel says it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he misses us but even when he's in Vienna we only
see him twice a week. And he has the right attitude. He will do
it.'' The family has already made sacrifices for Reinhard by moving
from Linz to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century Augarten Palace, once a Habsburg residence, is
now the boarding-school home of the choir. Behind its high walls
the gardens and playing fields echo to childish shouts and the soft
thud of snowballs hitting woolly coats.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the baroque palace, the school principal, Manfred Seipt,
sits in his office, wondering where the choir will get its next
artistic director from.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that 500 years after Emperor Maximilian I recruited
12 boys by decree into the royal musical household, this unique
institution is in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Its image took a battering a month ago when Agnes Grossman, the
choir's first female artistic director, said the boys were
exhausted, overworked, ruthlessly exploited for commercial profit
and being robbed of their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The claim shocked Vienna, provoking debate about what the choir
represents. Linked to such figures as Mozart, Haydn and Schubert
(who was in the choir), it has become a symbol of the city's
musical heritage. But with no state subsidy since the collapse of
the empire in 1918, it has increasingly had to rely on commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grossman, awarded a Silver Cross by the state for services
to the arts, resigned after an internal feud about the length of
foreign tours (typically two to three months) and the vulgarization
of the repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   It should not have been like this, on the choir's 500th
anniversary. A three-month U.S. tour overseen by Ms. Grossman was
an artistic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Music critics, worried about the decline in recent years, hailed
the choir's return to its serious musical heritage and original
mission. Now all that is in doubt again.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents are unsettled and have taken up Ms. Grossman's
demands for a reduction in tours and concerts. For years they
remained silent but now admit they are heartbroken to see their
10-year-olds disappear on tour for three-and-a-half months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Augarten was in festive mood as Christmas approached but
there is a heavy schedule ahead of the boys in the Haydn choir, who
are not on tour (the other three choirs are).
</P>
<P>
   Schoolwork has to be compressed into eight-week terms to fit in
the travel, but these are gifted boys, the elite of Austria's
musical youth.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio Golio, a tutor, is playing part of Mozart's Coronation
Mass on a grand piano. Five sopranos, in track suits and slippers,
study their scores. Lucio makes them repeat a difficult phrase over
and over, crying ``Bravissimo!'' when they get it right.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly as it was in the days of Schubert. In the
recreation area, older boys are huddled over Gameboys. A few more
are watching skiing on television. Over the beds in the
dormitories, Pamela Anderson and the Spice Girls adorn the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are normal boys,'' says Seipt. ``We have even caught boys
smoking.'' But few normal boys get flown to Germany to take part in
a Christmas special of the country's most popular television show.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Ritchie was supposed to accompany them, only he was
struck down with hoarseness, leaving 20 million viewers
disappointed. Instead, the choir sang a jazzed-up version of
``Silent Night.'' &QL;

<P>
   VIENNA _ It's 9:15 a.m. and, just as they have done every Sunday
since 1498, 24 child singers from the Vienna Boys Choir climb the
spiral stairs of the tiny Imperial Chapel of Vienna's Hofburg
Palace, former seat of the Habsburg rulers, and take their places
in the choir gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it is -5C and the quadrangle in front of the 13th
century church is like a skating rink. But the fur-wearing Viennese
mass-goers and intrepid Japanese tourists delighted to have secured
tickets to hear the angelic voices at close range are queuing.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointingly, the boys are concealed from view and the
tourists have to crane their necks to catch a glimpse. The
atmosphere is only slightly marred when a man enters the chapel
afterwards, brandishing CD recordings of the choir.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven-year-old Reinhard Gabriel, in navy coat and sailor hat,
gets ready to go home for Sunday lunch with his father, Helmut.
Next year he sets off on a tour covering every major European city,
but Gabriel says it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course he misses us but even when he's in Vienna we only
see him twice a week. And he has the right attitude. He will do
it.'' The family has already made sacrifices for Reinhard by moving
from Linz to Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th-century Augarten Palace, once a Habsburg residence, is
now the boarding-school home of the choir. Behind its high walls
the gardens and playing fields echo to childish shouts and the soft
thud of snowballs hitting woolly coats.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the baroque palace, the school principal, Manfred Seipt,
sits in his office, wondering where the choir will get its next
artistic director from.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that 500 years after Emperor Maximilian I recruited
12 boys by decree into the royal musical household, this unique
institution is in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Its image took a battering a month ago when Agnes Grossman, the
choir's first female artistic director, said the boys were
exhausted, overworked, ruthlessly exploited for commercial profit
and being robbed of their childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The claim shocked Vienna, provoking debate about what the choir
represents. Linked to such figures as Mozart, Haydn and Schubert
(who was in the choir), it has become a symbol of the city's
musical heritage. But with no state subsidy since the collapse of
the empire in 1918, it has increasingly had to rely on commercial
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grossman, awarded a Silver Cross by the state for services
to the arts, resigned after an internal feud about the length of
foreign tours (typically two to three months) and the vulgarization
of the repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   It should not have been like this, on the choir's 500th
anniversary. A three-month U.S. tour overseen by Ms. Grossman was
an artistic triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Music critics, worried about the decline in recent years, hailed
the choir's return to its serious musical heritage and original
mission. Now all that is in doubt again.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents are unsettled and have taken up Ms. Grossman's
demands for a reduction in tours and concerts. For years they
remained silent but now admit they are heartbroken to see their
10-year-olds disappear on tour for three-and-a-half months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Augarten was in festive mood as Christmas approached but
there is a heavy schedule ahead of the boys in the Haydn choir, who
are not on tour (the other three choirs are).
</P>
<P>
   Schoolwork has to be compressed into eight-week terms to fit in
the travel, but these are gifted boys, the elite of Austria's
musical youth.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio Golio, a tutor, is playing part of Mozart's Coronation
Mass on a grand piano. Five sopranos, in track suits and slippers,
study their scores. Lucio makes them repeat a difficult phrase over
and over, crying ``Bravissimo!'' when they get it right.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly as it was in the days of Schubert. In the
recreation area, older boys are huddled over Gameboys. A few more
are watching skiing on television. Over the beds in the
dormitories, Pamela Anderson and the Spice Girls adorn the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are normal boys,'' says Seipt. ``We have even caught boys
smoking.'' But few normal boys get flown to Germany to take part in
a Christmas special of the country's most popular television show.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Ritchie was supposed to accompany them, only he was
struck down with hoarseness, leaving 20 million viewers
disappointed. Instead, the choir sang a jazzed-up version of
``Silent Night.'' &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ It's 5:45 a.m., a few degrees above freezing, and I am
standing in a dim shed on the edge of a murky quayside where a
unique scene is being enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Below the strip lights, groups of middle-aged men in overalls
and rubber boots are prodding and pinching at hundreds of
silvery-white objects lined up in rows across the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   They look like frosty torpedoes or mysterious pods from outer
space. A thin steamy vapor rises from them, and there are yellow
labels stapled to their fins.
</P>
<P>
   At six o'clock exactly a bell is rung, and the din redoubles as
everyone in the shed starts simultaneously shouting and
gesticulating. Strings of numbers and names can be heard; a man
with a pot of red goo moves among the silvery torpedoes and brushes
an elegant Chinese character onto the outside of each.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs are the bodies of deep-frozen blue-fin tuna, the most
esteemed of all Japan's many fish, and this is the daily auction
Tsukiji fish market, the place where sushi comes to die.
</P>
<P>
   There is nowhere else quite like this in the world: in a good
year 850,000 ton of fish _ much of it still wriggling and thrashing
_ is hauled up on to this quayside on this eastern edge of Tokyo
and laid out for auction in the shed alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Like a medieval market, an entire community of suppliers and
provisioners has grown up around the market, selling knives, hooks,
boots, weighing scales, gloves and the tons of ground ice which the
market goes through every day.
</P>
<P>
   It is a spectacle of noise and color, as aproned men drag carts
bearing buckets of the delicious, the repulsive and the weird.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface much has changed in Japan during the
last year and Tsukiji, like the rest of the country, is in a state
of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   In any recession, food is the last thing which people stop
buying and, as the world's greatest piscivores, there is no danger
that Japanese are going to stop eating fish.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of recent European slumps, or by the economic
crisis devastating South-East Asia, the hardship here is difficult
to pin down _ for although the economic figures show an economy
unquestionably in decline, Tokyo still looks and feels like one of
the most prosperous cities on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Japan's fall has been from heights so lofty
that they appear, looking back, like a dream. At the height of the
famous Bubble Economy, Japanese were spending at such a level that
ideas of what was normal and sustainable were lost.
</P>
<P>
   The tuna sellers of Tsukiji were the beneficiaries, and then the
victims, of this bizarre period.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the elements of the auction, the most important part is
that which precedes the opening of the bids _ the poking and
caressing of the fish by the tuna buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, tuna are all different like people,'' says Osamu
Takahashi, who has been doing the job for 16 years. ``And it all
comes down to the amount of fat.''
</P>
<P>
   The lean, red tuna sells in the auction for as little as 1000
yen a kilo _ even after the numerous middlemen and transporters
have added their markup, this translates into something which the
average family can afford to eat at home.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the pale, pink toro _ with its layers of sweet marbled
fat _ which Takahashi tries to identify and which, even to the
wholesalers, costs 10,000 yen a kilo or more.
</P>
<P>
   Fatty bluefin tuna _ served as sushi, rolled with rice and
seaweed and even with gold leaf _ was the food of the bubble,
consumed by executives on expense accounts and at top-class
restaurants called ryotei, where the bill for an evening of food
and sake, served by hostesses, routinely ran in the stratospheric
range.
</P>
<P>
   But in the recessions, expense-account toro at the ryotei were
the first luxuries to go. ``Our volume of sales is about the same,
and the prices are about the same, but sometimes half the fish are
unsold,'' says one Tsukiji stallholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the politicians who used to go to the ryotei. They just
aren't spending anymore.'' &QL;

   TOKYO _ It's 5:45 a.m., a few degrees above freezing, and I am
standing in a dim shed on the edge of a murky quayside where a
unique scene is being enacted.
</P>
<P>
   Below the strip lights, groups of middle-aged men in overalls
and rubber boots are prodding and pinching at hundreds of
silvery-white objects lined up in rows across the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   They look like frosty torpedoes or mysterious pods from outer
space. A thin steamy vapor rises from them, and there are yellow
labels stapled to their fins.
</P>
<P>
   At six o'clock exactly a bell is rung, and the din redoubles as
everyone in the shed starts simultaneously shouting and
gesticulating. Strings of numbers and names can be heard; a man
with a pot of red goo moves among the silvery torpedoes and brushes
an elegant Chinese character onto the outside of each.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs are the bodies of deep-frozen blue-fin tuna, the most
esteemed of all Japan's many fish, and this is the daily auction
Tsukiji fish market, the place where sushi comes to die.
</P>
<P>
   There is nowhere else quite like this in the world: in a good
year 850,000 ton of fish _ much of it still wriggling and thrashing
_ is hauled up on to this quayside on this eastern edge of Tokyo
and laid out for auction in the shed alongside it.
</P>
<P>
   Like a medieval market, an entire community of suppliers and
provisioners has grown up around the market, selling knives, hooks,
boots, weighing scales, gloves and the tons of ground ice which the
market goes through every day.
</P>
<P>
   It is a spectacle of noise and color, as aproned men drag carts
bearing buckets of the delicious, the repulsive and the weird.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the surface much has changed in Japan during the
last year and Tsukiji, like the rest of the country, is in a state
of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   In any recession, food is the last thing which people stop
buying and, as the world's greatest piscivores, there is no danger
that Japanese are going to stop eating fish.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of recent European slumps, or by the economic
crisis devastating South-East Asia, the hardship here is difficult
to pin down _ for although the economic figures show an economy
unquestionably in decline, Tokyo still looks and feels like one of
the most prosperous cities on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that Japan's fall has been from heights so lofty
that they appear, looking back, like a dream. At the height of the
famous Bubble Economy, Japanese were spending at such a level that
ideas of what was normal and sustainable were lost.
</P>
<P>
   The tuna sellers of Tsukiji were the beneficiaries, and then the
victims, of this bizarre period.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the elements of the auction, the most important part is
that which precedes the opening of the bids _ the poking and
caressing of the fish by the tuna buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, tuna are all different like people,'' says Osamu
Takahashi, who has been doing the job for 16 years. ``And it all
comes down to the amount of fat.''
</P>
<P>
   The lean, red tuna sells in the auction for as little as 1000
yen a kilo _ even after the numerous middlemen and transporters
have added their markup, this translates into something which the
average family can afford to eat at home.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the pale, pink toro _ with its layers of sweet marbled
fat _ which Takahashi tries to identify and which, even to the
wholesalers, costs 10,000 yen a kilo or more.
</P>
<P>
   Fatty bluefin tuna _ served as sushi, rolled with rice and
seaweed and even with gold leaf _ was the food of the bubble,
consumed by executives on expense accounts and at top-class
restaurants called ryotei, where the bill for an evening of food
and sake, served by hostesses, routinely ran in the stratospheric
range.
</P>
<P>
   But in the recessions, expense-account toro at the ryotei were
the first luxuries to go. ``Our volume of sales is about the same,
and the prices are about the same, but sometimes half the fish are
unsold,'' says one Tsukiji stallholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the politicians who used to go to the ryotei. They just
aren't spending anymore.'' &QL;

Internet appears to have brought to the English language.

   VIENNA _ The 18th-century Augarten Palace, once a Hapsburg
residence, is now the boarding-school home of the Vienna Boys
Choir. Behind its high walls the gardens and playing fields echo to
childish shouts and the soft thud of snowballs hitting woolly
coats.
</P>

   Inside the baroque palace, the school principal, Manfred Seipt,

   The truth is that 500 years after Emperor Maximilian I recruited
12 boys by decree into the royal musical household, this unique
institution is in crisis.
</P>

   Its image took a battering a month ago when Agnes Grossman, the
choir's first female artistic director, said the boys were
exhausted, overworked, ruthlessly exploited for commercial profit
and being robbed of their childhood. &QL;

NEW YEAR BRINGS NEW OPPORTUNITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new year brings the opportunity for a new garden. Or an
improved one.
</P>
<P>
   January is the best time to plant trees _ shade, ornamental and
those that bear fruit. Roses, azaleas and other shrubs can be added
to the garden, too. Tidy existing perennials and add columbine,
coreopsis, Louisiana phlox and verbena as available. Cool-season
annuals that can color your garden now include allysum, calendula,
dianthus, Drummond phlox, forget-me-nots, toadflax, pansies,
petunias, snapdragons and stock.
</P>
<P>
   Use mustard and chard as ornamentals. Sow lettuce as a border
around your flowers. Sow carrots outdoors and broccoli indoors, or
wait until broccoli transplants soon appear in nurseries. Sow
tomatoes indoors to transplant outdoors in March.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening catalogs are beginning to arrive, perennial
temptations of new and old picture-perfect flowers and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   While you wait for deliveries, prepare flower and vegetable
beds. Good drainage is essential for many plants, so raise your
beds several inches to avoid root problems due to soggy soil. Work
in generous amounts of organic matter such as compost to further
improve drainage and provide nutrients.

IMPEACHMENT NOT CLOUDING MARKET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By Pamela Yip 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A year that promises a presidential impeachment trial would seem
to be a good case for volatile markets ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the way stock market analysts see it.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't expected to move the markets much because President
Clinton won't be forced to resign, said Conrad Herrmann, who
manages several mutual funds at Franklin Advisors in San Mateo,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of the markets recently appears to back that up.
Stocks rose in the weeks following the House impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market had already discounted the fact that the House of
Representatives was going to impeach Clinton,'' Herrmann said.
``Most people just want the whole situation to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is fighting to hold on to his job for two more
years, market observers still see good things in the political
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lame-duck presidents set about creating a legacy and they end
up doing some pretty good things in their final year,'' said Gerald
Perritt, editor of the Mutual Fund Letter in Largo, Fla., an
investment newsletter. ``The question mark for Clinton is, are his
hands going to be tied up in doing some good things like reforming
Social Security?''
</P>
<P>
   Other say the answer to that question is already obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's been hindered substantially already,'' said Ed
Larsen, chief equity officer at Aim Capital Management, a Houston
mutual fund firm. ``Relatively little was done in Congress because
people were focused on this issue. I think it will be very
difficult for him to get very much of an aggressive agenda through
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, it may not be so bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be a little more preoccupied than some of the previous
lame duck presidents, but the economy and the markets have had to
deal with that all year,'' said Gary Thayer, senior economist at
St. Louis-based brokerage firm A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   As they say, it's really the economy and Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan is the captain of that ship. In
Washington's world of revolving-door politics, investors follow the
Fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president likes to take credit for things, but Greenspan
is the key,'' said David Lapin, president of money management firm
Lapin &AMP; Wigginton Asset Management in Houston. ``He's the cog in
the wheel that makes it go.''
</P>
<P>
   If something happened to Greenspan or if he changed his stance,
``that event would be looked at by the markets with significantly
closer scrutiny than anything that would happen to Clinton,'' Lapin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The market also believes that Clinton has enough support to keep
from being removed from office by Congress, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is looking at the impeachment trial as almost a
nonevent,'' Lapin said.
</P>
<P>
   There is one historical factor that speaks well for the market's
view of life in Washington _ 1999 is a pre-election year. That
means every politician with an appetite for re-election will do
what it takes to juice up the economy to keep the voters happy.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1940, the Dow Jones industrial average has never fallen in
a pre-election year, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac, which
tracks stock market history, cycles and consistent patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dow has racked up double-digit gains in 10 of the
14 years, according to the almanac.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the Dow has fallen in seven post-election years
since 1940, notching double-digit losses five times.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1999 is near the dawn of the millennium doesn't hurt
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also the last year of the century, which would tend to be
bullish,'' said Yale Hirsch, publisher of the almanac. ``That
certain magic, that people imagine we're all going to be crossing
over the bridge. It's the promised land.''
</P>
<P>
   History bears that out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow soared 21.3 percent in 1897, rose 22.5 percent in 1898,
was up 9.2 percent in 1899 and rose 7 percent in 1900, Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of worrying about how Clinton's problems will affect
your pocketbook, stayed focused on your investment goals and
whether your holdings still have potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Acampora, market analyst at Prudential Securities, calls
for the Dow in 1999 to trade between a low range of 7,800-8,450 and
a high range of 9,800-11,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anticipated overall market strength in 1999 is coincident
with the powerful third year of a president's term in office,'' he
said.

SENATE SHOULD AVOID OPINION POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Mike McNulty was saying that he'd thought about
it, long and hard.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, he was saying, is not an innocent man. But,
McNulty was saying Monday night, ``The President of the United
States did not commit crimes on the order of treason and bribery
and does not deserve removal from office.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, most people haven't examined the issue as closely as has
Mike McNulty, but the Albany metro area's Democratic congressman
was only saying what most Americans have been telling pollsters for
a solid year now.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure, fine. So, Bill Clinton isn't a perfect human being.
That doesn't mean that he should be thrown out of office.
</P>
<P>
   Call it what you will _ a decision by most Americans to refuse
to judge a man solely on his worst moments or a total collapse of
values in American society.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, McNulty's remarks Monday night at a downtown rally
sponsored by the liberal Robert F. Kennedy Democratic Club more or
less represented mainstream thinking in this country. Just before
Christmas, though, the House of Representatives impeached the
President for perjury, obstruction of justice and a variety of
other sins and potential crimes. The Senate now is weighing whether
to begin a trial that could lead to Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   There may not be a trial, by the way. The Constitution says that
the Senate has the power to conduct one, but it doesn't have to.
And the influential Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., is among
those members of Congress pushing censure, even though he's no fan
of the President's. I still recall Moynihan fuming at the
Democratic National Convention in Chicago a few years back after
Clinton had signed welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone really must teach this young man how to govern,''
Moynihan was muttering. But Moynihan isn't bowing to public opinion
in his plan to keep the President from being thrown out. He's
retiring in two years. Losing the next election doesn't worry
Moynihan. He couldn't care less what the left-leaning members of
the Robert F. Kennedy Democratic Club might think.
</P>
<P>
   So, whether you agree with Moynihan's censure plan or not, he's
clearly operating out of conviction. That's the one thing that
neither side has been willing to concede to the other in this
whole, horrible mess. Each side has relentlessly accused the other
of venality and petty partisanship. The sad thing is that both
sides have been right, too.
</P>
<P>
   What few people seem to understand _ especially the ordinary
citizens to whom I've spoken _ is that the framers of the
Constitution really didn't want senators to pay much attention to
the public's attitudes during a proceeding to determine whether any
president would be removed from office. In fact, the framers went
out of their way to ensure that public opinion would play no direct
role in any such proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Were it up to me, I would throw Clinton out, even though I've
had no major problems with his policies as president. I can't get
past what clearly seems to me to be perjury. I would toss out
George Washington if he perjured himself, much less this guy. So,
I'm certain, would the framers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina said two centuries
ago that he would vote to remove all presidents who might ``behave
amiss or betray their public trust.'' Edmund Randolph of Virginia
said he would throw out a president who ``misbehaves.''
</P>
<P>
   There's very little question as to where these guys would be on
Clinton's removal on the grounds of perjury. And what they wrote is
supposed to be the supreme law of the land, binding on all good
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   I've discovered, though _ to my deep disappointment _ that only
a few of the several hundred people who've called me on this issue
have ever read the Constitution, much less any of the scholarship
that exists concerning its creation. Almost none of them know that
the framers has created a presidency without term limits. Almost
none are aware that the framers created a presidency where anybody
who could get elected could stay for as long as the public was
willing to vote that person back into office.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Franklin Delano Roosevelt was elected four
times, much to the chagrin of his many enemies, that the
Constitution was amended to limit any President to only two terms.
</P>
<P>
   So, given the fact that the nation's political class could
theoretically be stuck indefinitely with a law-breaker running the
country, the framers created a mechanism to toss out a president
even if he was popular.
</P>
<P>
   That was, in fact, precisely what the framers were worried about
_ a well-liked despot who would place himself above the law and a
public that wouldn't mind. The framers wanted the political class
to be able to get rid of a guy like that even if most citizens
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they left the final decision on throwing out a
president to a Senate designed to be immune to temporary
expressions of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Constitution was amended 85 years ago or so, members
of the Senate weren't directly elected. Instead, they were selected
by the state legislatures. One of the things the framers were after
was a legislative body largely insulated from momentary public
political sentiment _ as expressed by a good many people at Monday
night's rally, for example _ in considering whether to retain a
president or bounce him.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long haul, if voter outrage over a president's removal
continued, the public ultimately could oust the politicians who'd
ousted the president. Citizens would get their democracy, all right
_ but not immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The framers just didn't think that the Senate should have to
worry about public opinion as they made their constitutional
decision to retain a president or to bounce him. So, it's not that
the members of the Senate don't care how most people feel. This is
politics, and they're watching the polls just like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   The framers just didn't want them to care all that much right
now.

 &HT;    ADMINISTRATION MUM ON FINANCING AS SPENDING PLANS EXPAND
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ 'Tis the season to be spending in the nation's
capital, and the fiscal watchdogs are worried.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, President Clinton proposed a $215 million anti-drug
project for convicted criminals, and on Thursday he's scheduled to
outline new plans for education spending. These come on the heels
of new federal spending plans for defense, food safety and
long-term health care that will be included next month in Clinton's
annual budget, and more such unveilings are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The administration refuses to reveal how it would pay for the
new programs. When pressed for details on a proposed $1,000 tax
credit for long-term care of elderly relatives, Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala would say only that it would be
financed from unspecified revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Her response did not surprise Robert Bixby, policy director of
the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that urges budget
restraint. ``People always leak the good news and not the bad
news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bixby expressed concern about the push for spending by Clinton
and by some in the Republican-led Congress. Already, fiscal
watchdog groups point out, last year's federal budget surplus of
$70 billion is projected to fall slightly this year, partly because
of a burst of spending in last fall's budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   The military is a major focus for the budget-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton proposed to raise defense spending by $100 billion
over six years, incoming Senate Armed Services Chairman John
Warner, R-Va., upped the ante, vowing to seek much more for the
military. On Tuesday, his panel heard the military service chiefs
lay out their wish lists for improving ``readiness.''
</P>
<P>
   These are early signs of what Bixby predicts will become ``the
big budget battle of the year: a bidding war for the Pentagon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a bad thing to spend more on the Pentagon, if it's
needed, but Congress and the president should avoid the temptation
to just throw money'' at the Defense Department, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Committee for a Responsible Budget, a non-partisan
private group, Susan Tanaka warned that Clinton's long-term health
care tax credit proposal could create a long-term fiscal problem.
The initial cost, about $6 billion over five years, ``doesn't seem
like a lot of money,'' she said. ``But those kinds of programs
become very expensive when you have a lot more people that need
care. So we have programs that look inexpensive, but end of up
costing a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   During the White House unveiling, Shalala described the tax
credit plan as a ``significant first step'' in relieving families
of the burdens of long-term health care. ``But we see this as
evolving over a period of time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under balanced budget agreement rules, the president's completed
budget must include spending cuts or new revenues to offset
additional spending. For example, the administration last year
called for new tobacco taxes to pay for initiatives. Tanaka
predicts that proposal, rejected by the last Congress, will be
renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are expected to resist such tax
increases and push for tax breaks, such as ending the so-called
marriage penalty under the current income tax system.
</P>
<P>
   However, if recent history is a guide, Congress and the
president will both seek ways to ignore the budget caps placed on
government programs. In the last-minute rush to finish the budget
last year, they agreed to label $21 billion as ``emergency''
spending so that it would not be subject to spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of budget-busting raises questions about whether the
much touted ``budget surplus'' will ever materialize. From now
through the year 2000, government surpluses are projected to come
entirely from Social Security revenues that are earmarked for
future retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're concerned about is, without the Social Security
surplus, there's a projected deficit for this year,'' Bixby said,
as he monitored the daily announcements of more spending plans by
the president and lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bixby: ``If they want to truly balance the budget without
Social Security, they would have to come up with even more cuts.''

<P>
   If you're like most women, your experience with sea-based skin
care is limited to the occasional seaweed body wrap at your
favorite day spa.
</P>
<P>
   Seaweed is thick and gooey and less than aromatic, but despite
all this, you glide out the door with a sense of serenity,
relishing the inches that have melted off your frame _ a temporary
result of water loss.
</P>
<P>
   Then you make it home and never give seaweed another thought.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that is. All manner of marine ingredients, especially
the perennially popular seaweed, are making their way straight into
your skin-care regime.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we need to take this figurative dip in the sea? If anyone
has the answer to that question it's Lydia Sarfati, ceo and founder
of Repechage and self-proclaimed Queen of Seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need seaweed simply because it is a perfect substance,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sarfati, the vitamins, minerals, amino acids and
trace elements that are abundant in seaweed are the very
ingredients essential for the healthy functioning of skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, there is sufficient absorption of the vitamins
and minerals to benefit the skin, resulting in increased
moisturization and radiance.
</P>
<P>
   Of the thousands of different types of seaweed that exist,
Sarfati has singled out laminaria digitata, found along the
Brittany coast of France, as one of her favorites. This member of
the brown seaweed family is said to absorb within its cells more
than 10,000 times the amount of manganese and zinc contained in
seawater.
</P>
<P>
   You can find it in the best-selling Repechage C-Serum and in the
new Repechage Opti-Firm Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredible,'' is how Cindy Melk, founder and creative director
of H2O Plus, describes marine ingredients. ``They're so pure and
natural and so concentrated that you need only a small amount to
get a benefit. You're not really able to do that with botanicals.''
</P>
<P>
   The greater part of the H2O Plus collection features a ``Sea
Mineral Complex'' (consisting of sodium, magnesium, potassium and
calcium) that aids in the delivery of nourishment from marine
botanicals, such as kelp and sea fennel, to the skin.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the practice of thalassotherapy, or sea-water
therapy, is as basic as getting a manicure. But the concept of
turning to the sea for skin-care benefits is relatively new to
American women.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a booming interest in spa treatments and a desire to
extend the experience to the home, however, this is quickly
changing. American skin-care institutions such as Janet Sartin and
Georgette Klinger offer marine ingredients in their lineups, in
products like the Janet Sartin Gentle Cleansing Soap with Native
Fresh Water Silt and the three-item Georgette Klinger Sea Extracts
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, seaweed lines typically deemed ``for professional use
only'' are being gobbled up by clients. Manhattan spa owner Yasmine
Djerradine sells and uses in her Seaweed Body Wrap _ the highly
concentrated Algascience collection from France. Especially
popular, reports Djerradine, is the Algascience Slenderizing bath
with red seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   Other skin-care collections that have recognized the
remineralizing and hydrating properties of the sea include the
entire Hirsh lineup, the Shu Uemura Depsea Water collection of skin
mists and the new Natural Sea Beauty collection.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about the ick factor? Don't be. The experts are with
you on that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not from the school of bathing in a bathtub of dead fish
to get skin to look good,'' Melk says. &QL;

   LATIN-FOOD (New York) _ For years, trend spotters have trotted
out the same old prediction: South American food will be the Next
Big Thing in New York restaurants. It's a sleeping giant, they
would say, coming any day now. Any day. Well, look around you. From
the basket of steaming arepas that arrives with the menu at
Orinoco, a new Venezuelan restaurant on the Upper East Side, to the
grilled Argentine skirt steak served at Ideya in SoHo, the next big
thing is finally here. By Eric Asimov.

   LATIN-ROOTS (Undated) _ The first impulse of many uninitiated
cooks who happen upon root vegetables from Latin America in the
market is simply to shake their heads and walk way. These tubers _
brown, bumpy, sometimes even scaly _ look for all the world like
miniature logs that were tossed into the vegetable bin by mistake.
But nothing could be further from the truth. These vegetables are
bedrock culinary staples throughout Latin America and the Caribbean
and provide great culinary rewards for those willing to explore
them.

   COOKING-TEACH (New York) _ With all due respect to New York's
great cooking schools, they are, for the most part, relatively cold
places, steely professional institutions that lack the warmth of
home and hearth. That's fine for anyone heading off to labor in
some restaurant dungeon. But for the rest of us there is often a
disconnect. Once _ and the tradition is nearly gone now _ we could
learn the secrets of home cooking alongside our mothers and fathers
by helping them chop, mix, and stir. Domestic cooking was not a
formal art. And yet beautiful food often emerged from those
informal kitchens. Fortunately, in loco parentis, there's a small
band of people who still offer latecomers a way into this domestic
tradition by teaching fine cooking in real, home kitchens. By Polly
Frost.

`COSMO' LOOKS PAST THE CLEAVAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I read a lot of magazines, but I must confess that, as
a guy, I normally have about as much use for ``Cosmopolitan'' as I
do for garter belts and fish-net stockings (Halloween night
excepted).
</P>
<P>
   I don't doubt the magazine's popularity _ it has a circulation
of 2.6 million _ but it seems so wholly geared toward a female
audience that I feel like a voyeur when I read it. ``Fat-Burning
Breakthrough; The 7-Day Diet That Sheds Flab Fast'' just doesn't
interest me that much.
</P>
<P>
   But talking to Kate White did. She's the new editor in chief of
``Cosmo,'' coming to the magazine from ``Redbook'' late last year.
Word was that she was bringing more serious journalism to the
magazine. So as a guy who normally sees ``Cosmo'' only while
waiting in line at the grocery store, I had only one question for
her:
</P>
<P>
   You're not doing away with the cleavage on the cover are you?
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not do that to you, no sir,'' White said with a
chuckle from her New York office. And true enough, on the cover of
the January issue _ White's first as editor _ model Laetitia Casta
is hunched over in a pink-and-gold dress with a neckline that
plunges farther than the Dallas Cowboys' playoff fortunes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reassuring pose
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You weren't disappointed, I hope,'' White continued. ``She's
reassuring you with that pose.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, she's so contorted she looks more like she is
reassuring her chiropractor that he'll be able to send his kids to
an Ivy League school. But White's point is well taken: She's the
new woman in charge, but changes won't be fast and furious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to evolve it as it should be evolved,'' she said.
``Even a magazine that's working needs to grow. In some ways, I
hope people couldn't tell what my first issue was.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the headlines on the cover aren't a big change. ``Sex
Rules! 10 Make-Him-Throb Moves So Hot You'll Need a Fire Hose to
Cool Down the Bed'' blares the January issue. Not too different in
theme from November's ``Heinous Honeymoon Horror _ The Man I
Married Was Really a Woman,'' or December's ``50 Sexiest Holiday
Looks _ He'll Want to Unwrap (begin ital) You. (end ital) ''
</P>
<P>
   But White hopes to slip in some more serious fare in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't seem to me that it would be a handicap in any way
for our reader _ in fact, it would be a plus _ to run one story in
an issue that had ramifications for young women and their lives,''
she said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Serious doings
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the February issue will include a story about a
date-rape drug, and there is a story in the works for the March
issue about a woman who picked up her life and moved to New York to
try to find her missing sister.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're a fan of features such as ``Cosmetic Counter
Intelligence,'' don't worry _ White's not turning ``Cosmo'' into
``The Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not news in the sense of, `Oh, isn't it time we did a
piece on the collapse of the global economy?' '' she said. ``(But)
I would like to see in every issue one piece that has a strong
journalistic bent.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's in it for guys?
</P>
<P>
   ``The cover, definitely,'' White said, laughing. But more, too.
``I think it does give you a real sense of what young women are
like. I do think guys in their own way wonder, `How do I please her
more? What makes her tick?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sex will remain a going concern. Though White doesn't
see ``Cosmo's'' emphasis on just sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's about sex, but first and foremost, it's about
empowerment and giving women permission to go after what they
want,'' she said. ``Part of going after what you want is being able
to enjoy sex, feel comfortable in a relationship sexually, be able
to have your own needs met sexually.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sex jumps out at you. What I feel more is that
it's about, `You can have what you want.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from ``Cosmo,'' what people want is sex. And if cleavage
on the cover is empowering, what the heck, that, too. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, trend-spotters have trotted out the same
old prediction: South American food will be the Next Big Thing in
New York restaurants. It's a sleeping giant, they would say, coming
any day now. Any day.
</P>
<P>
   Well, look around you. From the basket of steaming arepas that
arrives with the menu at Orinoco, a new Venezuelan restaurant on
the Upper East Side, to the grilled Argentine skirt steak served at
Ideya in SoHo, the next big thing is finally here.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, restaurants offering South American and Latin
American foods have opened all over Manhattan, engulfing diners in
an avalanche of enticingly poetic terms like chimichurri, sancocho
and parrilla (which, for the uninitiated, are a tangy Argentine
herb sauce, a soupy stew and mixed grill). Some of these new
restaurants specialize in the food of a single country, like Cuba,
Brazil or Argentina. But most are selling hybrid cuisines, calling
their restaurants pan-Latin or even pan-American, combining the
foods not just of South and Central America but of North America
and the Caribbean, too.
</P>
<P>
   The southward trend, which began slowly a couple of years ago
with several Brazilian rodizios and Argentine steakhouses, has
surged ahead in the last few months, with the opening of
restaurants like Orinoco and Ideya as well as Campo, Casa and L-Ray
in Greenwich Village, Bolivar on the Upper East Side and Calle Ocho
on the Upper West Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed that it took so long, but to see it happen
like this is very exciting,'' said Douglas Rodriguez, the chef and
owner of Patria, the pioneering nuevo Latino restaurant on Park
Avenue South. Rodriguez's reinterpretations of Latin American
dishes have made him something of a godfather of contemporary Latin
American cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants eager to jump on the pan-Latin express are now
peppering Rodriguez with calls for help in finding chefs who are
familiar with the idiom, which can vary tremendously from the
European-derived cuisine of Argentina to Peru's pre-Columbian
emphasis on corn, grains and seafood to Brazil's unique
African-Portuguese-Caribbean blend.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for Latin American ingredients has shot up, too. ``Oh
yeah,'' said Vito Latilla, a vice president of the Manhattan Fruit
Exchange, a leading wholesale produce purveyor. ``Yuca, plantains,
tomatillos, it goes on unbelievably. From years back it's tripled.
Now everybody is buying yuca and jicama and all the related
items.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth, of course, is that South and Central American
restaurants have always existed in New York City. Strolling the
streets of Jackson Heights or Corona in Queens is like a trip to
the Andes, with extended families sitting down at neighborhood
Argentine spots like El Gauchito for huge platters of ribs,
sausages, beef hearts and sweetbreads, or at Tierras Colombianas
for a huge, thin steak, served with a fried egg on top and puffy
fried pork skin on the side. On certain summer weekends, you can
even find grilled cuy, a prize Ecuadorean specialty otherwise known
as guinea pig.
</P>
<P>
   You will not find beef hearts, fried eggs or guinea pigs at the
new Manhattan restaurants, though you will find cocktails and
colorful tropical drinks galore. These are not uncertain nooks
opened by recent immigrants offering a warm bit of home, but
carefully considered, well-financed businesses opened by
restaurateurs schooled in the intricacies of the Manhattan market.
Some of the new places, in fact, have simply dislodged restaurants
whose once-trendy concepts have waned.
</P>
<P>
   The Santo Family Group, for example, replaced the aging Arizona
206 with Bolivar after deciding that ``comida pan-americana,'' as
they call it, was a concept better suited to the Bloomingdale's
neighborhood than a 16-year-old Southwestern formula. On Broadway
near New York University, Ashley Smith, an owner of the popular
East Village restaurants Opaline and Radio Perfecto, was brought in
to reconstitute Bayamo, a Chinese-Latin fixture past its heyday, as
Bayamo Nuevo, offering Cuban food presented, as Smith says, ``so
it's user-friendly and exciting, but respectful of Cuban
traditions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Columbus Avenue, where the restaurant Main Street once dished
up family-style platters of meatloaf and mashed potatoes, there is
now a stylish new pan-Latin restaurant, Calle Ocho, where yuca and
malanga are the tubers of choice. While some of these ingredients
may sound unfamiliar to Upper West Siders, the menu places them in
context, describing bistec with fried yuca, for example, as
``Cuban-style steak frites.''
</P>
<P>
   Calle Ocho's four owners, Jeff Kadish, Spencer Rothschild, Steve
Scher and Paul Zweben, had previously succeeded with two Rain
restaurants, which follow a pan-Asian formula, and with the upscale
fusion restaurant Union Pacific. They were seeking a jump-start for
Main Street when they latched on to the pan-Latin theme. ``We
always want to be in the forefront of new tastes and restaurants,''
Rothschild said.
</P>
<P>
   To take charge of the kitchen, they hired Alex Garcia, who had
been a sous-chef at Patria. Garcia, perhaps anticipating the
pan-Latin wave a little too early, had made the leap with his own
pan-Latin restaurant, Erizo Latino, three years ago, but the
restaurant closed in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says, after some initial concern over how his food would
be received on the Upper West Side, he is beginning to relax.
``This is doing great,'' he said. ``They are really ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   With dishes like lobster ceviche, duck with calabaza squash and
orange salsa, and Peruvian shrimp chowder with achiote oil,
Garcia's menu is a creative blend in which new ingredients and
techniques act as garnishes for the comforting and the familiar.
Offerings like Dominican seafood stew and rum-glazed shrimp are
delicious but hardly challenging to norteamericanos.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to work on the Upper West Side?'' Rothschild
asked. ``We didn't put in the pulled pork dishes, the heavy stews,
the dishes with lots of beans.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, few of these restaurants pretend to offer authentic
cuisines. Lard and palm oil, used copiously in South America, are
replaced with olive oil, just as the range of organ meats is
represented by the occasional sweetbread. The menu at Bolivar, for
example, is heavy on grilled meat, familiar fish and hearty soups,
occasionally with exotic adornments. ``Sushi-grade'' tuna is served
with a yuca crust. Mussels are steamed in corn beer, an ancient
Peruvian beverage, while sauteed foie gras is served on an arepa.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our menu is South American steakhouse,'' said Andrew
D'Amico, the executive chef at Bolivar. ``A lot I would describe as
South American comfort food. We have interesting things on the
menu, but it's not a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The clear, direct flavors and the emphasis on simplicity are
part of the appeal of the pan-Latin restaurants, which generally
take pains to set themselves apart from the more complex nuevo
Latino formulations of Rodriguez at Patria.
</P>
<P>
   At Campo on Greenwich Avenue, Steven Picker, the owner and chef,
offers what he calls ``country cuisine of the Americas.'' He fuses
some of the ingredients of South and Central America with the
techniques and sensibilities of North America to produce dishes
like mildly spiced cod, steamed in a banana leaf and served with
sweet coconut rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a backlash to opulent eating,'' he said. ``There's
something about Latin America in the American psyche that feels
homespun, that feels of the earth. Americans feel it's
approachable. It's rustic, hearty and generous.''
</P>
<P>
   Anya von Bremzen, the author of ``Fiesta: A Celebration of Latin
Hospitality'' (Doubleday, 1997), said the fascination with
pan-Latin food is part of a wider social interest in Latin and
South America. She likened the surge in restaurants to the rise of
Latin music. ``Salsa went from the expression of Puerto Ricans
living in the barrio to this highly engineered, slick production,
and I see the same thing happening with food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tamar Kuznick, an owner of Ideya in SoHo, sees rise in interest
in Latin music and New York night life as crucial to the rise of
the pan-Latin restaurants. ``In the last two or three years, it
seems that all the different clubs and lounges in New York City
were doing salsa nights,'' she said. ``I felt there was a train
taking off, and I wanted to jump on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Argentine steakhouses in New York, like Pampa and Chimichurri
Grill in Manhattan and Sur in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, have been
wildly popular, but does the heavily meat-oriented Argentine
cuisine, derived largely from European settlers, have any relation
to, say, the pre-Columbian foods of Peru? Is the term pan-Latin any
more meaningful than pan-European?
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic thing that ties the cuisines together is the
language, but they also share ingredients,'' Rodriguez said, and
Ms. Von Bremzen agreed, adding that combining the cuisines may be a
marketing necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the individual cuisines might lack the sex appeal to
elevate them from the hole in the wall,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Tom Atkinson and Miriam Cordoba of Orinoco,
which opened in mid-December on the Upper East Side. While Orinoco
bills itself as offering the cuisine of South America, its
concentration is on Venezuela, where Ms. Cordoba grew up. Ms.
Cordoba, who was a sous-chef under Garcia at Erizo Latino, had been
working at Pacifico, a seafood restaurant that was one of several
places that Atkinson and a partner own. Business at Pacifico was
slow, except at Sunday brunch, when the owners allowed Ms. Cordoba
to put together a Venezuelan menu. ``We figured we were on to
something,'' Atkinson said. So they closed Pacifico and opened
Orinoco.
</P>
<P>
   With dishes on its menu like fried green plantains with stewed
salt cod, and venison stew with eggplant and potatoes, Ms. Cordoba
makes less of an effort than some other places to tailor her food
to North Americans. Yet she presents her food with art and style.
``My food is not nuevo Latino,'' she said emphatically. ``It is
typical regional food from Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Kuznick, who is half Brazilian, and her partner in
Ideya, Lauren Small, who grew up in Miami, their menu is ``a
contemporary interpretation of Latin American food.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does that mean? `'We make it less fattening,'' she
said. Her menu, put together with Ideya's chef, Christopher Rios,
includes dishes like roasted chicken with chorizo hash and whipped
yuca, and cocoa-cinnamon dusted breast of duck with stuffed
plantains and a poblano-red wine sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these restaurants will become long-term fixtures or
simply flavors of the month, New Yorkers have clearly widened their
appetites in the last year. And the ingredients themselves may be
the restaurants' most important legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're letting everybody know what malanga is, what ceviche
is,'' said Garcia of Calle Ocho. ``I don't know if all the
restaurants will stay, but the ingredients will stick.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)

FIREHOUSE '97, AND OTHER PROUD PARISIAN APPELLATIONS

<P>
   PARIS _ Avoiding the crowds waiting to ascend the Eiffel Tower
last week, a few intrepid tourists made their way instead to Bercy
Park at the southeast corner of the city to view an exhibition
called ``Vignes, Vins et Paris,'' or ``Vines, Wines and Paris.'' In
doing so, they joined the few insiders who know that Paris, a city
as urban as any, has eight vineyards. Six are cultivated by the
parks department, two are privately owned and all are very small.
</P>
<P>
   Though Paris was wine country centuries ago, a few of these
vineyards are only decades old; some were planted as recently as a
few years ago, in an effort to enhance certain neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The best known is in Montmartre, in the shadow of the great
white basilica of Sacre-Coeur. At harvest time, its grapes are
picked with considerable fanfare and the first bottles of the
previous year's harvest are sold to raise money for charity. The
1,800 vines, planted in 1932 on a site where vines had grown
centuries earlier, are mostly gamay and produce about 750 bottles a
year.
</P>
<P>
   In Belleville Park, the highest point in the city, 120 vines of
pinot meunier planted in 1993 produce about 300 bottles a year.
Pinot meunier is a principal grape of Champagne, and one day, the
city gardeners hope, these vines might produce a true sparkling
wine. In Georges Brassens Park in southern Paris, 700 vines of
pinot noir, pinot meunier and perlette, a German variety, yield 200
to 800 bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 chardonnay and sauvignon blanc vines grow in a small
city park on the Rue Lardenois in the northeast corner of the city.
Planted between 1994 and 1997, the vines have yet to produce enough
grapes to make their own wine. Nearby in the Parc de la Villette,
about 120 vines of golden chasselas produce about 200 bottles a
year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the private vineyards isn't exactly private; it consists
of 10 vines planted in 1934 that grow across the front of a
firehouse on the Rue Blanche in the central part of the city.
Generations of firefighters have tended the vines, which produce
about 50 bottles of wine a year. The grapes are pinot noir, but the
firefighters are quick to admit that Burgundy, where pinot noir is
king, has nothing to fear from the Rue Blanche.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of enormous vines climb around the sides of the Bistrot
Melac, in a working-class neighborhood near the Pere Lachaise
Cemetery. The bistro's owner, Jacques Melac, blends his grapes with
those of the members of the Association des Vignerons de Paris, a
semi-serious organization of grape growers that he founded.
</P>
<P>
   The association's 200 members are city folk who grow wine grapes
on terraces and balconies, in window boxes and tiny backyards.
Every year at harvest time, when Melac beckons, they gather from
all over the city, carrying their grapes in buckets, boxes and
plastic bags. He gives a party and helps them crush their grapes
and make about 800 bottles of wine. The winemaking is actually done
by a few moonlighters from Champagne or some other true wine
region. The highlight of each year's crush is a chance to taste the
previous vintage.
</P>
<P>
   The merriment that all of this occasions intrigues a lot of
other Parisians, and it is because of this growing interest that
the city mounted the exhibition, which is scheduled to run through
March but may be extended. Besides Bercy Park's own vineyard, now
neatly pruned, there are displays of winemaking equipment,
information on all the city's vineyards and classes on how to grow
wine grapes for fun, if not for profit.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended varieties, by the way, are not the grapes most
people think of when they drink French wine. The favored whites are
perdin and chasselas de Fontainebleau, and the reds are aladin,
Alphonse Lavallee and Brant, varieties that are hardy enough to
withstand city living.
</P>
<P>
   In Roman times, much of the Paris region was planted in vines.
In the Middle Ages, Parisian wines were a staple of the city's
growing population, and as recently as World War II, suburban
vineyards like those in Suresnes still produced wines commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout much of modern history, the Bercy district, along the
Right Bank of the Seine, was Paris' principal wine depot. Long
before railroads carried wine north to the city from the Midi, the
Rhone Valley and Burgundy, millions of gallons came up the river on
barges to be blended, stored and bottled in stone warehouses. A
small city of wine, Bercy included the Rue de Bordeaux, the Rue de
Macon, the Rue de Pommard and the Rue de Chambertin. So much a part
of city life were the wine sheds that, as Georges Simenon's
fictional Inspector Maigret recalled, ``When we arrested drunks we
wrote them up as `Bercys.'''
</P>
<P>
   Well into the 1960s, old-line wine companies still stored
inexpensive bulk wine at Bercy and bottled it for the city's small
grocery stores. As tastes have changed and disposable income has
risen, the market for this cheap stuff has virtually disappeared.
After sitting mostly abandoned for two decades, many of the Bercy
warehouses were pulled down, and the area was turned into a park
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything was demolished. One old building was converted
into a gardening center where people can learn how to grow grapes
in tough city conditions. A ``Bercy'' today is liable to be not a
drunk but an irate matron from the Avenue Foch demanding to know
why her vine died.

   JERUSALEM _ A good word on behalf of Benjamin Netanyahu? It
would be hard to find one in the Israeli press. No Israeli leader
has been so reviled by so many of his countrymen. History, however,
may prove somewhat more charitable.
</P>
<P>
   In applying parts of the Oslo accords, however partially,
reluctantly, gracelessly, he has made the more moderate half of the
Israeli right wing accessory to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he has moved the nation a good way through an
ideological minefield and exposed a latent peace consensus
embracing two-thirds of Israel's population.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly against his own instincts, he has made a future
settlement with the Palestinians a matter of pragmatic give and
take rather than a hostage to hopeless theological-historical
disputation over holy land.
</P>
<P>
   It may have required an oddity like Netanyahu to achieve this
not inconsequential step.
</P>
<P>
   When a Labor government carried out the first Oslo stages, the
country was torn by violent demonstrations culminating in the
assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Netanyahu's
concessions have evoked little more on the right than parliamentary
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu had initially opposed the Oslo peace accords. During
his election campaign he changed his tack after polls showed that
most Israelis felt otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   His narrow election victory was wrought by an alliance of
right-wing ideologues and a more moderate, largely ethnic sector of
Sephardi Jews opposed to the Labor Party, which they associate with
the Ashkenazi elite of European origin.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not oppose the peace process. They distrust Arabs
but, unlike the ideologues, accept Oslo's land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu achieved election success by fudging his rhetoric so
that ethnic supporters saw him as a tough peacemaker who would
drive a hard bargain, while the hard-liners, catching his wink,
were convinced that he had no intention of withdrawing on the West
Bank, whatever he said publicly.
</P>
<P>
   His heavy-handed maneuvering during the past two years went
beyond the bounds of clever tactics into inscrutability.
</P>
<P>
   Declarations of intent to honor Israel's Oslo commitments mixed
with acts of provocation seemingly designed to derail the peace
process have left even political allies wondering who the real
Netanyahu is. He has often seemed uncertain himself.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, his withdrawal in Hebron and his implementation of
the first of three withdrawals from West Bank rural areas
constituted a crossing of the Rubicon for the right wing. The
shining image of a Greater Israel stretching from the Mediterranean
Sea to the Jordan River was being violated, not by the left this
time but by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's claim that he is the only candidate who can
implement a peace acceptable to the nation is not altogether
exaggerated. Labor had the vision and courage to make the peace
breakthrough at Oslo, but Israel's national fiber was almost
sundered in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's aggressive rhetoric and posturing enable him to make
territorial concessions without being accused of selling out by the
moderate part of his right-wing constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners continue to oppose Oslo, but Netanyahu's
betrayal, as they call it, seems to have taken the fire out of
them. It has exposed them in their unyielding ideology without the
protective wrappings of the broader right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu was positioned to significantly push the peace process
forward, but his undoing was his own personality. To say that no
one in the country, particularly his own ministers, believes a word
he says may be overstatement, but not by much.
</P>
<P>
   He has thrived on attack politics, instilling a pervasive
nastiness into public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of building trust with the Palestinians as peace
partners, his attitude has been imperious and demeaning. Instead of
trying to heal Israel's internal rifts he is politically vulgar and
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   His chutzpah is boundless and without charm. His swagger and
perpetually smug expression reflect an almost adolescent need to be
perceived as a winner. ``I'm no sucker,'' is one of his favorite
phrases.
</P>
<P>
   History chooses its own instruments. Perhaps a transparent
manipulator was what Israel needed to persuade a critical portion
of the population to swallow territorial concessions. Without a
character transplant, however, Netanyahu's task would seem to be
finished. &QL;

   History chooses its own instruments. Perhaps a transparent
manipulator was what Israel needed to persuade a critical portion
of the population to swallow territorial concessions. Without a
character transplant, however, Netanyahu's task would seem to be
finished. &QL;

   HONG KONG _ Who doubts that Khieu Samphan, Nuon Chea and fellow
butchers deserve to be hanged, shot, poisoned, gassed or
electrocuted?
</P>
<P>
   And who, other than the pair's Khmer victims, has the right to
do so?
</P>
<P>
   The surrender of the pair and the confusion about what Prime
Minister Hun Sen plans to do with them has naturally aroused
anguish. Can perpetrators of mass murders escape? Is there no such
thing as genocide, no such thing as crime against humanity?
</P>
<P>
   Has the world forgotten so quickly the mass graves, the mounds
of skulls, the terror created by a bunch of pitiless semi-educated
ideologues?
</P>
<P>
   The demand that these men be surrendered to international
courts, to accept that there are some universal values that the
``international community'' must apply, is real enough. Unless
punished, the argument goes, the horror will surely be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are reasons to reject out of hand the demands
that the Khmer Rouge leaders be handed over to anyone but Khmers.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious but least weighty is that Hun Sen, although
originally one of their number, has spent more time _ some 20 years
_ and effort battling the butchers than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   He may not be likable, he may have treated efforts at democracy
in his country with a degree of contempt, he may be too close to
Vietnam for comfort. Some of his supporters have used violence to
further his cause. But no one has thrown charges of mass murder
against him.
</P>
<P>
   As elected (however imperfectly) prime minister, he has first
call on how Cambodians should deal with their former enemies
within.
</P>
<P>
   He also has to deal with the situation that in every village
there are Cambodians who, like French people during the Nazi
occupation, did the bidding of the rulers. What to do with them?
Trials in The Hague don't do much for that problem.
</P>
<P>
   How other Cambodians view the matter of Khieu Samphan and
company has yet to be played out. They may deliver their own
revenge on compatriots who caused the bloodbath. But let no one
pretend that the primary victims of the bloodletting were other
than Cambodians. This is a Khmer issue.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the little matter of who supported the Khmer Rouge
butchers after 1980. The mass graves, the slaughters of innocents,
the sheer terror of the Pol Pot era were well known to the outside
world by 1981.
</P>
<P>
   But who supported the Khmer Rouge with weapons for the next
decade? Not just Thailand and China, which had their own obvious if
ignoble reasons. It was all of (the then) ASEAN and most of the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Who voted year after year to keep Pol Pot and company seated at
the United Nations? None other than Western nations now expressing
horror that the butchers may not be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Was there talk of trials of Khmer leaders for their crimes when
the United Nations brokered the 1991 peace agreement?
</P>
<P>
   Demands for trial of the brutes seem bizarre to many in Asia who
note that no one doubts their guilt. So why a show trial? And if
they are guilty, why not execute them?
</P>
<P>
   The people pressing for trial are mostly the same who oppose the
only punishment that most Cambodians would believe fits the crime:
death.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodians, execute them if you wish, or let them live and be
hated _ perhaps a more profound punishment for these exemplars of
the banality of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners, read up on your own role in Cambodia in the last 50
years and be contrite. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sun also sets or, to be more accurate, settees.
Ernest Hemingway, writer, brawler, boozer, outdoor man, has become
a furniture line.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fame lives on thanks to the Ernest Hemingway Collection, a
new body of licensed products embracing furniture, accessories,
gifts and textiles,'' proclaims a press release from Fashion
Licensing of America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's president, Marla A. Metzner, is ensuring that the
Nobel Prize-winner's fame lives on in such objects as the Corrida
Sofa, the Sun Valley Cocktail Table and the Papa Hemingway Chair
and Ottoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Papa chair has a ``signature nailhead embossed with an H to
identify it as authentically Hemingway'' while the brush
metal-framed Pilar bookcase has a ``distinctive signature H and
marlin symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve licensees will release nearly 100 Hemingway home products
next month, with Thomasville Furniture in N.C. the chief player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernest Hemingway had a unique celebrity about him. He was a
very real person, not a designer, and he was bigger than life,''
says Thomasville's senior vice-president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was launched in October with Jack Hemingway, the
writer's oldest son, bolstering the line in the North Carolina
press. ``I think he would be pleased, but he might not say so,''
Jack told the Thomasville Times.
</P>
<P>
   In her Madison Avenue office, Metzner, svelte in a safari-style
suit, likes to use a Hemingwayesque term, ``the true gen,'' to
describe the Hemingway Collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the real thing. I love to use that because when the
property is right, when the category is right, it is a true gen, it
really does bring up all the images that are very Hemingwayesque.''
</P>
<P>
   That ottomans and slipcovers and woven chenille in wild animal
patterns could be the true gen became apparent to Metzner a couple
of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She informed the Hemingway family, whom she had represented
earlier on such minor deals as Gap and Calvin Klein ads, a limited
edition Mont Blanc pen in a box that was supposed to look like a
novel ($600, but only $325 for the rollerball), fly reels, Papa
Hemingway wire eyeglass frames made in Japan and a long-billed
fishing cap featured in the J. Peterman catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to make Hemingway a brand name by trademarking him
and then find a niche for the name, such as the burgeoning home
furnishings industry. It was Metzner who put together what she
calls the brand personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``High quality was absolutely number one. Masculine, having a
sense of the man _ passionate, enduring, international, this sense
of romance although very masculine.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity commodities are not new but the branding of the name
and its intensive merchandising is novel enough for the
grandchildren of another great writer to sign up with Metzner: She
is now at work on an F. Scott Fitzgerald line, of which only a pair
of Gatsby suspenders so far exist.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomasville's vice president explained, Hemingway was a real
person, not a designer, and so each Papa product has a biographical
bias: The furniture is inspired by four places where the writer
lived: Key West, Fla.; Havana; Kenya, and Ketchum, Idaho, where he
took his life.
</P>
<P>
   Why no Paris? ``Because we didn't want to do everything at
once,'' Metzner replied, ``just as Papa said at the end of the day
he didn't like to drain the well dry, he liked to leave a little
bit so he knew exactly where to go the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to do everything in the first line. Spain, the
Paris years and Italy _ that is all to come.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Caporetto chintz? Who knows? In the meantime, Metzner is working
on Hemingway apparel, although he was a notoriously sloppy dresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never do a suit; that wouldn't be appropriate,''
Metzner smoothly replied. She has in mind what she calls a major
sportswear line _ ``the kind of clothes that you would see
gentlemen wear in the Hamptons on the weekend. Tweeds, leather.
Country suburban, you might call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Literary consumer goods could have a great future. Beckett trash
cans for the new big areas, the kitchen and bathroom; an O. Henry
pocket watch; a Henry James golden bowl handcrafted in Taiwan with
a built-in flaw, and for Fitzgerald a hip flask.
</P>
<P>
   There is presumably nothing against a recreational utility
vehicle with zebra-patterned seats for Papa, Metzner having so far
drawn the line only at booze and firearms.
</P>
<P>
   A few grouches have of course criticized the branding of
Hemingway, but Metzner dismisses them easily. ``The family was
really defending their family name because if they didn't do it
someone else would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the things you see, the family wouldn't have approved.
By getting them pro-active, getting trademarks, now it has to be
approved. It could have been Wal-Mart or Sloppy Joe's around the
corner without their approval, so I commend them for protecting the
family name.''
</P>
<P>
   Metzner refuses to give details of the royalty agreements that
have been signed, but 1999 should be a good year for her and the
Hemingways.
</P>
<P>
   It is the centennial of the writer's birth, which will be marked
not only by a nationwide promotion for The Ernest Hemingway
Collection, but also by the publication of an abandoned manuscript
that Hemingway's youngest son, Patrick, has completed in his
father's stead and named ``True at First Light,'' and a film by
Hemingway's granddaughter, Mariel, of his Paris memoir, ``A
Moveable Feast.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy New Year, Papa. &QL;

metal-framed Pilar bookcase has a ``distinctive signature H and
marlin symbol.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve licensees will release nearly 100 Hemingway home products
next month, with Thomasville Furniture in N.C. the chief player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernest Hemingway had a unique celebrity about him. He was a
very real person, not a designer, and he was bigger than life,''
says Thomasville's senior vice-president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was launched in October with Jack Hemingway, the
writer's oldest son, bolstering the line in the North Carolina
press. ``I think he would be pleased, but he might not say so,''
Jack told the Thomasville Times.
</P>
<P>
   In her Madison Avenue office, Metzner, svelte in a safari-style
suit, likes to use a Hemingwayesque term, ``the true gen,'' to
describe the Hemingway Collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the real thing. I love to use that because when the
property is right, when the category is right, it is a true gen, it
really does bring up all the images that are very Hemingwayesque.''
</P>
<P>
   That ottomans and slipcovers and woven chenille in wild animal
patterns could be the true gen became apparent to Metzner a couple
of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   She informed the Hemingway family, whom she had represented
earlier on such minor deals as Gap and Calvin Klein ads, a limited
edition Mont Blanc pen in a box that was supposed to look like a
novel ($600, but only $325 for the rollerball), fly reels, Papa
Hemingway wire eyeglass frames made in Japan and a long-billed
fishing cap featured in the J. Peterman catalogue.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to make Hemingway a brand name by trademarking him
and then find a niche for the name, such as the burgeoning home
furnishings industry. It was Metzner who put together what she
calls the brand personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``High quality was absolutely number one. Masculine, having a
sense of the man _ passionate, enduring, international, this sense
of romance although very masculine.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity commodities are not new but the branding of the name
and its intensive merchandising is novel enough for the
grandchildren of another great writer to sign up with Metzner: She
is now at work on an F. Scott Fitzgerald line, of which only a pair
of Gatsby suspenders so far exist.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomasville's vice president explained, Hemingway was a real
person, not a designer, and so each Papa product has a biographical
bias: The furniture is inspired by four places where the writer
lived: Key West, Fla.; Havana; Kenya, and Ketchum, Idaho, where he
took his life.
</P>
<P>
   Why no Paris? ``Because we didn't want to do everything at
once,'' Metzner replied, ``just as Papa said at the end of the day
he didn't like to drain the well dry, he liked to leave a little
bit so he knew exactly where to go the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to do everything in the first line. Spain, the
Paris years and Italy _ that is all to come.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Caporetto chintz? Who knows? In the meantime, Metzner is working
on Hemingway apparel, although he was a notoriously sloppy dresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would never do a suit; that wouldn't be appropriate,''
Metzner smoothly replied. She has in mind what she calls a major
sportswear line _ ``the kind of clothes that you would see
gentlemen wear in the Hamptons on the weekend. Tweeds, leather.
Country suburban, you might call it.''
</P>
<P>
   Literary consumer goods could have a great future. Beckett trash
cans for the new big areas, the kitchen and bathroom; an O. Henry
pocket watch; a Henry James golden bowl handcrafted in Taiwan with
a built-in flaw, and for Fitzgerald a hip flask.
</P>
<P>
   There is presumably nothing against a recreational utility
vehicle with zebra-patterned seats for Papa, Metzner having so far
drawn the line only at booze and firearms.
</P>
<P>
   A few grouches have of course criticized the branding of
Hemingway, but Metzner dismisses them easily. ``The family was
really defending their family name because if they didn't do it
someone else would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the things you see, the family wouldn't have approved.
By getting them pro-active, getting trademarks, now it has to be
approved. It could have been Wal-Mart or Sloppy Joe's around the
corner without their approval, so I commend them for protecting the
family name.''
</P>
<P>
   Metzner refuses to give details of the royalty agreements that
have been signed, but 1999 should be a good year for her and the
Hemingways.
</P>
<P>
   It is the centennial of the writer's birth, which will be marked
not only by a nationwide promotion for The Ernest Hemingway
Collection, but also by the publication of an abandoned manuscript
that Hemingway's youngest son, Patrick, has completed in his
father's stead and named ``True at First Light,'' and a film by
Hemingway's granddaughter, Mariel, of his Paris memoir, ``A
Moveable Feast.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy New Year, Papa. &QL;

   GLAND, Switzerland _ What are we to make of the year that just
came to its end when we consider the state of our planet? For many,
1998 will be remembered as the year of the fires, floods and
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people have died and catastrophic damage has been
caused by torrential rain and exceptionally violent storms.
</P>
<P>
   As for the forest fires that swept parts of Asia and Latin
America, the full extent of the destruction is only now beginning
to be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The common factor in all these disasters is the global climate.
This is particularly noticeable in the case of forests. Their
distribution has always been influenced by climatic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   During the glacial periods, which were cool and dry in the
tropics, rain forests shrank to small ``refuges.'' Often the agents
of their demise was fire.
</P>
<P>
   Moist tropical forests become prone to burning when the leaf
litter and undergrowth dries up after unusually long periods of
drought, and fire spreads from surrounding grasslands.
</P>
<P>
   Today we are again seeing the frequent incidence of long dry
seasons in the tropics. Once more, fire has begun to play a key
role in the forests. But this time it is not simply the fact that
we are confronted with climate change, and change much more rapid
than in the glacial ages because it is driven by the behavior of
humankind.
</P>
<P>
   The fires themselves are mostly man-made. They are lit to clear
trees so that land can be used for agriculture or other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   With the increasing fragmentation of forest areas as a result of
timber exploitation and clearance, fires are pushing back tropical
forest fringe in Amazonia, West Africa and Southeast Asia at
increasing speed. If that continues unchecked, the world faces
deeply alarming consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The Hadley Center for Climate Change in Berkshire, England, has
calculated with its super-computer that unless things change, parts
of the Amazon rain forest will turn into desert in the next
half-century.
</P>
<P>
   That will add to the greenhouse global warming effect that we
are now learning to fear and starting to try to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   There is a terrible irony in the center's pronouncement that in
the wake of the 1998 fires the forests have already become a net
producer of carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas that experts around
the world now agree must be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hopes of industrialized nations that have been
reluctant to take drastic action to cut carbon dioxide emissions is
that forests might provide a partial solution by absorbing the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Policymakers need to wake up to the fact that there is no
alternative to action that will reduce the concentrations of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they must accept that moves to stop the
destruction of forests, and to conserve and manage them
sustainably, have a role to play in controlling climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of clinging to the forlorn hope that the trees will save
us, we have to help ourselves by saving the trees. &QL;

categories.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ President Clinton announced controversial steps Tuesday
aimed at easing U.S. sanctions against Cuba, drawing howls of anger
from some exiles, but enthusiastic support from U.S. businesses
that have lobbied hard for any loosening of the tough U.S. economic
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement, Clinton effectively rejected a
proposal for an all-out review of the U.S. policy of isolating the
hemisphere's sole communist holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps are designed to help the Cuban people without
strengthening the Cuban government,'' Clinton said in announcing
the measures, which build on a previous easing of the 36-year-old
embargo last March.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measures, the United States will: allow direct mail
service to Cuba, expand direct charter flights to and from Cuba,
increase cash transfers from private Americans to needy Cubans, and
encourage the exchange of athletes, scientists and other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles baseball team, for example, will be
allowed to arrange exhibition games with the Cuban national team in
both the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a substantial change in U.S. policy and probably the
single-greatest change in U.S. policy in more than a decade,'' said
John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council in New York, the largest nonpartisan U.S. organization
providing information on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most controversial measure is one that allows the
sale of U.S. food and agricultural supplies to non-governmental
entities on the island, including religious groups and Cuba's
emerging private sector, such as family restaurants and independent
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics blasted the measure, saying it would require too much
cooperation from the Cuban government, and could even be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing but smoke and mirrors,'' said Wayne Smith,
formerly the top U.S. diplomat in Havana during the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can sell food to groups in Cuba when the distribution
system is run by the state,'' he said. ``These moves just avoid a
serious and much-needed review of American policy towards Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had hoped Clinton would agree with at least 21 senators
who have pushed for the establishment of a bipartisan commission to
analyze the effect of the embargo on America's economy and
relationship with its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said the sale of food products may
empower Cuban President Fidel Castro more than the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since virtually nobody on the island has significant amounts
of hard currency except the government, who will be purchasing
these products?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Malone, an expert on Cuba at Georgetown University in
Washington, said the measure comes dangerously close to
manipulating the Catholic church in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has tried to be independent in Cuba, so it doesn't
help when the United States decides that food sales must go through
non-governmental groups, such as the Catholic church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. -- himself a Cuban-American --
said he will oppose any food sales to Cuba because they would
violate U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says any such sales would be limited to
entities independent of the government and therefore would be
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich said the sale of food commodities to Cuba could total
$300 million this year, but only if the Cuban government is allowed
to provide funds to non-governmental organizations so that they can
afford the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most U.S. business groups applauded Tuesday's
announcement, saying it was a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think it's time to review our entire policy, and we
believe this is a step toward doing just that,'' said Frank
Kittredge, vice chairman of USA Engage, a coalition of 675
businesses working to end unilateral U.S. foreign-policy sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich added that the new moves could benefit a wide variety
of U.S. companies, including Atlanta-based United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the Cuban market, U.S. businesses have pushed
hard for a relaxation of the embargo since the visit of Pope John
Paul II to Cuba last January.
</P>
<P>
   The number of American business executives traveling to Cuba has
grown from 500 in 1994 to some 2,500 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, the pope emphasized his long opposition to the
embargo and urged the world to open up to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent reaction to the pope's visit, Clinton announced an
easing of sanctions in March that included a reinstatement of
remittances by Cuban-Americans to relatives on the island of up to
$1,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials reiterated this week that while the new
initiatives go even further in promoting people-to-people contacts,
none of them involve any softening of the U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
   They said that lifting the embargo would require a change in
U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would enrage Cuban-American voters, meaning it's one
the administration is unlikely to contemplate less than two years
before a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina greeted Tuesday's
announcement with some skepticism, saying it did not do away with
an unjust blockade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the first time that announcements are made of
initiatives that don't really go to the root of the problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright responded Tuesday
that U.S. policy toward Cuba was designed to promote closer ties
between people of both countries without providing aid and comfort
to a ``repressive and backward-looking regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The new measures are designed to build on the Cuba Democracy Act
of 1992, which tightened the embargo but also called for increased
exchanges between Cubans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But exile Frank Calzon, director of the non-profit Center for a
Free Cuba in Washington, warned that the measures mostly reward the
Cuban government, which is still a repressive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These measures imply that the United States can play ball with
Castro, but that's not true,'' he said. ``Sure, you can play ball
with him, but Castro still makes the rules, which just isn't
right.''

 &HT;    CLINTON EASES EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA, DELIGHTING U.S. BUSINESS
GROUPS
 &HT;    With CUBA-EMBARGO-0106.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.

   MIAMI _ President Clinton announced controversial steps Tuesday
aimed at easing U.S. sanctions against Cuba, drawing howls of anger
from some exiles, but enthusiastic support from U.S. businesses
that have lobbied hard for any loosening of the tough U.S. economic
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement, Clinton effectively rejected a
proposal for an all-out review of the U.S. policy of isolating the
hemisphere's sole communist holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps are designed to help the Cuban people without
strengthening the Cuban government,'' Clinton said in announcing
the measures, which build on a previous easing of the 36-year-old
embargo last March.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measures, the United States will: allow direct mail
service to Cuba, expand direct charter flights to and from Cuba,
increase cash transfers from private Americans to needy Cubans, and
encourage the exchange of athletes, scientists and other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles baseball team, for example, will be
allowed to arrange exhibition games with the Cuban national team in
both the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a substantial change in U.S. policy and probably the
single-greatest change in U.S. policy in more than a decade,'' said
John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council in New York, the largest nonpartisan U.S. organization
providing information on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most controversial measure is one that allows the
sale of U.S. food and agricultural supplies to non-governmental
entities on the island, including religious groups and Cuba's
emerging private sector, such as family restaurants and independent
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics blasted the measure, saying it would require too much
cooperation from the Cuban government, and could even be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing but smoke and mirrors,'' said Wayne Smith,
formerly the top U.S. diplomat in Havana during the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can sell food to groups in Cuba when the distribution
system is run by the state,'' he said. ``These moves just avoid a
serious and much-needed review of American policy towards Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had hoped Clinton would agree with at least 21 senators
who have pushed for the establishment of a bipartisan commission to
analyze the effect of the embargo on America's economy and
relationship with its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said the sale of food products may
empower Cuban President Fidel Castro more than the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since virtually nobody on the island has significant amounts
of hard currency except the government, who will be purchasing
these products?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Malone, an expert on Cuba at Georgetown University in
Washington, said the measure comes dangerously close to
manipulating the Catholic church in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has tried to be independent in Cuba, so it doesn't
help when the United States decides that food sales must go through
non-governmental groups, such as the Catholic church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. -- himself a Cuban-American --
said he will oppose any food sales to Cuba because they would
violate U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says any such sales would be limited to
entities independent of the government and therefore would be
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich said the sale of food commodities to Cuba could total
$300 million this year, but only if the Cuban government is allowed
to provide funds to non-governmental organizations so that they can
afford the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most U.S. business groups applauded Tuesday's
announcement, saying it was a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think it's time to review our entire policy, and we
believe this is a step toward doing just that,'' said Frank
Kittredge, vice chairman of USA Engage, a coalition of 675
businesses working to end unilateral U.S. foreign-policy sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich added that the new moves could benefit a wide variety
of U.S. companies, including Atlanta-based United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the Cuban market, U.S. businesses have pushed
hard for a relaxation of the embargo since the visit of Pope John
Paul II to Cuba last January.
</P>
<P>
   The number of American business executives traveling to Cuba has
grown from 500 in 1994 to some 2,500 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, the pope emphasized his long opposition to the
embargo and urged the world to open up to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent reaction to the pope's visit, Clinton announced an
easing of sanctions in March that included a reinstatement of
remittances by Cuban-Americans to relatives on the island of up to
$1,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials reiterated this week that while the new
initiatives go even further in promoting people-to-people contacts,
none of them involve any softening of the U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
   They said that lifting the embargo would require a change in
U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would enrage Cuban-American voters, meaning it's one
the administration is unlikely to contemplate less than two years
before a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina greeted Tuesday's
announcement with some skepticism, saying it did not do away with
an unjust blockade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the first time that announcements are made of
initiatives that don't really go to the root of the problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright responded Tuesday
that U.S. policy toward Cuba was designed to promote closer ties
between people of both countries without providing aid and comfort
to a ``repressive and backward-looking regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The new measures are designed to build on the Cuba Democracy Act
of 1992, which tightened the embargo but also called for increased
exchanges between Cubans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But exile Frank Calzon, director of the non-profit Center for a
Free Cuba in Washington, warned that the measures mostly reward the
Cuban government, which is still a repressive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These measures imply that the United States can play ball with
Castro, but that's not true,'' he said. ``Sure, you can play ball
with him, but Castro still makes the rules, which just isn't
right.''

   Current U.S. policy toward communist-ruled Cuba:
</P>
<P>
   The United States has had an embargo against trade with Cuba
since 1963. The embargo prohibits the export of all but a very few
products from the United States to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Travel to Cuba is allowed but Americans can't spend money there
unless they are licensed by the U.S. Treasury Department or their
trip is paid for by a non-U.S. entity. Journalists, for example,
can receive such licenses.

<P>
   &QR;  resume licensing of direct charter flights to Cuba from Miami;

<P>
   &QR;  allow Cuban-Americans to send remittances to family members in

CAN GOVERNMENT FUNCTION NOW?

 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten days before the House voted along partisan
lines to impeach President Clinton, 48 congressional leaders of
both parties met with him in a closed session to analyze ways to
protect the future of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   This is one issue that Democrats and Republicans agree should
top their legislative priority list. And a participant in the
meeting reports that the topic was discussed soberly and seriously,
without anger or partisan posturing.
</P>
<P>
   But there was an illusory air about that session on Dec. 9. It
was as though the Social Security issue existed apart from, and
unaffected by, the impeachment politics that pervaded everything
outside the room. The meeting was unreal. The time was wasted.
</P>
<P>
   House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer of Texas, carried away
by the solemnity of the occasion, leaned toward Clinton and
observed earnestly, ``There is no reason we can't solve the Social
Security problem. You have only two years left, and I have
announced I will retire in two years. We are not running for
anything any more. This is our opportunity to leave a bipartisan
legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a participant, one senator whispered loudly to
another: ``What is this two-year business? Am I mad or has
impeachment suddenly vanished?''
</P>
<P>
   Mentally and emotionally, Congress and the White House can't get
away from the titanic power struggle over the president's fate. Yet
if they are ever to truly work together this year to address the
nation's business, the Archer approach must somehow take hold.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood, however, is that the partisan rancor generated
by the impeachment ruckus will paralyze Washington until the
presidential election next year can shake up the political
landscape, bring in fresh faces and break the pattern of endless
retaliatory partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   Archer may have been ignoring the impeachment sideshow in the
vain hope that it could be compartmentalized away. Maybe he
believes that the Senate will not convict the president, a common
assumption that could yet prove inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment is not a trivial pursuit to be used as a
political tool to embarrass a president while not really intended
to bring him down. The partisan hostility generated by the
name-calling cannot be easily forgotten or forgiven. Our
legislators are not saints.
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and Congress insist that they can still
work together in the nation's interest. They have to say that, or
concede they are useless. Common sense indicates both parties will
be in trouble at the polls in the next election if Washington
appears moribund.
</P>
<P>
   The controlling Republican majority must shake the
``do-nothing'' label of the last Congress, which hurt the party in
the 1998 election. Clinton, for his part, cannot make his lame-duck
status worse by looking beaten.
</P>
<P>
   He has been ostentatiously carrying out his presidential duties
despite the congressional chaos over how to convict him, acquit him
or censure him. This attempt at normalcy may seem weird, but it has
helped to shore up public support for him.
</P>
<P>
   During the holiday season he proposed a series of legislative
remedies for obvious social problems, some expensive but some quite
financially modest. They were designed to appeal to constituencies
important to consolidating the Democratic hold on the White House
into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's agenda includes huge new spending increases in the
defense budget, a favorite cause of conservatives. He also proposed
billions for the long-term disabled and their family caregivers,
more funds for food-safety inspections, tougher laws to fight child
abuse and murder, tax breaks for businesses that try to reduce air
pollution, federal subsidies to rebuild the nation's decaying
schools, expanded antiterrorist programs and more federal aid for
the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   This flurry of activity did not include the broad new tax cuts
demanded by GOP conservatives or any specifics about how to protect
federal budget surpluses so they can reinforce Social Security's
long-term viability. These issues would be contentious even without
the emotions aroused by the impeachment struggle.

</P>
<P>
   Whoa, sorry about that.
</P>
<P>
   After being snowbound for a few days, I was having my own little
snowbound-Jack Nicholson-cabin-fever-``Shining''-breakdown at the
keyboard for a moment there _ but I'm out of it now, ready to open
the Notebook of Observations on the Blizzard of '99. For starters,
some experts say it wasn't technically a blizzard at all because at
no point did we have sustained winds of 35 mph or more for a
three-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, 9 a.m.: The guy on the radio was saying Lake
Shore Drive was closed at just about the time I was finding out for
myself, firsthand, that Lake Shore Drive truly was closed. In order
to go south I had to travel north and then double back, so a
15-minute trip took me an hour and a half _ but that's OK. If
nothing else, it gave me the chance to eyewitness a number of
Winter-Weather Phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exhibit A, the Jogger Guy.
</P>
<P>
   We were in the middle of the worst storm in two decades and this
fitness freak was prancing along, no doubt feeling superior to us
mortals on the highway, spinning our wheels in three-foot snow
drifts or skidding on the ice or stumbling through the treacherous
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea pal: Why don't you jog your Patagonia-clad self
over to a shrink who'll help you deal with the obvious imbalance in
your life that compels you to go running in a blizzard, OK?
</P>
<P>
   _ Exhibit B, the dog-walkers.
</P>
<P>
   This makes a little more sense. If Binky or Blackie has to go,
he or she has to go. But still, it wasn't a scene of people walking
their dogs; I was seeing dogs walking their people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exhibit C, the four-wheel drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a car works just fine if you have to navigate the
streets of Chicago, even on the Dan Ryan Expressway during rush
hour. Really. But for a few days now, I'll admit it would be nice
to have one of those monster sport-utility vehicles with the Big
Crunching Tires. Go ahead, eat snow, Rover!
</P>
<P>
   Those lucky folks this last weekend, for instance, who were
behind the wheel of a Jeep Cherokee or a Ford Explorer or a Chevy
Suburban, had a clear advantage.
</P>
<P>
   HOWEVER, that didn't give any of them the license to drive like
an idiot.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bit of history, please. Back in 1979, Chicago was hit with one
of the worst snowstorms in the city's history. Mayor Michael
Bilandic, like a melting snowman, saw his political career
disappearing as the city's crews were way-too-slow to respond to
the deluge, prompting thousands of still-grumbling voters to vote
for upstart Jane Byrne a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   Up until then, the Great Blizzard of '79 was the biggest
political upset Chicago had ever seen. Politicians ever since in
this part of the world have made VERY sure the plows and salt
trucks are out in full force, even if there's little more than a
dusting of the white stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For a huge storm like right now, our current Mayor Daley isn't
taking any chances. Whereas he tends to be invisible most weekends
(one of the refreshing things about our mayor is he reserves the
right to spend time with his family), save for a parade or picnic
here and there, this last Saturday, as the snow fell, he called a
press conference to update and reassure citizens about their city's
progress in dealing with the huge storm.
</P>
<P>
   No small show, the press conference was broadcast live on five
TV stations and a number of radio outlets too, and Daley was at his
tongue-tied and zany best as he handled questions from reporters.
Asked if he was surprised that despite the outlandish conditions
outdoors, some beds in the city's homeless shelters actually were
going unused, the mayor said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this is uh, you know, we, we, every year we point this
out. A lot of, this is a record, whether it's November cold or
there's one or two days, or December-January-February or March,
happens every year, EVERY YEAR, unused beds. So if you see anybody
there it's really a matter of choice. We can't force them in, we
cannot physically bring them in. They're out there ... under Wacker
Drive, completely nude, walking around, we cannot bring them in. So
remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Something tells me that I WILL remember that. ... brrrrrr!
</P>

   Whoa, sorry about that.
</P>
<P>
   After being snowbound for a few days, I was having my own little
snowbound-Jack Nicholson-cabin-fever-``Shining''-breakdown at the
keyboard for a moment there _ but I'm out of it now, ready to open
the Notebook of Observations on the Blizzard of '99. For starters,
some experts say it wasn't technically a blizzard at all because at
no point did we have sustained winds of 35 mph or more for a
three-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, 9 a.m.: The guy on the radio was saying Lake
Shore Drive was closed at just about the time I was finding out for
myself, firsthand, that Lake Shore Drive truly was closed. In order
to go south I had to travel north and then double back, so a
15-minute trip took me an hour and a half _ but that's OK. If
nothing else, it gave me the chance to eyewitness a number of
Winter-Weather Phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exhibit A, the Jogger Guy.
</P>
<P>
   We were in the middle of the worst storm in two decades and this
fitness freak was prancing along, no doubt feeling superior to us
mortals on the highway, spinning our wheels in three-foot snow
drifts or skidding on the ice or stumbling through the treacherous
streets.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an idea pal: Why don't you jog your Patagonia-clad self
over to a shrink who'll help you deal with the obvious imbalance in
your life that compels you to go running in a blizzard, OK?
</P>
<P>
   _ Exhibit B, the dog-walkers.
</P>
<P>
   This makes a little more sense. If Binky or Blackie has to go,
he or she has to go. But still, it wasn't a scene of people walking
their dogs; I was seeing dogs walking their people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Exhibit C, the four-wheel drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Usually a car works just fine if you have to navigate the
streets of Chicago, even on the Dan Ryan Expressway during rush
hour. Really. But for a few days now, I'll admit it would be nice
to have one of those monster sport-utility vehicles with the Big
Crunching Tires. Go ahead, eat snow, Rover!
</P>
<P>
   Those lucky folks this last weekend, for instance, who were
behind the wheel of a Jeep Cherokee or a Ford Explorer or a Chevy
Suburban, had a clear advantage.
</P>
<P>
   HOWEVER, that didn't give any of them the license to drive like
an idiot.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A bit of history, please. Back in 1979, Chicago was hit with one
of the worst snowstorms in the city's history. Mayor Michael
Bilandic, like a melting snowman, saw his political career
disappearing as the city's crews were way-too-slow to respond to
the deluge, prompting thousands of still-grumbling voters to vote
for upstart Jane Byrne a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   Up until then, the Great Blizzard of '79 was the biggest
political upset Chicago had ever seen. Politicians ever since in
this part of the world have made VERY sure the plows and salt
trucks are out in full force, even if there's little more than a
dusting of the white stuff.
</P>
<P>
   For a huge storm like right now, our current Mayor Daley isn't
taking any chances. Whereas he tends to be invisible most weekends
(one of the refreshing things about our mayor is he reserves the
right to spend time with his family), save for a parade or picnic
here and there, this last Saturday, as the snow fell, he called a
press conference to update and reassure citizens about their city's
progress in dealing with the huge storm.
</P>
<P>
   No small show, the press conference was broadcast live on five
TV stations and a number of radio outlets too, and Daley was at his
tongue-tied and zany best as he handled questions from reporters.
Asked if he was surprised that despite the outlandish conditions
outdoors, some beds in the city's homeless shelters actually were
going unused, the mayor said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this is uh, you know, we, we, every year we point this
out. A lot of, this is a record, whether it's November cold or
there's one or two days, or December-January-February or March,
happens every year, EVERY YEAR, unused beds. So if you see anybody
there it's really a matter of choice. We can't force them in, we
cannot physically bring them in. They're out there ... under Wacker
Drive, completely nude, walking around, we cannot bring them in. So
remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Something tells me that I WILL remember that. ... brrrrrr!

`THE BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY': 3 FRENCH MINDS, DEFIANT AND BRAVE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a country that has provided some of the world's greatest
thinkers, France has had a dubious 20th century. Between the two
world wars, most French thinkers were so preoccupied by the
traditional Gallic war of left versus right that they failed to
respond effectively to the rise of Fascism. During World War II,
many French intellectuals supported the collaborationist Vichy
regime, and afterward, again riven by ideological conflict, many
were uncritical of, or worse, excused the policies of Stalin to
avoid comforting their rightist opponents.
</P>
<P>
   But some French thinkers went against the grain of their
contemporaries, and three of them are the subject of ``The Burden
of Responsibility,'' Tony Judt's elegantly difficult, eloquent and
instructive study of intellectual courage in the face of what the
author persuasively describes as intellectual irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Judt has written three probing and complex essays on the figures
he considers heroes. They are Leon Blum, the leader of the French
Socialist Party for most of the 1920s and '30s; Albert Camus, the
novelist and moral critic, and Raymond Aron, the philosopher and
polemicist who, from the 1930s to his death in 1983, played a role
in France similar to the one that Isaiah Berlin played in Britain
as his country's leading commentator on the beauty and fragility of
liberal society.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes these three men interesting,'' Judt writes, ``is
their shared quality of moral (and, as it happens, physical)
courage, their willingness to take a stand not against their
political or intellectual opponents _ everyone did that, all too
often _ but against their `own' side.''
</P>
<P>
   Judt's portraits in courage are not for specialists alone, but
they are not entirely accessible either, especially if you are
unfamiliar with the main strands of 20th-century European history
and thought. And even if you are familiar with most of the terms
and names here, you might wish that Judt explained a bit more and
provided concrete examples rather than relying on abstraction and
generalization as much as he does. (He also ought to have
translated his various French citations.) When, for example, Judt
writes that the ``French revolutionary myth'' was to Aron the
desire to ``bridge the gap between moral intransigence and
intelligence,'' you think you understand what that means, but you
yearn for a more direct, unadorned formulation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a morally lucid and penetrating book, the product
of long and deep thinking, and it contains many arresting passages.
``One of the things that he had come to dislike the most about
Parisian intellectuals,'' Judt writes about Camus, ``was their
conviction that they had something to say about everything, and
that everything could be reduced to the kind of thing they liked to
say.'' In many ways, Judt, who is the Erich Maria Remarque
Professor of European Studies at New York University, has written a
natural sequel to his most recent other book, ``Past Imperfect:
French Intellectuals, 1944-1956'' (University of California Press).
There, Judt's focus was irresponsibility itself, especially by
those ranging from the Roman Catholic left to Jean-Paul Sartre, who
both dealt in revolutionary illusions, ignoring reality even while
spouting fashionable opinions about it. In his new book, Judt
concentrates on case studies of independent thinking that was
solitary, hostility-inducing and exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   Judt's longest and most absorbing portrait is of Blum, who was
the only one of the three to hold public office, as prime minister
in the two Popular Front governments that briefly held power in
France in the late 1930s. Judt does not worship Blum. He holds him
responsible for a kind of bad judgment that contributed not only to
the failure of his governments but to the civil morass of France in
the 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Blum was amazingly brave _ ``the only prominent French
Socialist to have the courage openly to abandon pacifism,
collective disarmament and appeasement in the face of the
international realities of the late '30s.'' Earlier, after the
Bolshevik Revolution, Blum broke with Leninist authoritarianism and
preserved a democratic socialist alternative for France. More
unusual perhaps, he had the guts to admit publicly when he was
wrong, as he did after the Soviet-engineered 1948 coup in
Czechoslovakia, blaming his party for naive blindness regarding
Stalin's intentions. Significantly, Blum, a Jew, operated amid
anti-Semitism whose corrosiveness and intensity is difficult to
understand in our far more polite times. Even when physically
attacked, Blum calmly refused to withdraw from politics. ``I have
often thought,'' he said, ``that morality consists uniquely perhaps
in having the courage to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   The men that Judt discusses were so different from one another
that it seems strange at first to see them lumped together as a
category, and indeed, Judt's fine delineation of each preserves
individual differences. But, as Judt describes them, all were in
important respects outsiders to their own society. Aron and Blum
were Jews; Camus, born in Algeria and powerfully imprinted by the
experience of North Africa, shared in none of the old-school ties
of what might be called the establishment revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   All men repudiated what they saw as their peers' dangerous
romance with the idea of revolution, or, as Judt puts it, ``the
disposition of intellectuals to take words for things.'' All his
life, Aron insisted on a lucid understanding of reality while
intellectuals were swept away by the beauty of the pure idea.
``Only the hidden is truly scientific, burbles the tribe of
Parisian philosophers _ none of whom has ever practiced any science
at all,'' he once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Courage and genuine independence are not common at any time or
in any place, not in midcentury France nor in the United States
today. Judt's study is aimed, he explains, at elucidating something
about French history. Part of the value of reading his book,
however, is its relevance to other times and places as well,
including our own.

<P>
   The first impulse of many uninitiated cooks who happen upon root
vegetables from Latin America in the market is simply to shake
their heads and walk way. These tubers _ brown, bumpy, sometimes
even scaly _ look for all the world like miniature logs that were
tossed into the vegetable bin by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could be further from the truth. These vegetables
are bedrock culinary staples throughout Latin America and the
Caribbean and provide great culinary rewards for those willing to
explore them. In their simplest form, they can be boiled and mashed
to make smooth, rich purees, which are slightly more flavorful
versions of mashed potatoes. Deep fried, they become crisp,
deliciously tangy fries or chips. Added to soups and stews, they
provide not only pleasantly earthy flavors but also a lovely
creaminess.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them can be baked, turned into hash browns or otherwise
cooked as you would potatoes. In fact, getting to know the virtues
of these roots is like suddenly having a whole new array of
potatoes to enliven your table.
</P>
<P>
   And like potatoes, these Latin tubers also provide a perfect
backdrop for more aggressive flavorings, from hot chilies to
pungent garlic and tangy citrus.
</P>
<P>
   Since they are inexpensive ingredients used mostly by home
cooks, these roots and tubers often have different vernacular names
from country to country. This can make sorting them out confusing.
A good place to start, though, is with the distinctive root called
yuca (pronounced YOO-kah). Also known as manioc or cassava, yuca is
probably the most popular of Latin roots both in this country and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, we received a lesson in the centrality of this
humble root in Latin American cooking. Driving from our touchdown
point in San Jose, Costa Rica's capital, to the village of
Tamarindo on the Pacific coast, we stopped for a meal at a roadside
restaurant. We ordered up a storm: grilled pork chops with
tomatillo salsa, shell-on shrimp, whole snapper, rice and beans and
local beers. But our waiter was obviously not satisfied. After a
brief pause he arched an eyebrow and inquired, ``And an order of
yuca?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, we agreed, and the mashed yuca, served with a spicy
lime-garlic sauce, was the ideal complement to the rest of the
food. It was so good, in fact, that ``un orden de yuca'' became the
catch phrase of our trip. But what most impressed us was the
waiter's sense that without this starchy vegetable our meal was
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   While yuca is far from reaching that point in the United States,
it has gained prominence as a favorite of the East Coast's large
Cuban-American population. Indeed, in Miami the name of the
vegetable was appropriated as an acronym for young upscale
Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yuca is shaped like a very long, narrow sweet potato. Its rough
outer skin looks like scaly bark, and often a thick coating of wax
is applied to keep it fresh during shipping. Yuca's interior is
stark white with a crisp texture, and it bleeds a thin white liquid
when cut.
</P>
<P>
   Cooked, yuca has a slightly sweet, buttery flavor and a
glutinous, chewy texture. Like most of its tuberous cousins, it can
be cooked in any way that a potato can, but we like it best boiled.
Yuca takes a bit of precooking preparation because its underskin
and central core both have to be removed. It should also be served
hot because as it cools it quickly hardens.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line in the Latin root hit parade are malanga and taro,
two members of the same family, which are virtually
indistinguishable to the untrained eye. Malanga, also known as
yautia, may look like an elongated sweet potato or a fat turnip. It
has medium brown, shaggy, mottled brown skin, which often does not
fully cover the flesh underneath. The flesh, which can be white,
yellow or pinkish, has a distinct, nutty flavor, with a pleasantly
musty undertone. It is great when boiled or fried, but doesn't bake
well because of its slightly waxy texture. Malanga also performs
particularly well in soups, because with long simmering it begins
to soften and dissolve into a creamy paste that thickens the soup
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Malanga's near twin, taro, called dasheen in the Caribbean, is
found in two varieties in the United States. The most prevalent is
shaped very much like malanga, only slightly more like a barrel. It
also has a barklike skin like malanga's and a comparably sweetish
nutty flavor. To make it even more confusing, in Cuban stores one
of the most popular varieties of taro is called malanga islena, or
island malanga.
</P>
<P>
   One difference between malanga and taro is that the off-white
flesh of the larger variety of taro is often speckled with tiny
dots. But trying to distinguish between the two is ultimately not
worth the effort. Just buy whichever you find. They are very much
alike in taste and can be cooked in the same ways. Be aware,
though, that the flesh of taro has a tendency to turn gray when
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   The second, less popular variety of taro is much smaller, about
the size of a new potato. It is much like its larger brother but
has a blander flavor. In our opinion, it is not really worth
seeking out.
</P>
<P>
   Even the taro-malanga confusion pales beside the sweet
potato-yam mix-up. The first key to solving it is to understand
that those sweet orange tubers that we call yams in the United
States are actually sweet potatoes. The misnomer was foisted on the
public in the 1930s by a group of Louisiana farmers who wanted to
distinguish a new type of sweet potato they had developed, and so
they called it a yam.
</P>
<P>
   The true yam is one of the world's most important food crops,
widely eaten throughout Asia and Africa, as well as Latin America.
There are more than 600 species of yams, but the type most
prevalent in this country is brown or brown-black and may resemble
a log or a misshapen rock. Also known as name (pronounced NYAH-may)
or igname (EE-nyahm) it has crisp white flesh, ranging from white
through off-white to almost yellow. Cooked, it is like a dry,
floury, bland potato. It may be roasted, boiled or fried, but is
too sticky to make into a puree. Before cooking, it must be thickly
peeled to get rid of the bitter sap that is found immediately
beneath the skin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of sweet potatoes, another of the Latin roots is the
one that almost everyone outside the United States calls just that.
Variously known in this country as boniato, batata dulce or Cuban
sweet potato, this potato-size, bulbous root has pinkish mottled
skin and creamy white flesh and can be cooked exactly like sweet
potatoes. While boniatos are slightly drier in texture than sweet
potatoes when cooked, their wonderfully delicate, slightly sweet,
chestnutlike flavor makes up for this slight shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The bulbous, thin-skinned jicama (hee-CAH-mah), unlike its
starchier cousins, is best used raw. It has a wonderfully crisp,
crunchy texture and a sweetish taste that falls somewhere between
an apple and a potato. Similar to the jicama is the apio
(ah-PEE-oh), often called arraccha. This tuber, which resembles a
celery root, but is less aromatic, may be used raw or cooked and is
starting to make inroads in the United States market.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy tubers and roots, choose very hard roots that have
no soft spots, no external mold and no cracks. With yuca and taro,
ask the merchant to cut into one for you to be sure that the
interior is stark white, with no graying or dark spots near the
skin. When buying true yams, taro or malanga, stick your fingernail
into one to be sure that it is juicy because dry specimens have an
unpleasant texture when cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Roots should be stored in a cool, dark place _ as close to the
atmosphere of a root cellar as you can get. With the exception of
true yams, none of them keep very well and should be used within a
few days of buying; boniatos, in particular, spoil quickly. Peeled
and covered with water spiked with lemon juice, all will keep in
the refrigerator for a day or two, and all freeze well after being
peeled and cut up.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it doesn't pay to get too worried about fine
distinctions among these roots and tubers. They are folk
ingredients, and their names are as malleable as the plot of a folk
tale. So don't hesitate too long in front of that vegetable bin _
go ahead and pick a few, take them home and cook them. After all,
it took centuries for Europeans to accept potatoes, and look what
they were missing.

   TRUE YAM HASH BROWNS WITH BACON AND SWEET-SOUR RED ONIONS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 slices bacon, diced
</P>
<P>
   2 red onions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   \ cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds true yams, deeply peeled and cut into pieces about the
size of an egg
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   { cup roughly chopped fresh parsley.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a medium saute pan, saute bacon pieces over medium-high
heat until just crisp, about 6 minutes. Remove, and set on paper
towel or brown paper bag to drain. Pour all but 2 tablespoons of
bacon fat out of the pan, add onion slices, and saute, stirring
occasionally, until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Add vinegar,
sugar and salt and pepper to taste, mix well, remove from heat, and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, place yams in a large pot of salted water, bring
to a boil over high heat, and cook until they are tender but not
mushy, 6 to 10 minutes; they should be easily pierced with a fork
but still offer considerable resistance. Drain, cut into uniform
bite-size pieces, and set on paper towels to dry.
</P>
<P>
   3. Heat the peanut oil over medium-high heat until it is hot but
not smoking. Add the dried yams, and cook until they are well
browned, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the pan with a slotted
spoon, set on paper towels briefly to drain, then place in a large
bowl. Add the reserved onions and bacon and the parsley, toss
lightly, and serve at once.

</P>
<P>
   \ cup lime juice (about 2 limes).
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut yuca crosswise into sections about 4 inches long. Make a
lengthwise slit down each section, slide a paring knife underneath
the brown skin and the pinkish underlayer, and lift them off,
leaving the bright white flesh. Slice each section in half
lengthwise and cut out the fibrous center cord, then cut into
medium dice.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place yuca in a large sauce pot with lightly salted water to
cover (about 1 gallon). Bring to a rapid boil over high heat,
reduce heat to low, and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until yuca
is easily pierced with a fork but still offers a bit of resistance.
</P>
<P>
   3. Drain well and place in a large bowl. Add stock and garlic,
and mash with potato masher until smooth. Season to taste with salt
and freshly cracked black pepper, drizzle with olive oil and lime
juice, and serve. Yield: 4 servings.

<P>
   2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl mix the sour cream and maple syrup
until mixture is of an even consistency.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove boniatos from oven, split down the center by using the
tines of a fork. Top the flesh of each with a generous spoonful of
the maple sour cream, sprinkle with scallions, and serve. Pass the
remaining maple sour cream separately.

`WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, STARLIGHT CAFE?': 65 CENTS, AND SOMETIMES
WORTH IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the days before fast-food chains, roadside dining was a
hit-or-miss affair. The inviting cafe just off the highway could be
the home of truly hellish cuisine. On the other hand, it could be
the White Rose Diner, a tiny white rectangle in Hannibal, Mo.,
whose dinner included a choice of smothered chicken and dumplings,
prime rib or T-bone steak, served with green beans, new potatoes in
cream, asparagus vinaigrette, a beverage and ice cream. When the
White Rose opened in 1938, the price for this spread was 65 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The diners and the roadside cafes are mostly gone, but Will
Anderson headed out to find them anyway. Clutching a stack of old
postcards, he traveled 14,000 miles of back road, determined to
ferret out the history behind the little mom-and-pop joints that
fed millions of Americans on the move. His findings, along with the
postcards, are on display in ``Where Have You Gone, Starlight
Cafe?'' (Anderson &AMP; Sons, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   The book, which Anderson published himself, is a little like the
subject: quirky, haphazard and highly personal. There is no
Starlight Cafe, for example. Anderson simply liked the sound of it.
</P>
<P>
   Title aside, the author researched local records to construct a
biography for each of the 40 cafes and diners in the book, but his
basic research technique was to roll into a town like Waycross,
Ga., look for old people and quiz them. Waycross was easy. Who
could forget the Green Frog, a drive-in that served frogs' legs?
Its motto was ``Service With a Hop.'' Not all the quotations are
electrifying. One interviewee, searching his memory for a bright
vignette, told Anderson that the Raleigh Grill in Elizabeth City,
N.C., had ``slow-turning fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson honors the humble and the grand. He finds space for
Earl's Sandwich Shop in Waterloo, Ill., a converted gas station
where the hamburgers cost a nickel in the 1930s and 40s, and the
Griddle Cafe in Plainview, Texas, a white stucco joint whose owners
baked their own rolls and fruit cobblers. His more grandiose finds
include the Dutch Mill Village in Glasgow, Ky., a restaurant in the
shape of a windmill that featured ``Kentucky Kuisine'' and a
half-dozen windmill-shaped motel cabins out back.
</P>
<P>
   The book has a certain poignancy. Most of the restaurants have
long since disappeared, done in by the Interstate highway system
and the rise of national chains. Anderson traces each story to the
bitter end, and in some cases includes photographs of the old spots
as they now appear. It's not a pretty sight, but Anderson, for all
his love of the old ways, seems to be a realist. ``Was the food any
better in the real McCoy?'' he writes. ``Maybe yes. Maybe no. Maybe
so.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   To the list of ingredients that have jumped from regional
specialties to international stars we can add piquillo peppers,
crimson beauties from the Navarre region of northeastern Spain. On
a plate, these horn-shaped peppers are visually stunning _ you
can't see them without wanting to eat them. On the palate, their
flavor is a near-perfect blend of sweet and hot, intense but not
fiery. And nature could not have designed a better shape for
stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   It should be no surprise that a food with so much going for it
is now grabbing the spotlight at such trendsetting restaurants as
Cafe Boulud, just as it has for years in restaurants featuring
traditional Spanish cuisine. Home cooks, too, are discovering how
adaptable the piquillo is to a variety of dishes, from frittatas to
a classic Basque dish in which it is simply sauteed with olive oil
and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that all this versatility comes in a can _
in fact, all piquillo peppers are sold in cans or bottles. Chefs do
not let that fact daunt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're the greatest canned product in history,'' said
Ken Johnson, the chef at the Terrace restaurant in Manhattan. ``I
just love them to death.'' Dan Silverman, the chef at Alison on
Dominick Street, said that any chef's aversion to using canned
foods disappears when it comes to piquillos, ``because they're more
flavorful than a regular sweet roasted pepper, even a fresh one.''
</P>
<P>
   The best piquillos are from the town of Lodosa, and will say so
on the label. There, they have been grown _ and coddled _ for
centuries. They are harvested by hand, roasted over wood and
hand-peeled; no water touches them, as this would wash away flavor.
They are then canned or bottled, with no other ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   This regal treatment makes top quality peppers expensive, about
$15 a pound. There are cheaper alternatives _ peppers that are
roasted over gas or that have citric acid added as a preservative.
There are also piquillo-style peppers from other parts of Spain;
these can cost up to $8 a pound. But even these are better than any
canned peppers (often called pimentos) you have ever tasted.
</P>
<P>
   Piquillos have become popular largely because they are the
perfect foil for full-flavored stuffings. Johnson, for example,
stuffs them with leg of lamb, green olives and pine nuts. Ignacio
Blanco, the chef and owner of Meson Galicia in Norwalk, Conn., who
has been stuffing piquillos in countless ways for more than a
decade, goes to Spain every year and finds that chefs there are
``always updating `tradition,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I feel free to stuff the peppers with anything that makes
sense,'' Blanco said.
</P>
<P>
   That may include rice bound with garlic mayonnaise and shrimp;
poached salmon with tomatoes and vinaigrette; salt cod, either
pureed or cut in chunks and mixed with boiled potatoes; spinach
with mushrooms or pine nuts and raisins; sweetbreads and mushrooms,
and oxtail, rabbit or duck confit with vegetables and vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these are served cold, some at room temperature and some
hot. Most have sauces on top but, as Blanco noted, ``The peppers
are so juicy that you can almost always do without a sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most impressive presentation of piquillos is one
that sometimes appears on the menu of Cafe Boulud: a pepper stuffed
with squid and topped with squid-ink sauce that is served alongside
a squid stuffed with piquillos and topped with a piquillo sauce.
Alex Lee, who was the restaurant's chef de cuisine and is moving to
the new Daniel, has used the peppers since a trip to the Basque
region seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them stuffed with salt cod,'' he said, ``but I also
like eating them out of the can, on some crusty bread rubbed with a
little olive oil, salt and garlic.''

<P>
   PIQUILLO PEPPERS STUFFED WITH BRANDADE
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Daniel Boulud
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours, plus 12 hours' soaking time
</P>
<P>
   { pound salt cod
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 head garlic
</P>
<P>
   { cup cream
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   { pound Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and cut into 1-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   12 piquillo peppers
</P>
<P>
   1 small red pepper, trimmed, seeded and finely sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 shallot, peeled and sliced. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Soak salt cod in cold water to cover for about 12 hours,
changing the water twice during this period. Divide peppercorns,
bay leaf and thyme into two batches, and wrap each in cheesecloth
to make sachets. Reserve one clove of garlic, then slice the head
in half crosswise.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pour cream into a small saucepan, and add half a head of
garlic. Bring to a boil, then turn heat to a minimum and infuse for
45 minutes. At the same time, pour \ cup of olive oil into a small
saucepan and add the other half head of garlic. Heat until garlic
starts to sizzle, reduce heat to very low and infuse for 45
minutes. Strain cream and oil separately, and keep them warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. When the garlic and the cream have infused for 30 minutes,
combine 2 cups of the milk, a herb sachet and the cod in a medium
saucepan. Bring to a boil, lower heat and cook until cod flakes
easily, about 15 minutes. While cod simmers, cook potatoes with
remaining milk and herb sachet. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 10
to 15 minutes, until potatoes are tender.
</P>
<P>
   4. Drain cod and potatoes, discard sachets, and transfer to a
food processor. With machine running, slowly add the infused oil,
followed by the cream. Pulse until smooth, then season with white
pepper to taste. Use a small spoon or piping bag to stuff 8 of the
peppers with this mixture. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate
until ready to serve. (You can prepare the dish several hours in
advance up to this point.)
</P>
<P>
   5. Cut remaining piquillos into thin strips; crush and peel the
reserved garlic clove. Warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium
skillet over moderate heat. Add the sliced piquillos, red pepper,
shallot and garlic to the pan, season with salt and pepper, and
saute for 2 or 3 minutes, stirring. Add 2 tablespoons water, cover
pan and lower heat. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until vegetables
are completely tender. Discard garlic, transfer the mixture to a
blender, and puree, then strain through a sieve and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   6. Preheat oven to 250 degrees. Warm 1 tablespoon of the olive
oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add stuffed peppers, and
transfer to the oven for 20 minutes. Ladle pepper puree onto 4
plates, and top with 2 peppers each; then serve.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 appetizer-size servings.

ILLNESSES ABOUND; ARE YOU COVERED?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In total horror, I watched and listened as the woman in the
dirty uniform hacked, wheezed and sneezed.
</P>
<P>
   She coughed in her hand and she coughed on her sleeve. She
sneezed and millions of invisible germs flew across the room like
an aerosol spray. I found myself unconsciously holding my breath as
I consciously debated my options. When she finally addressed me, I
probably looked as terrified as I felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I help you?'' she asked with a pleasant smile before
another fit of coughing caused her to double over behind the
register. ``Would you like one of our burger specials today?''
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, Louise, what's a girl to do?
</P>
<P>
   My lunch hour was over in another 30 minutes, and I only had
$3.37 in my purse. If I drove to the barbecue place down the
street, I wouldn't have enough time to eat, and besides, all I
could buy there with $3.37 was a bun and some sauce. Maybe they'd
throw in a slice of pickle, but meat was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   I saw other people preparing food but just in case, I tried to
order things that didn't require a lot of touching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have a large fry, a small fruit punch, and a small apple
pie,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   She took my money, coughed on it and put it in the register. I
felt really sorry for the poor lady because she was obviously quite
ill. Her face was flushed with fever, but the rest of her was
extremely pale. I wondered why the manager put her up front where
she would have direct contact with the customers. I guess it was
that position or somewhere in the back coughing all over the food.
One thing I didn't wonder was why she came to work or why the
manager didn't send her home. If you don't know why, then consider
yourself very fortunate. You've lived a charmed life.
</P>
<P>
   As she got my order, I kept my eyes trained on the counter and
tried to ignore that constant cough that sounded somewhere between
bronchitis and emphysema. Yeah, I should have left, but if I'd gone
through the drive-through down the street or the restaurant next
door, someone still could have coughed all over my food and I
wouldn't have even known about it. As it was, I figured that if I
got ill, at least I could come back and say, ``Hey, what disease
did you have? I think you gave it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, we're constantly exposed to the germs that cause colds
and many other common ailments. We only become ill when our immune
system is weakened by factors like stress, malnourishment or lack
of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Mom was on to something when she made you wear that hat to
school on chilly days. The hat keeps you from losing too much of
that important body heat through your scalp. So like your mother
always said: eat right, dress warmly, and cover your mouth when you
cough. It's going to be a long, cold winter, and giving up
hamburgers is out of the question.

   Under a new state law, they must be informed in writing where to
look in order to find out if a registered sex offender lives in the
neighborhood where they want to buy or rent.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement _ which takes some of the disclosure liability
away from home sellers and real estate agents _ is among several
state and federal changes that will affect residential property in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Handymen will catch a break under the changes. So will couch
potatoes who use small satellite dishes to pull in TV signals.
Renters get a $60 tax credit, and thousands of home buyers will get
a deal on lower mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is in for a happy '99, though. Drug dealers in Los
Angeles may find themselves getting the eviction heave-ho a lot
quicker.
</P>
<P>
   The latest contribution to the national Megan's Law mosaic is
SB1989, which becomes effective July 1. The law was named for
7-year-old Megan Kanka of New Jersey, who was raped and murdered in
1994 by a convicted sex offender. The man lived nearby, but neither
Megan's family nor neighbors knew of his criminal background.
</P>
<P>
   California and other states created databases that list the
names of registered sex offenders and the zip code in which they
live. It is available to the general public through local law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   SB1989 requires home sales contracts and rental agreements (for
one to four units) to include a notice that information on
registered sex offenders _ including a 900 number to access the
database _ is available. Then it's up to the home buyer or
prospective tenant to peruse the database.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once that notice is included, the seller or real estate agent
has no further obligation'' to provide additional information
unless he has ``personal knowledge that a registered sex offender
lives down the street or next door,'' said Alex Creel, chief
lobbyist for the California Association of Realtors, which
sponsored the legislation. California courts might consider such
personal knowledge a material fact that affects the value of the
home and warrants disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   California rental owners do not have the same strict material
fact disclosure requirement, but they cannot refuse housing to or
evict a person on the list of registered sex offenders. This rule
puts income property owners in a tough situation, said Terry
Feinberg, executive director of the Tri-County Apartment
Association in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you knew someone was on the list and that person then
subsequently molested a little girl who was also living on the
property and you had not taken action to protect that little girl,
then you've got a civil liability,'' Feinberg said. ``So it's a
real Catch-22 situation. I don't doubt that there won't be some
headline-type cases in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the law will cost you $25,000. Stay tuned on this one.

`PRIVATE CONFESSIONS': SCENES FROM A MARRIAGE, THIS TIME MOM AND
DAD'S
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(dal) 
 JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Private Confessions,'' an unfaithful wife hesitates beside
the telephone, wondering whether to call her lover. Were it not for
this scene's period clothing and antique instrument, there would be
little about the moment to anchor it in 1925, though that is when
most of this sensitively acted, extraordinarily pedigreed film
takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Written by Ingmar Bergman, directed by Liv Ullmann, shot by Sven
Nykvist and starring Pernilla August, who expands upon her
performance as Anna Bergman in ``The Best Intentions,'' ``Private
Confessions'' has a behavioral acuity that defies any particular
time period. Once again Bergman writes about his stern father and
privileged, restless mother as if they were his intimates rather
than his parents. Again he finds something universal in their
marital difficulties, which are envisioned here with pitiless
frankness and also, ultimately, with overwhelming compassion.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Ullmann, who faced the connubial crises of Bergman's
great, piercing ``Scenes From a Marriage'' with soul-baring
intensity, takes a similar tack in directing Ms. August here. All
that Ms. Ullmann knows about Bergmanesque candor is apparent on the
screen, in a film whose troubled heroine is seen as earthy and
forthright, her face laid bare at very close range, her duplicity
exposed even when the principal person whom Anna deceives is
herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private Confessions'' begins and ends with explicitly
religious references that suit Anna's search for absolution. The
story begins in a churchyard, where Anna approaches the fatherly
priest she calls Uncle Jacob (Max von Sydow, who did play Anna's
actual father in ``The Best Intentions''), in need of help. She
tells him about her unhappiness with Henrik (Samuel Froler, with a
reprise of that role from ``The Best Intentions'') and about her
affair with a married friend named Tomas (Thomas Hanzon). That all
the men in the story are theologians has not kept anyone out of
harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Anna's attempts to justify her situation only induce Jacob, in a
long and fine-tuned conversational episode, to ask: ``If everything
is so marvelous, why did you start crying?'' Anna has no easy
answer, beyond the fact that she is willing to lose everything,
even her children, for the sake of the affair. In a dialogue
fraught with Bergmanesque shadings (``I was made to taste the pain
waiting behind the joy''), Anna struggles with what she must have
known would be Jacob's response to her situation. Kind and paternal
as he is, Jacob exposes Anna's selfishness and counsels her to be
truthful, no matter how hard she resists that idea. As played by
von Sydow with towering moral authority and great reserves of
understanding, Jacob sends Anna off to confront the careful
illusions she has created.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. August's deliberately matronly, plain countenance tells its
own story, one of frustrated passion and wild longing for escape.
As she has her confrontation with Henrik in the film's next
sequence, set a few weeks later with the crisp chronology of a
play, her desperation comes to the fore. Though Ms. Ullmann makes
the spouses' conversation so Bergmanesque that at first Anna's
revelation prompts more gloom than fury, the sequence escalates
into the film's most searing argument, a fight that defines the
marriage even while tearing it apart. The bitter words heard here
could leave scars forever, if ``Private Confessions'' were not
fundamentally about how passions change over time.
</P>
<P>
   In its most revealing episode of all, the film flashes back to
an earlier mad tryst that crystallized Anna and Tomas' flirtation.
Ms. August, at her character's most emotionally exposed moments,
reveals all the self-deluding recklessness that created Anna's
predicament in the first place. Ms. Ullmann directs this sequence
so dutifully that sets and costumes are red for Anna's fieriest
moments, and Tomas not only avows his nervousness but also tugs at
his starched collar. But ``Private Confessions'' achieves an
enveloping intensity that goes well beyond its occasionally literal
and earnest approach.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, we join the aged Jacob in learning how Anna
remade herself in the aftermath of the film's other events. The
film's greatest wisdom lies here, in a sequence that transcendently
links Anna's adolescent purity of vision with her guarded,
compromised veneer in middle age. Von Sydow's performance, already
stirring, becomes even more haunting in the long scene that
wordlessly suggests the depth of his bond to Anna and the way he
knows so little and yet so much about her. Bergman's own vision and
Ms. Ullmann's empathy are nowhere more apparent in ``Private
Confessions'' than in the rich complexity of that bittersweet
redemption.

   BUSH _ TALLAHASSEE _ Jeb Bush was sworn in as Florida's 43rd
governor Tuesday and the Republicans officially retook the capital
for the first time since the Civil War. Flanked by his parents,
former president George Bush and first lady Barbara Bush, wife,
Columba, brother, George W., and family, Gov. Bush vowed to work
for the entire state, not just special interests. (Brian, Palm

<P>
   CYBER-BUSH _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On Tuesday, Jeb Bush is
being sworn in not only as Florida's 43rd governor but also as the
state's No. 1 e-mail addict. He likes the speed, precision and
technology of e-mail. Like many Floridians of his generation,
e-mail has become a part of his life and business. Symbolically, it
also suggests the generational change that has taken place in state
politics with the Dec. 12 death of Gov. Lawton Chiles and the
departure from public life of Gov. Buddy MacKay. (Crowley, Palm
Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   WEATHER _ DAYTON _ What's ahead? that depends on who you ask.
Forecasters are watching a front that could dump another heavy load
of snow in the Dayton area Friday or Saturday. We'll also likely
get more snow today (a 90 percent chance), though temperatures will
rise a bit to the mid-20s. Checking schools _ will they open? _ and
monitoring wrecks. (Hundley, Dayton Daily News)
</P>

   w/SALT _ DAYTON _ Why can't transportation departments find
something to put on snow and ice that doesn't damage your car and
harm the environment. The answer is, they can, but it might cost
you. A look at some of the alternatives to that winter staple known
as rock salt. (Beyerlein, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   COLD-WEATHER _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's more than
sweater-weather. It's time to break out the jackets. How many folks
went to the shelters last night, and will they be open tonight?
(Hayes, Palm Beach Post). 8.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA-COLD _ ATLANTA _The cold wave that is blasting Georgia
may last a couple of more days and could possibly produce some

priest connected to former Palm Beach Bishop J. Keith Symons _ who
resigned last year after admitting to sexually abusing several boys
_ have settled their suit against the Archdiocese of Miami,
according to court records and lawyers. The two were among five men
who have said Rocco D'Angelo sexually assaulted them in the 1960s,
when they were attending St. Mark's Catholic Church in Boynton
Beach, Fla. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post).

reform these days, and Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina have been
joined by South Carolina in having policies that reward or punish
schools based on performance. A look at accountability measures
being considered in Georgai as Gov.-elect Roy Barnes prepares to
take office. (Cumming, Atlanta Journal-Constituton). 45.

Tuesday to decide temporary rules for clemency hearings. The rules

brought by death row inmates who say the current system violates
open meetings laws in Texas. (Herman, Austin American-Statesman).

   ATL-CUBANS _ ATLANTA _ Cubans in Atlanta expressed a wide array
of reactions Tuesday to President Clinton's move to relax relations
with Cuba. ``Clinton wants to normalize relations because he is
almost a Communist,'' said Guillermo Merlo, a 73-year-old former
profressor. ``He keeps helping Castro. We don't agree with that.''
Other Cubans say they are torn: ``The people will definitely
benefit, but I hate to give Castro one cent,'' said real estate
broker Norma Santana. `` If I had to choose one side, I'd say, 'No,
I don't want them to lift the restrictions.''' Still others urge a
pragmatic approach: ``Everything that helps the Cuban public is
welcomed,'' said Ernesto Perez, a federal government engineer.
``When it comes to the humanitarian, politics doesn't exist. When
you have family in Cuba, we're all Cubans.'' (ABrice, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With all due respect to New York's great cooking
schools, they are, for the most part, worlds away from home
kitchens. They have space and equipment undreamed of in most
apartments, but they lack the warmth of home and hearth.
</P>
<P>
   A professional institution is fine for anyone heading off to
labor in some restaurant dungeon. But for the rest of us, there is
often a disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   Once _ and the tradition is nearly gone now _ we could learn the
secrets of home cooking alongside our mothers or fathers by helping
them chop, mix and stir. Domestic cooking was not a formal art. And
yet beautiful food often emerged from those informal settings.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, in loco parentis, there is a small band of people
who still offer latecomers a way into this domestic tradition by
teaching fine cooking in real, home kitchens. You don't hear much
about them these days, drowned out as they are by the din of the
big schools.
</P>
<P>
   Henri-Etienne Levy is one of those superb cooks and teachers who
work at home. He has been imparting the techniques of classical
French cooking for 20 years through classes he calls ``La Cuisine
Sans Peur'' (``Cooking Without Fear'').
</P>
<P>
   He gives demonstration classes to a maximum of four students in
the 16- by 9-foot kitchen of the Manhattan apartment he and his
wife share. He has almost no counter space; his porch-green
cupboards have not come from a catalog. Eighteenth-century plates
are lined up on the wall next to a modest butcher-block dining
table. Patterned curtains hide a few essential cookbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate high-tech kitchens,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, while Levy was showing a class the perfect way
to make a roast with marchand-de-vin sauce, his young tabby cat
jumped between his feet as he hurried onions over to the pan
warming on the stove. And in the midst of rolling out delicately
crunchy pate brisee to top an earthy snail-and-mushroom soup, he
fielded some fond teasing from his students. Then it was back to
serious food advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you use snails, you cannot go wrong by combining them
with mushrooms,'' he said. ``They have what is known as a taste of
the earth.'' As for the snails: ``Buy them in cans and don't
overcook them or they'll become tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy later took down a 1983 port to spritz the quartered figs
that, along with Italian gorgonzola dolce, would be the dessert _
and all the while he was swearing eloquently at people put
wrappings on bottles that must be furiously whittled away to get at
the cork. The meal that this lord of the home fires produced in the
midst of this bustle was sublime.
</P>
<P>
   The prices at these home cooking classes can be far above
courses at famous cooking schools like Peter Kump's, but the
experience is a different one _ far more intimate, with four
students at Levy's versus an average class of 12 at Kump's, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   The sad fact is that even as the country becomes ever more
food-savvy, there are fewer and fewer galley professors like Levy.
But the happy news is that the handful of home-based classes that
remain here are terrific, taught by devoted, first-rate cooks in
real New York homes. Despite the celebrity of some of the teachers,
they mostly remain a hidden part of the cooking-class scene, an
underground that can be discovered only by word of mouth or careful
research.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most established courses is taught by Karen Lee in
the galley kitchen of her modern high-rise apartment. In the early
1970s, she was a young divorced mother with five years of training
in classical Chinese cooking behind her. By dint of charm,
enthusiasm and entrepreneurial spirit, she began her teaching
career by talking to other mothers in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got the class for free in exchange for bringing four or
five friends together who paid,'' Ms. Lee recalls. Her classes for
up to 10 students have been attracting loyal followers since then:
some of them have been coming back for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   These repeat students are a hallmark of home cooking classes. At
Levy's Wednesday morning class, I recognized Lenore Kravitt, who
had been in one of his classes with me more than almost a decade
ago. As we got reacquainted, I learned that she had been taking
classes with Levy on and off for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   If these home classes inspire ardent devotion in students, why
aren't there more of them?
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes enormous preparation and concentration to do this
kind of teaching,'' said Julie Sahni, the cookbook author, who
conducts small intense, hands-on classes in Indian cooking at her
home in Brooklyn Heights.
</P>
<P>
   It also takes much more: The flexibility to have strangers
traipsing through one's home; assistants to shop and help with prep
work, and a large outlay for everything from food and wine to
knives and aprons for students. Even a teacher who charges $1,445
for a 27-hour course, as Ms. Sahni does, is not doing it solely for
the money. The career-sensible thing for a cook of this caliber
would be to focus only on the fame game _ concentrating on
promoting cookbooks, endorsing products, doing personal
appearances, maybe chasing after a slot on television. Though some
of these teachers do all these things, they persist in their home
cooking classes because they are devoted to passing along a
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to learn home cooking, there's no point to it
unless you're studying it in someone's kitchen,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun of studying with these teachers is getting to
peek into other people's kitchens. Yet even that faintly illicit
Manhattan pleasure turns out to have a serious benefit. Anyone
planning to break the bank on renovating a kitchen would do well to
take one of these classes. A dazzling culinary setting, you quickly
learn, is not a prerequisite for first-rate cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lee teaches morning and evening classes in a typical
closet-size Manhattan kitchen. ``People see my kitchen, and they
think, `If she can do it, I can do it,''' Ms. Lee said. (She is a
caterer as well as a teacher, and so she does have a six-burner
stove and an additional refrigerator in the living room.) But the
small space is actually a lesson in efficiency. Pointing at an
entire dining room wall of pegboard festooned with woks, pans and
utensils, several students murmured, ``I should do this.''
</P>

   Anna Teresa Callen holds her regional Italian cooking classes,
with hands-on instruction for up to six students, in a friend's
Greenwich Village apartment kitchen. Her own is too small. Of the
three home classes that I visited, this was the kitchen most likely
to make a Manhattanite go green with envy: it's almost suburban
size, with plenty of counter space and lovely cream-colored wood
cabinetry. But it's still clearly someone's home: no angled mirrors
here. And as Ms. Callen teaches, she gives advice on how to scale
your efforts to your own place.
</P>
<P>
   While all these chefs drill home the basics and the techniques,
they also answer questions that students in bustling cooking school
classes might never ask. What's the best way to wash sand from
arugula and other dark greens? Ms. Callen showed how: pour kosher
salt on them and cover them in lukewarm water: the grit will fall
to the bottom and you don't have to rinse over and over.
</P>
<P>
   What are some of Levy's favorite presentation techniques? Even
though he has plenty of tricks up his sleeve, Levy discourages his
students from emulating the dazzling architectural feats served in
trendy restaurants. ``I like the rough and tumble of a plate,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips can be picked up without even asking. Ms. Lee tapes
her recipes to the cupboard doors to keep them visible yet safe
from oil and flour. When I opened a jar of cumin in her kitchen, I
was overtaken by the difference in smell between her spices and
mine. ``Maybe you've put your spices next to the stove in one of
those fancy decorator racks,'' she said. ``That's the way to lose
flavor.'' I'm now storing mine the way she does, inbrown vitamin
bottles in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   I also noticed the way Ms. Lee slowly sweated the onions for an
Indian-inspired lentil soup, and only added the spices for it after
the onions were safely caramelized. She then encased that
intensified flavor in tomato puree before adding homemade vegetable
stock. The soup almost sang with flavor, despite its low fat
content.
</P>
<P>
   A student in this kind of class also learns just by watching the
informal, improvisational choreography of great home cooks at work
_ the way they clean up as they go, the little tricks they have
devised. After watching Ms. Lee prepare an entire complex meal
using a stainless-steel Chinese cleaver as her only knife, I bought
one myself. Now, I rarely use any other.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, you pick up the feel of how a great kitchen hums
with activity, all of it smooth. For Ms. Callen, the key to
everything is honoring fine ingredients by treating them well. This
concept takes on meaning when you watch her smelling the olive oil,
patting the succulent meats that will be simmered to make bollito
misto, then showing her students how to cut peppers for sauteeing.
Slicing them in half and deftly removing the pith, she bemoans the
way that ``Americans cut away too much of the pepper.''
</P>
<P>
   Home kitchen classes are also a great way to meet and network
with other home cooks. A few days after my class with Ms. Lee, a
student called to tell me about a pasta machine he had bought and
where I could find one for myself. Two of the students in Ms.
Callen's class made plans to get together to exchange their own
cooking secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe people in New York don't just want to go to
restaurants,'' said Vicki Majors, who was taking her first home
cooking class. ``I think many people want to cook in their own
apartments. But they don't know how.''

BREATHING LIFE INTO OLD BROADWAY SHOWS 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many performing arts, but they all ask the same
questions. To judge from recent trips to the theater, ``Swan Lake''
thrives while ``On the Town'' is doing less well. Critics and
audiences tend to love the first but can't make up their minds
about the second.
</P>
<P>
   I had to wait a few weeks to get into ``Swan Lake'' at the Neil
Simon Theater; at the performance of ``On the Town'' I saw, the
oversize Gershwin Theater was half full at best.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows (for I don't think Matthew Bourne's version of the
Tchaikovsky ballet minds being called a show) are about older
pieces brought back to life. Each has superior music and a history
of prior success. ``Swan Lake'' has made its way from the past
without noticeable injury; ``On the Town,'' on the other hand,
enters 1999 with effort.
</P>
<P>
   One knows that ``On the Town'' is in trouble from its first
moments. Energy becomes near-hysteria, as if frantic effort might
combat some as yet unseen negative force. Lea DeLaria rumbles
through the role of Hildy Esterhazy like a heavily armed Tiger
tank, but her charm soon withers under all that relentlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble may not be the new choreography, although replacing
Jerome Robbins's original has made some people angry. George C.
Wolfe's ambitious production has another weight on its back: the
year 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy of ``On the Town,'' with book and lyrics by Betty
Comden and Adolph Green, doesn't travel well. Its three sailors on
24-hour leave exude a collective naivete with which a hipper,
millennium-minded New York has little contact. The comedy routines,
the wartime ease of boy-meets-girl all have a quaintness that makes
them seem faraway and hard to reach.
</P>
<P>
   But if the gags die, Leonard Bernstein's sentimental ballads
(``Lucky to Be Me,'' ``Some Other Time'') survive, and his hard,
aggressive, metrically uneven instrumental music flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town,'' revisited, behaves like a Baroque-opera
revival: lavishly produced, authentically reconstructed,
stylistically true, musically relevant and theatrically embalmed.
The music transcends period and topicality, but the topics
themselves seem unrevivable.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Rameau's ``Dardanus,'' of 1744, still sounds terrific
but looks foolish to the less than scholarly, ``On the Town,''
which must have made perfect sense to audiences a half-century ago,
needs a social historian to mediate its message.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town'' is archeology posing as reincarnation. Wolfe
might have done what updaters like Peter Sellars do with opera, but
I am afraid he is stuck with a musical comedy of current events
long past. Its shtick is agreeable, but finding up-to-date
metaphors to replace it would be next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   That ``On the Town'' does much better in the second act than in
the first tells something about the success of ``Swan Lake.''
Bourne, with his whimsical adaptation of male swans and a modern
royal family, travels light. His looseness avoids explicit answers
to the implied questions of gay versus straight, ballet versus
theater, and fairy-tale kingdom versus the House of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between Tchaikovsky's classic original and this
alternately raucous and touching revision are left vague. Solid
beneath it all, however, is elemental storytelling: boy wants love;
boy meets swan; boy loses swan. That is something that was as
understandable 120 years ago as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through its evening, ``On the Town'' finally finds its
timeless story to tell: a lover's search and a boogie-woogie
Orpheus whose Hades is Coney Island. Act I is neither loose nor
narrative but a collection of comedic trivia that really doesn't
speak to our lives; Act II makes a nice stab at being universal.
</P>
<P>
   The cast seems to sense the problems handed it: thus the forced
exhilaration early on and the easier confidence later.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne's deviations from tradition have a powerful ally in
Tchaikovsky. If the music of ``Swan Lake'' is ubiquitous, inducing
the listener to swat it away into some half-attended background, it
blossoms anew with enforced listening. A splendid pit orchestra
(prepared by David Frame but at my performance conducted by
Constantine Kitsopoulis) made one sit up with a start at the beauty
of the music: its astonishing melodic inspiration and originality.
The waltzes lodge in the head and remain for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's music is striking but bogs down in its environment.
It is not helped by grotesque amplification, which makes sure that
one hears all the words, no matter how twisted and bloated the
musical wreckage left behind. ``Swan Lake'' is blessed with no
words at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the principal preservative keeping ``Swan Lake'' fresh is
simplicity, meaning simplicity in the profounder sense. The stories
it tells are basic to all lives and as applicable today as they
would have been several thousand years ago and certainly were in
1876, when Tchaikovsky's original first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Could this help explain why Homer still stands tall in the
modern imagination while Herodotus, with wonderful stories to tell
and fascinating facts to relate, is read mainly by the scholar or
the particular devotee? Herodotus wrote about specific victories
and defeats in strange places; Homer, about victory and defeat
itself. The first is about a time; the second is relatively
timeless.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is why operas with terrible librettos survive so
well. It is certainly only part of the reason, music, of course,
being the significant other. Although ``La Forza del Destino'' is
bad theater, ``Pace, pace, mio dio'' will never be passe.
</P>
<P>
   But Verdi also survives because he pushes primal buttons. Grand
opera like his devours history, discards ambiguity and leaves love,
hate, greed, jealousy and a story behind. Such simple ingredients
limit opera theatrically, but they are also a reason for its
hardiness.

WEDDING PHOTO IN THE ICING: HOW SWEET IT IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The cake that my sister and I bought for our
parents' 50th anniversary had a copy of their wedding day photo
reproduced right in the icing.
</P>
<P>
   They can do such things now, you know. Take any photograph, scan
it into a computer and, with a jet printer made in Kansas,
reproduce the image in food coloring on a white surface.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1948, when 18-year-old Patty Lee Cunningham and
22-year-old Morris Allen Salter got married on the day after
Christmas, there were no real computers or scanners, let alone
cakes with people's photos-in-icing on them.
</P>
<P>
   There were hardly any televisions either, no commercial jets, no
zip codes, Visa or MasterCards, no birth control pills, McDonald's,
Vietnam (or Korean) War vets, disposable cameras or one-hour
developing, no boom boxes, compact discs, interstate highway system
or self-service gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   My dad was running a Standard Oil station in Vincennes, Ind.,
when he and my mom got married. Not long out of the Army and World
War II, Daddy was accustomed to hard labor (he got his first job at
age 7), but the gas and oil biz was brutal. Radical though it was
for the time, he actually stayed open on Christmas Day 1948.
Customers bought him out of gas by midafternoon and darn-near
cleared his stock of tires.
</P>
<P>
   In the photo that we took to the baker for scanning, my mom and
dad jointly hold a silver cutter above their modest wedding cake.
If you look closely, you can see black grease around my dad's
fingernails. He tried, but it just wouldn't come off.
</P>
<P>
   I have trouble looking at Dad's hands in that photo. Everything
tough and backbreaking that my father ever endured is concentrated
for me in those pencil lines of black grease. As for my mother, her
hands are slim, white and graceful; they look like the hands of a
princess. In reality, they are the hands of a hard-scrabbling
teenager who began waiting tables in junior high school and would
spend the prime of her adult life working in a hot, noisy factory.
</P>
<P>
   The morning of her wedding, Mom was on her hands and knees
painting her parents' kitchen table so things would look a little
better for the reception. Unlike my dad, she managed to get all the
stains off by the time she put on her older sister's satin wedding
gown.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months and 16 days later, I came along, turning a teenage
bride into a teenage mom.
</P>
<P>
   This past Dec. 26, as Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra CDs
provided the musical background, our ``immediate family'' sat
around a table after dinner in a little Indiana inn and talked
about my parents' 50 years together: Mom, Dad, my sister and her
three kids, her husband and his two kids, an aunt and an uncle and
my 21-year-old niece's live-in beau.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, each of us raised a glass of Asti Spumante and paid
a verbal tribute to Morris and Patty. The men's speeches were
short, the women's mostly teary. At one point I asked my parents
what they had liked best about each other on their wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a hard worker and he had a good sense of humor,'' said
Mom. ``When you girls came along, he was a great daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   My 72-year-old father looked at his 68-year-old wife and blushed
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your mom was a looker,'' he said, with a touch of awe in his
voice. ``She still is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom grimaced and rolled her eyes and said, ``Yeah, right.''
</P>
<P>
   Because we asked them to, Mom and Dad gave my niece and her
boyfriend some advice about long-term relationships. Both of them
said it was hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communicate,'' said my mother. ``And if you can do it with
some humor, so much the better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Never go to bed mad,'' said my father. ``Don't carry an
argument over to the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, we didn't get around to cutting the cake. When I
got back to California, Mom told me that the chocolate part had
tasted pretty good, but the icing was too thick and sweet to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter,'' she said. ``We're going to save our faces
anyway and keep them in the freezer.''

   Romantic Films Trump Thrillers
</P>
<P>
   Which movie is a more valuable piece of programming for a
broadcast network, the first run of the recent action-packed
thriller ``Mission Impossible'' or the fourth run of the gooey
sudser ``The Bodyguard?''
</P>
<P>
   The pairing makes the answer obvious. Even though ABC paid
approximately 30 times more for the rights to ``Mission
Impossible,'' CBS proved last week that when it comes to appealing
to the television audience, romance has an impressive track record
in trumping action.
</P>
<P>
   In fact CBS proved it three times over. First, on Tuesday of
last week, ``The Bodyguard,'' scored an 11.1 rating, totally
dominating the night, which otherwise was filled with repeats of
series on other networks. It was the best Tuesday night for CBS in
almost four years and brought in hordes of younger female viewers,
which CBS is rarely able to attract.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sunday, CBS broadcast the first run of another romantic
comedy, ``Sabrina,'' and soared to a 14 rating, the third highest
rated show of the week. And on Monday night, in a slick bit of
counter-programming, CBS used a third run of yet another romance,
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' against ABC's college football title game
and had its biggest Monday night of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ABC spent about $30 million to acquire ``Mission Impossible,''
then played it on a Thursday in November when it drew a paltry 6.6
rating. (Each rating point represents 994,000 homes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bodyguard'' results even look good when compared against
what Fox achieved with ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' which
played twice in November, first drawing a 12.4 rating, then only a
6.3 rating. Fox paid $80 million for that return, or about 80 times
CBS's price on ``The Bodyguard.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS paid so little because ``The Bodyguard'' had already played
three times on ABC, the last time in February of 1997. It was
thrown in with a larger package of movies that CBS purchased from
the film's studio, Warner Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The message seems to be that romantic movies can play over and
over again, while much bigger-budgeted caper or action films tend
to wear out their welcome.
</P>
<P>
   But scheduling is crucial. The films have to be spaced out over
a rather long period so that they are a fond memory for fans who
have seen them several times already. They also work best when used
against programming not likely to draw many women, like Monday
night's football game, or Sunday night's lineup of shows on Fox,
``The Simpsons,'' ``That '70s Show'' and ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ABC thought it had the right scheduling idea when it
put ``Mission Impossible'' against NBC's mainly female-appeal
comedies on a Thursday night in November. But many men were more
interested that night in seeing ``Shocking Moments Caught on Tape''
on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   CBS used deft timing in bringing back ``Sleepless in Seattle''
when ``You've Got Mail,'' with the same two stars, Tom Hanks and
Meg Ryan, is showing at theaters.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's success with three romantic films in the same week makes a
deal the network is reported to have just concluded more
understandable. Though CBS did not confirm it, Variety reported
this week that CBS had purchased the rights to ``You've Got Mail''
after the Turner Entertainment cable networks play it.
</P>
<P>
   Against another male-oriented choice, perhaps the women will
come flooding back to see Tom and Meg.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   More Prime-Time News
</P>
<P>
   Pushed into the shadows by the dazzle of ABC News' announcement
Monday that Diane Sawyer and Charlie Gibson would be co-anchors of
``Good Morning America'' was a companion announcement, that ABC is
giving yet another hour of prime time to a news program.
</P>
<P>
   Tentatively called ``ABC News Thursday Night,'' the program will
take over the 10-to-11-p.m. time slot on Thursdays for most of the
rest of this season, following ``Cupid,'' a comedy moving from
Saturday to Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The new program's format remained a bit unclear Tuesday, but ABC
News spokesmen said it would feature hourlong special reports from
ABC News correspondents _ a report on terrorism kicks off the
series Jan. 14 _ on some nights, and shorter, magazine-style pieces
on others, including repackaged or updated versions of earlier
reports. Shelley Lewis, who was replaced as executive producer of
``Good Morning America'' in Monday's shake-up, will be the
executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   By February, ABC will have prime-time news programs on five
nights out of seven _ ``20/20'' appears Wednesdays, Fridays and
Sundays, and, starting Feb. 1, on Mondays as well, with Connie
Chung and Gibson as co-anchors.
</P>
<P>
   That ties ABC with NBC for prime-time hours of news; NBC has
five nights a week of ``Dateline.'' Meanwhile CBS is adding ``60
Minutes II,'' also starting next week, at 9 p.m. Wednesdays, for a
total of three hours, and Fox has one, ``Fox Files.'' So the
broadcast networks, starting in February, will have 14 hours of
prime-time news a week.

<P>
   An Analytical Channel
</P>
<P>
   There may be plenty of news on the air, but much of it lacks
substance and analysis, in the opinion of the Freedom Forum, a
nonpartisan foundation focused on media studies, and WETA, the
public-television station serving the Washington area. The two have
joined to start a cable channel devoted to analyzing and
interpreting news _ a sort of round-the-clock ``News Hour with Jim
Lehrer.'' It will also carry other public affairs programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Turner, one of the original executives at CNN when it started
in 1980, and most recently a fellow at the Freedom Forum, was named
president of the new channel, to be called the Forum Network. A
spring start on Washington-area cable systems is planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN started with a slogan of `on-the-air breaking news,' and
my new slogan is `breaking analysis,''' Turner said Tuesday. ``We
don't have enough dissent in this country, and I want to give an
outlet to people who have an informed point of view.''

A LOOK AT WHAT JUNIPER BERRIES AND GINGER CAN DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the fifth of eight columns by Alfred Portale, the
executive chef and an owner of Gotham Bar and Grill in Manhattan.
His collaborator on these columns is Dorie Greenspan.)  
 (HLW)  
 By ALFRED PORTALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is the third incarnation of a dish that started
very simply and changed serendipitously. I had a pheasant that I
was going to marinate and reached for juniper berries, knowing that
juniper and game are a classic combination. And I had it in mind to
do something classic, when, crushing the juniper berries, their
powerfully fresh, bright fragrance forced me to take a detour. I
headed straight for the ginger root, with its similarly crisp,
clean fragrance.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not usually given to these kinds of leaps. I like to know
there's a precedent to back me up when I start inventing dishes,
but the aromatic match was so strong I went with it, adding onions
and garlic to the marinade. The juniper and ginger turned what
might have been an ordinary dish into something vibrant. I had
never had a game dish like this one. It was almost refreshing,
hardly the word I would choose to describe traditional game dishes,
which are often heavily sauced, abundantly herbed and paired with
chestnuts, mushrooms or brussels sprouts. The result was a
revelation, and I couldn't resist trying the combination on other
birds.
</P>
<P>
   I used the same marinade, cooking technique (pan searing
followed by oven roasting) and sauce (white wine and chicken stock
flavored with the marinade's aromatic ingredients) with turkey to
equally good effect. Finally I tried it on chicken. Because chicken
is so mild, the bright flavors of the marinade and sauce
ingredients are even more vivid.
</P>
<P>
   Originally I served the pheasant with braised red cabbage, and
I've found that it is just as fine with the chicken. The cabbage is
cooked with red wine and equal parts wine vinegar and honey until
it is meltingly tender and has blended with its flavorings. The
cabbage, a brilliant magenta, looks and tastes good with the
chicken but is even better when you add pureed potatoes.
</P>

   MARINATED CHICKEN WITH BRAISED RED CABBAGE

   Time: 2 hours, plus 1 day to marinate the chicken

   24 cloves of garlic (about 2 heads), peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces fresh peeled ginger (a piece about 3 inches long)

</P>
<P>
   2{ cups roughly chopped onions, plus 1 thinly sliced onion

<P>
   3 chickens (each about 3{ pounds), split in half, backbones
removed
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   \ pound smoked bacon, cut into 4 pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons caraway seeds
</P>
<P>
   1 large head red cabbage, cored and cut into slices \ inch thick
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   { cup red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   { cup honey
</P>
<P>
   } cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1. Thinly slice 19 cloves of garlic and three-quarters of the
ginger. Crush 5 tablespoons juniper berries with a mortar and
pestle. In a very large mixing bowl, combine sliced garlic, sliced
ginger, crushed juniper berries and chopped onions. Season chicken
with salt and pepper to taste, place in bowl and rub with mixture.
Cover, and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. When ready to serve, prepare the cabbage. In an 8-quart pot
over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon canola oil and add bacon. Saute
until well browned, about 6 minutes. Remove and discard bacon. Add
sliced onion, and saute until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add
caraway seeds, and saute 2 minutes more. Stir in cabbage, red wine,
vinegar and honey. Season to taste. Cover, and reduce heat to
medium-low. Cook 40 minutes, stirring occasionally. Uncover, and
continue to cook until liquid has reduced to a light glaze, about
30 minutes. Remove from heat, and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, prepare chicken. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
Remove chickens from refrigerator, and allow to rest at room
temperature for 15 minutes. Wipe off marinade, and season with
coarse salt to taste. In a large skillet over high heat, heat 2
tablespoons canola oil until almost smoking. Place 2 or 3 chicken
halves in skillet, skin side down, and sear until skin is browned,
about 4 minutes. Turn, and brown other side, 4 minutes more.
Transfer to shallow roasting pan, and repeat with remaining
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   4. Finely chop remaining garlic and ginger. Grind remaining
juniper berries in a spice grinder, or pulverize with a mortar and
pestle. In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, heat remaining 2
tablespoons oil and add garlic, ginger and juniper berries. Saute
until softened but not colored, 8 to 10 minutes. Add white wine,
increase heat to medium-high and cook until wine evaporates. Add
stock, and increase heat to bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low,
and skim any impurities off surface. Simmer until stock is reduced
by half, 15 to 20 minutes; then remove from heat, cover and keep
warm. While stock is simmering, finish chicken.
</P>
<P>
   5. Roast chicken 20 minutes, turn pieces and continue roasting
until juices run clear when meat is pierced near bone, about 10
minutes. Remove from oven, cover and keep warm. Strain sauce,
discarding solids. Swirl in butter and season to taste.
</P>
<P>
   6. Place a chicken half on each of six plates. Spoon sauce over.
Place a serving of cabbage alongside, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

GROCERY SHOPPING IN ELECTRONIC AISLES

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of doing the week's marketing at a computer screen used
to be the stuff of science fiction. But the number of American
households shopping for food on the Internet may reach almost seven
million by 2002, a projection of eMarketer, which tracks business
on-line.
</P>
<P>
   While specialty foods are becoming a presence on the World Wide
Web, most of those households will be buying groceries from a few
sites like www.peapod.com. Peapod, whose services have been
available in the Chicago area (where it is based), on the West
Coast, in Texas and in Boston, has opened a distribution center,
its first, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. Until now, Peapod has teamed up
with supermarkets, where uniformed Peapod workers pick the goods
from the shelves, check them out and pack them for delivery by
white temperature-controlled vans with Peapod logos.
</P>
<P>
   The new center eliminates the market in the middle. But because
Peapod sells perishable goods like dairy products and meat, the New
York operation so far serves customers only in western Nassau
County and eastern Queens. There are three purchasing plans,
combining delivery charges and monthly fees.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod's Net shoppers are largely dual-income suburban couples
pressed for time, said Mary Kiscaden, a spokeswoman. Some of them
order for elderly parents. What they ordered most between
Thanksgiving and New Year's was the humble banana. Using Peapod's
software, shoppers can buy, for instance, eight bananas, four ripe
and four green. Among other products, it sells 83 choices of
spaghetti sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Another national site is www.netgrocer.com, with headquarters in
New Brunswick, N.J., which sells only big-brand dry goods and ships
by Federal Express. It offers coupons online. Click, instead of
clip, and they're subtracted at checkout. Netgrocer has now
branched out into electronic goods, books and CD's.
</P>
<P>
   A local service for New York and southern Connecticut,
www.yourgrocer.com, will deliver perishables (minimum orders, $50).
</P>
<P>
   Two services available only in New England are www.shoplink.com
and www &QL; 
.streamline.com. Shoplink, like Peapod, has software to download.
It offers more than groceries: dry cleaning, shoe repair and video
rental. Streamline provides much hand-holding for new customers and
will set up a special refrigerator in the garage for deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers for specialty foods have a new discriminatingly stocked
site, based in Seattle: www.chefshop.com. It sells products that
chefs use, like Frontera salsas, Torrefazione Italia coffee,
Rustichella d'Abruzzo pasta and Scharffen Berger chocolate. Many of
these are handmade by small producers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rustichella pasta, for instance, which Chez Panisse in
Berkeley, Calif., and Union Square Cafe in New York both serve, is
made with Italian stone-ground wheat and cut with antique bronze
dies. It is rough textured, which keeps sauces from slipping off
the surface. The pasta is sold in a sampler of spaghetti,
fettuccine, penne rigate and orecchiette (little ears), a total of
3 pounds 11 ounces (3.5 kilos), for $19.95, as well as in a
collection of 15 bags, adding fusilli col buco, twice as long as
spaghetti and hollow inside, for $75.95.
</P>
<P>
   An older specialty foods site that operates in partnership with
the Culinary Institute of America, www.digitalchef.com, boasts that
it offers ``the best selection of gourmet food and cookware
available anywhere _ on line or off.'' But most of its fare can be
found in good grocery stores. The chefs' gadgets it sells include
the excellent Bron mandoline for cutting and slicing vegetables
($150), but also run-of-the-mill tools like a $16 cheese cutter and
a $12 pizza cutter.
</P>
<P>
   `Almond Paste' to `Zester'
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference between fusilli and rotini? If you don't
know, you just might need www.flavorweb.com. This site aims to
inform its users about food and drink in plain and fancy forms, in
hopes of sending them by links to commercial sites. But you don't
have to click on those links, and if you do, you don't have to buy
anything.
</P>
<P>
   For a start, click on food, wine, beer, spirits et al., then on
Glossary of Cooking Terms. There are entries as elementary as
``baste'' and ``fry,'' but also useful discussions of, for example,
confit, ham and Pavlova, the national dessert of Australia and New
Zealand (a meringue bedecked with whipped cream and fruit). The
entry for creme fraiche is a recipe. Under ``casein'' (the milk
protein and foundation for cheese) or ``rennin'' (the coagulating
enzyme used in cheese making), click on Cheese for a primer by
types of cheese and a few words on eggs. All the way through, there
are links to recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The site devotes pages to fruits, nuts, vegetables, herbs and
spices, beef, fish, dessert wines, sparkling wines and brandy. And
it has a recipe index and also a weights and measures link to
convert Centigrade to Fahrenheit and grams to ounces.
</P>
<P>
   For the ins and outs of penne and orecchiette, click on ``pasta
shapes'' (that link is deep within the Glossary, under
``farfalline''). As for Fusilli and rotini, they are both names for
corkscrew-shape pastas.
</P>
<P>
   A World of Coffee
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who likes to sip coffee while surfing the Net will want
to know &QL; 
about www.shoppingplace.com/coffee/links1.html. It is a list of
links, an electronic skeleton key to 200 sites that sell coffees,
among them Hawaiian Kona and Jamaican Blue Mountain. Click on any
name to turn the key. Hawaiian Express, for instance, offers five
varieties of Kona at per-pound prices, shipping included, from $24
to $31 (for small-bean Kona Peaberry), as well as Maui, Kauai,
Molokai and organic Hawaiian coffees. They're all available as
whole beans or ground. The Jamaica Blue Mountain Coffee site sells
one-pound burlap bags: roasted whole beans, $25.90; roasted ground,
$23.80; green beans, $17.50. Shipping is extra.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10)  
 (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many performing arts, but they all ask the same
questions. To judge from recent trips to the theater, ``Swan Lake''
thrives while ``On the Town'' is doing less well. Critics and
audiences tend to love the first but can't make up their minds
about the second.
</P>
<P>
   I had to wait a few weeks to get into ``Swan Lake'' at the Neil
Simon Theater; at the performance of ``On the Town'' I saw, the
oversize Gershwin Theater was half full at best.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows (for I don't think Matthew Bourne's version of the
Tchaikovsky ballet minds being called a show) are about older
pieces brought back to life. Each has superior music and a history
of prior success. ``Swan Lake'' has made its way from the past
without noticeable injury; ``On the Town,'' on the other hand,
enters 1999 with effort.
</P>
<P>
   One knows that ``On the Town'' is in trouble from its first
moments. Energy becomes near-hysteria, as if frantic effort might
combat some as yet unseen negative force. Lea DeLaria rumbles
through the role of Hildy Esterhazy like a heavily armed Tiger
tank, but her charm soon withers under all that relentlessness.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble may not be the new choreography, although replacing
Jerome Robbins's original has made some people angry. George C.
Wolfe's ambitious production has another weight on its back: the
year 1944.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy of ``On the Town,'' with book and lyrics by Betty
Comden and Adolph Green, doesn't travel well. Its three sailors on
24-hour leave exude a collective naivete with which a hipper,
millennium-minded New York has little contact. The comedy routines,
the wartime ease of boy-meets-girl all have a quaintness that makes
them seem faraway and hard to reach.
</P>
<P>
   But if the gags die, Leonard Bernstein's sentimental ballads
(``Lucky to Be Me,'' ``Some Other Time'') survive, and his hard,
aggressive, metrically uneven instrumental music flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town,'' revisited, behaves like a Baroque-opera
revival: lavishly produced, authentically reconstructed,
stylistically true, musically relevant and theatrically embalmed.
The music transcends period and topicality, but the topics
themselves seem unrevivable.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Rameau's ``Dardanus,'' of 1744, still sounds terrific
but looks foolish to the less than scholarly, ``On the Town,''
which must have made perfect sense to audiences a half-century ago,
needs a social historian to mediate its message.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town'' is archeology posing as reincarnation. Wolfe
might have done what updaters like Peter Sellars do with opera, but
I am afraid he is stuck with a musical comedy of current events
long past. Its shtick is agreeable, but finding up-to-date
metaphors to replace it would be next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   That ``On the Town'' does much better in the second act than in
the first tells something about the success of ``Swan Lake.''
Bourne, with his whimsical adaptation of male swans and a modern
royal family, travels light. His looseness avoids explicit answers
to the implied questions of gay versus straight, ballet versus
theater, and fairy-tale kingdom versus the House of Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between Tchaikovsky's classic original and this
alternately raucous and touching revision are left vague. Solid
beneath it all, however, is elemental storytelling: boy wants love;
boy meets swan; boy loses swan. That is something that was as
understandable 120 years ago as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through its evening, ``On the Town'' finally finds its
timeless story to tell: a lover's search and a boogie-woogie
Orpheus whose Hades is Coney Island. Act I is neither loose nor
narrative but a collection of comedic trivia that really doesn't
speak to our lives; Act II makes a nice stab at being universal.
</P>
<P>
   The cast seems to sense the problems handed it: thus the forced
exhilaration early on and the easier confidence later.
</P>
<P>
   Bourne's deviations from tradition have a powerful ally in
Tchaikovsky. If the music of ``Swan Lake'' is ubiquitous, inducing
the listener to swat it away into some half-attended background, it
blossoms anew with enforced listening. A splendid pit orchestra
(prepared by David Frame but at my performance conducted by
Constantine Kitsopoulis) made one sit up with a start at the beauty
of the music: its astonishing melodic inspiration and originality.
The waltzes lodge in the head and remain for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein's music is striking but bogs down in its environment.
It is not helped by grotesque amplification, which makes sure that
one hears all the words, no matter how twisted and bloated the
musical wreckage left behind. ``Swan Lake'' is blessed with no
words at all.
</P>
<P>
   But the principal preservative keeping ``Swan Lake'' fresh is
simplicity, meaning simplicity in the profounder sense. The stories
it tells are basic to all lives and as applicable today as they
would have been several thousand years ago and certainly were in
1876, when Tchaikovsky's original first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Could this help explain why Homer still stands tall in the
modern imagination while Herodotus, with wonderful stories to tell
and fascinating facts to relate, is read mainly by the scholar or
the particular devotee? Herodotus wrote about specific victories
and defeats in strange places; Homer, about victory and defeat
itself. The first is about a time; the second is relatively
timeless.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is why operas with terrible librettos survive so
well. It is certainly only part of the reason, music, of course,
being the significant other. Although ``La Forza del Destino'' is
bad theater, ``Pace, pace, mio dio'' will never be passe.
</P>
<P>
   But Verdi also survives because he pushes primal buttons. Grand
opera like his devours history, discards ambiguity and leaves love,
hate, greed, jealousy and a story behind. Such simple ingredients
limit opera theatrically, but they are also a reason for its
hardiness.

`THE RODGERS &AMP; HART STORY': THOROUGH TV BIOGRAPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One was tall, handsome, self-confident and aloof, the other
pint-size (barely 5 feet tall), witty, lovable, and consumed with
self-loathing for his physical shortcomings. They were the composer
Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Lorenz Hart, partners in one of
the greatest songwriting collaborations of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rodgers &AMP; Hart Story: Thou Swell, Thou Witty,'' which is
being broadcast Wednesday onight as a ``Great Performances''
special, is about as thorough a television biography as one could
hope to find about a collaboration that ended in 1943, when Hart
died of complications from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, whose life had shadowy aspects that no biographer has yet
fully explored, was only 48. He been in an alcohol-driven downward
spiral for years. By then, Rodgers had already embarked on his
second major collaboration, with Oscar Hammerstein II, one that
carried the Broadway musical out of its adolescence and to
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rodgers and Hammerstein shows, from ``Oklahoma!''
through ``The Sound of Music,'' are so indelibly stamped our
cultural landscape, the Rodgers and Hart partnership is often
thought of as a warm-up act for the main event. But as ``Thou
Swell'' demonstrates, Hart wrote as many enduring standards as
Hammerstein, among them ``Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,''
``Blue Moon,'' ``It's Easy to Remember,'' ``Manhattan,'' ``My Funny
Valentine,'' ``My Romance'' and ``Where or When.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart's lighter lyrics flaunted a playfully urbane wit. Lines
like ``I'll go to hell for ya./ Or Philadelphia,'' from the team's
first published song, ``Any Old Place With You,'' in 1919, found
Hart's talent for wordplay already full-blown. Many of Hart's
ballad lyrics conveyed a heart-stopping sadness that reflected his
conviction that he was physically too unattractive to be lovable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thou Swell, Thou Witty,'' narrated by Jonathan Pryce, is an
artfully constructed melange of interviews with family members and
friends, vintage film clips, home movies and contemporary
performances of Rodgers and Hart songs done in a period style with
the original orchestrations played by Rob Fisher and the Coffee
Club Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In the program's most euphoric moment, Rebecca Luker, Christine
Ebersole and Debbie Gravitte swivel through the delectably
lubricious ``Sing for Your Supper,'' from the 1938 show ``The Boys
from Syracuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luker also leads a five-member chorus in a fizzy version of
``Falling in Love With Love,'' from the same show. Ms. Ebersole
brings an insouciant tang to ``The Lady Is a Tramp,'' from the
hit-filled 1937 show ``Babes in Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The most poignant performance is Mary Cleere Haran's pensive
version of the still obscure ``This Funny World.'' An expression of
rueful wisdom (``This funny world makes fun of the things that you
strive for/ This funny world can laugh at the dreams you're alive
for''), the song seems to sum up Hart's lifelong self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Albert remembers being taught to dance for the ``Slaughter
on 10th Avenue'' ballet in ``On Your Toes.'' Larry Adler recalls
Hart's fear that his mother would discover his homosexuality.
Rodgers' daughter, Mary, recalls her father's diffidence and biting
sarcasm. And June Havoc remembers Gene Kelly as Joey Evans in ``Pal
Joey,'' the 1940 show that made him an overnight star.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the material in ``Thou Swell,'' especially shadowy
home movies of original Broadway production numbers, seems to have
been included simply because it exists. The home movies are too
crude be very enlightening. If the contemporary versions of Rodgers
and Hart standards, filmed with period costumes and elegant
semi-abstract sets, capture some of the buoyancy of Rodgers and
Hart production numbers, the performances have a stiff,
self-consciously posed quality that undercuts the effervescence of
the music.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The streets of New York weren't the only crowded
place this Christmas season. Driven by swarms of tourists, Broadway
theaters and many of the city's museums posted record numbers last
week.
</P>
<P>
   On Broadway, box offices tallied more than $17.2 million in
sales last week, smashing the previous high of $15.7 million, set
exactly a year ago. Attendance numbers were also at near-record
levels as more than 287,000 people flooded into Broadway theaters
to take in a show.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, Broadway was sold out last week,''
said Jed Bernstein, the executive director of the League of
American Theaters and Producers. ``It was a great week for actors
because you're playing to full houses. And for producers, it ain't
bad either.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, weekly box office records were set for at least four
major Broadway musicals, including the critically lambasted
``Footloose'' and three long-running shows: ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera'' and ``Les Miserables.''
</P>
<P>
   The city's other cultural institutions were also brimming with
visitors. Most museums reported record attendance for the week
after Christmas. Increased tourism contributed to the boom in both
theaters and museums, with an estimated 34 million tourists
visiting last year, an increase of 3 percent over 1997, according
to the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau. At museums, an
eclectic exhibition schedule was also a factor.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of Modern Art, the Jackson Pollock retrospective
has been attracting crowds of 9,000 to 10,000 people a day. The
museum estimates that during the two-week holiday period _ from
Dec. 18 through Jan. 3 _ about 101,000 people visited the museum, a
15 percent increase from 87,000 who attended last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This season has been particularly strong due to the popularity
of the Pollock show and strong tourism,'' said Elizabeth Addison,
the Modern's deputy director for marketing and communications. The
museum has been working to attract tourists with package deals that
include features like transportation and wine tastings.
</P>
<P>
   At the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, even Sunday's driving rains
didn't keep crowds away. Guards told visitors to keep their coats
on because the coat checks were full.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's current exhibition, ``Rendezvous: Masterpieces From
the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Guggenheim Museums,'' attracted
an international crowd, and the Guggenheim officials reported that
attendance for the week from Dec. 26 through Jan. 1 increased 26
percent, to 32,305 from 25,656 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 154,000 people streamed
through the doors during the two-week holiday season. ``This season
people came to see everything from Renaissance armor and baseball
cards to our famous Christmas tree,'' said Harold Holzer, the Met's
vice president for communications.
</P>
<P>
   Children certainly helped bolster the numbers. At the Museum of
Natural History, live butterflies and Haitian vodou art and
altarpieces, which were on view during the Christmas season, led to
outside lines and record attendance. The museum experienced a 16
percent increase from Dec. 19 through Jan. 3 with 176,920 visitors,
compared with 149,444 for the period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't walk through the halls of the museum without
hearing two or three different languages,'' said Mary-Lou
Edmondson, director of media relations at the natural history
museum.
</P>
<P>
   At the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Saturday, when the museum was
open till 11 p.m., the place was hopping with people who had come
to listen to music, see movies and view the art. Officials there
said that while attendance during the Christmas holidays wasn't
what it was last year, when the museum had a blockbuster Monet
exhibition, the number of visitors this season was running higher
than normal.
</P>
<P>
   In Times Square on Saturday, well-bundled crowds were standing
three deep at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS Booth, where
salespeople were doing a brisk business in half-price tickets for
even the mustiest of shows. Here, in fact, total sales were down 15
percent from last year, a development that Broadway seers perceive
as a positive sign that more tickets were being sold in advance for
full price during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   Some producers were scrambling to wring as much money from the
season as possible by scheduling extra performances. Downtown, at
the Orpheum on Second Avenue, ``Stomp'' sold out all 10
performances scheduled last week, up from the usual 8. The cast was
so busy it ate a Christmas turkey dinner onstage between shows.
</P>
<P>
   And anticipating a New Year's Eve feeding frenzy, many producers
also increased prices, as planned, with $150 tickets selling at
``Chicago,'' the hit musical; $125 charged for another hit,
``Cabaret,'' and $100 for shows like ``Titanic'' and ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel.'' The weekend crowds were so thick that two shows,
``Electra'' and ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ran out of Playbills
</P>
<P>
   The holiday crush offered solace for several struggling shows,
including the Joseph Papp Public Theater's revival of ``On the
Town,'' which topped $500,000 in sales for the first time in more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not everybody was enjoying the holidays. At the Whitney
Museum of American Art, attendance was actually down this Christmas
season. And on Broadway, some producers said the week's take could
have been even bigger had the weather not turned ugly Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were way up early in the week; the weekend was softer than
we hoped,'' said Bernard Gersten, the executive director of Lincoln
Center Theater, where the new musical ``Parade'' did good but not
record business.
</P>
<P>
   ``People kept saying `Icy, icy, icy,' on the television, and
people panicked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The year-end numbers put Broadway on pace to break several more
records by the time the theater season officially ends in June.
According to the league, attendance is up by nearly 5 percent thus
far, with a dozen new productions expected in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the windfall, Broadway veterans said the record might be
quickly forgotten in coming days of winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a once-a-year festival,'' said Alexander H. Cohen,
the longtime producer. ``The next two weeks I would call a
famine.''

WOMEN DOMINATE GRAMMY NOMINATIONS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It will be a battle between divas young and old at
the 41st annual Grammy Awards, judging from the contenders
announced here on Tuesday by the National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences. Lauryn Hill received the most nominations, 10,
followed by Celine Dion, Madonna, Sheryl Crow, Brandy and Shania
Twain.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, every singer competing in the album of the year
category is a woman, and in the record of the year category (an
award given to a single), every nomination but one (``Iris'' by the
Goo Goo Dolls) went to a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill, a member of the rap trio the Fugees who released her
first solo record last year in addition to producing an album by
Aretha Franklin, led the way. Her ``Miseducation of Lauryn Hill''
will be competing for album of the year with ``Ray of Light'' by
Madonna, ``Come On Over'' by Shania Twain, ``The Globe Sessions''
by Sheryl Crow and ``Version 2.0'' by Garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Iris,'' the other contenders for record of the year
are ``You're Still the One'' by Ms. Twain, ``Ray of Light'' by
Madonna, ``My Heart Will Go On'' by Ms. Dion and ``The Boy Is
Mine'' by Brandy and Monica.
</P>
<P>
   The dominance of women in this year's nominations is a far cry
from those of past years, particularly 1994, when the academy said
that no suitable female entries could be found in the rock vocal
performance category. Overall, Ms. Twain and Ms. Crow each earned
six nominations, Madonna got five, and Brandy and Ms. Dion four.
Ms. Dion was expected to fare better, considering that the
soundtrack to ``Titanic,'' on which she is featured, and her own
album, ``Let's Talk About Love,'' were the year's best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The men who earned the most nominations were selected mainly for
their role on albums by women: Ms. Twain's producer, co-writer and
husband, Mutt Lange, and her engineer, Jeff Balding, both received
five nominations. Madonna's co-producer, William Orbit, and her
engineer, Pat McCarty, received four, as did Tchad Blake, who was
engineer on Sheryl Crow's album.
</P>
<P>
   In the best new artist category, Ms. Hill is up against a
diverse bunch: Natalie Imbruglia, the Dixie Chicks, Andrea Bocelli
and the Backstreet Boys. The nominees for best pop instrumental
performance are equally diverse, ranging from Kenny G to the Brian
Setzer Orchestra to the Dust Brothers to Bela Fleck and the
Flecktones to Pat Metheny. Tony Bennett is competing with Elmo of
Sesame Street in the best musical album for children category,
which pits Bennett's ``Playground'' against ``Elmopalooza!''
</P>
<P>
   In the classical categories, the usual suspects _ the conductors
Pierre Boulez (with Bartok's ``Bluebeard's Castle'') and Sir Georg
Solti (with works by Bartok, Kodaly and Weiner) who in death
continues to be a Grammy favorite _ will be among those competing
for best album.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy Awards are to be held on Feb. 24 at the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles, and broadcast on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   This move back to Los Angeles after two years in New York was
announced last year at a news conference in Manhattan unveiling
nominations for the 40th annual awards ceremony. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani accused Michael Greene, the head of the National Academy,
of verbally abusing a mayoral aide and declared that the Grammys
could go back to Los Angeles for all he cared.

   &UR; RELIGION FOR DINNER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a forest, there was a hunter who was suddenly
confronted with a huge, mean bear.
</P>
<P>
   In all his fears, his attempt to shoot the bear was
unsuccessful. He turned away and started to run as fast as he
could. Finally, he ended up at the edge of a very steep cliff.
</P>
<P>
   His hopes were dim. But, he got on his knees, opened his arms
and said, `My God! Please give this bear some religion!`
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was a lightning in the air and the bear stopped just
a feet short of the hunter. The bear was puzzled and looked up in
the air and said, `My God! Thank you for the food I am about to
receive... `

   Mr. Clinton played lots of golf over the New Year's holiday.
However, some of his best lies in 1998 weren't on the links but,
rather, on tape.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year, politicians say, in which Washington must save
Social Security. So, where to begin? How about with an impeachment
trial?
</P>
<P>
   If there's a Senate trial, Mr. Clinton's State of the Union
speech may be delayed past Jan. 19. What will it be called, the
Late of the Union address?
</P>
<P>
   There's some talk that Mr. Clinton could just present his State
of the Union address to Congress in writing. If he does that, it
will help to insert helpful words such as (applause), (laughter)
and (just kidding).
</P>
<P>
   Many observers are speculating about how Senate Republicans will
handle the impeachment matter. If you ask us, it's time for
Lottership.
</P>
<P>
   One plan calls for a two- or three-day Senate impeachment trial
and then adoption of a censure resolution. And then several months
of criticism from all sources.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton wants to add $12 billion to next year's defense
budget. What's he want to buy? Small missiles to aim at the special
prosecutor's office?

   Much of Europe has switched to a single currency, the euro. The
man at the next desk says the name almost rhymes with his own
currency, the you're-broke.

   The world financial markets seem to like the euro as an
alternative to the dollar. Would it help to replace George
Washington's picture with, say, Monica Lewinsky's?

FOOD STUFF: STILL-MOIST DRIED FRUIT ARRIVES FROM FRANCE

 FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new crop of dried fruits from France has arrived.
Vergers d'Alienor's richly succulent apricots, peaches and pears
are actually partly dried, so that they're moist and kissed with
fresh flavor and texture. They are sweetened, but without the
sticky, cloying intensity of the usual French or Australian glace
fruits. They are great for snacking or for baking and cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The company also makes plump semidried figs, which have a
slightly bitter taste and are not so satisfying. The fruits come in

   Chocolate Lover's Handbook
</P>
<P>
   It can't compare to a box of chocolates, but a new book gives
the whole lowdown on what the Aztecs called the food of the gods.
And though there are no ``scratch and sniff'' pages, ``All About
Chocolate'' by Carole Bloom (Macmillan, $17.95) does its job well.
</P>
<P>
   This workaday paperback includes a glossary of chocolate terms,
products and dishes; a chronology of chocolate history; a
description of how cocoa beans are harvested and turned into candy,
and advice on what to look for when tasting chocolate. There is
also some chocolate lore, along with sources for ingredients and
equipment, events, clubs and courses. And there are recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bloom, a food writer who is also a spokeswoman for a
chocolate trade group, gives reliable ratings to retail and
mail-order chocolatiers around the world. And to show she has left
no truffle unturned, there is also a list of movies and videos that
put the accent on chocolate. A Cake Fit for Three Kings
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday is Epiphany, the Feast of the Three Kings, and to
celebrate it, many Europeans serve a festive cake. In France, the
galette des rois, or kings' cake, can vary from province to
province.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a new Provencal bakery, Pan Bagnat, 54 W. 55th St.,
makes the galette des rois in two ways: the Provencal style, which
is like a buttery brioche studded with candied fruit, and the
Parisian kind, made of flaky puff pastry and almond cream. Both are
being sold at half-price Wednesday, $6 for a 6-inch cake and $8 for
an 8-incher. They will be available at regular prices Thursday
through Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The bakery is owned by Philippe Lajaunie and Jose de Meirelles,
who also own the restaurants Les Halles and Le Marais. It has good
croissants ($1.40 each), rich and crumbly butter cookies ($21 a
pound), a fine apple tart ($15 and $26) and some very good salads,
including a mustardy potato salad ($2.95 and $5.50, depending on
the portion). A simple sandwich of rillettes (a spreadable pate)
with cornichons ($5.95) was also excellent.
</P>
<P>
   But a pan bagnat made to order was a pale version of the French
classic. A counterman made a tunafish salad sandwich with
hard-boiled eggs, onion slices, inferior tomatoes and a baguette.
No olive oil drenched the bread, and the olives were the tasteless
black kind from California. Another time, a ready-made pan bagnat
was an improvement, on a proper round roll, well moistened with oil
and vinegar adding flavor to the olives, which were chopped, as
they should be. Oddly, there did not seem to be a nicoise olive in
sight in this store, not even in the salade nicoise.

CLINTON OUTLINES $215 MILLION DRUG INITIATIVE TO TEST PRISONERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton proposed Tuesday a steep increase
in money to enforce ``zero tolerance'' of drug use by prisoners and
parolees.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by his drug czar and attorney general, Clinton outlined
a $215 million program to help states and counties drug test, treat
and punish prisoners and parolees. The effort builds upon an
existing program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's announcement coincided with release of a Justice
Department study showing the majority of prisoners report prior
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted in 1997, found 83 percent of state
prisoners and 73 percent of federal prisoners reported past drug
abuse. Nearly 20 percent of state inmates and 15 percent of federal
prisoners reported their convictions stemmed from offenses to get
money for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear to us that if we're going to continue to reduce
the rate of crime, we have to do something to avoid releasing
criminals with their dangerous drug habits intact,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president called his budget plan ``a dramatic leap forward''
in the fight against drug use. He said it would be the biggest
effort to date to test and treat not only prisoners but parolees
and probationers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To inmates in every state, we want to send a message: If you
stay on drugs, you must stay behind bars. To probationers and
parolees, we want to send a message: If you want to keep your
freedom, you have to keep free of drugs,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the $215 million would ensure that states
fully implement their plans to drug-test prisoners and parolees.
The initiative also would help support efforts by states such as
Maryland and Connecticut, which regularly test inmates on
probation.
</P>
<P>
   The president's fiscal 2000 budget also will include a separate
$50 million, a 25 percent increase over this year, to expand the
number of local drug courts and $65 million for residential drug
treatment programs in state prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced release of $120 million under the fiscal
1999 budget for drug-free prison initiatives _ $63 million
earmarked for state prisons to provide long-term treatment and
intensive supervision for prisoners with the most serious drug
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno noted the number of federal inmates
tested for drug use last year was 133,000. And, since 1993, the
number of federal prisoners receiving treatment has increased from
5,450 to 21,995.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most effective things we can do is to make sure
that prisoners don't get out of jail unless they regularly test
clean for drugs and that when they get out, they continue to get
appropriate testing and treatment,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the lieutenant governor of Maryland,
said 50 percent of all drug use is by people under the supervision
of the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about the revolving door of criminal justice, it
is clearly the drug-addicted offenders who are turning the
wheels,'' she said.

 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Kyle Fawcett was eating a bowl of Trix and
talking a mile a minute about dinosaurs. His mother, Nina, was
worried. Her son had just been kicked out of a day-care center for
misbehaving and she wasn't sure what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no idea how his actions affect other people,'' said
Fawcett, who lives in Latham, near Albany. ``He just doesn't get
it.'' She's talking about those subtle social interactions that are
often taken for granted, like picking up on the way someone feels,
or being able to relate comfortably with peers.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, 7, has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a
condition characterized by odd, eccentric and sometimes
unpredictable behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers consider it a form of high-functioning autism
that affects an estimated 20 to 25 people out every 10,000 in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those with Asperger's can speak and are often of above average
intelligence. Their problem is social: They often don't understand
jokes or how to interact with people. Sometimes, they are
disruptive. In children, the behavior may be interpreted as acting
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to be loners,'' said Dr. June Groden, a psychologist
and director of the Groden Center in Providence, R.I. ``They tend
to be people who are isolated from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine having a Ph.D. in mathematics but not understanding how
to cross the street or how to make chitchat with office colleagues.
Imagine being ultrasensitive to lights, noises or even the feel of
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kyle, who is fascinated with dinosaurs, many people with
Asperger's have an obsessive interest in one topic.
</P>
<P>
   Groden works with adults and children with these problems.
Unable to deal with the world around them, they withdraw or behave
inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments vary, but can include drugs like Ritalin, Prozac and
most often, intensive behavior modification therapy to teach coping
strategies and social skills.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure and no known cause, although some researchers
believe there may be a genetic link.
</P>
<P>
   New research, however, shows that music therapy may be
especially helpful to children with autism, including Asperger's.
Jeanne Lyons, a Georgia parent, was recently featured on NBC's
``Dateline'' after recording a CD specifically designed to help
teach social skills to autistic children. Her son, Shawn, now 9,
was diagnosed with Asperger's at age 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some autistic children apparently have an easier time processing
tones, rather than spoken words.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of parents find that if they sing directions to
children, it makes it a little easier,'' Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett, a divorced mother, knew something was wrong with her
son when he was a toddler and couldn't pay attention. ``It took me
three months to get him to say `please.''' Her son was initially
diagnosed with attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity.
Fawcett wasn't convinced she'd found the answer, especially as his
behavior became more erratic.
</P>
<P>
   Like others with Asperger's, Kyle pulls objects close to his
eyes to look at them and his voice has a sing-song cadence. He'll
often ignore questions, like ``How are you?'' and is unable to
express his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't understand teasing,'' said Fawcett, an office
administrator for an Albany firm. ``He can't pick up on a smile. He
looks like he's misbehaving but he just can't help it.'' Over the
summer, a school psychologist suspected Asperger's. A physician has
since confirmed it.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett is relieved she's found an answer to help her explain
her son's difficulties. He attends school in North Colonie, where
he receives special education. Fawcett hopes more day-care workers
and parents will understand Asperger's. ``My main thrust is to get
people educated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle, sitting in the living room, continued to rattle off
dinosaur names: apatasaurus, allosaurus, dilophosaurus, before
pausing for a question: ``Have you ever read a modern dinosaur
book?'' Fawcett was thinking about dinner, bedtime and finding a
new day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son wants to be social. He wants to have friends,'' she
said. ``He's bright enough to know what's missing.''

it and turn in shows that are the equal of (and sometimes far
better than) those they're preceding. Pop music critic Dave Ferman

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games. Bowl games count as one and a half times a regular
season game.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is not a very large
difference between Tennessee (no. 1) and Ohio State (2), but the
difference between Georgia Tech (7) and Arizona (8) is much
smaller.

   WASHINGTON _ As the U.S. Senate prepared for a historic
impeachment trial, a group of Democratic lawmakers shifted their
attention Tuesday to a different crisis _ falling livestock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the situation turns around soon, we are facing a total
collapse of the U.S. pork industry,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa,
adding that the drop in hog and cattle prices could force tens of
thousands of farm and ranch families out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.,
co-chaired a forum that included testimony from hog farmers, cattle
ranchers and representatives of several farm organizations. The
senators said the event symbolized a commitment to put livestock
issues at the top of the agenda as the new Congress convenes this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Those in attendance packed a hearing room on Capitol Hill and
heard sometimes compelling testimony.

   ``I am here today with a heavy heart,'' said Herman Schumacher,
a livestock farmer and auctioneer from South Dakota. ``In my
business of agriculture, we are suffering. We, who are the very
people who create the basic wealth that feeds and drives the
economy, are being literally cheated out of our homes, farms,
ranches and our livelihoods.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was a reaction to recent dramatic drops in livestock
prices. Hog farmers have taken the biggest hit as hog prices
dropped last week as low as $7 per hundredweight in some parts of
the country. Cattle prices, which reached around $80 per
hundredweight at the first of the year, have hovered in the $60-$70
range in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher and others said many problems in the pork industry
stem from increasingly larger farms and large producers having too
much control on all aspects of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty of the largest producers own nearly 2.1 million sows,
which can produce more than 40 percent of annual U.S. pork sales,
said Richard Roth, a veterinarian and swine industry consultant
from North Dakota. Many of these large producers are owned by or
aligned with packers while others are owned by large feed
companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This smacks of monopoly and restraint of trade,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin also had questions about who is profiting from the
collapse in pork prices.
</P>
<P>
   Holding a package of pork chops that he purchased at a grocery
store for $4.29 a pound, Harkin said some farmers sold pigs for
about 8 cents a pound last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will someone please tell me what's going on here? Someone's
making a killing, folks, and it's not the farmer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has taken several steps in recent
weeks to help pork farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The government has agreed to buy $65 million worth of more pork,
bringing government pork purchases since March to $95 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman agreed as well
to defer some loan repayments for hog farmers and formed a task
force to look at ways to help pork producers.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman also announced a temporary freeze on Agriculture
Department lending for new pork production plants to prevent
exacerbating the industry's problem.
</P>
<P>
   At the forum, Daschle said he will push for legislation in the
new Congress to level the playing field for small producers by
requiring mandatory price reporting, meat labeling, and better
enforcement of laws prohibiting anti-competitive practices.

`CABARET' HAS MOST OF THE OLD FACES BUT THE SHOW IS SOMETHING NEW  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10)
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you couldn't get in to see ``Cabaret'' last year
when it was on West 43rd Street, the chances are you'll have better
luck now. The hit revival has moved to larger quarters 11 blocks
north at Studio 54, the former disco that in the heedless 1980s
exemplified Manhattan chic and decadence. A fitting space, maybe,
for a show that is set in Berlin, circa 1929-30, just before the
Weimar Republic collapsed, and that ostentatiously flaunts gaudy
style to find deadly significance in ephemera.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this ``Cabaret'' is not exactly the same production that
opened in March at Henry Miller's Theater, which was renamed the
Kit Kat Klub for the loud, sweaty Berlin nightclub that is the
show's principal locale. Changes have been made.
</P>
<P>
   As the replacement for the spectacular Natasha Richardson,
Jennifer Jason Leigh is making her Broadway debut in the pivotal
role of Sally Bowles, one of contemporary literature's most
appealing lost ladies. Sally is the gallant and foolish young
Englishwoman on the loose in Berlin, who fights hangovers with
prairie oysters and boredom by sleeping with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Blair Brown has succeeded Mary Louise Wilson
as Fraulein Schneider, the owner of the Berlin rooming house that
Sally passes through on her way to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   The other important roles continue to be played by the actors
who opened with the show: Alan Cumming, who is so dazzling as the
M.C., and John Benjamin Hickey, possibly the production's backbone,
as Clifford Bradshaw, the American writer through whose sensibility
the events are seen.
</P>
<P>
   Only two cast changes, but ``Cabaret'' is now very different. It
is less focused in one important way and also more vivid in some of
its subsidiary concerns, even though the essential ingredients
remain intact: the fine Fred Ebb-John Kander score and the book by
Joe Masteroff, as well as the theme-park concept of the production,
which was directed by Sam Mendes with Rob Marshall, the co-director
and choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, Jennifer Jason Leigh has won a number of
awards and a fairly formidable critical reputation for her
performances in such films as ``Miami Blues,'' ``Last Exit to
Brooklyn,'' ``Georgia'' and even the pricelessly awful ``Mrs.
Parker and the Vicious Circle,'' in which she appeared as Dorothy
Parker. She has made her name playing waifs of all degrees of
intelligence and neuroticism. It is easy to see why she might seem
a natural to play Sally Bowles, the character originally conceived
by Christopher Isherwood in his ``Berlin Stories,'' which, with
John Van Druten's stage adaptation, ``I Am a Camera,'' provided the
source material for ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh's performance as Sally comes close to being fascinating,
though mostly for what it reveals about the differences between
acting in movies and in the theater. Among other things, she
doesn't yet know how to fill a stage. She is physically tiny, but
her size has nothing to do with it. She is technically correct in
everything she does. Her English accent is good. She can sing with
a small, true voice that is easily amplified. She moves with vigor.
</P>
<P>
   What is missing is any kind of stage presence, the idiosyncratic
spirit that gives singular dimension to the technical proficiency
by which all performers communicate. Though Leigh sings, there is
no character in the song. The lines she speaks are funny, but they
emerge without humor. As Sally spirals toward her doom, she should
be a figure of folly and innocence. Instead, she seems older than
Mother Courage and as invulnerable as an armored tank.
</P>
<P>
   Like many accomplished film actors, Leigh uses gestures so small
that, on the stage, she almost appears to be passive. She is acting
up a storm, but the effects are lost before they reach the
audience. Her work needs to be punctuated by pore-tight close-ups
and by cutaways for reaction shots. Seen in the one continuing long
shot, which is the way of the stage, the performance is dim, fuzzy,
like something viewed through a cataract.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Bowles doesn't exactly disappear in this production. She
is too important to the narrative for that to happen. Also, she
gets to sing several of the best Kander and Ebb songs: ``Don't Tell
Mama,'' ``Perfectly Marvelous'' and the great title number. Now,
however, Sally is a supporting character.
</P>
<P>
   Fraulein Schneider, the landlady, has always been a supporting
character in ``Cabaret,'' but in Blair Brown's beautifully simple,
direct and rich performance, she becomes memorable. There was
nothing wrong with the way Mary Louise Wilson played the role
earlier in the run. Yet Brown discovers shades of feeling that are
entirely new to this production.
</P>
<P>
   As a sort of professional hausfrau, complacent and bourgeois to
the bone, Fraulein Schneider is stricken with fear when she has to
choose between security (pleasing the Nazis) and her planned
marriage to Herr Schultz (Ron Rifkin), her adoring greengrocer who
is also a Jew. The astonishing thing about Brown's performance is
not that she can sing, which she does well, but that Fraulein
Schneider remains so human while being the kind of so-called ``good
German'' who unashamedly looks the other way. Even Rifkin's
performance, as moving and severely controlled as it was when the
revival opened, seems to be enriched by Brown's presence.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish-born Alan Cumming continues to be terrific as the
Kit Kat Klub's leering, breezily satanic M.C., a role that has
always been at the center of the show without being quite inside
it. He introduces the numbers, interacts with the characters,
sometimes setting the scene, always behaving as if he were a
rascally tour guide. The M.C. never says it, but you can read his
rouged lips: this way to the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Not having to share the stage with a bewitching Sally Bowles,
Cumming becomes the de facto star of ``Cabaret.'' His performance
hasn't changed, only the circumstances in which it is seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret'' is just the latest reminder of how hit shows
continue to evolve, not always in productive ways, in the course of
long runs. All shows are vulnerable. Different performers can
unintentionally shift emphases and meanings without changing a line
of dialogue or any stage business.
</P>
<P>
   Have you gone back to see ``Chicago'' at the Shubert Theater?
Ann Reinking, who played Roxie Hart, and Bebe Neuwirth, as Velma,
co-starred as equals in talent and pizazz when the show opened.
After Reinking left, Neuwirth suddenly became the show's undisputed
star. Marilu Henner, the new Roxie, wasn't bad, but she wasn't in
Neuwirth's league as a big-time, audience-astonishing performer.
``Chicago'' then played like a Model A Ford driving through the
night with a single headlight. There was nothing seriously wrong
with it, but it seemed to have aged.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently when I saw it, both Neuwirth and Henner had
departed, leaving the all-American Karen Ziemba to play Roxie, and
Ute Lemper, the German-born, European cabaret star, in the role of
Velma. ``Chicago'' hasn't been altered in any official way, but it
is now something far different from the show that was reviewed so
enthusiastically in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being a satirical consideration of two small-time,
tabloid-hungry husband-killers competing for the public eye from
the Cook County jail at the height of the Roaring Twenties,
``Chicago'' has become a contest between two different kinds of
theater. Ziemba is a warm performer, straightforward and
uncomplicated in the home-grown Broadway manner. Lemper is cool and
sophisticated, the epitome of a certain kind of European cabaret
stylist: she comments on the role as much as she plays it.
``Chicago'' isn't terrible. The book is still amusing and the
Kander and Ebb score full of wit and disarming melody. Though if I
were an out-of-towner who remembered the original reviews, I think
I would be totally baffled.
</P>
<P>
   One important aspect of the ``Cabaret'' revival has not been
lost in its recent move from Henry Miller's Theater: When you walk
into Studio 54, you don't walk into a disco or a conventional
theater. You enter a mock-up of the Kit Kat Klub, where even the
fellow directing traffic in the lobby can be suitably surly.
</P>
<P>
   If you pay for orchestra seats, you sit on hard wooden chairs at
tiny cafe tables and order drinks from attendants. The show itself
is the show on the stage of this faux Kit Kat Klub. Supposedly we
are there, as we are when we visit the storybook castle at Disney
World. All of which spells bliss for many members of the audience,
even those whose imaginations haven't been shriveled by too many
visits to theme restaurants. The bright side: this sort of nonsense
apparently helps to sell tickets.
</P>

<P>
   `The Shaughraun'
</P>
<P>
   You have until Jan. 30 to see one of the more charming Off
Broadway productions of the season: the Irish Repertory Theater's
exuberant revival of ``The Shaughraun'' (meaning vagabond). This is
the 1874 comic melodrama by Dion Boucicault, whose elegant Regency
comedy ``London Assurance'' (1841), written when he was 21, was
done by the Roundabout Theater Company in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly forgotten today, Boucicault was a legend in his own time
for his prodigious output (some 200 plays), his scandalous private
life, his acting triumphs and his successful lobbying on behalf of
copyright laws. Though his popularity in Britain and America was
ridiculed by some, Shaw, Wilde and O'Casey, among others,
acknowledged him as a master of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   The convoluted plot of ``The Shaughraun,'' set in its own day,
isn't easily synopsized, being a tumultuous mix of romance, land-
grabbing intrigue, Irish patriotism, one death and resurrection and
the triumph of good.
</P>
<P>
   The title character is a blithe, unreliable young man who drinks
too much, but who always manages to come up trumps. He is meant to
be irresistibly debonaire. In this production, however, he is
nowhere near as much fun as Captain Molineux, a proper English
officer (exceptionally well played by Daniel Gerroll) who falls in
love with a local lass, behaves nobly and remains staunchly
supercilious throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The large cast, efficiently directed by Charlotte Moore on the
company's small stage, mixes American and Irish-born actors to
create a veritable symphony of accents. The performances may be
uneven, but the spirits are high.
</P>
<P>
   `Bosoms and Neglect'
</P>
<P>
   Sunday is the final performance of ``Bosoms and Neglect''
(1979), John Guare's absurdist comedy being presented by the
Signature Theater Company as the second play in its Guare season.
The play and the production (directed by Nicholas Martin) are big
improvements over the initial offering: ``Marco Polo Sings a Solo''
(1973), another absurdist work that has not aged well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosoms and Neglect'' is far less fanciful, being a broadly
comic take on three emotionally disadvantaged adults: a mother
dying of breast cancer she refuses to recognize, her 40-something
son who would like her to commit suicide so as to be rid of her,
and the young woman he first notices in his psychiatrist's waiting
room. Their bond: they are literary name-droppers, though they have
learned nothing from the volumes those names have written.
</P>
<P>
   The two-act play is often amusing and, in Mary Louise Wilson's
performance as the old lady, it is viciously articulate. David
Aaron Baker and Katie Finneran are also worth attending to. In the
Guare career, it's a way station between the playwright's first
major work, ``The House of Blue Leaves'' (1971), and his last hit,
``Six Degrees of Separation'' (1990).
</P>
<P>
   Next up at the Signature: a new play _ ``Lake Hollywood.''
Enough looking back. Let's peer into the future.

PLAYING SANTA: A WONDERFUL AND HEARTBREAKING EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANNY ANDREWS  
 c.1999 Plainview Daily Herald  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLAINVIEW, Texas _ Playing Santa Claus is the most wonderful
experience of my year.
</P>
<P>
   It also can break your heart.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of school before the Christmas break, I was
asked to play Ol' Saint Nick at my grade school alma mater -
Hillcrest Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, attired in a wonderful Santa suit the school
purchased, I walked from class to class, handing out candy canes.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I sat on the cafeteria stage and - one by one - each
student came up after lunch to be greeted by Santa and receive some
candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Santa what you want for Christmas,'' I coaxed one third
grade girl, expecting her to repeat a familiar line: ``I want a
Barbie'' or ``I want a Nintendo 64'' or ``I want a bicycle'' or, as
a couple of bright-eyed girls had chirped, ``I want two thousand
bucks!'' What this one little girl requested caught me completely
off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to put my family back together,'' the child said
sincerely and with sad eyes.
</P>
<P>
   I bit my lip under the big fuzzy set of white whiskers and
blinked back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter, honey, are Mother and Daddy separated?''
``No, it's all of us. We fight all the time,'' she said
sorrowfully.
</P>
<P>
   I hugged her close and said, ``We'll see what we can do'' and
added that Santa was proud of her because she cared so much about
her family.
</P>
<P>
   I knew this request was out of Santa's league and whispered a
prayer to God to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, a good-looking boy (I'll call him Jimmy)
swaggered toward me and when I asked what he wanted, he said
insistently, ``Aw, there's no such thing as Santa Claus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes there is,'' I replied emphatically. ``You need to believe
in Santa Claus!'' ``I bet you $5 he won't bring me a bicycle,''
Jimmy retorted.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing kids his age are beginning to have their doubts - even
if someone hasn't already taken away this beautiful childhood
fantasy - I was pretty sure this kid wasn't just lobbying for a
bike. His tone belied the fact that he had sized up his
circumstances and felt there was about as much chance of getting a
bike as Frosty the Snowman rising and flying with the reindeer.
</P>
<P>
   After the Santa session, I checked with several folks in the
office and learned that Jimmy, several siblings and two cousins
lived with their grandmother in pretty meager financial
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   My Sunday school class already had come up with about $250 to
help needy youngsters but we had no specific project - until that
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   When I told the group about this ``Doubting Thomas'' youngster,
two brothers came up, individually, after class and said, ``I want
to help get that bicycle.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long time since I've had a lump that big in my
throat.
</P>
<P>
   Let me pause here for a ``side story'': As a friend and I
shopped for clothing and a toy for each of the five kids later in
the week, a young man ahead of us in line said, ``I'm ready for
Christmas to be over. My son's attitude is 'kill the fat man and
roast the reindeer.' My friend and I were both taken aback. My
friend suggested the man take his son to a nursing home and let him
visit some folks and that might make him more thankful for what he
has.
</P>
<P>
   I told him I had something in the car I'd like to give him and
as we walked through the parking lot, he told me he was a trucker
from Ohio on his way to Central Texas to be with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Handing him a ``Jesus'' video about the life of Christ, I
encouraged him to watch it with his boy over the holidays. ``Maybe
it'll help both of you.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked me straight in the eye and said sincerely, ``God bless
you, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, another friend, my daughter Kayla and I loaded
up the presents and a big box of groceries and headed for our
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Among the loot was a cute, slightly-used girls' bike requested
by a first grader in the family; we couldn't find a new one
anywhere in town in our price range but some other folks in our
church gave it to us without charge.

   Dense fog will reduce visibility to 1/4 of a mile or less in the
Central Valley of California on Wednesday morning from the town of
Red Bluff southward. The fog will lift into a deck of status clouds
by early afternoon, allowing visibility to improve to 1 mile or
more in most areas. However, the fog will again redevelop Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, broken areas of generally light snow will accompany a
fast-moving, moisture-starved disturbance from the eastern Great
Lakes early Wednesday to the central and northern Appalachians
later Wednesday and Wednesday night. A few enclaves of moderate
snow are possible, mainly on high ground near the eastern Great
Lakes, where the system will glean moisture from open waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the ``Alberta clipper,'' Arctic air knifing
southeastward over Lake Superior and Lake Michigan will be
moistened in transit, setting the stage for narrow bands of snow to
form downwind of southern and eastern shores. Winds from the
northwest will average 20 to 30 mph with higher gusts, causing
blowing and drifting snow.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, pockets of fluffy snow will develop over the high
northern Plains and east-facing slopes of the northern Rockies as
cold winds from the east are forced to ascend the sloping terrain.
Meanwhile, moist high-altitude winds from the Pacific will engender
snow on west-facing slopes in Idaho, Montana and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Spotty, generally light showers will develop over east Texas and
parts of Louisiana as milder, moister air from the Gulf of Mexico
starts to return northward.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: State Record
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures fell precipitously across snow-covered central
Illinois on Monday night, reaching a nadir of minus 36 degrees at
the town of Congerville around dawn Monday. The reading set a new
state record. Obviously, the Arctic air mass that gripped the
Middle West was very cold and very dry. But snow cover likely made
the difference during the clear, calm night. While the top of the
snowpack rapidly lost infrared energy through the clear and dry
atmosphere, the deep snow cover effectively sealed off warmth from
the earth, allowing surface temperatures to plummet to a new state
record.

   The children, puzzled about who we were (I told them Santa Claus
always asked a few folks to help him with deliveries) excitedly
tore into their packages of clothing and a few small toys.
</P>
<P>
   The look on the face of the dimpled, dark-haired first grader
when she opened her eyes and saw the pink bike was priceless. The
boy who requested a Dallas Cowboys jacket was overjoyed. The little
girl who wanted a Barbie smiled approvingly. A two-year-old we
didn't know about sat in my daughter's lap and held a Beanie
Baby-type toy close.
</P>
<P>
   But you could see perceptible disappointment on Jimmy's face and
I think I heard him say, ``I asked for a bike, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' I teased, ``there's one more present for one of the
little kids but everybody has to turn their back and close their
eyes while we bring it in. Don't look!'' I can't even describe the
look of wonder and amazement on Jimmy's face when he spied that
shiny new bike.

   But before he could settle down, I told him that we were there
on behalf of Santa Claus who had sent along a message complete with
a picture of himself and wanted him to read it out loud.
</P>
<P>
   With trembling hands but a confident voice, Jimmy read: FROM:
Santa Claus TO: Jimmy Dear Jimmy: My Santa helper at Hillcrest
School said you didn't believe in Santa Claus and wouldn't believe
unless he brought you a bike.
</P>
<P>
   Well, here it is, and a few other gifts, too.
</P>
<P>
   Never forget that the greatest gift of Christmas is being able
to believe. . . to always have the heart of a child.
</P>
<P>
   Grown-ups get to a point where they don't believe and that's
very sad.
</P>
<P>
   Santa loves you and your family, especially your grandma, for
loving and taking caring of you.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you have a wonderful Christmas, Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Santa Claus North Pole e-mail: Santa.np.com Jimmy hugged
me tight and assured me with dancing eyes that he would believe in
Santa at least one more year. (He and his brother had decided the
Santa at Hillcrest had been the former principal, Larry McNutt. I
played right along).
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy also asked if we had already been to lots of houses that
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope, this is the only one!'' Before we left, we all gathered
in a circle, held hands and prayed, thanking God for letting us be
Santa's helpers and for how sweet and appreciative all the children
and their grandmother were.
</P>
<P>
   On an earlier trip to visit with Grandma, I left a copy of the
aforementioned ``Jesus'' video. The kids told me excitedly they had
already watched it three times.
</P>
<P>
   I've always loved a little ceramic that has Santa Claus kneeling
in prayer at the manger - the one who gets most of the attention at
Christmas acknowledging the true reason for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not very theological, but for this ``Santa'' - thinking of
Jimmy and his family, the little girl who wanted to get her family
together, and the truck driver with the ungrateful son - it's very,
very precious.

By K. ROBERT SCHWARZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By the late 1970s, Philip Glass was poised to conquer
the mainstream. ``Einstein on the Beach,'' of 1976, a non-narrative
music-theater work created with the director Robert Wilson, had
solidified his reputation in the downtown arts community. It had
also served to clarify and codify Glass' distinctive language. Now
he was firmly in control of his materials and could turn them to
new goals.
</P>
<P>
   The first was to capitalize further on his obvious flair for the
theater. With remarkable facility, he explored new media like film,
dance and opera. Even today, he remains fascinated with
experimental hybrids of music and theater. ``Monsters of Grace,'' a
loose collaboration with Wilson, was given its premiere last month
at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Billed as the ``first 3-D digital
opera,'' it promised revelation but delivered only titillation,
since its special effects seemed marginal to both scenario and
music.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' immersion in the theater had a profound impact on his
style. In the 1980s, his music grew more expansive, its structure
looser, its content more intuitive. The years of defiantly
repetitive and radically reductive Minimalism were over.
</P>
<P>
   Newly confident in his abilities, Glass took barely six months
in 1979 to compose what may be his finest opera, ``Satyagraha,'' a
lyrical reflection on Gandhi's formative years in South Africa. And
in 1981, he wrote his finest film score, for Godfrey Reggio's
``Koyaanisqatsi,'' making a breakthrough to the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   A studio recording of music from ``Koyaanisqatsi'' was released
in 1984 on Antilles, but to fit on one LP, the score was cut to 46
minutes. Two movements were omitted, and the remaining six were
drastically shortened, usually by curtailing repetitions. The
complete soundtrack was available only in video versions of the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Now the score has been restored to its original glory. A new
recording (Nonesuch 79506-2; CD), running 72 minutes, regains the
expansive pace, grand sweep and formal integrity that were the
essence of both the film and the music. And on Saturday evening,
``Koyaanisqatsi'' will be screened at BAM, with Glass and his
ensemble performing the score live.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' music for ``Koyaanisqatsi'' has only gained in stature
over 18 years. Indeed, it could even be considered his first
orchestral score. As such, it makes a striking contrast with one of
his more recent works, the Symphony No. 2, of 1994, also recorded
by Nonesuch (79496-2; CD), with Dennis Russell Davies conducting
the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Koyaanisqatsi,'' a Hopi word, translates roughly as ``life out
of balance.'' The film shows faceless hordes of commuters and
bureaucrats moving at a frantic pace, imprisoned by technology,
divorced from a ravaged environment. Set against this urban
nightmare are various traditional cultures, whose graceful balance
and timeless rituals are rooted in the rhythms of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, this naive premise proves plausible on screen, partly
because ``Koyaanisqatsi'' does not preach. Devoid of dialogue, text
and narrative, ``Koyaanisqatsi'' lets the images speak for
themselves and allows viewers to draw their own conclusions. And
Reggio's images are unforgettable: sweeping, aerial views of grand,
pristine landscapes; gritty shots of poverty and pollution;
time-lapse footage sped up to turn hyperkinetic city dwellers into
veritable automatons.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of dialogue, Glass' score was always front and
center; it had to be strong enough to lead an independent life.
Perhaps that is why ``Koyaanisqatsi'' showed, for the first time,
Glass' symphonic aspirations. Those had been thoroughly obscured by
the segmentation of the material on the original LP. Only now is
the tightly knit large-scale structure apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The core of ``Koyaanisqatsi'' remains the winds and keyboards of
the Philip Glass Ensemble. But the ensemble is supplemented by a
larger group of low brasses and strings (without violins), and a
wordless vocal sextet. Though hardly a conventional orchestra, this
ensemble represents a big step toward Glass' subsequent embrace of
the orchestral tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The range of instrumental colors is astonishing. If one
particular timbre has come to characterize ``Koyaanisqatsi,'' it is
the dark, subterranean growl that opens and closes the score.
First, low strings and organ sustain open fifths; next, slow,
mournful arpeggios unfurl above; finally, a sepulchral bass voice
solemnly intones the title. Yet ``Koyaanisqatsi'' also shimmers,
especially when brilliant, whirling arpeggios in the high winds and
organ emerge like shafts of sunlight breaking through dark clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the score maintains a melancholy tone, as if resigned to
the fact that Reggio's battle against technology has already been
lost. Glass makes no attempt to mimic Reggio's visuals, but his
trademark vocabulary _ rapid arpeggios, syncopated rhythms and
repeated bass figures _ is well suited to both kinetic and static
imagery. What may appear to be repetition is more illusory than
real, since some aspect of the music always changes, however
subtly.
</P>
<P>
   Glass' score has countless thrilling moments: the richly
sonorous brass ensemble that opens ``Cloudscape'' and ``The Grid'';
the desolate unison of ``Organic,'' growing into stark two-part
counterpoint; the ethereal vocal ensemble of ``Vessels''; the
untamed violence of ``Pruit Igoe.'' ``The Grid,'' maniacal and
propulsive, dominates ``Koyaanisqatsi.'' Now enlarged from the LPs
13 minutes to its full 21, it is not one second too long.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those involved with the original LP _ the Philip Glass
Ensemble; the Western Wind, a vocal ensemble, and Albert de Ruiter,
a bass _ also appear here. Both performances are sharply etched and
consistently inspired, despite Nonesuch's claim that the new
recording demonstrates an ``infinitely greater surety and
dexterity.'' The reason to buy this disk is not because the
performers have matured but because a masterpiece we thought we
knew has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1981, Glass' patented arpeggios and syncopations sounded
fresh and exhilarating, the work of an inspired composer eager to
broaden his language. If only they were similarly vibrant in the
Symphony No. 2, of 1994. But here they are placed in a different
context, which radically alters their impact.
</P>
<P>
   No one can accuse the symphony of lacking ambition. Some 42
minutes long, it is clearly intended to be a major statement.
Unlike the Symphony No. 1, which is based on themes from David
Bowie's album ``Low,'' this work is entirely abstract. What's more,
Glass considers it a study in bitonality, a descendant of music
written in France between the wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more interested in the ambiguous qualities that can result
from polytonality,'' he writes, ``how what you hear depends on how
you focus your ear, how a listener's perception of tonality can
vary in the fashion of an optical illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first movement, bitonal relationships produce gently
dissonant, pungent harmonies. The resulting chromatic language is
new for Glass. But his interest in bitonality wanes in the two
movements that follow.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the symphony offers little that is new and much that
is routine. It opens promisingly enough, with a poignant, lyrical
melody in the English horn. Basically an ascending and descending
scale, the theme reappears countless times throughout the work in
various guises. It is the only distinctive material in the
17-minute first movement, which uses it as the basis for a series
of continuous variations.
</P>
<P>
   The second movement is barely distinguishable from the first,
with neither tonality nor tempo changing significantly. A varied
form of the scalar theme alternates, all too predictably, with new,
noisy syncopations. The last movement begins with genuinely
contrasting gamelanlike patterns, but its main purpose is to allow
Glass to circle back to the motto theme and whip it up to a
suitable climax. (Shades of Dvorak's ``New World'' Symphony?)
</P>
<P>
   Glass strives hard to achieve a grand, brassy apotheosis, but
the gentle little theme cannot support all the bluster. And here
lies the problem with much of his recent instrumental music.
</P>
<P>
   In his works of the 1970s, the repetitive Minimalist patterns
were played by a lean, strident amplified ensemble, and they sound
shocking and defiant even today. In a later work like
``Koyaanisqatsi,'' the same patterns, given to a larger but still
unconventional ensemble, retain much of their sharp edge, motor
energy and obsessive power.
</P>
<P>
   But when these burbling arpeggios, ascending and descending
scales, predictable syncopations and repeated bass figures are
inflated to symphonic proportions, an awkward disparity arises
between Minimalist gestures and Romantic expressive aspirations.
With material of insufficient weight to support the large edifice
built atop it, the symphony falls flat.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Glass' style is inherently antisymphonic. With
simple patterns frozen into unvarying eight-bar phrases, there is
no rhythmic momentum, development or sense of climax. In Glass'
operas, the narrative provides direction, but here the structure is
merely episodic, with no compelling thrust or cumulative impact.
</P>
<P>
   The vast resources of the orchestra tempt Glass to thicken the
stew unnecessarily. Minimal materials are clothed in absurdly
maximal garb. This contradiction also plagues orchestral works by
other first-generation minimalists, including Steve Reich and Terry
Riley.
</P>
<P>
   At least Reich acknowledged the problem. Since 1987, he has
shunned the orchestra and returned to spare, unconventional
ensembles. Undoubtedly he recognized that his intricate
counterpoint, so crystalline when played by a small group, can turn
muddy when orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   Glass, for his part has written marvelous music in recent years,
but none of it has been orchestral. ``Orphee,'' based on the film
by Jean Cocteau, is a small-scale opera scored for a lean,
transparent chamber ensemble. The Fifth String Quartet, startling
in its harmonic and formal innovations, is cast in a medium that
shuns grandiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years after its composition, ``Koyaanisqatsi'' has lost
none of its vitality, for its musical materials are at home in
their environment. Life, in other words, is in balance. But in the
Symphony No. 2, life has swung out of balance, with the materials
mired in alien terrain.

`LATELINE': THE NEWS IS OLD, BUT THE JOKE LIES ELSEWHERE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike, say, vegetable soup, topical comedy cannot be cooked up
months in advance and then put in the freezer until you're hungry.
That's one lesson that might be learned from the return of
``Lateline'' to the NBC schedule Wednesday night. The network's
programmers, who apparently didn't grasp the show's limited
potential when it failed to catch fire last year, are looking in
vain for nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the concept must have seemed promising on paper: an
ensemble comedy about a nightly news program like ``Nightline.''
One of the show's creators, the savvy writer and comic Al Franken,
gave himself the plum role of a goofy gung-ho reporter. There's a
pompous anchor (Robert Foxworth), a conniving producer (Miguel
Ferrer) and other assorted staff members. Add the gimmick of having
real-life political and media figures wander about, and what do you
get?
</P>
<P>
   Not enough. For one thing, despite walk-ons by people like Dick
Gephardt and Ralph Nader, the production schedule did not allow the
show to be topical in its first incarnation. In the months since,
the pace of the news in Washington (and of the media efforts to
keep up) has increased geometrically. And since none of the recent
events are reflected in the first two new episodes, a show that's
meant to look knowingly in touch looks sadly out of the loop, even
if William F. Buckley does stroll through Wednesday night, and the
lawyer Robert Bennett has a bit of dialogue next week.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's show, Foxworth's character briefly loses
his journalistic way when he records some comedy bits for Conan
O'Brien. The episode gives O'Brien's pudgy late-night sidekick,
Andy Richter, a chance to romp around the fictional news studio
clad only in briefs. For his part, O'Brien manages to keep both his
clothes and dignity pretty much in place.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's story sends Franken and Ferrer to jail: something
about protecting a source. But the laughs, such as they are, are
pretty stale. And without any comic payoff, the scene that creates
the illusion that Franken is going to the toilet is merely
puzzling.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' to ``Murphy Brown'' and even
``News Radio,'' this newsroom stuff has been done better with more
distinctly drawn characters. Even the short-lived ``Brian Benben
Show'' this season was more clever. And after ABC's sophisticated
``Sports Night'' set the current standard for a
let's-put-on-a-television-show television show, the decision to
resurrect ``Lateline'' seems desperate.

   Vegetable soup, anyone?

AMERICAN FICTION HAD A HEYDAY IN THE '70S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we enter the last year of the '90s, my thoughts turn to the
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because a recent investigation of my notebooks convinces me
that the decade of the 1970s was quite fabulous for American
fiction, and I don't believe this has been acknowledged or
otherwise noted.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to evaluate the inventory of the '90s or even of
the '80s, because its staying power has not been determined. By my
reckoning, the '90s have been almost a washout and the '80s weren't
much better, but that could change; if I could be around, say,
another 20 or 30 years, I might revise that opinion. In any of the
creative or performing arts, a distanced perspective is needed for
final qualitative judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, I can salute the '70s as our strongest literary
decade of the post-World War II era, spilling over with books to be
read and read again, decades later. And I'll only scratch the
surface ...
</P>
<P>
   The reigning masters, some then quite young, were represented
well. Saul Bellow delivered ``Humboldt's Gift.'' An uneven John
Updike ledger showed ``Rabbit Redux,'' second item in the Harry
Angstrom tetralogy. Bernard Malamud was in form with ``The
Tenants'' and ``Dubin's Lives.'' Ditto Wallace Stegner with ``Angle
of Repose'' and ``The Spectator Bird.'' Joseph Heller's ``Something
Happened'' divided critics, but today is regarded as highly as
``Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Malamud's ``Rembrandt's Hat'' was one of many splendid story
collections. Others included Brendan Gill's ``Ways of Loving'' and
Isaac Bashevis Singer's ``Passions''; and John Cheever, whose
collected stories were a trumpeted event, also produced a strong
novel in the prison-based ``Falconer.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the manifold glories was Vladimir Nabokov's ``Glory.'' A
brilliant monstrosity was William Gaddis' ``J R.'' A Thomas Pynchon
I didn't admire was ``Gravity's Rainbow,'' but it seems generally
admired today. There was plenty of good Philip Roth and Jerzy
Kosinski and Stanley Elkin and Chaim Potok; and the stars of the
decade surely were E.L. Doctorow (''The Book of Daniel'' and
``Ragtime'') and John Gardner, with no less than four varied gems _
``Grendel,'' ``The Sunlight Dialogues,'' ``Nickel Mountain'' and
``October Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger men rose to prominence: Don DeLillo (''Ratner's Star''),
James Salter (''Light Years''), Robert Stone (''Dog Soldiers''),
John Nichols (''The Milagro Beanfield War'') and Richard Ford (''A
Piece of My Heart,'' a stunning debut). Dutifully I report that the
'70s also gave us Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the decade in which women writers closed the gap and
achieved parity with the men. Not just those with variably feminist
voices, who certainly were vital to the women's movement _ Alix
Kates Shulman (''Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen''), Mary Gordon
(''Final Payments''), Sheila Ballantyne (''Norma Jean the Termite
Queen''), Erica Jong (''Fear of Flying'') and the shrill Marilyn
French (''The Women's Room'').
</P>
<P>
   Doris Grumbach's exquisite ``Chamber Music'' transcended
feminism or any label, as did works by other forthright American
women _ Alison Lurie (''The War Between the Tates''), Gail Godwin
(''Glass People,'' ``The Odd Woman''), Anne Tyler (''The Clock
Winder,'' ``Searching for Caleb''), Alice Hoffman (''Property Of,''
``The Drowning Season''), Laurie Colwin (''Happy All the Time''),
Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey (''A Woman of Independent Means'') and
yes, Joyce Carol Oates (''Wonderland,'' among others).
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison won the critics with ``The Bluest Eye'' and
``Sula,'' and won the people with ``Song of Solomon.'' James
Baldwin was at his most provocative with ``If Beale Street Could
Talk,'' and young Gayl Jones exhibited ferocious promise in
``Corregidora'' and ``Eva's Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Want more names? Gore Vidal, Jessamyn West, Frederick Buechner,
William Humphrey, Cormac McCarthy, Judith Rossner, Steven
Millhauser, George V. Higgins and Edward Abbey all produced at high
levels in the '70s. And I haven't mentioned Larry McMurtry, Judith
Guest, Scott Spencer, Nicholas Delbanco, or brilliant one-shots
John Lahr (''The Autograph Hound'') and Wilfrid Sheed (''People
Will Always Be Kind'')... or the now completely lost Kelly Cherry
(''Sick and Full of Burning''), Ross Feld (''Years Out''), and
Stephen Paul Smith, whose ``American Boys'' may be both the best
and least-known of the Vietnam novels.
</P>
<P>
   William Wharton's ``Birdy,'' which I am credited with having
``discovered,'' is a great novel. So are Arthur A. Cohen's ``In the
Days of Simon Stern'' and Leslie Epstein's ``King of the Jews'';
and I insist again that the finest American novel of the '70s was
Robert Roper's neglected ``On Spider Creek,'' with Thomas Rogers'
equally ignored ``A Confession of the Child of the Century'' a near
second.
</P>
<P>
   This is only an American summary. The Brits (Trevor, Murdoch,
Drabble et al.) and Canadians (Davies, Munro, Atwood) fortified a
healthy literary decade. That could be another report entirely.
</P>
<P>
   So many books worth reading again. It was a bountiful time, but
we hardly knew it then. And, hey, whatever happened to Tom Robbins?

AMERICAN FICTION HAD A HEYDAY IN THE '70S
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we enter the last year of the '90s, my thoughts turn to the
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because a recent investigation of my notebooks convinces me
that the decade of the 1970s was quite fabulous for American
fiction, and I don't believe this has been acknowledged or
otherwise noted.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to evaluate the inventory of the '90s or even of
the '80s, because its staying power has not been determined. By my
reckoning, the '90s have been almost a washout and the '80s weren't
much better, but that could change; if I could be around, say,
another 20 or 30 years, I might revise that opinion. In any of the
creative or performing arts, a distanced perspective is needed for
final qualitative judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, I can salute the '70s as our strongest literary
decade of the post-World War II era, spilling over with books to be
read and read again, decades later. And I'll only scratch the
surface ...
</P>
<P>
   The reigning masters, some then quite young, were represented
well. Saul Bellow delivered ``Humboldt's Gift.'' An uneven John
Updike ledger showed ``Rabbit Redux,'' second item in the Harry
Angstrom tetralogy. Bernard Malamud was in form with ``The
Tenants'' and ``Dubin's Lives.'' Ditto Wallace Stegner with ``Angle
of Repose'' and ``The Spectator Bird.'' Joseph Heller's ``Something
Happened'' divided critics, but today is regarded as highly as
``Catch-22.''
</P>
<P>
   Malamud's ``Rembrandt's Hat'' was one of many splendid story
collections. Others included Brendan Gill's ``Ways of Loving'' and
Isaac Bashevis Singer's ``Passions''; and John Cheever, whose
collected stories were a trumpeted event, also produced a strong
novel in the prison-based ``Falconer.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the manifold glories was Vladimir Nabokov's ``Glory.'' A
brilliant monstrosity was William Gaddis' ``J R.'' A Thomas Pynchon
I didn't admire was ``Gravity's Rainbow,'' but it seems generally
admired today. There was plenty of good Philip Roth and Jerzy
Kosinski and Stanley Elkin and Chaim Potok; and the stars of the
decade surely were E.L. Doctorow (''The Book of Daniel'' and
``Ragtime'') and John Gardner, with no less than four varied gems _
``Grendel,'' ``The Sunlight Dialogues,'' ``Nickel Mountain'' and
``October Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger men rose to prominence: Don DeLillo (''Ratner's Star''),
James Salter (''Light Years''), Robert Stone (''Dog Soldiers''),
John Nichols (''The Milagro Beanfield War'') and Richard Ford (''A
Piece of My Heart,'' a stunning debut). Dutifully I report that the
'70s also gave us Stephen King.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the decade in which women writers closed the gap and
achieved parity with the men. Not just those with variably feminist
voices, who certainly were vital to the women's movement _ Alix
Kates Shulman (''Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen''), Mary Gordon
(''Final Payments''), Sheila Ballantyne (''Norma Jean the Termite
Queen''), Erica Jong (''Fear of Flying'') and the shrill Marilyn
French (''The Women's Room'').
</P>
<P>
   Doris Grumbach's exquisite ``Chamber Music'' transcended
feminism or any label, as did works by other forthright American
women _ Alison Lurie (''The War Between the Tates''), Gail Godwin
(''Glass People,'' ``The Odd Woman''), Anne Tyler (''The Clock
Winder,'' ``Searching for Caleb''), Alice Hoffman (''Property Of,''
``The Drowning Season''), Laurie Colwin (''Happy All the Time''),
Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey (''A Woman of Independent Means'') and
yes, Joyce Carol Oates (''Wonderland,'' among others).
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison won the critics with ``The Bluest Eye'' and
``Sula,'' and won the people with ``Song of Solomon.'' James
Baldwin was at his most provocative with ``If Beale Street Could
Talk,'' and young Gayl Jones exhibited ferocious promise in
``Corregidora'' and ``Eva's Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Want more names? Gore Vidal, Jessamyn West, Frederick Buechner,
William Humphrey, Cormac McCarthy, Judith Rossner, Steven
Millhauser, George V. Higgins and Edward Abbey all produced at high
levels in the '70s. And I haven't mentioned Larry McMurtry, Judith
Guest, Scott Spencer, Nicholas Delbanco, or brilliant one-shots
John Lahr (''The Autograph Hound'') and Wilfrid Sheed (''People
Will Always Be Kind'')... or the now completely lost Kelly Cherry
(''Sick and Full of Burning''), Ross Feld (''Years Out''), and
Stephen Paul Smith, whose ``American Boys'' may be both the best
and least-known of the Vietnam novels.
</P>
<P>
   William Wharton's ``Birdy,'' which I am credited with having
``discovered,'' is a great novel. So are Arthur A. Cohen's ``In the
Days of Simon Stern'' and Leslie Epstein's ``King of the Jews'';
and I insist again that the finest American novel of the '70s was
Robert Roper's neglected ``On Spider Creek,'' with Thomas Rogers'
equally ignored ``A Confession of the Child of the Century'' a near
second.
</P>
<P>
   This is only an American summary. The Brits (Trevor, Murdoch,
Drabble et al.) and Canadians (Davies, Munro, Atwood) fortified a
healthy literary decade. That could be another report entirely.
</P>
<P>
   So many books worth reading again. It was a bountiful time, but
we hardly knew it then. And, hey, whatever happened to Tom Robbins?

IMPEACH (Washington) - It now appears that impeachment trial

WHITE HOUSE THREATENS LONG DEFENSE AS SENATE SETS TRIAL DATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment trial will begin in
the Senate on Thursday, Senate leaders announced Tuesday, trigging
an immediate White House threat to launch an exhaustive and
protracted defense of the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton's lawyers
are preparing to attack the alleged facts underlying the two
articles of impeachment approved by the House on Dec. 19 as well as
to challenge whether his alleged wrongdoing warrants removal from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., announced the
Thursday trial date after conferring with Senate Minority Leader
Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., and Chief Justice William Rehnquist
about procedures the Senate might follow. The chief justice will
preside over Clinton's trial, the first impeachment trial of a
president since Andrew Johnson was tried for 10 weeks in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Lott offered few details at a news conference and refused to
take questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a constitutional duty here,'' said Lott. ``It is a
very serious one... We will do our very best to do this in a proper
way.'' He said he hoped the Senate would ``come to a conclusion
that is fair and hopefully quick, also.''
</P>
<P>
   The House impeached Clinton last month for allegedly committing
perjury and obstruction of justice in connection with the cover-up
of his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial convenes Thursday, Rehnquist is expected to
administer a special oath to senators, who will sit as jurors in
the trial. Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who conferred twice Tuesday
with Lott, later told reporters that Lott indicated the actual
evidence phase would start Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there was confusion among senators about how the
rarely used procedure would unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., summed up the disarray: ``It's all up
in the air. It's a jump ball.'' Unanswered questions included
whether witnesses would be called, whether a censure proposal
should be part of the equation and how long the trial would last.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., warned that failure to reach agreement
on the ``nitty gritty'' of how to conduct the trial could result in
a ``meltdown'' in the Senate. However, Assistant Majority Leader
Don Nickles, R-Okla., said he was ``optimistic'' that the Senate
would reach an agreement on how the trial should proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties were scheduled to caucus separately
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While threatening a lengthy defense of the president at a full
Senate trial, Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said Clinton's
lawyers would not launch an all-out defense if the Senate were to
move to censure the president rather than trying him on the
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Censure would be up to the Senate and House, Lockhart said, and
the White House would not have ``a role in presenting a defense in
that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said White House lawyers will expand upon the three
written reports and day-long presentations to the House Judiciary
Committee in December challenging the impeachment of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make, at the appropriate time, the same arguments to
the allegations, I think, no matter how the process moves
forward,'' Lockhart said. ``We will argue, whatever the process, I
think effectively and in a compelling way, that neither of the
articles have a constitutional basis or do the facts offer a
foundation to remove the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropping an earlier threat, however, Lockhart said the White
House would not challenge the constitutionality of the 106th
Congress taking up an impeachment proceeding launched last year by
the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As Lockhart put it: ``I haven't heard any serious discussion of
that argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the Senate's No. 2
Republican vote counter, announced his opposition to a bipartisan
plan that Lott shopped around last week, which would allow the
Senate to censure Clinton unless two-thirds of the Senate voted in
a preliminary ballot to continue with a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said the Founding Fathers, when writing the Constitution,
did not use the term censure because they did not intend for it to
be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, of course, a natural desire to want a reasonable,
quiet, even silent way out,'' Gregg said. ``But, to use censure as
the vehicle should not be the Senate's choice... Censure will not
be taken seriously by the president or his people; it will set a
precedent that will undermine a primary element of our system of
governance and it is not the proper constitutional format.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., emerging from a meeting with Lott
Tuesday, acknowledged a widespread lack of consensus about how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything is clear at this point,'' Abraham said.
</P>
<P>
   But Abraham said he was certain of one thing: ``We need to get
the process moving through as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.V., an expert on Senate rules, was also
called into Lott's office to consult.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said he preferred that the Senate hold a trial without
calling in witnesses _ such as former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky or President Clinton _ suggesting the use of sworn
testimony instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have at our fingertips the information that would enable us
to reach a considered and reasoned judgment,'' Byrd said. ``We need
not go through the sordid details of this unfortunate episode in
the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Specter told reporters ``It is very difficult to conduct a
trial if you don't have witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of religious leaders decried what they said
was a lack of civility during the impeachment investigation and
called on the Senate ``to set aside the language of sound-bites and
barbed quips for reasoned debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Welton Gaddy, a Baptist minister and the executive director of
the nonpartisan Interfaith Alliance, which claims to represent
80,000 Americans of different religions, said the investigation by
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and the subsequent impeachment
debate in the House had succumbed to ``strident partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, Gaddy said, will be on trial at the same time as the
president. ``The people of this nation will judge how the Senate
conducts its business in deciding the fate of the president,''
Gaddy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The religious leaders believe that incivility among elected
officials erodes the public's faith in its leaders and
institutions. The Interfaith Alliance is planning a summit of
national religious leaders Jan. 26 to discuss the matter.

CLINTON OFFERS FURTHER EASING OF EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, looking to a future post-Fidel
Castro Cuba, sought to ease U.S. restrictions on the island nation
for the second time in 10 months Tuesday, hoping to foster a
peaceful transition to democracy after the Marxist dictator dies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton authorized resumption of direct mail service to Cuba, a
pair of exhibition baseball games between the Baltimore Orioles and
Cuba's national baseball team, more charter passenger flights to
Havana and the sale of U.S. food and pesticides to non-governmental
humanitarian organizations including Roman Catholic charities.
</P>
<P>
   James Dobbins, a National Security Council specialist on Cuba,
said the president was laying the groundwork for ties with Cubans
who can forge a peaceful transition to democracy after Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cuba is approaching a transition,'' Dobbins said. ``We don't
know how quickly it will come, but that it will come is almost
certain.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, American officials are ``more eager to find
ways to assist it and to assure that it is peaceful and that it is
democratic,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, 72, still seems to be in good health. But when he
appeared last Friday in the Cuban capital, Santiago, to mark the
40th anniversary of his coming to power, he told supporters that he
was ``not exactly the same man'' that he was on the day of his
triumph in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposals cannot be implemented without the approval
of the Cuban government, U.S. officials noted.
</P>
<P>
   The president said his actions reflect a growing bipartisan
consensus that the United States ``can and should do more to work
with the Cuban people toward the future of democracy and
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed that all Americans _ not just those with
relatives in Cuba _ be allowed to send up to $1,200 a year to needy
Cubans. The flow of additional U.S. dollars would strengthen the
ability of ordinary Cubans to operate inside the country without
depending on state-provided food and services. Clinton's aid
measures would specifically circumvent the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, like administration actions taken last year, were
responses to appeals by Pope John Paul II during his visit to Cuba
last year for more generous U.S. aid to ordinary Cubans. Clinton is
scheduled to meet the pope in St. Louis during the pontiff's visit
to the United States in late January.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Clinton authorized resumption of direct charter
flights to Havana from Miami and allowed Americans of Cuban descent
to send money to their relatives on the island. He also expedited
the process of applying for licenses to ship food and medical
supplies to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the additional steps he outlined
Tuesday may ease the criticism of U.S. policy toward Cuba that
Clinton expects to face on his tour of Central America in
mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami-based advocacy group, the Cuban American National
Foundation, urged Clinton to rethink his plan to permit food sales
to non-governmental relief organizations in Cuba. The foundation
said that to ``alleviate the suffering imposed on the Cuban people
by the Castro regime,'' Clinton should allow donations, not sales,
of food.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American politicians in Florida immediately challenged
Clinton's actions. Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami,
whose congressional district includes many Cuban exiles, charged
that the administration's secret goal is ``normalizing relations
with the Cuban dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Romero, a State Department official responsible for
Cuba, replied, ``We don't have a hidden agenda here. What you see
is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Clinton's proposals
were designed to encourage development of Cuban civic organizations
independent of Havana's communist government that ``will help the
Cuban people prepare for the day when their country is once again
free.''
</P>
<P>
   The measures ``constitute a major advance in our effort to reach
out to the Cuban people,'' Albright said, adding that Clinton's
initiatives ``should help all Cubans to understand that the United
States is on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero said the Clinton administration effort is aimed partly at
disarming ``the propaganda machine in Cuba that essentially
continues with the same diatribe that the American people are the
enemy of the Cuban people.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has imposed an economic embargo on Cuba, which
is 90 miles from Florida, since 1962 _ three years after Castro
overthrew Fulgencio Batista's 26-year-old dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tightened the embargo after Cuban warplanes shot down a
pair of unarmed civilian planes flown by anti-Castro Cuban exiles
testing Cuban airspace in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the administration was revealing Clinton's new proposals
Tuesday, it rejected a recommendation from a bipartisan panel led
by Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., for
creation of a blue-ribbon commission to map revisions of U.S.
policy on Cuba. A senior official said a commission is not needed
because ``there is already a bipartisan consensus'' that aid to the
Cuban people should be expanded.

NEW GENERATION OF WOMEN FACING THE BIG 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Generation X _ that youthful, ``slacker'' generation _ is facing
a quiet crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of that group is turning 30. Time to grow up,
get serious. Time for a major identity shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   Time to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think of ourselves as not really that together and not
really very grown up,'' said Kristin Beck, a Bay-area writer who
hit the big 3-0 last April.
</P>
<P>
   After reading up on adult development, she and colleague Lauren
Dockett interviewed more than 30 women about ``lessons learned and
dreams examined'' as they reached their first scary ``decade''
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The responses are woven into their book, ``Facing 30: Women Talk
About Constructing a Real Life and Other Scary Rites of Passage''
(New Harbinger Publications, 163 pages, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   Beck and Dockett uncovered rampant angst among their peers, who
believed they had little to show for themselves as they entered
serious adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering in school, putting off marriage, flitting from job to
job, they panicked as they saw their adolescence stretch like cheap
pantyhose. Many worried they were living a kind of ``adulthood
lite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women pretty uniformly said their identity was shaken at the
end of their 20s,'' Beck said. ``Love and career and babies: Those
are the big things.''
</P>
<P>
   Many women believed self-imposed deadline pressure to have their
lives tidily arranged _ right now. When things didn't gel, they
believed the problem lay with them, not their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the biggest unrealistic expectation,'' Beck said, ``is
that you have to achieve everything by 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Graying baby boomers may snort at the thought of Gen-Xers
wringing their smooth, unlined hands over the trauma of aging, but
Beck says ix-nay on the condescension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially when you're facing 50, 30 looks pretty good,'' she
concedes. ``But like it or not, it is a significant developmental
period in a woman's life. If you don't take a look at stuff in your
30s, you might end up with a big, fat midlife crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen-Xers grew up in a different climate than their elders, so
turning 30 feels slightly different for them. Baby boomers _ who
coined the phrase, ``Don't trust anyone over 30'' _ may have
suffered some chagrin when age pushed them into the enemy camp. But
their choices in life were fairly straightforward, Beck said. They
could either conform to traditional roles or rebel against them.
</P>
<P>
   Generation X, on the other hand, is coming of age with no clear
sense of identity. Everything is up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there aren't even rules to be broken,'' Beck said. ``It's
so free-form, it's stultifying.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees Gen-X as a cautious, media-saturated bunch who grew up
without illusions. Stung by their parents' divorces, the women she
met are nervous about commitment, even if they see marriage as a
desirable goal. With far less job security than their parents had,
they view career choice as something malleable, less defining.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's basically our generation in a nutshell _ many, many
different kinds of jobs before settling into a career,'' Beck said.
``The idea is grab what you can get. We have grown up in a pretty
screwy economy and nothing seems very secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Although women are having babies later in life, they still feel
pressure to get moving on the issue _ at least make up their minds
_ by age 30, Beck said. If they want children, their tendency is to
dump lackluster relationships at around this age and start scouting
for more promising, long-term partners.
</P>
<P>
   Beck senses a backlash against the mantra that women can have it
all _ high-octane career, marriage and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really grateful to our mothers for paving the way for
us,'' she said, ``but I do think that having it all means you're
sacrificing something.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women we talked to wanted to stay home with their
kids _ wanted to _ and considered themselves feminists.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck, who grew up as a latchkey kid, said she works full time
out of economic necessity but would rather be home with her
2{-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of women are trying to figure out a way to work
half-time and keep themselves in the career loop and pay attention
to their kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The younger women Beck interviewed saw 30 as a great divide
between the carefree, adventurous possibilities of youth and the
drudgery of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People basically thought you'd be set in your ways, you'd be
calcified, you'd have to give up facets of your personality you
weren't ready to give up,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, turning 30 seldom lived down to their expectations.
Women who had already passed that milestone said they felt more
sure-footed and fully formed. They also felt less pressure to
strive for impossible standards of beauty. Beck said their
philosophy was, ``No one's going to ever buy you as a young person
anymore, so you might as well give it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle-age women said it's OK to hit 30 without all the answers.
In hindsight, they saw it as a jumping-off point for adulthood _ a
time to move forward with greater confidence and really start
living.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just know yourself better when you turn 30,'' Beck said,
adding that she learned to lighten up after talking to these women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to wrap things up right this second,'' she
decided. ``If I'm not happy in my career, I have a whole lifetime
to figure it out. I don't feel I have to have everything solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she added, ``30 seems like an exciting possibility instead
of a big bummer.''

BRUINS-LEAFS MATCHUP PITS DIFFERENT STYLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The home-and-home series between the Bruins and Maple
Leafs Thursday and Saturday should be an interesting two-game
tussle. The Bruins prefer to play a defensive style, while Toronto,
in first place in the Northeast Division, plays a more wide-open
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs, who have a 4-point lead on the third-place
Bruins, have scored 122 goals and allowed 109. The Bruins, on the
other hand, have scored 99 and given up 82. There's plenty of
scoring balance on the Maple Leafs, led by Mats Sundin with 42
points (13 goals) and Steve Thomas with 32 points (15 goals).
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some guys who can put the puck in the net; they've
scored quite a few goals this year,'' said Bruins captain Ray
Bourque. ``They play hard, and it should be quite a challenge to
us. They're two big games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins won't change their style; they play the same way
regardless of the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with defense and trying to keep the other team off
the board, and if we do that, our chances of winning are a lot
better,'' said Bourque. ``We're going to try to shut them down and
capitalize on our opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time they came in here'' _ a 4-1 Boston win Nov. 5 _
``we did a pretty good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque would like to see the Bruins get at least 3 of the 4
points from this set.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are huge because they're divisional games, and that's 2
points that you're preventing Toronto from getting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly a day goes by when Bourque doesn't glance at the
standings. He looks at both the division and conference standings,
the latter of which find the Maple Leafs in second and the Bruins
in sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I do is watch the standings and where we stand and who's
playing and who we may be able to pick up on or how close you are
to the people in front of you,'' Bourque said. ``Also, how close
people are behind you. You pay attention to that. This is a tough
conference, where 85 points might keep you out of the playoffs.
You've got to get 90 to make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sundin and Bourque have had their share of wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few instances where he competes and I
compete and you battle for your ice,'' Bourque said. ``By doing
that, sometimes certain things happen you don't like too much. I
just know he wants the best of me in terms of scoring, and to shut
him down, I've got to play strong and hold him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Maple Leaf to contend with is goaltender Curtis Joseph,
who has a 2.64 goals-against average and .906 save percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the top goaltenders in the league,'' Bourque said.
``He can stun you any night. He competes fairly hard, he's
acrobatic, and you've always got your work cut out when you're
facing him. You've got to find a way to get the puck past him, and
sometimes that's really hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have done well the last two games, a 2-1 victory over
Anaheim, followed by a 5-1 decision over Calgary, both at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 40 shots that Byron (Dafoe) had to face against
Calgary, but he only allowed one in,'' Bourque said. ``That's too
many shots for him to face. We don't like that to happen too often,
but we came out with a win, and Anaheim, we shut them down real
good, too. It's a nice way to come back after our 6-1 loss at
Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong first period might be important. The Bruins haven't
been consistent in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about it, trying to correct it,'' Bourque said.
``You've got to be ready. You have to be aware of those starts. A
good first period certainly helps.''

FISK WILL HAVE TO WAIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)``Sparky Anderson says Don Gullett is going to the Hall
of Fame after the World Series. I'm going to the Eliot Lounge (a
former Boston drinking place).''(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   _ Bill Lee, October 1975 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost a quarter-century since the Greatest World
Series Ever Played, and the Class of '75 will be stalking
Cooperstown well into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk Tuesday came up 43 votes shy in his first year of
eligibility for the Baseball Hall of Fame. This is disappointing.
Fisk hit more homers and caught more games than any other catcher
in history. He deserves a plaque in Cooperstown, and will probably
get one next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Baseball Writers Association of America announced Tuesday
that Nolan Ryan, George Brett, and Robin Yount will be inducted
into the Hall July 25. Fisk was named on 330 of 497 votes cast,
which was less than the 75 percent required for entry to Hardball
Heaven. Tony Perez finished fifth with 302 votes, making it a
frustrating day for the Class of '75.
</P>
<P>
   The 1975 World Series, punctuated by Fisk's Game 6 foul-pole
clanger, saved baseball from irrelevancy at a time when our nation
was pledging allegiance to the Bee Gees and ``Monday Night
Football.'' It was a true Fall Classic, sparking a baseball revival
that carried all the way into the 1994 strike. What Mark McGwire
and Sammy Sosa did in 1998, the Reds and Red Sox did in '75. And
now the Class of '75 bangs at the door of the Diamond Shrine while
three members rest ensconced inside.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, Carl Yastrzemski and Johnny Bench were the first two
'75 graduates to make it to Cooperstown and they went in together
in 1989. A year later, it was Reds second baseman Joe Morgan
gaining entrance. But they will not be the final links between the
Hall and the Class of '75.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk should be next, probably in 2000. Perez has more RBIs
(1,652) than any player who's not in the Hall, and could be
welcomed someday, especially if his name is turned over to the
Veterans Committee (Perez has been on the ballot for eight years).
And the inimitable Sparky no doubt will make it to the Hall on the
strength of his managerial genius.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there is cause celebre Pete Rose, who got 16
write-in votes Tuesday. The all-time hit leader would have been a
certain first-ballot Hall of Famer if his gambling compulsion
hadn't earned him lifetime banishment from baseball. Prediction:
Someday, either the rules will be changed or the Nixon mentality
will take hold; Rose will be forgiven and received by the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   So think about that, ladies and gentlemen. The 1975 Reds boasted
two men who are in the Hall, and at least three more who either
could or should be in Cooperstown. They also had a shortstop, Dave
Concepcion, who gathered 59 votes this year, an outfielder (George
Foster) who would later hit 50 homers in a season, and another
outfielder (Ken Griffey) who produced a kid that's a lock for the
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The '75 Red Sox were all over Tuesday's ballot, but their vote
totals were lower than they should have been. Jim Rice got 146
votes, and it appears that his only shot will be with the Veterans
Committee (a player's name is turned over to the committee if he
fails to gain entry after 15 years on the ballot; a player needs 5
percent of the vote to stay on the ballot).
</P>
<P>
   Luis Tiant, every bit as good as Hall of Famers Catfish Hunter
and Don Drysdale, got only 53 votes this year. Poor Dwight Evans,
one of the superstars of the Class of '75, got only 18 votes and
will be dropped from future consideration. Alas, Fred Lynn's name
has already come and gone from the ballot. Think of what could have
been ...
</P>
<P>
   Fisk, however, will be back. His candidacy this year no doubt
was hurt by the strength of Ryan, Brett, and Yount, three
first-time callers who made the cut. A lot of voters don't like to
vote for more than one or two players per year, and a strong ballot
hurts a promising first-time candidate like Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   So look for Catcher Carlton to make the cut next year when
voters will be presented with a less formidable ballot. Fisk caught
the most games, hit the most homers by a catcher, and provided the
game's signature moment of the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and what about Don Gullett? He won 109 games, retired in
1978, and never got a sniff. Lee won 119, and was quickly dismissed
from the ballot, but it is widely believed that he did make it to
the Eliot after the '75 World Series.

 &HT;    Elton's next tour takes him small U.S. cities
 &HT;    EDS: Resending for those who need it. ELTON-DATES-COX will also
move as a sidebar to this story.)
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elton John says he enjoys scaring himself. And now he'll have
the chance.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the singer and pianist will hit the road
alone, playing small American cities with just a piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to keep myself fresh and on my toes,'' John said in
an interview. ``It's very rewarding to go out and do shows on your
own because a) it's scary, and b) you get to do numbers you don't
normally perform with a band, and it gives you a chance to talk to
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've had a career for 30 years, you need to go back
and be scared once in a while. With a band, you're surrounded by
people who can support and cover up for you. With this, if I make a
mistake, it's out there for everyone to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets go on sale Saturday for the first leg of the tour, which
begins Feb. 19 in Roanoke, Va. John will also play Chattanooga,
Tenn.; Fort Myers, Gainesville and Pensacola, Fla.; Jackson, Miss.;
Grand Rapids, Mich.; Lafayette, La.; Iowa City, Iowa; and
Huntsville, Ala. He's even playing Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The tour will swing through John's adopted U.S. hometown,
Atlanta, Feb. 23, when he makes his Fox Theatre debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to play the Fox. It's a beautiful theater
and a great size to play,'' John said.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices for the Fox date have yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   John will entertain college students during several campus dates
on the itinerary, including Southern Illinois University at
Carbondale and the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga. He says
those shows will help him build on his boomer-heavy fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll either be beside themselves with glee or beside
themselves with absolute horror!'' said John, 51.
</P>
<P>
   The singer also likes the idea of playing places that rarely get
included on superstar tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played Greenville, S.C., recently, and people were saying,
`I can't believe he's coming to Greenville.' Well, why not? Thirty
thousand people are a lot people. Also, these are people who
haven't heard you play for a while. That adds to the challenge of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   John says fans can expect some low-key songs. Sets will likely
include ``Talking Old Soldiers'' from the 1970 album ``Tumbleweed
Connection'' and ``Border Song'' from 1981's ``The Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'll be doing some up-tempo stuff, too,'' said John,
laughing. ``Otherwise, you'll have to give people a suicide kit
before they leave.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preparing the tour, the singer has logged time in
a recording studio in recent months. ``Elton John and Tim Rice's
Aida,'' an album based on songs from ``Elaborate Lives: The Legend
of Aida,'' is scheduled for release March 23. (The future of the
Disney stage show, which premiered in Atlanta, is undecided.)
</P>
<P>
   Sting, James Taylor, Spice Girls, Tina Turner, Shania Twain,
Lenny Kravitz and Boyz II Men have all contributed tracks. John
himself recorded duets with LeAnn Rimes and Janet Jackson and a
solo version of the show's title song.
</P>
<P>
   John and Rimes will publicly debut their duet of ``Written in
the Stars'' during the live ``People's Choice Awards'' telecast at
9 p.m. EST Sunday on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Of the ``Aida'' album, John said, ``I just told people, `Don't
do the songs the same as me.' And no one has. Sting has done
`Another Pyramid' in a very, very classic reggae way. James
Taylor's done `How I Know You' in a very beautiful James Taylor
acoustic fashion. And the Spice Girls have recorded `My Strongest
Suit.' They're really the only people who could have done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actresses Heather Headley and Sherie Scott, who starred in
``Aida'' during the show's Atlanta run, also put in some time
together in the recording studio. Along with John, they have
recorded the show's ``A Step Too Far'' for the album.

   PEVEK, Russia _ Here in Russia's most northern city, a winter's
day is two hours of cheerless gray. The temperature plunges to 40
below. And delays in getting wages are measured in years, not
months.
</P>
<P>
   It is the edge of the world and the end of the line for
thousands of Russians drawn here during Soviet times by promises of
high pay and patriotic appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents were lured here by the romance of the north,''
said Irina Akulenko, 32, cradling her 2-year-old daughter in her
arms. ``Like almost everybody else, I would like to get out now.
But we don't earn anything here, and there is no way we can
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Trapped in Russia's frozen frontier, many workers resemble the
political prisoners who were brought here decades ago. They are
unable to leave and are often not even paid _ at least not
promptly, and not always with money.
</P>
<P>
   The colonization of the north was one of the Soviet Union's most
audacious ventures. The Soviet government wanted the region's ores
and natural gas and was determined to bend nature to its will to
get them. Entire cities sprouted on the forbidding tundra. Cargo
ships plied the iceberg-laden waters, lugging food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Now the dismal economics of the north has finally caught up with
these far-flung regions. Russia's new market economy cannot bear
the colossal cost of feeding and heating the northern outposts.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the cash-strapped Russian government has done little to
relocate the almost 9 million Russians, Ukrainians, Belarussians
and other former Soviet citizens who live there. It has even failed
to formally rescind the benefits mandated to lure workers. People
continue to arrive only to find that many promised rewards exist
only on paper.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chukotka region, an expanse the size of France that runs
along the Arctic Sea to the Bering Strait, many workers have done
their best to flee. Apartments have sold for bargain prices in
Pevek and other cities. Smaller settlements have been abandoned,
turning them into shuttered, icy ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   The 85,000 who remain carry on despite soaring food prices,
uncertain fuel shipments and unpaid wages. They endure in the hope
that Chukotka's rich veins of gold will draw deep-pocketed foreign
investors, or simply because they lack the money to buy a ticket
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The northern territories are in terrible shape now,'' conceded
Alexander Nazarov, the governor of the Chukotka region.
</P>
<P>
   A concrete hammer and sickle still signals the approach to this
harbor city, one of the major gateways to the Russian Arctic. But a
splash of graffiti has updated the Soviet symbol: spray-painted
across are the words ``The Exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a paradox that a land of such uncanny isolation and wild
beauty could become a painful example of the follies of planning at
the Kremlin, 3,600 miles to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Before the days of Soviet power, this was a land of Chukchi
indigenous people and polar explorers, a place where winter
mornings begin under moonlit skies, the summer sun never sets and
fierce arctic cyclones erupt almost without warning.
</P>
<P>
   It was Chukotka's gold and mineral wealth, however, that
attracted the Kremlin's attention. Had the Soviet government
concentrated on the bottom line, it might have built small
settlements and flown in workers for monthlong shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, opening the northern frontier became an industry.
Political prisoners were used as pioneers in the vast region, the
closest Russian territory to Alaska. Then the Soviet government
turned the north into a test of communist commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment houses, schools, hospitals, sports complexes, stores
and hotels were built on stilts, the better to cope with the
perpetual permafrost. A Chernobyl-style nuclear power plant was
built at Bilibino, one of Chukotka's arctic cities.
</P>
<P>
   To attract workers and their families, wages were several times
higher than on the ``mainland,'' as residents here refer to Russia
below the Arctic Circle. There were free vacations and, in contrast
to the south, no delays in buying cars. Pensions, which men
generally get when they are 60 and women when they are 55, were
provided five years early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The north was one place where Soviet citizens could
legitimately receive a higher income,'' said Andrei Markov, a
Moscow-based economist with the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the north suffer as much from the shortages that
afflicted the rest of the Soviet Union. The program to ship food
and fuel to the north, which makes up almost half of Russia's vast
territory, was one of the most heavily subsidized parts of the
Soviet economy. Only agriculture and the coal industry received
more.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, the north's population had climbed to 9.7 million,
making it far more densely populated than comparable areas of
Alaska, Canada and Scandinavia. Even the population of remote
Chukotka swelled to 185,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Pevek is no longer the kind of place that attracts the
country's talent. It suffers from the same ills as much of Russia,
but the consequences are far more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Because virtually all food is imported, the price is several
times that in pricey Moscow. That puts meat and vegetables out of
reach of poorer residents, who unlike Russians in the south have no
kitchen gardens to fall back on.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of travel has turned many laborers into virtual
prisoners. The $200 for a one-way ticket to Moscow is several times
the monthly salary of many workers, assuming they receive their
pay.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has helped some residents leave, giving
priority to pensioners and veterans. Others have used their life
savings and whatever help they could marshal from relatives to buy
their way out. Pevek's population has shrunk to about 7,500 from
more than 13,000 a decade ago. Thousands more are desperate to get
away.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Maslov, the 32-year-old chief physician at the Pevek
Hospital, was among the thousands who clamored to move here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could do things that doctors on the mainland could not
afford,'' he recalled. ``My wife and I flew south to go to the
seashore each year. People had work. They had social guarantees. It
was not easy to get selected to live in the north.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Maslov is desperately trying to hang on to his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our surgeon keeps telling me he will leave if he does not get
his back wages,'' he said. ``Theoretically, I have a good job; but
it is in a city that is dying.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Selling your apartment is not an effective way to raise money.
Apartments are in such low demand that they sell for a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most I can sell my apartment for is $750,'' said Alla, a
59-year-old former geologist who runs a small market in the center
of town. ``I need at least $6,000 to buy a cheap apartment in
central Russia. There is no way to make that much money here.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the adversity, life goes on. Pevek even boasts a heated
indoor swimming pool filled with sea water, a legacy of Soviet
days.
</P>
<P>
   At Mys Shmidta, an arctic town 270 miles to the east, the
hardship is more extreme. As fuel ran out, the Russian government
sent a tanker ship and an icebreaker that fought their way through
the ice floes to Pevek. Then a convoy of trucks braved a bitter
snowstorm to haul fuel to the isolated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government sent a tanker ship and icebreaker to help them
out,'' Ms. Akulenko said. ``It would be cheaper in the long run to
evacuate them.''
</P>
<P>
   The only alternative to chronic and costly supply problems is to
help people leave the north and lure new investment to support a
smaller population. It is a daunting task, especially in a society
where labor mobility remains an alien notion.
</P>
<P>
   The government's policies have not helped. The Kremlin spends
only 0.1 percent of Russia's gross domestic product to ship food
and fuel to the north, down from an extravagant 2 percent in Soviet
times.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin is also not doing much to help people leave.
Only 10 percent of the 1.8 million who have left the region since
1989 did so with government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, many of the benefits that the Soviet
Union introduced to lure workers northward are, surprisingly, still
guaranteed by law. These must be paid by local governments and
newly privatized enterprises, though they often fail to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The increasingly false promise of high pay and generous benefits
has drawn a million new residents since 1989, keeping the
population in the north near 9 million.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the new arrivals are from the non-Russian former
Soviet republics, like Ukraine and Belarus, whose failing economies
make life in the north appear attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people want to leave,'' Markov said. ``There are hundreds
of thousands in each region and city who are waiting to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chukotka, waiting is a painful process. Not only does it have
an exceptionally severe climate, but it and the nearby regions of
Yakutia, Magadan and Kamchatka lead the nation in unpaid wages,
according to government data.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a long view, Nazarov, the governor of Chukotka is pinning
his hopes on persuading Western investors to tap his region's rich
veins of gold and mineral resources. Chukotka has recently been hit
by sagging gold prices. But the hope is that prices will recover
and that new, more efficient ventures will be started for which
workers will flow in and flow out for stints in the north. That
would minimize the cost of sustaining the population.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, Pevek's aging airport is not a hub for
mobile workers. It is the scene of a desperate protest. After
waiting three and a half years for their wages, 11 workers who
clean and service the airport buildings began a hunger strike in
late November.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of money, the workers have received small monthly
supplies of rice, peas, sugar, flour and some meat as an advance
against their pay. But after the collapse of the ruble in August,
even the rations began to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been hungry for a long time,'' said Slava Rybin, a
bearded worker who lay on a cot in a dingy dormitory near the
airport. ``The only difference is we're not working any more.''
</P>
<P>
   (Responding to the protest, the Chukotka authorities finally
gave the strikers almost half of their back pay. The workers
suspended their strike after five weeks of fasting. By then, three
of the workers had been hospitalized. Fellow workers who did not
strike also received some back pay, but not as much.)
</P>
<P>
   While Nazarov boasts about Chukotka's resources, he does not
underestimate the difficulties in developing his region. Nor does
Ms. Akulenko, whose parents moved to Chukotka decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that if we get new technology for our gold deposits,
we can be self-sustaining,'' she said, bundled up against the
bitter chill. ``But who knows if we can hang on for that long.''

 &HT;    FINAL GOVERNMENT WITNESS CALLS MICROSOFT AN ANTITRUST PREDATOR
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial queues.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Employing Microsoft's own corporate data, a
prominent economist testified Tuesday that the software giant seeks
to dominate the Internet through its Windows-based monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Franklin Fisher
argued that Microsoft Corp. has crossed the line that defines
illegal actions in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher laid out his argument, based partly on his examination of
subpoenaed Microsoft files, in 110 pages of testimony released five
hours before he took the stand as the government's final witness in
the landmark antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher contended that if Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser
and its Windows operating system are in fact superior products,
then competitive forces will lead computer makers, Internet service
providers and customers to select them without any need for
Microsoft to ``artificially influence those choices.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he wrote, ``Microsoft has engaged in anti-competitive
conduct that has no economic justification but for its effect of
restricting competition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These actions,'' he added, will allow Microsoft to protect its
monopoly in the market for operating systems and to establish a
monopoly in the market for browsers'' unless the courts step in and
reverse the current tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft's conduct is not checked,'' Fisher concluded,
``those that do not use a Microsoft standard will never prosper,
and a critical opportunity for innovation that reduces or
eliminates Microsoft's power will be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dry academic tones, the white-haired veteran economist
struck to the heart of the case that the Justice Department and the
19 co-plaintiff states have been making before U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson since mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   His comments were aimed at lending intellectual rigor to a case
that has thus far largely relied on largely anecdotal testimony
from Microsoft's main business rivals and the government's own view
of the economic forces at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this case is about is whether browser competition
presents a threat to Microsoft's operating system monopoly,''
Fisher said on the witness stand when he was repeatedly challenged
for his methodology under cross-examination by Microsoft lawyer
Michael Lacovara.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson watched impatiently from the judicial dais, Lacovara
portrayed Fisher as an ivory-tower economist _ a witness out of
touch with a fast-paced software industry that has seen Microsoft's
main rival in the browser wars, Netscape Communications Corp., move
to merge with America Online Inc. since the landmark trial began.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara, however, has so far failed to shake Fisher's central
finding, which economists call ``network effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Fisher summed up that process in his direct
testimony:
</P>
<P>
   ``If software developers believe that Microsoft will engage in
anti-competitive acts to impede any innovation that threatens its
monopoly, they will have substantially reduced incentives to
innovate in competition with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, the range of software products from which
consumers can choose will be limited, ultimately further reducing
consumer welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is likely to begin presenting its defense early next
week by calling economist Richard Schmalansee, interim dean of the
Sloan School of Management at the MIT, to the stand. Schmalansee
was once Fisher's graduate student.
</P>
<P>
   The company also plans to bring nine of its key executives from
its Redmond, Wash., headquarters to testify in the federal
courthouse here.

FORMER ABL PLAYERS SEEK EUROPEAN JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two weeks after the American Basketball League pulled the plug,
the players are still trying to pick up the pieces. Some hope to
sign with a team in Europe, where the season is already in
progress; some are waiting to see if a WNBA team approaches them;
some are, well, just waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad that the league folded because it rekindled the
passion I had when I played as a kid,'' said Dale Hodges, a
6-foot-1-inch forward who was the New England Blizzard's top
rebounder last season. ``Although it didn't work out, it was an
awesome experience. I'm really glad they gave us the opportunity to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, who still works out at the YMCA every day, hopes to land
a spot on a European team. After graduating from St. Joseph's in
1988, she played overseas for five years, with teams in Italy,
France, and Japan. She then worked as an assistant coach at Drexel
and the University of Massachusetts before joining the ABL in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So she's taking the unexpected layoff in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just came out of college, I might be devastated, but I
believe if I just keep working hard, I'll get an opportunity,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges had some idea last summer that the league was on shaky
footing. And to the disappointment of everybody in the ABL, the
lack of competition created by the NBA lockout did nothing to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that Lifetime (cable channel) carried college games
over us, I knew we were in trouble,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Levy, Hodges's agent, said he's trying to work out deals
for her and fellow clients Sheri Sam (San Jose Lasers) and Vicki
Hall (Nashville Noise) to sign with European teams.
</P>
<P>
   But their release from the ABL is not official yet, since the
league is in the middle of bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the league collapsed, and these players have to get a new
job, but they not might not get it if they don't have their
freedom,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges, like her Blizzard teammates, said that if she has any
sadness, it's for leaving the diehard fans of Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so fanatical,'' she said. ``I had never experienced
playing in front of so many people like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for Jennifer Rizzotti, who has been playing in Connecticut
since she was a sophomore in high school, then with UConn and the
Blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   At the farewell rally the team held Saturday at the Hartford
Civic Center, Rizzotti looked out at the crowd of more than 1,000
and said, ``No matter where I go or where I play, this will always
be my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti, like teammate Kara Wolters, will likely hook up with a
WNBA team whenever the league starts talking. But those
conversations, like the ones with European teams, are tied up
because of the ABL's bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters said she's recovering from walking pneumonia, ``so I'm
just trying to get healthy and hopefully get to play in the WNBA.''
She is still working for the NBC affiliate in Hartford, where her
Blizzard reports have been replaced by college basketball updates.
</P>
<P>
   Wolters bought a townhouse in Manchester, Conn., shortly before
the Blizzard folded but said she's trying to keep that in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, maybe Drew Bledsoe will buy it,'' she said, referring to
the Patriots' planned move from Foxborough to Hartford.

JOPS PAINTS ROSY PICTURE WITH NEW PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Once-moribund Apple Computer Inc. is on a roll,
and cofounder and interim chief executive Steve Jobs is betting a
slew of new products announced Tuesday will keep the momentum
going.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the reaction of thousands of visitors to the
MacWorld trade show Tuesday, Jobs may well be right. The crowd
hailed a series of product announcements, including powerful new
Macintosh computers for professional users, new server software for
running networks of Macintosh computers in businesses and schools,
and a more muscular, less-expensive version of the popular iMac
home computer.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac will now be available in four additional colors _
blueberry, grape, tangerine, and strawberry _ besides the original
blue-green and white.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beautiful,'' said Jobs, ``and we hope everybody will
want to own all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few people have already snapped up the iMac _ 800,000
since the product was introduced in August, Jobs said. More
impressive was Jobs's statement that 45 percent of those units were
sold to people who had never before owned a Macintosh. That means
the iMac is achieving its most vital objective _ expanding the user
base for Macintosh hardware and software. Jobs also stated that
Apple would announce its fifth straight quarterly profit when
financial data is released next week.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs is regarded as the master showman of the computer industry,
and his presentation measured up to his reputation. But there was
substance beneath the glamour. For example, the new Power Mac G3
professional machines will feature PowerPC processor chips ranging
in speed from 300 to 400 megahertz, along with 16 megabytes of
memory devoted solely to displaying graphic images, and a new
128-bit graphics chip from ATI Technologies Inc. that is presently
available only in the new Macs.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Jobs promised, is graphics performance that can't be
matched by PCs using Intel Pentium II processors and running
Microsoft's Windows 98 or Windows 2000 operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new Power Macs will be capable of accepting up to a gigabyte
of memory chips and up to 100 gigabytes of hard drive capacity.
They will include FireWire, a high-speed serial port system for
connecting external devices like disk drives or other computers.
FireWire allows much faster data transfers than existing
technologies like SCSI or Universal Serial Bus.
</P>
<P>
   The new Power Macs will range in price from $1,599 to $2,999,
not including monitor. By contrast, a Compaq Computer Corp. machine
with a 450-megahertz Pentium II processor, including 17-inch
monitor and a bundle of Microsoft software, sells for $1,999. But
the Compaq machine offers less video memory, a slower graphics
chip, and no support for FireWire.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analyst Tim Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies
in Campbell, Calif., said that with their advanced features the new
Power Macs are ``more than price-competitive with anything in the
PC market.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also demonstrated a new version of the Mac operating system
for use on powerful network server computers. Mac OS X Server is
modeled after the advanced Unix operating system, widely used in
corporate computer networks and on the Internet. It will include
support for the BSD version of Unix, as well as a Mac version of
Apache, the world's most popular software for distributing Web
pages on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other network operating systems, like Microsoft's Windows 2000,
are priced according to the number of desktop ``client'' computers
attached to the network. But Jobs said that when OS X Server goes
on sale in February, it will cost $995, no matter how many
computers are on the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fantastic deal,'' said Louis Mazzucchelli, industry
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison &AMP; Co. ``Anybody who's shopping
for an operating system that's not wed to Microsoft will have to
look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also boasted that since the release of the iMac, software
companies are once again eager to write programs for the Mac. He
said that since May, developers have pledged to release more than
1,300 new or renewed software titles for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most aggressive promoters of Mac software is Microsoft
Corp., Apple's traditional rival but also the biggest maker of
software for the Mac. Microsoft demonstrated a new version of its
Internet Explorer Web browser, with features that work only on
Macs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to pioneering features and innovations first
for the Macintosh,'' said Benjamin Waldman, who oversees
Microsoft's development of Mac software.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Microsoft launched Mactopia, a Web site devoted
entirely to information about Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of popular computer games for the Mac has long been a
sore point. But Jobs vowed: ``We are totally committed to making
the Macintosh the greatest gaming platform in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   John Carmack, president of ID Software Inc., vowed future Mac
versions of the company's popular Quake game series. And software
maker Connectix Corp. announced a $50 program that would allow Macs
to run games written for the Sony Playstation game console.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Jobs's speech, rumors abounded that he would announce
major price cuts on the iMac, to perhaps below $1,000. Instead,
Jobs said the iMac would decline in price from $1,299 to $1,199.
The new iMacs would get a faster version of the PowerPC processor,
a bigger hard drive, and the palette of new colors.
</P>
<P>
   Apple will probably sell at least one of the grape-colored iMacs
to the comedian Sinbad, a self-described ``Mac freak,'' who came to
MacWorld in search of new gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter had just said, `Daddy, if they had a purple one,
that'd be cool,'' Sinbad said. He also wanted to check out Mac OS
Server for use in the computer centers Sinbad runs in his native
Michigan to provide computer training to children.

U.S. JETS FIRE MISSILES AT IRAQI PLANES OVER NO-FLY ZONE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four U.S. jets fired missiles at Iraqi warplanes
Tuesday in the southern no-fly zone, marking the third time in
eight days that American pilots have retaliated against Saddam
Hussein's forces, said a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. F-15 and F-14 jets missed their targets in the first
air-to-air conflict between the countries since 1982, added,
spokesman Kenneth Bacon. None of the approximately 15 Iraqi jets in
the area shot at the U.S. planes, choosing instead to ``beat a
hasty retreat'' when the missiles were fired, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One Iraqi plane might have crashed after running out of fuel
following the incident, Bacon added.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton declined to comment on the clash, which
followed two conflicts with Iraq last week. In those incidents,
U.S. jets fired missiles at Iraqi military installations in
retaliation for surface-to-air missile attacks on American and
British warplanes in the no-fly zones over northern and southern
Iraq, the Pentagon reported.
</P>
<P>
   After the first incident last week, Clinton warned Saddam that
U.S. pilots would ``protect themselves if they're threatened or
attacked.'' After Tuesday's confrontation in the air, White House
spokesman David Leavy reiterated the president's warning, saying
Iraqi pilots enter the no-fly zones ``at their own peril.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddam on Tuesday gave a televised speech in which he urged
people in Arab countries to overthrow their governments if the
leaders fail to support him in his battle against the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But State Department spokesman James Rubin discounted Saddam's
statement as the plea of a desperate dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqi leader has given a speech which we think is a not
surprising diatribe on television that indicated his isolated
position in the Arab world,'' Rubin said. ``The intemperate,
unmeasured and desperate tone I think speaks very clearly to the
isolation that Iraq faces in the Arab world and the isolation that
Saddam Hussein faces around the entire world.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident Tuesday over southern Iraq occurred in two stages,
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The first began at about 10:15 a.m. Iraq time, 2:15 a.m. EST,
when two Air Force F-15 jets were illuminated by radar from Iraqi
warplanes southwest of Baghdad. The U.S. jets fired four missiles
at the Iraqi planes but missed, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 minutes later, Iraqi MiG fighter planes ``engaged'' two
Navy F-14 jets southeast of Baghdad. The U.S. pilots fired two
missiles but also missed, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The F-15s returned safely to an undisclosed base, and the F-14s
landed safely on the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Distance between the U.S. and Iraqi aircraft might have been a
factor in the American missiles failing to hit their targets, Bacon
said. ``It looks easy in the movies, but it's not easy in real
life,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi planes have often flown into the forbidden zones in
violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions barring such flights
after the 1991 Persian Gulf War. Most of those violations involved
Iraqi planes simply darting into the areas and leaving just as
quickly, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, Saddam's forces have become more daring,
flying in the forbidden skies for longer periods and attracting the
attention of U.S. forces. The Iraqi dictator's provocative actions
could indicate he is ``frustrated or maybe even desperate''
following a massive four-day bombing campaign the United States and
Britain conducted against Iraq's warmaking capability last month,
Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam was disappointed when Arab countries did not leap to his
defense, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's incident followed a Dec. 23 clash in which U.S. jets
fired on defense installations after British warplanes were
attacked by missiles in the southern no-fly zone. In the Dec. 21
conflict, U.S. jets responded to a similar Iraqi surface-to-air
missile attack in the northern no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who is considering a presidential
run, called it ``unconscionable'' that the Clinton administration
continues to put American pilots ``in harm's way'' when it has the
military capability to destroy Iraq's airfields. McCain, a former
Navy fighter pilot, pressed Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, on whether the U.S. military will take
stronger steps to prevent Iraq from violating the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton, appearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
responded that the military has ``these types of plans on the
shelf,'' but has so far opted to continue simply patrolling the
no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
   The three recent clashes followed the joint U.S.-British attack
against Saddam's suspected weapons sites Dec. 16-19. The United
States and Britain launched the assault, code-named Operation
Desert Fox, after U.N. weapons inspectors reported that Saddam had
denied them access to sites where he was suspected of creating
chemical weapons and constructing other weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam has refused to let the inspectors back into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The no-fly zones extend south from the 33rd parallel, just below
Baghdad, and north from the 36th parallel. The zones, which the
U.S. and British military have enforced as a condition of Iraq's
surrender in the Gulf War, are designed to prevent Iraqi aircraft
from attacking Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam refuses to recognize the no-fly zones, regarding them as
an illegal encroachment on Iraq's sovereignty
</P>
<P>
   During the prior air-to-air conflict, a U.S. F-16 shot down an
Iraqi MiG-25 on Dec. 27, 1992, Bacon said.

CLINTON TO SEEK MORE BASE CLOSINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will ask Congress for two
additional rounds of base closings beginning in 2001 to help pay
for modernizing the nation's military, senior defense officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bell, the senior director of defense programs at the
White House's National Security Council, disclosed that the request
would be included within the fiscal 2000 budget proposal, which
will be sent to Congress in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that we need authority from Congress
... to conduct two additional base-closing rounds,'' Bell said at a
news conference here. ``It's going to be incumbent on Congress to
cooperate and give us that authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Without explicit authority from Congress, the Pentagon cannot
close bases of substantial size.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Army Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the
joint chiefs, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee
Tuesday about the need to close more military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Congress should approve additional base-closing
rounds, Shelton said, ``Definitely, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting rid of the excesses that we have now ... would be very
beneficial,'' Shelton said, adding that the Pentagon could save $15
billion over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Clinton announced that his 2000 budget will
include a $12 billion defense spending increase.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that the base-closing proposal stands a good chance of
passage this year because Republicans are also seeking increased
defense spending and closures would provide additional funds.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials are seeking the base closings in order to cut
costs, bankroll new weapons systems and ensure troops remain well
trained. They argue that while troop levels have been reduced
dramatically since the end of the Cold War, military bases have not
and should be pared by at least 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, the government has closed or announced
plans to close 97 bases and realign activities at several hundred
smaller facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Those closures and realignments were made by the independent
Base Realignment and Closure commission, or BRAC, that convened
four times _ in 1988, 1991, 1993 and 1995. After the 1995 round,
the commission was disbanded, even though military officials said
too many bases still remained open.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1997, the Clinton administration unsuccessfully
attempted to close more bases. But congressional opposition was
wide and deep and included members of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concerns over regional economic hardship when a
base is shuttered, opponents have complained that the base-closing
process, which had been fairly devoid of politics, was tainted by
Clinton. In the run up to the 1996 presidential election, Clinton
reversed the commission and ordered that Air Force depots in Texas
and California slated for closure be privatized to save jobs. The
two states contain have the most electoral votes.

A NONTRADITIONALIST WHO ALTERED JAPANESE TRADITION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   Paula Deitz is editor of The Hudson Review.  
 (af)  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While most of the centuries-old Buddhist temples
and gardens in Kyoto, Japan, were designed for quiet contemplation,
one, called Koetsu-ji, was a bustling center of creative activity.
Its rustic teahouses and earthen huts nestled along woodland paths
on the outskirts of the city formed a village where artists and
craftsmen in the 17th century lived under the leadership of Hon'ami
Koetsu.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture where tradition ruled more often than not, Koetsu
infused the arts of calligraphy, ceramics and lacquer ware with a
freedom and originality of technique and design that still appears
fresh and spontaneous today.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, the collector Charles Lang Freer recognized
Koetsu's accomplishments, particularly in calligraphy and ceramics,
and acquired several of his important works early in this century.
These formed ``the esthetic center of Freer's interest in Japanese
art,'' said Ann Yonemura, an associate curator at the Freer Gallery
of Art, who was an organizer of the current exhibition, ``Japanese
Art in the Age of Koetsu.'' It provides the perfect complement to a
larger show at the National Gallery entitled ``Edo: Art in Japan
1615-1868.''
</P>
<P>
   The 44 works on view at the Freer, including paintings,
calligraphy, ceramic vessels and lacquer ware, demonstrate Koetsu's
influence at a high artistic moment when the traditional Heian
culture in Kyoto was transformed into a looser decorative style. In
a sense, this breathtaking simplicity is what appears most Japanese
about Japanese art.
</P>
<P>
   Koestu's work was rediscovered later by his great grandnephew,
the artist Ogata Korin, who made it the basis of a movement called
Rimpa (``rin-school'' from Korin's name). And, as is evident in the
Edo show, Rimpa art threads its way through several centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Koetsu was in his late 50s when he moved in 1615 to Takagamine,
the land outside Kyoto granted him by the shogun. Like others in
his family, he had been a connoisseur of swords and an expert in
polishing them, a time-honored profession that also put him in
touch with powerful patrons. But mainly he gained stature as a
calligrapher, collaborating with Tawaraya Sotatsu, an artist whom
he first engaged to restore Buddhist scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great masterpieces is certainly their 30-foot-long
hand scroll of poetry from the anthology ``Kokinshu,'' a collection
of poems completed around 920.
</P>
<P>
   Sotatsu handprinted the designs with wood blocks. In the section
on view, using a carved block of a single crane, he printed a
series of cranes taking flight. By alternating between silver and
gold, each crane takes on a different shading from the heavily
applied ink. In a preceding vignette, a grove of overlapping bamboo
trees is printed one section at a time from a long vertical block.
</P>
<P>
   Overlaying this design is Koetsu's fluid and elongated
calligraphy in a combination of Chinese and Japanese characters
that stream across the scroll. Just as the printed designs vary in
tone, the brushwork begins with dense black, freshly inked strokes
and finishes in a pale watery gray, before the brush is dipped
again. Sometimes the characters merge with the texture of bamboo or
they drift across the voids between design motifs, creating their
own rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   These classical poems were frequently the subjects of scrolls by
other calligraphers, and Ms. Yonemura compares the different
versions to musical performances of the same score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual differences in ink tone and scale of characters
created a variety of dynamic relationships like those in music,''
she said. Here the crescendo comes as the vertical calligraphic
lines, read from right to left, converge with the cranes rising up
in flight from left to right. Seen through a silvery haze of mica
specks in the paper, the poem reads: ``I must go out to/her as the
moon leaves its home/behind rugged mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   In collaborating on a six-panel folding screen, which is on
display at the Freer, Koestu selected 36 poems from a second major
source, the ``Shin kokinshu,'' an anthology commissioned by a
13th-century emperor. The screen itself represented a departure in
technique, with gold leaf crumbled and applied in a crusty fashion
rather than stroked on with a brush. At one end, brushed horizontal
lines suggest split bamboo window blinds, complete with painted
tassels and glimpses into a peony garden.
</P>
<P>
   The poems, written on squares of paper (shikishi) and pasted on
to the panels, are scattered across the screen. Again, the visual
rhythm is enhanced by the counterpoint between cursive Japanese
script and bold Chinese characters against a pattern of gold
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Koetsu was known as one of the ``Three Brushes'' of the era,
along with Konoe Nobutada and Shokado Shojo, whose calligraphic
work is also on view along side other objects that summarize the
arts in Kyoto at that time. And throughout the Edo show, there is
evidence of Koestu's powerful influence: the scattered writing
designs of characters tie-dyed and embroidered on a kosode, a
kimonolike garment, or in a scroll by Ogata Kenzan depicting a
bridge over a pool of iris with a poem recalling an episode from
the classic ``Tales of Ise.''
</P>
<P>
   Koetsu's innovative spirit is also present in the ceramic
tradition of tea bowls at the Freer, including one in black raku.
``Each bowl was treated like an individual sculpture,'' explained
Louise Cort, the museuem's curator of ceramics, ``and Koetsu
allowed the professionals in the Kyoto raku workshop to solve the
technical problems while he addressed the esthetic ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The blunt-cut rim and uneven black glaze that was purposely
scraped away on his bowl made it a treasure to be copied throughout
the centuries. The long line of copies on display in both black and
red raku is symbolic of the artistic dynasty of which he was the
originator.
</P>
<P>
   The art historian Elise Grilli called Koetsu the ``Leonardo de
Vinci of Japan, the versatile genius in whom all the arts and
refinements of his day seemed to find their confluence.''

INCUBUS IS COMING HOME _ SORT OF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Calabasas fusion-rockers Incubus got their first
Sunset Strip gig thanks to a lost $100 bill.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the band's earliest party gigs in the early '90s,
Incubus was playing all-ages clubs in the Valley when guitarist
Mike Einziger found the dough on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a time when you had to buy tickets and sell them in
order to play the Strip,'' he explained. ``That day I went to the
Roxy, bought the tickets, booked the show, and then we sold all of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's tireless self-promotion expanded its audience from
high school friends to fans throughout Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, the five-member Incubus appears at the Forum along with
Pantera, Glendale's System of a Down and Black Sabbath with Ozzy
Osbourne. The band's debut, ``S.C.I.E.N.C.E.'' (Immortal/Epic),
recently was released to positive reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is special 'cause it's our home,'' Einziger said. ``At
these big venues, though, it's like looking at a faceless entity.
It's not very personal. Generally speaking, when we play venues
that size, the audience isn't always there to see us. But it's an
interesting experience. It can be weird, but it has its moments.''
</P>
<P>
   The guitarist admitted that hailing from Calabasas can work both
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this small town a lot of people haven't even heard of,''
he said. ``But if you're a rock band that has some talent and
you're close to the center of the music industry _ which is Los
Angeles _ you're automatically in a position where you'll be more
easily heard. But it also puts you with thousands of struggling
bands all trying to get somewhere. It's not the healthiest
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Incubus expanded its fan base to Europe when a 1997 trek opening
for label mates Korn was capped by a gig for more than 5,000 fans
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might seem like our sort of music is the `in' thing now,''
Einziger, 22, said. ``But bands like Primus and Faith No More were
playing a fusion of different styles years ago. We've been doing it
for eight years and obviously we've gotten better at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, everyone wanted to be punk or ska, but that's not
what we do. We just stuck with what we enjoy doing.'' &QL;

ANNIE ROLE SUITS 10-YEAR-OLD JUST FINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NANCY HEWITT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sitting in an overstuffed chair at the Pantages
Theatre, Brittny Kissinger looks like any other 10-year-old. But
that's where the resemblance ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to be an actress,'' she says, after a short
pause. ``I saw `Annie' the movie when I was 3,'' she continues. ``I
loved `Annie.' I always knew I would be `Annie' one day. My dream
has come true.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, being only 10, Kissinger is likely to have a lot more
dreams, but right now she's living out the fantasy of many actors _
starring in a big Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger has the title role in the 20th anniversary production
of ``Annie,'' the musical tale of Little Orphan Annie's adoption by
rich Daddy Warbucks. It opened Tuesday at the Pantages for a
two-week engagement. Fresh from Broadway, the show features Conrad
John Schuck as Daddy Warbucks and Sally Struthers as Miss Halligan.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger began her acting career at the tender age of 5,
appearing in Schenectady, N.Y., community theater productions of
``Annie Warbucks,'' where she played the lead in the sequel to
``Annie,'' then as Tootie in ``Meet Me in St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   And she annually appears in the theater's production of ``The
Nutcracker.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Little Orphan Annie has always been a favorite of
Kissinger. And she especially enjoys the musical numbers. Her
favorite songs: `` `Maybe' I like. It's soft. It's a lullaby,'' she
says dreamily. ``And `Tomorrow.' `Tomorrow' is a very optimistic
song.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course there's the dancing. ``I started dancing at age
2. I really like modern dancing, tap, modern jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kissinger was cast in ``Annie,'' it was in the smaller role
of July, one of the orphans. But taking on the lead role was no big
deal to the young performer. ``We had speakers in the dressing
room, so we heard the whole show. Learning the part wasn't that
hard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still hard work that keeps her from friends and school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind the school part,'' she says with an impish grin.
``I'm not often in regular school. (Being on the road so much) I
can work at my own speed. It's easier. In real school if you have a
question, you have to wait for the teacher to talk to other
students before getting to you.''

   But it's nice being in a class of nine kids, she says.

   But Kissinger takes preparing for a part in stride. ``It's my
job,'' she says.

   She also has other career aspirations. ``When I was 2, I wanted
to be a rodeo girl,'' she says. ``Then at 4, I wanted to be a
policewoman and a teacher. But I mostly want to be an actress and a
lawyer and a psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, does she have a lot of schooling ahead of her.
</P>
<P>
   When not on stage or studying, Kissinger finds time to indulge
in another favorite activity: reading. ``I like to read,'' she
says. ``I like Roald Dahl, and I like scary books.''
</P>
<P>
   She spends time with friends at home in Ballston Spa, N.Y.,
whenever she can and admits that she has a good relationship with
younger sister Chelsea, 8. ``But we're not best friends,'' she says
emphatically. ``When I have a friend over, she wants to have a
friend over so she won't be lonesome.'' &QL;

   Apple issues fashion, price and

<P>
   power challenges

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Steve Jobs made a fashion statement at Macworld
Expo
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, introducing four new colors of iMac computers to
jointhe original teal.
</P>
<P>
   The bright fruit colors splash Apple Computer Corp.'s mark in a
computer world where beige is as dominant as Intel Corp. processors
and Microsoft Corp. software.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also issued a challenge of power and price to the Wintel
crowd in unveiling a speedy Power Macintosh for professionals. The
PowerMac G3 starts at $1,599 and tops out at $2,999, signalling
Apple's retreat from premium pricing for high-end computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will jump on the colors, but the most important thing
today was the G3 pricing,'' said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative
Strategies Inc. in Campbell, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs' keynote speech is usually the highlight of the Macworld
Expo, the biggest gathering of Apple users, vendors and users.
</P>
<P>
   There were no blockbusters from Apple's interim CEO on Tuesday
from
</P>
<P>
   the stage of the Moscone Center, but the speech stood out,
according to some analysts, for what he didn't have to say. He no
longer has to reassure the Mac community that Apple's future is
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant news at this show is what was not talked
</P>
<P>
   about,'' said Pieter Hartsook, a former Apple vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burning question from a year ago, was 'when is Apple going
to go out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the iMac, a profitable year and recovered stock
</P>
<P>
   price have answered most of the questions hanging over the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs only reference to the company's financial situation came at
the start of his talk when he said the company would announce its
fifth-straight profitable quarter
</P>
<P>
   on Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Apple earned $300 million in latest fiscal year, compared to a
loss of more than $1 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Apple shares jumped $2.06 1/4 to $43.31 1/4 in Nasdaq trading
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The new PowerMacs should help reinforce Apple's regained
strength. At the high-end, the PowerMac will feature up to a
400-megahertz G3 microprocessor from the PowerPC family and a
200-megahertz level-two cache. Accessing level-two, or backside
cache at 200 megahertz provides high-speed access to frequently
used data.
</P>
<P>
   The machines also come with 128 megabytes of memory and 9
gigabytes of hard drive storage, which can be expanded to three
drives totaling more than 100 gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering iMacs in blueberry, tangerine,
strawberry, grape and lime colors, Apple upgraded the iMac to a
266-megahertz chip from 233 megahertz. The $1,199 price tag is
lower than the original iMac, which Jobs said sold 800,000 units
since its August 1998 introduction.
</P>
<P>
   They may have trouble competing with IBM compatible PCs running
a
</P>
<P>
   333-megahertz AMD processor, which will sell for about $899 when
they
</P>
<P>
   are introduced next month, Bajarin said.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's ``price at the low end is still a bit pricey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also had good news for game enthusiasts, who have had to
wait months in some cases for popular games to be released for the
Mac platform. A $49 program from
</P>
<P>
   Connectix called Virtual Playstation allows G3 owners to play
hundreds of games for Sony Corp. Playstation.

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
announces that Chief Justice William Rehnquist will open the
impeachment trial of President Clinton on Thursday. But the Senate
is still negotiating over the terms of a trial. By Alison Mitchell.

   IRAQ-ARABS (Cairo, Egypt) _ A bitter war of words between Iraq
and its Arab neighbors has followed last month's American-led
bombings, leaving Iraq more isolated than at any time since the
Persian Gulf war. As Iraq has accused the Arabs of failing to stand
by its side, Egypt has responded with particular scorn, all but
calling for the ouster of the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. The
confrontation became even more intense Tuesday as Saddam called on
Arabs to rise up against leaders who have not given his regime
their full support. By Douglas Jehl. 1,200 words.
</P>
<P>
   With: IRAQ-U.S. (Washington) _ In the first air duel between
American and Iraqi jet fighters in more than six years, U.S.
warplanes fired missiles at Iraqi jets over southern Iraq on
Tuesday, and one of the Iraqi planes was reported to have crashed
after it ran out of fuel. By Philip Shenon.

   RUSSIA-NORTH (Pevek, Russia) _ Here in Russia's most northern
city, a winter's day is two hours of cheerless gray, the
temperature plunges to 40 below, and delays in getting wages are
measured in years. It is the edge of the world and the end of the
line for thousands of Russians drawn here during Soviet times by
promises of high pay and patriotic appeals. The colonization of the
north was one of the Soviet Union's most audacious ventures. Now
the dismal economics of the north has finally caught up with these
far-flung regions. Russia's new market economy cannot bear the
colossal cost of feeding and heating the northern outposts. By
Michael R. Gordon. 2,000 words.

<P>
   NY-GUN-SUIT (New York) _ On the night of July 27, 1993,
17-year-old Njuzi Ray was fatally shot in a dispute on a Brooklyn
street. A suspect was later acquitted, and nobody else has been
arrested for the killing. Normally a case like this would have long
disappeared from public awareness. But the slaying in
Bedford-Stuyvesant is once more in the spotlight, as the subject of
a potentially precedent-setting lawsuit against the gun industry
that went to trial on Monday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. By
Joseph P. Fried.

<P>
   CONGO-MASSACRE (Nairobi, Kenya) _ About 500 people, many of them
women and children, were massacred over three days in the eastern
Congo during the New Year holiday, a Catholic news agency reported
Tuesday. By Ian Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-FARMERS (Greensboro, Ga.) _ While pleased by the public
acknowledgment of their plight, many black farmers say that the
settlement will do little to reverse the stunning decline of
independent black farming, a livelihood that has carried a special
nobility ever since freed slaves were granted 40 acres and a mule.
The relief, which calls for farmers who claim they were harmed by
discrimination to receive $50,000 tax-free and to be forgiven their
federal debt, is too little, they said, and it has come too late.
And it does not relieve them of the burden of commercial debt they
took in when they could not get government money. By Kevin Sack.

2 SENATORS USE THEIR PRESTIGE TO PUSH FOR BRIEF TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn., Wash)  (See also IMPEACH-NYT) 
(bl) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., has often called
himself a ``passionate moderate'' and, as his state's attorney
general a quarter century ago, was one of the first Republican
officials nationally to call for the resignation of President
Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., has frequently joined forces
with conservatives on social and cultural issues and, just four
months ago, delivered perhaps the most sternly worded condemnation
of President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky that any
high-ranking Democrat has ever publicly uttered.
</P>
<P>
   That these two men, technically on opposite sides of a yawning
partisan gulf in Congress, have their names attached to a
bipartisan plan for an abbreviated Senate trial of Clinton is
testimony in part to the long friendship they have shared.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects their reputations as sometimes maverick
thinkers with independent streaks, as politicians who pride
themselves on not letting anything as trifling as party fidelity
get in the way of what they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   That is what made both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and
Minority Leader Tom Daschle willing to listen to and air their plan
_ which is becoming more of a springboard for discussion than a
blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Daschle and Lott felt that they were effective volunteers
for something like this,'' said a Republican official involved in
trial negotiations. ``They gave the idea a certain gravitas.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal crafted by Gorton and Lieberman called for a sort
of preliminary trial, beginning next week, with two days of opening
presentations by both the House-appointed prosecutors and the
president's legal team, then a day of questioning by the senators.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, senators would debate whether the charges against
Clinton warranted a full-blown trial. If less than two-thirds of
senators voted to proceed with a trial, the Senate might forgo such
a cumbersome proceeding and take up a discussion of censuring the
president instead.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton and Lieberman, both distressed over the florid enmity
between political parties that came to dominate the House debate
over impeachment, began discussing in early December some kind of
bipartisan resolution concerning a Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he had been thinking about contacting Lieberman when
Lieberman called him. ``I give him more credit than I give
myself,'' Gorton said in a telephone interview. ``We exchanged a
number of phone calls and three or four written proposals and we
got to this point just before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Republicans, Gorton's name lent some cache to a bipartisan
proposal not only because he was an independent thinker but because
he was not known for chasing publicity or trying to nudge toward
the center of every fray. Additionally, Gorton, 70, a 16-year
veteran of the Senate, is highly regarded by Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the E.F. Hutton of the Republican conference,'' said
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., referring to the brokerage firm whose
advice, in a well-known television commercial, rendered listeners
rapt.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lieberman, 56, who has served in the Senate since
1989, is in many ways a perfect spokesman for Democrats seeking an
alternative to a prolonged Senate trial. His September denunciation
of Clinton's behavior cast him as someone who is not simply doing
Clinton's bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laid the foundation then for being part of the ultimate
resolution by establishing his credibility,'' said Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J. ``It's a very interesting dynamic.''

`MAN ON THE MOON' FILM OF COMIC ANDY KAUFMAN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One chilly November night, a crowd of about 250
people who looked as if they had been cryogenically frozen 20 years
ago and then unpacked for the occasion, poured into the lunchroom
of Midtown West elementary school on West 48th Street in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Neatly arrayed on the lunch tables in front of them were
hundreds of half-pint milk cartons and chocolate-chip cookies on
bright red paper napkins. There to greet them was a man wearing a
wool stadium coat, his shoulders hunched forward and eyes ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   They cheered. He beamed. And then, as the crowd surged toward
him, the man broke into a spasmodic victory dance, his knees
pumping and his arms thrust out awkwardly like a pelican learning
to disco.
</P>
<P>
   And then something strange happened. The director Milos Forman
stopped the action with a delighted, ``Perfect, Perfect,'' and the
crowd reverted to unfashionably dressed extras recreating one of
the routinely bizarre moments in the career of the performer Andy
Kaufman, his Carnegie Hall Concert April 26, 1979, when he took
everyone in his entire audience of 2,800 people who chose to come
along in rented buses for milk and cookies at a nearby school when
the show ended.
</P>
<P>
   But though the filming stopped, the man in the stadium coat
seemed not to have noticed. He kept the same hunched-over look, the
same expression of benign, bug-eyed ebullience that Kaufman
displayed at moments of particular delight in a career that ended
in 1984 when he died of cancer at the age of 35. The filming had
stopped. But Jim Carrey was still Andy Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   That sense of murky, multiple realities apparently never wavered
during the three months that Carrey recreated the brief, strange
life of Kaufman for the film ``Man on the Moon,'' which is being
directed by Forman and is scheduled for release sometime next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Kaufman's life played out like a dada comic's vision as
scripted by M.C. Escher, of illusions within deceits and characters
willfully blurring the lines between what was real and what was
performance. And for the three months of filming, Carrey did the
same thing, becoming for weeks Kaufman's foul-smelling,
foul-mouthed, lounge lizard, Tony Clifton; taunting Kaufman's
real-life wrestling nemesis, Jerry Lawler into belting him in the
face on the stage of the David Letterman show much the way he
slugged Kaufman, and capturing Kaufman so completely that those who
knew him were spooked by the process.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as different as they are, Carrey's physical comic style
and gift for manic mimicry make him an intriguing choice to play
Kaufman. When he speaks of his admiration for Kaufman, it sounds
like he is also talking about what he tries to do with his own
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important for me to do justice to him,'' Carrey
said in a phone interview after the shooting ended. ``He was on
such another level. He had a pure need to create. He was like
Geppetto. He walked into a room and didn't see people who would
like him or not like him, hurt him or help him. He saw the world as
his own little puppet show.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the film begins with a moment that could be a prequel
to Carrey's performance last year in ``The Truman Show,'' about a
man whose whole life is a television show. ``Man on the Moon''
begins with a Trumanesque moment from Kaufman's childhood _ Andy
performing in the basement of his house to imaginary cameras in the
walls allegedly broadcasting his antics nationwide on his own
television network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim called me about coming over to see the audition tape he
made,'' said Bob Zmuda, Kaufman's co-writer and co-conspirator. ``I
didn't know him well, and I was thinking, `What do I say if it's
awful?'' I was thinking of lines like, `Wow, that's something,'
just in case. And when I saw it, I broke down and cried. He got him
so right, it was scary. I'm not saying I believe this kind of
stuff, but there were people who felt he was channeling Andy. To
this day, there are things he did, that I don't know how he could
have known about.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman, whose public career largely spanned his appearance on
the first broadcast of ``Saturday Night Live,'' on Oct. 11, 1975,
until his death, seems an unlikely figure to be memorialized in a
Hollywood extravaganza. The film's title comes from the R.E.M.
song, ``Man on the Moon,'' that Michael Stipe wrote about Kaufman.
Courtney Love plays Kaufman's girlfriend, Lynne Margulies; Paul
Giamatti portrays Zmuda, and Danny DeVito, who co-produced the
movie, is Kaufman's manager, George Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   The comic actor perhaps is best remembered for his performance
as Latka Gravas, the sweetly muddled immigrant on the television
show ``Taxi,'' an appealing but hardly epic role. Those old enough
to remember his performances from the 1970s and 1980s, mostly
remember stray snippets about his career _ that he was badly
injured in a match with a professional wrestler, that he wrestled
women, that he could switch on a dime from Latka's befuddled
precursor, a hopelessly inept immigrant comedian, to Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   But to other performers and to a cult of fans, Kaufman remains a
singular figure, more performance artist than comic, whose multiple
personae, humor without jokes, and wry riffs on his audience's
expectations created a comic presence no one else has even
approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andy wasn't a comedian, he was a behavioral scientist,'' said
Carrey, who was so eager to do the role that he worked for about
half the $20 million fee he can command and even auditioned to get
the part. ``I was hooked the first time I saw him. I think of him
as the Neil Armstrong of comedy. He went places no one else had
gone. If he was a comedian, he was the only one who didn't need to
get a laugh. He didn't care if audiences loved him or hated him as
long as he got beneath their veneer and got them emotionally
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman grew up on his own distant moon in Great Neck, drove a
cab after high school and then attended Grahm Junior College in
Boston. He was an indifferent student with an artistic sensibility
that was one part Fellini, one part children's entertainer and one
part the theatrical good-versus-evil world of professional
wrestling. Ill-suited for much else, he invented his own brand of
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At his first club dates, audiences sat in embarrassed silence,
not knowing what to make of his bumbling foreign man, groping his
way through his utterly inept jokes and impressions. He came on
stage and read, ``The Great Gatsby'' in a pretentious English
accent as audiences first tittered nervously and then hissed and
booed in anger.
</P>
<P>
   He created apparently unscripted fiascos on live television,
strutted like a pig after wrestling women in his guise as the the
World's Intergender Wrestling Champion and then offered up
snivleling pleas for the audience's forgivenness and affection.
</P>
<P>
   Andy the Good appeared with a gospel singer from Dallas to
peform Christian songs, profess his new-found faith in Jesus and
apologize for his earlier errant behavior. Andy the Bad sneeringly
instructed the populace of Memphis, Tenn., on the proper use of
soap and toilet paper, before being sent to the hospital after
being slammed head first to the canvas by the wrestler Jerry
Lawler.
</P>
<P>
   The personae played out on so many levels, it was hard for even
friends and family to be sure what was real. When Kaufman was Tony
Clifton, he drank heavily, though Kaufman did not drink at all, and
he smoked, though Kaufman did not smoke. Tony did things sexually
that Kaufman would never do.
</P>
<P>
   But since Tony was portrayed at various times by Kaufman, by
Kaufman's brother, Michael, and by Zmuda, audiences and television
talk show hosts could never be sure if the Tony Clifton in their
presence was Kaufman or not.
</P>
<P>
   Zmuda said he once carried on a torrid affair as Tony Clifton
with a Las Vegas showgirl who thought she was with Kaufman. For the
record, Clifton denied he was Kaufman and threatened to file suit
against Kaufman for using his name.
</P>
<P>
   True to the spirit of things, even after filming ended, Carrey
still referred to both ``Andy'' and ``Tony'' in the third person,
as if both were distinct people he'd come to know, like fellow
passengers on a particularly interesting cruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony surprised a lot of people,'' he said. ``The first week of
filming, Milos came to me and said, `I don't know how to handle
Tony,' He was very upset. He'd gone into Tony's trailer while Tony
was being made up, and Tony sliced him to ribbons. But in the end,
people developed enormous respect for Tony. His last day on the set
was one of the most emotional things I've ever seen. These
characters were totally separate, more separate than you could
imagine. I'm not saying I had to go insane to do this film, but I
know that there were some nights, I went to bed as a character who
was insane.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrey said he still does not know the truth about much of
Kaufman's life and art, which is the way everyone wants to keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with Andy was like working with Harry Houdini,'' said
Zmuda. ``There's the magician's code of not giving the secrets
away.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film is likely to give at least some of them away.
Kaufman's manager, George Shapiro, for example, said Kaufman's
injury at the hands of Lawler, described at the time as seriously
injured cervical vertebrae, which kept Kaufman in a neck brace for
months, was simply faked wrestling stagecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Zmuda and the writer Bill Zehme are both working on books about
Kaufman, to be released about the time of the film; and Kaufman's
brother is contemplating a collection of his reflections and
Kaufman's own writings, so it is unclear how many of the secrets
will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be the hottest dead comedian around,'' said
Brian Momchilov, who built an elaborate website devoted to Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the ultimate mystery. When reports emerged that
Kaufman had cancer, many people, even those close to him, assumed
it was an elaborate joke, yet another bit of sleight of hand by a
performer who often talked of faking his own death.
</P>
<P>
   Zmuda recalls people congratulating Kaufman on yet another
brilliant deceit as he was being pushed around in a wheelchair, his
hair falling out from chemotherapy. Kaufman's death from lung
cancer struck many who knew him as too cruel and too unlikely to be
true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly did not believe that Andy had contracted cancer and
died,'' said Danny DeVito, one of Kaufman's co-stars on ``Taxi.''
``Even after he died, I didn't believe it, and a lot of other
people felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows it is true. Kaufman died May 16, 1984, and was
buried on Long Island in Beth David Cemetery in Elmont. But faking
his own death would have been so in character, that even those who
know he is dead like to keep open the vague notion that maybe it is
conceivable he is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something called denial, but 14{ years later, there is
still a large group of people who hold out the possibility that
he's still alive,'' said Michael Kaufman, who joined his sister
Carol and their father Stanley on the set. ``Possibility is a funny
word. It's a lot different than probability. In all likelihood,
he's gone, but if you ask me if it's possible he's still alive, I'd
say it's not out of the realm of possibility. In our family,
anything for a joke.''

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; How about ``The Widely Predicted Sweep of Lauryn
Hill''?
</P>
<P>
   The Fugees member and new mom received a leading 10 Grammy
Awards nominations Tuesday for her acclaimed solo debut album ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an expanse of accolades everybody expected.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the 41st annual record academy bids looked like
girl's night out for the second year running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are taking over,'' said Northridge-bred pop songwriter
Diane Warren, whose ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'' got a nod for
song of the year. ``It does seem to be the day of the female
artists.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critic's faves were left out of the spotlight. Lucinda
Williams, for example, was named in the contemporary folk album
category for her acclaimed ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' album
and for the track ``Can't Let Go'' in the female rock vocal
performance derby. However, her album, which topped most critics'
best-of-'98 lists, was generally expected to be a finalist for
album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, 23, competes against a nearly all-female field, including
Madonna, Sheryl Crow and Shania Twain, for album of the year. She
also garnered nominations in the best new artist, pop, r&AMP;b, rap and
producer categories. Twain and Crow tied for second place with six
nods each.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that session musicians involved in the making of ``The
Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'' recently filed suit against Hill and
her label for a share of the songwriting credits and royalties
didn't hurt the album's popularity with Grammy voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to thank everyone who supported this album,''
Hill said. ``I think it is a strong statement, in these days, that
I can make an album completely from my soul and without compromise
and be acknowledged for it. Praise God.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill has said that the title of her album shouldn't be taken too
literally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about the things you've learned outside of school,
outside of what society deems appropriate and mandatory,'' she
said. ``I have a lot of respect for academia, but there was a lot I
had to learn that wasn't part of any scholastic curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna received five nominations, while Celine Dion and Brandy
tied with four apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic! I'm thrilled! I'm incredibly blessed!'' Madonna,
speaking in her new English accent, said from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Women dominated the record of the year and album of the year
categories, taking eight of 10 nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian country superstar Twain's husband Robert John ``Mutt''
Lange, who produced and co-wrote much of her material, was the male
co-leader, sharing his five nods with engineer Jeff Balding.
</P>
<P>
   Record of the year nominees included Celine Dion's ``My Heart
Will Go On,'' Twain's ``You're Still the One,'' the Brandy and
Monica duet ``The Boy Is Mine,'' the Goo Dolls' ``Iris'' and
Madonna's ``Ray of Light.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica said such recognition from her peers in the industry
``keeps me determined. It gives me a reason to sing and
entertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Dion's love theme from ``Titanic'' was widely expected to sweep
the awards, but the song _ co-written by Westlake Village resident
Will Jennings _ received just four nods. The song dominated radio
last year, and the ``Titanic'' soundtrack sold almost 10 million
copies.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Natalie Imbruglia was mentioned for female pop vocal
for the song ``Torn,'' and for best new artist and pop album for
``Left of the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Beverly Hilton, where the nominations were announced
Tuesday, Imbruglia responded: ``I think artists are artists, and I
don't really like to separate gender. I think that's really
destructive. It should just be everybody is equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Album of the year nods went to Hill's ``The Miseducation of
Lauryn Hill,'' Crow's ``The Globe Sessions,'' Madonna's ``Ray of
Light,'' Twain's ``Come on Over'' and Garbage's ``Version 2.0.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill's nominations included best r&AMP;b album, best r&AMP;b vocal
performance for ``Doo Wop (That Thing),'' best r&AMP;b song for ``A
Rose Is Still a Rose,'' which was recorded by Aretha Franklin, and
best r&AMP;b performance by a duo or group with vocal for her duet with
D'Angelo, ``Nothing Even Matters.'' In 1997, the South Orange,
N.J., native won two Grammys as part of the Fugees, the
biggest-selling rap group of all time.
</P>
<P>
   She launches her first worldwide tour this month in Japan and
appears March 5 at the Universal Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   Crow and Twain's six-bid tie included album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Twain was also nominated in the record of the year and best
female country vocal performance categories for ``You're Still the
One,'' and best country album for the 6-million-selling ``Come on
Over.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow's other nominations included best female rock vocal
performance for ``There Goes the Neighborhood'' and best rock album
for ``The Globe Sessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Best new artist nominees were Hill, Backstreet Boys, blind
Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli, the Dixie Chicks and Imbruglia.
</P>
<P>
   Song of the year nods went to the composers of Twain's ``You're
Still the One,'' Aerosmith's ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'' from
the ``Armageddon'' soundtrack, Goo Goo Dolls' ``Iris'' from the
``City of Angels'' soundtrack, Kirk Franklin's ``Lean on Me'' and
Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On'' from the ``Titanic'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Other men receiving more than one nomination included Vince
Gill, Kirk Franklin, Pat McCarthy, engineer/producer Tchad Blake
and producer William Orbit, who worked on Madonna's ``Ray of
Light'' album. They got four nods each.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations this year boasted several new categories: best
traditional r&AMP;b vocal performance, best classical crossover album,
best Tejano music performance, best dance recording, re-mixer of
the year and Latin alternative rock album.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 entries were received to generate the nominations
in 95 categories, said Michael Greene, president and chief
executive officer of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences (NARAS).
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony, which returns to Los Angeles after two
years in New York, takes place Feb. 24 at the Shrine Auditorium and
will be broadcast on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials hope to bring the 2000 show to the Staples
Center, which is under construction downtown and is scheduled to
open in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside Hill in the best r&AMP;b album category were Erykah Badu's
``Live,'' Brandy's ``Never Say Never,'' Franklin's ``A Rose Is
Still a Rose'' and Maxwell's ``Embrya.''
</P>
<P>
   The best female country vocal performance category featured
Twain, Emmylou Harris, Faith Hill, Lee Ann Womack and Trisha
Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few years, people have been saying more and more how
women have been making a statement in music, especially country
music,'' Yearwood said. ``I think it's a cool thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill, Clint Black, Garth Brooks and Steve Wariner compete for
best male country vocal. Brooks' ``Sevens'' was nominated for
country album, along with ``Wide Open Spaces'' by the Dixie Chicks,
``Faith'' by Faith Hill, ``Come on Over'' by Twain and ``Where Your
Road Leads'' by Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite Grammy memory came last year as I was rehearsing
for `Saturday Night Live,' and I got the call from Trisha
(Yearwood) telling me we had one,'' said Brooks, who was nominated
three times. ``I would love to get another call like that this
year. No matter what happens, I'm flattered.'' &QL;

EVEN WITHOUT A GOVERNMENT, TURKEY IS WINNING KEY DIPLOMATIC
BATTLES
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Turkey has been without a functioning
government for 40 days, and no one knows whether there will be an
election soon or what other solution may emerge for the drifting
political system. But in sharp contrast to this domestic
uncertainty, Turkish foreign policy is tougher and more assertive
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of blunt warnings of economic pressure and even
military strikes, Turkish leaders are using their growing power to
achieve what they consider vital policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's most recent foreign policy success came on the tense
island of Cyprus, which is divided between Turkish and Greek
sectors. The Greek-backed government there had planned to deploy
Russian anti-aircraft missiles. Turkey responded by promising to
bomb them. Last week, the Cypriots backed down.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey cannot claim full credit because the United States and
several European countries had also urged that the deployment be
canceled. But in other areas, Turkish leaders have won important
battles on their own.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Turkish generals and political leaders demanded that
neighboring Syria expel the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan,
who has directed a 14-year guerrilla war in southeastern Turkey.
They strongly hinted that Turkey would attack Syria if it did not
comply, and they sent soldiers to the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
   With an alacrity that some in the region found astonishing,
Syria quickly expelled Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Syria was feeling weak,'' said a European diplomat
with long experience in the Middle East. ``It couldn't have
resisted an attack by Turkey and it didn't want to be humiliated,
especially with Israel watching.''
</P>
<P>
   From Syria, Ocalan flew to Russia. Turkish officials warned
Russia that if he was allowed to stay there, they would demand
instant repayment of Russian debts and force the scores of Turkish
companies operating in Russia to cease operations immediately.
Within days, Ocalan was on the road again.
</P>
<P>
   His next stop was Italy, and immediately after he landed there,
Turkish leaders demanded that Italy send him home to face trial.
But Italy, which is governed by a left-leaning coalition that
includes some who sympathize with Kurdish rebels, proved less
pliant and refused to extradite Ocalan, saying it could not legally
send him to a country where he faced the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged Turks have threatened to ban Italian imports, which are
worth many millions of dollars to Italian companies, and to reject
Italian bids for huge Turkish military contacts. Newspapers here
are full of predictions that Italy will soon send Ocalan away.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is also using high-pressure tactics to persuade foreign
oil companies that they should build their main export pipeline for
Caspian crude through Turkey rather than another route.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies want to build a shorter and cheaper pipeline
to Georgia, and then send their crude in tankers across the Black
Sea and through the Bosporus. But Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
asserted that the Bosporus was already full and that Turkey would
no longer ``grant any priority to oil tankers.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the Turks went even further. They told the two main
partners in the Caspian oil consortium, Amoco and BP, that if they
continued supporting a pipeline route outside of Turkey, Turkey
would revoke their permits to explore for oil in Turkish waters.
Turkish officials also said they would disqualify Amoco's bid to
build a new $500 million liquid natural gas terminal here.
</P>
<P>
   By some standards, Turkey is well positioned to use such tough
tactics. It has a strong economy, a population of 65 million and
370,000 soldiers under arms, more than any other NATO country
except the United States. Partly due to its old alliance with the
United States and its new partnership with Israel, its military is
well trained, disciplined and equipped.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Turkey's regional rivals are extraordinarily
weak. Iraq is suffering under crushing U.N. sanctions, Iran is torn
by internal conflict, and Russia is in political, military and
economic disarray.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turkey itself is hardly a model of stability. Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz lost a vote of confidence in November, and feuding
political leaders have proved unable to put together a new
government to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   But military commanders have stepped into the political vacuum.
They have taken a decisive role in foreign and security policy, and
are responsible for much of Turkey's new assertiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this tends to back up the idea of a newly activist
Turkey,'' Alan Makovsky, a specialist in Turkish affairs at the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as recently as 1990, the Turkish state was largely
third-world militarily and economically,'' Makovsky said. ``It had
no modern weaponry, it faced countries that were well armed and
backed by the Soviets, and it was basically inward-looking. Now all
of that has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey has more than 1,000 M-60 tanks and 200 F-16 fighters.
It's the 17th or 18th largest economy in the world. The Turks still
can't push everyone around, but they can stir the pot in a way they
couldn't five years ago. When they threaten economic or even
military retaliation, it's not something that's easy to dismiss.''

SLAY SUSPECT'S MOTHER FOUND FROZEN TO DEATH

<P>
   DENVER _ The mother of one of two Wyoming men charged in the
killing of a gay college student froze to death after leaving a
bar, Wyoming police officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy T. Dixon, the mother of Russell A. Henderson, was last
seen staggering out of a bar in Laramie, Wyo., on Saturday night,
said Sheriff Jim Pond, of Albany County. She was wearing a light
jacket while wind chill temperatures had dropped to 30 degrees
below zero, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after dawn on Sunday, her body was found on the side of
a rural road about five miles north of town, said Julie Heggie, the
coroner, who said there were no signs of injury to the body.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dixon's death shed light on the troubled life of her
21-year-old son, a suspect in a case that gained world attention as
a symbol of violence against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me his parents were dead,'' said Maggie McKinney, who
lives in the trailer park where Henderson lived. Ms. McKinney, who
once worked at a Taco Bell with Henderson, added, ``I didn't even
know he had his parents in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has been charged with kidnapping and first-degree
murder in the death of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college
freshman who was lured from a Laramie bar, beaten and left to die
tied to a fence outside of town in October.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Henderson pistol-whipped Shepard
in a pickup truck, then tied him to the ranch fence. His trial is
scheduled to begin on March 22 in Laramie. A friend of Henderson,
Aaron J. McKinney, is to be tried separately on the same charges,
with a trial date set for Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have pleaded innocent. The prosecutor, Cal Rerucha,
announced last week that he would seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson never met his biological father and was adopted as an
infant by a stepfather, said his lawyer, Wyatt Skaggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was abused substantially by various boyfriends,'' said
Skaggs, a public defender who represented Mrs. Dixon in several
cases in the last decade. ``She had a longstanding alcohol problem
that began years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Russell was removed from his mother's home and went
to live in Laramie with his maternal grandmother, a deeply
religious woman. Under her care, he apparently flourished,
attaining the honor roll in junior high school, excelling in
sports, joining the Future Farmers of America and becoming an Eagle
Scout.
</P>
<P>
   But at 17, he moved out of his grandmother's house and almost
immediately started having problems with the law. He was arrested
twice for drunken driving and once for fighting with a police
officer.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Leveaux is drawn to plays that are ``killers,''
he says, and one could argue that this English theater director
certainly knows how to slay the New York critics. Although he has
worked only three times over the last 14 years on Broadway, where
his production of Sophocles' ``Electra'' _ starring Zoe Wanamaker _
is currently playing at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, on each
occasion he has come away with mostly raves. (``Electra'' has been
extended to more than double its initial eight-week run, and is now
scheduled to close on March 28.)
</P>
<P>
   That's an impressive track record by anyone's standard, made
doubly so by Leveaux's rigorous choice of plays. He has presented
two by O'Neill, including ``Anna Christie,'' a drama that many
thought too fogbound and dated to survive a successful run until,
that is, his elemental staging with Liam Neeson and Natasha
Richardson in 1993, which won a Tony Award for best revival; and,
now, a 2,400-year-old Greek tragedy by a dramatist whom Leveaux
refers to, with an excited smile, as ``the granddaddy of O'Neill.''
</P>
<P>
   The director was also nominated for a Tony for ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten,'' starring Kate Nelligan and Ian Bannen, with which he
made his New York debut in 1984 at the age of 26. He did not attend
the ceremonies that year because, he recalled, ``I couldn't afford
the suit, and it struck me that if Mike Nichols was nominated'' _
and, indeed, won for his production of ``The Real Thing'' by Tom
Stoppard _ ``then that was the way it was going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In between Broadway ventures _ and two somewhat less-heralded
Off Broadway ones, directing new plays by Martin Sherman
(``Messiah'') and Edna O'Brien (``Virginia'') _ Leveaux's
peripatetic travels have kept him away from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's a bit of an enigma to me in terms of his disappearing
for a time,'' said Todd Haimes, artistic director of the Roundabout
Theater Company, which produced ``Anna Christie.'' Perhaps
inevitably, the truth behind Leveaux's absences from New York is
more prosaic, and has to do with a man motivated, he says, not by
some ``fugitive aspect'' in his professional life but by
``situations and productions that excite me,'' wherever they may
be.
</P>
<P>
   Now 41, Leveaux grew up in Derby, in the Midlands, the son of a
cardiologist and the second of four children. Today he lives in
West London, with his partner, Viviana Durante, a ballet dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been able to think in terms of how you structure a
career,'' he said one recent wintry Sunday over brunch in
Manhattan. His long, unruly hair and chiseled features suggested a
Byronic musician perhaps, not a man who, not long out of Manchester
University, followed up his Broadway debut on ``Moon for the
Misbegotten'' with a German-language production in East Berlin of
Strindberg's ``Dance of Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are very good at mapping a career, he said, but
``I'm not, and therefore, I suppose, look like more of a maverick
on paper, although to me there is a structure, there is a shape, of
a kind.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last five years, that shape has been provided by
Leveaux's post as artistic director of Theater Project in Tokyo,
where he spends about a third of every year working _ largely
through an interpreter. (Of his own familiarity with the Japanese
language, Leveaux grinned: ``It's coming along.'')
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1995 that Leveaux first tackled ``Electra'' for that
company, housed in a converted dye works. The production was in
Japanese with a local actress, Sato Orie, in the title role. The
designer was Vicki Mortimer, from England, who will be represented
on Broadway later this season with Patrick Marber's play
``Closer.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to ``Electra'' in September 1997, when Wanamaker led
an entirely separate production, first at the Chichester Festival
Theater south of London and then in the West End at the Donmar
Warehouse. The director remembered being ``fed'' both by his work
on it in Japan and by an image he had seen in an amateur
documentary of a young Bosnian girl, perhaps 11 or 12, standing by
her brother's grave. The task, Leveaux said, ``was how to release
the play from its, if you like, academic stranglehold without
supplanting aridity with hysteria, which is not an answer either.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I saw that documentary film, I actually saw the play
in our world. More than 2,000 years later, you realize that, in
fact, Sophocles was a realist; suddenly I saw it was actually both
necessary and possible to do the Greeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese production then became what Leveaux termed ``an
experiment'' for an esthetic that has continued to evolve as he and
Wanamaker thought through the play in England and then again, with
a different (and, to some who had seen it in Britain as well as the
United States, superior) supporting cast at the McCarter Theater in
Princeton, N.J., and now New York. That cast includes Claire Bloom
as Electra's mother, Clytemnestra; Michael Cumpsty as Electra's
brother, Orestes; Stephen Spinella as his servant, and Pat Carroll
as the Chorus of Mycenae.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to go down a route,'' Leveaux said, ``that made as
direct a connection between the audience and the experience of this
play as possible but did not attempt somehow to make it more
convenient by making it more conversational; the play cannot be
made more convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the aim was to wed a very Eastern economy of expression
and focus to a ``psychological naturalistic suppleness'' that, the
director said, is no less definably Western. The result, in the
adaptation by Frank McGuinness, was a ``reducing down to the point
of greatest energy'' that, Leveaux added, was not that far removed
from the plays of Harold Pinter _ like ``Moonlight'' and ``No Man's
Land'' _ which he has directed to acclaim in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Harold has done in his writing,'' Leveaux said.
``From Hackney'' _ Pinter's birthplace in east London _ ``to Tokyo
is clearly a vast distance, but the theater has a magnificent
ability to collapse distance and time at will.''
</P>
<P>
   And having first discussed a Tennessee Williams revival with
Wanamaker (the rarely seen ``Eccentricities of a Nightingale'' was
a candidate), Leveaux found himself unleashing a fury in the
actress both adult in its expressiveness and childlike in its
primal, unfettered force. Wanamaker's qualities as a child-woman _
enhanced by that notable pug nose and her sad, wounded gaze _ have
emerged even more essentially, Leveaux said, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this almost childlike presence in Zoe which opened up the
possibility of Electra to me,'' he said. ``You must see someone who
in a sense has remained in the captivity of childhood because
that's literally what Electra is: she has arrived in womanhood
without having mediated that. She's not some 19th-century
aristocratic heroine; she doesn't suffer like that. She suffers
like a child; that's what makes her dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in the spring in London, Leveaux will excavate pain of a
different sort _ that of the cuckolded playwright Henry _ when he
is back at the Donmar directing the first London revival of
Stoppard's 1982 play, ``The Real Thing.'' Beyond that are hopes of
the first-ever visit to the West of his Japanese venture, perhaps
with his newly opened staging of Wedekind's ``Lulu.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an attempt to emend Haimes' ``once-a-decade theory'' (or
thereabouts) about Leveaux's visits to Broadway, the director hopes
to return next season with a commercial revival of Pinter's ``Old
Times,'' starring Cherry Jones. ``I think it's a major play,''
Leveaux said.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely though, he added, that Broadway would ever be a
full-time home. ``In the end, you have to take responsibility for
your artistic development, and you can't measure that against bouts
of perceived success. It is fantastic when the work one is
passionate about coincides with success; it is fantastic. That is
all that can be said of it because equally there is work one feels
passionate about that doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reality,'' he said. ``That's the way it goes.''

<P>
   The Cuban Revolution is now 40 years old, and its anniversary is
all the more remarkable in view of the relative shambles the
country is in.
</P>
<P>
   When Fidel Castro, Che Guevara and the other 1,500-odd members
of the Rebel Army and the 26th of July Movement overthrew Fulgencio
Batista and entered Havana in January 1959, no one could have
predicted that events on the small island would be so far-reaching
and significant.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they led to the Cuban missile crisis, the most severe
confrontation of the Cold War; to daring revolutionary escapades
throughout Latin America and part of Africa; to a four-decade
animosity on the part of the United States; to Castro's outlasting
the attempts of nine U.S. presidents to get rid of him, one way or
another.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly an exceptional feat to have survived, and the
authors of the revolution can at least take solace in that. Not in
much else, at this stage, which is why perhaps a reassessment of
the Cuban epic's true legacy and impact, at least in Latin America,
is relevant today.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, for a movement that prided itself on being truly
political, and on radiating its political influence throughout the
hemisphere, Cuba today exists in Latin America through its cultural
influence.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution's political impact now is mostly limited to the
displays of small crowds that congregate outside the hotels where
Castro chooses to rest on his sporadic forays into the region. If
Cuba once ignited passions of hatred and mistrust, or inspired
thousands to give their lives for an ideal, today it can barely
cajole Latin American governments to half-heartedly condemn the
U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s nearly everyone _ from Mexican national hero Lazaro
Cardenas to Jean-Paul Sartre and Stokely Carmichael _ made the
pilgrimage to Havana. Today the swarms of revolutionaries,
intellectuals and advisers from the golden age of glory are nowhere
in sight. What you see instead are middle-age Spanish, Italian and
Mexican tourists who come to take advantage of Cuba's beautiful
beaches, cheap prices and readily available sex.
</P>
<P>
   While the Cuban cultural presence is far less than it was 30
years ago, or even as recently as the 1980s, the island's sway
among writers, singers, painters, academics, poets, actors and TV
and movie directors is still disproportionate to its tiny size and
meager resources.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the paradox: the Cuban Revolution has left a much more
lasting imprint among novelists than political ideologues, among
painters than student activists, among musicians than labor
organizers _ in short, among cultural than political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Having once wielded enormous influence over the politics of
Latin America and to an extent the world, today Cuba's strategic
value is highly reduced: Russia prefers IMF dollars to
nuclear-tipped missiles pointed at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   And yet hundreds of graduates from Gabriel Garcia Marquez's
School of Cinema and Television in San Antonio de los Banos are
scattered across the influential cities of Latin America. At the
University of Buenos Aires, a Che Guevara rotating chair
inaugurated in early 1997 still attracts hundreds of attentive
students. In Mexico, La Jornada, the mass-circulation daily where
Carlos Fuentes and Octavio Paz published their columns and
commentaries on current events as recently as five years ago,
continues to flaunt its enthusiasm for everything Cuban.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller than ever, but nonetheless impressive number of Latin
America's most distinguished cultural icons remain fast and true
friends of Cuba _ from Garcia Marquez to Chilean playwright Ariel
Dorfman, from Ecuadorian painter Guayasamin to Uruguayan
teeny-bopper idol and best-selling novelist Mario Benedetti, from
Brazilian songwriter and folk hero Chico Buarque to the dean of
Latin American sociologists, Mexico's Pablo Gonzalez Casanova.
</P>
<P>
   The continued loyalty to Cuba of these and many other major
figures on the Latin American cultural scene stems in part from the
status and activities of the region's intelligentsia. During the
long night of authoritarian rule in Latin America, intellectuals
frequently spoke out at home and abroad against abuses and
atrocities, and helped to replace banned or weakened political
parties. When democratization finally arrived, that role greatly
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Cuban regime is now so discredited in Latin
American politics that the most a fellow traveler to Cuba can get
away with is to call for an end to the U.S. embargo and harassment
from Miami; but in the field of culture there is greater leeway.
Artists are less accountable to the public than politicians, who
have to face the media and the voters. Artists and performers face
only their audience and youthful, radical fans, most of whom tend
to share their political views. Few openly pro-Cuban politicians
are left in Latin America, but there are still many pro-Cuban
cultural figures.
</P>
<P>
   The festive times of the Cuban Revolution ended many years ago,
as did the heyday of its influence _ political, cultural and
otherwise. What remain are memories and regrets, as well as
vestiges of a singular experience in Latin America history: the way
in which a small island with no particular claim to fame was
transformed into a cultural beacon and haven for many of the
greatest writers the region has ever known, and for some of its
finest thinkers, musicians and painters.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is perhaps a fitting tribute to Cuba and to Che
Guevara that they both made a greater mark in the shining field of
Latin culture than in the mundane, mediocre world of politics.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a new, emerging left in Latin America, it is largely
because the Cubans have been banished from political life in the
hemisphere. But if the region's cultural realm maintains its
marvelous vitality, it is partly because of Cuba's contribution to
it.

TENNESSEE'S VICTORY GIVES THE BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES A BOOST  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The coach was talking about his team, the
undefeated, undisputed national titleholders, but Phillip Fulmer
might as well have been summing up the Bowl Championship Series and
its computer-age way of matching the nation's two best teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't always perfect, and it wasn't always the prettiest,
but they always found a way to get it done,'' Fulmer said in the
bowels of Sun Devil Stadium shortly after his Tennessee Volunteers
beat Florida State, 23-16, Monday night, to finish 13-0 and No. 1
in both the coaches and news media polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols' Fiesta Bowl star, Peerless Price, the wide receiver
who hauled in 199 yards worth of passes including a 79-yard fourth
quarter bomb to secure the victory, was talking about outdueling
Florida State's all-America wideout who dominated the pre-game
coverage. But Price might as well have been putting a postscript on
the Seminoles' effort in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no comparison,'' he shouted above the din of the
Volunteers' raucous celebration. ``Who showed up? Who showed up?
Now I can talk! All week long, all I heard was that Peter Warrick
was the best receiver in the country. That's all the hype I need to
hear. When the money was on the line, when the game counted _ who
showed up?''
</P>
<P>
   The BCS compendium of human polls and computer rankings
fulfilled its mission and got Tennessee here against what was
undoubtedly the second best team in the nation. It needed two of
the top three teams, UCLA and Kansas State, to lose on the final
day of the regular season (and each would lose a second game as
well) to quell the debate and second-guessing to make it happen.
But it worked.
</P>
<P>
   Then Tennessee did the rest. The school formerly known as Peyton
Manning's alma mater, a team picked to go 8-3, one that was an
underdog despite a 12-0 record, showed that ``destiny'' and
``character'' _ Fulmer's words _ sometimes mean more than
reputation and talent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the final polls reflected that the new system was not
only consistent but left room for fitting surprises beyond
Tennessee. The Volunteers, Ohio State (11-1), Florida State (11-2)
and Arizona (12-1) were ranked, 1, 2, 3 and 4 in both the
Associated Press media poll and USA TODAY/ESPN coaches poll.
</P>
<P>
   The media poll placed Florida (10-2) fifth and Wisconsin (11-1)
sixth, while the coaches had the Badgers ahead of the Gators. Both
rewarded Tulane (12-0) for its undefeated season in Conference USA
with a No. 7 ranking. Air Force (12-1) earned the No. 10 spot in
the coaches poll; Georgia Tech (10-2) No. 9 in the media poll.
</P>
<P>
   And the two teams that were considered title contenders until
the final week, Kansas State (11-2) and UCLA (10-2), were dropped
for their disappointing bowl losses: The Wildcats fell to No. 10
with the media and No. 8 with the coaches after losing to Purdue in
the Alamo Bowl; the Bruins to No. 8 by both polls after getting
upset by Wisconsin in the Rose.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest letdown of the whole season perhaps was the
sluggish, mistake-prone game the Volunteers and Seminoles played in
prime time Monday night. Unless, of course, you're a Tennessee fan.
</P>
<P>
   And it will fuel the continuing debate about the BCS _ at least
until 2001 when the alliance agreement runs out. The arrangement
has rendered the traditional New Year's games largely meaningless.
In a college football community that on the one hand argues for a
playoff, but on the other enjoys the confusion when there's not a
clear-cut No. 1 versus No. 2 game, the Tennessee- Florida State
game left both sides unsatisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The game featured 7 turnovers and 165 yards in penalties and
precious little in terms of big-play offense. The Seminoles, who
had been off 44 days and were led by a sophomore quarterback making
only his third career start, were especially awful. They committed
12 penalties for 110 yards and paid for it.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, a roughing-the-kicker penalty gave the Vols a
second chance after they had settled for field goal. Tennessee went
on to score its first touchdown. Then, false-start and
illegal-shift penalties turned what was first-and-goal on the
5-yard-line for Florida State into third-and-goal from the 17.
</P>
<P>
   The frustrating, 4-minute-33-second series, exacerbated by
Florida State having to call time out twice due to confusion, ended
when Sebastian Janikowski kicked a 33-yard field goal to cut the
Tennessee halftime lead to 14-9.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, the Seminoles drove to Tennessee's
26-yard-line only to collect another false-start penalty, followed
by a 10-yard sack, and were forced to punt. ``We beat ourselves,''
said Marcus Outzen, who took over as Florida State's quarterback
only three games ago when Chris Weinke was injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Rooster, as teammates call him for his red crew cut,
completed only 9 of 22 passes for 145 yards, with an interception
returned for a touchdown by Dwayne Goodrich and another to snuff
out the Seminoles' last chance at a comeback with 1 minute 29
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden conceded that his team was
rusty, but tipped his hat to a Volunteer defense that wasn't as
hailed as the Seminoles' No. 1-ranked unit. ``They made more big
plays than we did,'' Bowden said. ``We had a hard time getting the
ball to our threat, and they deserved to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteer defense held Florida State to 253 yards, its
lowest output of the season. The Vols sacked Outzen four times and
held Warrick, who averaged 20.2 yards a reception and 102 yards a
game this season, to 1 catch for 7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Johnson and I had more catches than Peter Warrick,''
said Goodrich, gloating about the Volunteers' two-deep coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Where Warrick and Outzen stumbled, the Vols' Price and Martin
delivered the two most galvanizing plays of the game. The same
play. The second and most important time they ran it was with 9:15
left to play and the Vols on their own 21. In sandlot football,
they call it ``Go Long'' and that's what Price did.
</P>
<P>
   He blew past Seminole defensive back Mario Edwards down the
right sideline and Martin delivered a 45-yard arc that Price caught
and turned into a 79-yard touchdown. It put the Vols up by 20-9,
but, more importantly, deflated Florida State. In the first half,
the same bomb against the same man went 76 yards and set up a
Tennessee touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to prove to everybody we were the No. 1 team in the
nation,'' said Martin, who was 11 of 18 for 278 yards and 2
touchdowns.
</P>

INCREASINGLY ISOLATED, IRAQ VERBALLY ATTACKS OTHER ARAB NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-U.S.) 
(bl) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ A bitter war of words between Iraq and its Arab
neighbors has followed December's U.S.-led bombings, leaving Iraq
more isolated than at any time since the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   As Iraq has accused the Arabs of failing to stand by its side,
Egypt has responded with particular scorn, all but calling for the
ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The confrontation became
even more intense Tuesday as Saddam called on Arabs to rise up
against leaders who have not given his regime their full support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolt, sons of the great Arab nation, against injustice, and
let your voices be heard,'' Saddam said in an Army Day speech
broadcast by Qatar's Al-Jazeera Television, an Arabic-language
satellite channel that is viewed around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking Arab rulers who he said took their instructions from
Washington, he said: ``Revolt and unseat those stooges,
collaborators, throne dwarves and cowards. Revolt against
injustice. Surely we will remain forever as revolutionaries against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Arab governments explicitly condemned the four
days of U.S. and British air strikes that ended Dec. 19, and in the
weeks since, none have been willing to align themselves with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean they supported the bombing, only that they
have grown increasingly uneasy with Saddam's behavior in recent
months as he has refused repeatedly to cooperate with United
Nations inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arab governments, including Egypt, lost patience long ago
with Saddam's regime. But since the Gulf war they have generally
shied away from direct criticism, choosing instead to emphasize
their sympathy for ``the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been seen as prudent because it is does not contradict
an Arab public opinion that has often been willing to excuse Saddam
for Iraq's woes. Saddam does retain a small reservoir of admiration
among the Arab public _ the air strikes brought demonstrations in
Cairo and other Arab capitals _ making it possible that his call to
arms will be heard with some sympathetic ears.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats and other analysts said they believe that Iraq
will probably be the bigger victim in the war of words, because
Saddam's calls for an uprising are likely in the end only to
compound his isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials and newspapers began their war of words against
the other Arab countries last week, singling out Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and suggesting that he was little more than a stooge
of the West because he did not speak out against the attacks on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a commentary broadcast overnight on Egyptian state
radio suggested that the time had come for ``the beginning of the
end'' of the Iraqi regime. It included the harshest rhetoric that
Egypt has directed against Iraq since the Gulf war, and denounced
Saddam by name as a killer, a gangster and the ``destroyer of
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab Nation has never known, even in its worst periods of
decadence, a leader worse than the dictator of Iraq, who committed
the crime of invading Kuwait, which led to his Mother of Defeats,''
Egyptian radio said.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore those sentiments, Egypt's ambassador to
Jordan was reported to have met there in recent days with leaders
of the Iraqi National Accord, one of the opposition groups vowing
to overthrow Saddam. Monday night, Egyptian television devoted much
of a two-hour broadcast to interviews with journalists and ordinary
people criticizing the Iraqi leader for the suffering of the
country's population.
</P>
<P>
   In private, Western diplomats said, Egyptian officials have
expressed little more than scorn for the support that the United
States has declared for Iraqi opposition groups, on the grounds
that none represent a real threat to the Iraqi leader. The
diplomats also said that the fresh criticism of the Iraq from Egypt
and other countries should not be interpreted as support for
December's bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Egypt's harsh new rhetoric was prompted mostly by pique,
though, the effect has certainly been to draw a sharp new line
between Arab regimes sympathetic to Iraq and those that clearly are
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt has made up its mind about Iraq, and there is no way
back,'' said Mohammed Sayed Said, a senior researcher at the Al
Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said that
Saddam's statement was ``a not-surprising diatribe'' that
``indicated his isolated position in the Arab world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The intemperate, unmeasured and desperate tone, I think,
speaks very clearly to the isolation that Iraq faces in the Arab
world and the isolation that Saddam Hussein faces around the entire
world,'' he said. ``He's lashing out as a result of his isolated
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that Egypt, along with Saudi Arabia, was
instrumental in securing the postponement until Jan. 24 of a
meeting of Arab foreign ministers that the Iraqi government had
hoped would take up its cause.
</P>
<P>
   The United Arab Emirates and Yemen, which have expressed some
sympathy with Iraq, had pressed for an early meeting. But the
Egyptians and the Saudis were determined to keep other Arabs at
arm's length from Iraq _ ``to slow down the train'' in the
expectation that anger over the air strikes would fade, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incendiary statements from Iraq that have fueled
intra-Arab tensions was Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz's
suggestion last week that Mubarak was ``the only one in this
world'' who had said that Iraq, and not the United States, should
bear the responsibility for the U.S.-led attack.
</P>
<P>
   Another, in the Iraqi newspaper Babel, which is owned by
Saddam's son Uday, urged Egyptians to topple Mubarak and thereby
``reject their shameless ruler who has lost everything, including
his self-respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the Iraqi attacks that angered Egyptian officials was
a cartoon in Babel that showed Mubarak clad in women's clothing and
dancing to the applause of U.S., Kuwaiti and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Another Arab leader criticized by Iraq in recent days is Crown
Prince Hassan of Jordan, the country's acting leader since King
Hussein began cancer treatment in the United States six months ago.
Aziz said that Prince Hassan was responsible, along with Mubarak,
for the postponement of the meeting of Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's broadcast, Saddam did not mention any Arab leaders
by name. But he called on the Arab people to ``correct the
deviations of those who have deviated.'' He noted in particular
that the aircraft that have attacked Iraq were flown from Arab
nations and Arab waters and that there were Western troops ``in the
land of the holy sites'' _ a reference to Saudi Arabia.

THE HOMEY JOYS OF SIMPLE PAELLA  
</HEADLINE>
 (dal) 
 MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You wouldn't know it from the elaborate meat-and-shellfish dish
in Spanish restaurants, but paella has simple roots. Like most
peasant dishes gone ritzy, paella is quite comfortable back in the
home kitchen. Indeed, a plain rice-and-shrimp dish can be as much a
``real'' paella as the $25-a-plate version. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The name ``paella'' refers not to a combination of rice,
seafood, sausage and other meats, but rather to the paellera, a
large pan that looks like a flat wok. The only ingredient common to
every traditional paella is rice, which makes sense, since the dish
originated in Valencia, Spain's great rice-growing region.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that true paella must contain either meat or seafood
(never both), that it can be prepared only in a paellera or that it
must be cooked outdoors over wood. Perhaps they're all right.
What's clear to me is that you can produce the fabulous rice dish I
call paella in just over a half-hour, which makes it a great option
for weeknights. The trick is to start it on the stove and finish it
in a superhot oven. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a paellera, and I'm not about to buy one, so I use
a cast-iron skillet. Although I'm a great fan of nonstick cookware,
here it would be counterproductive, since one of the great joys of
a paella is the crust of rice that forms on the bottom. To
encourage that to form, I finish the paella in an oven that is as
hot as I can get it, usually on a baking stone for good measure.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rice must be short or medium grain. Since Valencia rice is
not easy to find, I usually use arborio, now sold just about
everywhere, or cheaper American or Asian short-grain rice. Saffron
is the essential seasoning, and a chicken stock laced with this
pungent spice makes the best liquid, although you can substitute a
simple stock made from shrimp shells if you like (water is a
desperate but acceptable alternative).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp is my first choice as a featured ingredient, but the
alternatives are numerous: chicken, chorizo or other sausage, peas
or other vegetables, scallops, pork, firm tofu. Combine them at
will: anything less than a half inch thick will cook through by the
time the rice absorbs the liquid.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Half of this recipe (in an eight-inch skillet) will make a side
dish for four.
</P>
<P>
   THE MINIMALIST'S PAELLA  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 cups chicken stock (see text)
</P>
<P>
   Pinch saffron
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups short- or medium-grain rice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and fresh black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 cups raw peeled shrimp, cut into {-inch chunks
</P>
<P>
   Minced parsley for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees, or as near as you can. Warm
the stock in a saucepan with the saffron. Place a 10- or 12-inch
skillet over medium-high heat and add the oil. One minute later,
add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent,
about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the rice, and cook, stirring occasionally, until glossy _
just a minute or two. Season liberally with salt and pepper, and
add the warmed stock, taking care to avoid the rising steam. Stir
in the shrimp, and transfer the pan to the oven. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Bake about 25 minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed and
the rice is dry on top. Garnish, and serve immediately.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 main-course servings.

COMMENTARY: THE BLOVIATORS' BALL
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By FRANK RICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Was it coined by H.L. Mencken? Warren G. Harding? Gore Vidal?
Lewis Carroll? To the many vocal readers who have searched in vain
for a dictionary that might give the definition and derivation of
the term ``bloviate'' since it appeared here, in a November column
about the nattering nabobs of Washington, I say: Forget the OED and
consult the essential ``Safire's New Political Dictionary,'' in
which the history of this ``made up'' word is traced back as far as
1850. Its creator? Unknown. Its meaning? ``To orate pompously.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that a reference book is essential to identify _ if I may
make up another word _ a bloviator. As we enter Monicagate Y2, a
bloviator can be defined as any TV talking head who has (a)
inflated the historic grandeur of this moment by repeatedly
referring to the president (still ``Bill Clinton'' to us
outside-the-Beltway rubes) as ``William Jefferson Clinton''; (b)
given credence to post-impeachment predictions about a presidential
resignation or a fast censure deal; or (c) wasted time speculating
that Clinton might seriously consider postponing as sure-fire a
poll-booster as his State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   (Besides, if our compartmentalizing president can speak with
congressmen on the phone while having sex with an intern, what's to
stop him from speaking to the entire Congress while on trial for
lying about having sex with an intern?)
</P>
<P>
   Given these definitions, only one question remains: Who in the
entire Monicagate cast is  &UR; not &LR;  a bloviator? The answer is easy,
since there is only one _ Brian Lamb. The man from C-Span is the
sole talking head to pass through this marathon circus without
making a prediction, stating an opinion, copping an attitude or
raising his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb only asks questions, and mildly. So mildly that an
important question he raised before Christmas _ in a letter to
Trent Lott and six other senators _ has been ignored by nearly
everyone, including most talking heads. Reading the 26 rules that
govern a Senate trial for impeachment, Lamb discovered that the
most crucial part of the entire proceeding, the final deliberations
in which each senator can speak for 10 or 15 minutes while arriving
at a verdict, is ``closed'' to the public, and thus to TV cameras.
</P>
<P>
   And there may be other blackouts as well. Mitch McConnell, the
Senate's Rules Committee chairman, has publicly said he doesn't
think ``the children or the families of America should be
subjected'' to embarrassing testimony from ``the more infamous
witnesses.'' (Where was McConnell's concern when his House
colleagues were pelting the families of America with the Starr
report, Clinton's grand jury video and the Lewinsky-Tripp tapes?)
</P>
<P>
   The public ``is going to be one damn frustrated group'' if ``the
deliberations are private,'' said Lamb when I asked him this week
about his letter. Secret congressional deliberations, he points
out, only send the message that ``a deal is being cut.'' Nor does
he feel that Americans should be shielded from any testimony. ``I'm
always struck by those who are wringing their hands about the
children of this country,'' he says, noting that children may in
fact be learning ``so much about the system'' of government from
the impeachment drama that ``it could be a positive when all is
said and done.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's letter hasn't been answered, and neither he nor anyone
else has a clue as to whether there's any Senate consensus about
opening the whole trial to TV. But Lamb worries that in the
tradition-bound Senate, which only began permitting broadcasting of
its regular sessions in 1986 (seven years after the House did),
just ``one senator could stand up and make it difficult'' to get
the rule change required to give TV complete access. And if that
should happen, Lamb says, we'll have come through this whole
process only to learn of the final round through senatorial ``sound
bites in the hallway'' and ``after-the-fact analysis'' on the
commercial cable news channels.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome would be the ultimate triumph of the Washington
bloviators. Once again they will have an open field to monopolize
the nation's conversation about off-camera events by spinning,
speculating and sermonizing over how Monicagate at last reached
``closure'' on the Senate floor. Only Brian Lamb, of all the
talking heads in Washington, will be out of work.

US FIRES ON IRAQI JETS OVER NO-FLY ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the first US-Iraqi dogfight in more than six
years, four American warplanes Tuesday fired air-to-air missiles at
Iraqi aircraft flying in violation of a US-patrolled no-fly zone in
southern Iraq, according to US officials.
</P>
<P>
   While US officials said that there is no evidence that the US
F-14s and F-15s shot down an Iraqi plane, they said at least one
Iraqi fighter crashed as it fled the American attack.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad's decision to challenge American fighter jets that
patrol the no-fly zone was the latest in a series of provocations
by the Iraqi military since the US ended Operation Desert Fox _ the
four-day bombing campaign by the US and Britain that ended on Dec.
19.
</P>
<P>
   And it appeared aimed at whittling away regional support for
American military operations in the Persian Gulf. Hours after the
American missile attack, Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein warned his
neighbors to stop aiding the United States in its ongoing war with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address, President Saddam Hussein blasted his
Gulf neighbors, primarily Saudi Arabia and Qatar, for permitting US
forces to station their military forces and air-force ``in the land
of the holy sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said that there were two separate
fire-fights. In the first incident, Iraqi Mig-25 fighters entered
the no fly zone in southwest of Baghdad and illuminated two US F-15
fighter jets with radar. The US planes responded with air-to-air
Sparrow and Amraam missiles. Fifteen minutes later and 62 miles
away, two more MIG-25s challenged a pair of Navy F-14 fighters from
the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson. They responded by firing two
Phoenix missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iraqi planes...turned sharply and beat a hasty retreat,''
said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``They escaped without being
shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``the US planes returned safely to their bases.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq acknowledged the American attack but denied that Iraqi war
planes had been downed in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hawks of our brave air force confronted and clashed with
the aggressive American and British planes...and the enemy planes
withdrew,'' according to military official quoted in the government
Iraqi News Agency. But he added that ``all the planes of our air
force returned to their bases safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said he did not understand Saddam Hussein's motives in
ordering the Iraqi airforce to challenge the American pilots. But
he warned that the US was poised to retaliate with considerable
force if Iraq conitnued to defy the no fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shown our willingess to strike with surprise and force
in the past and that remains an option in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Britain and France imposed the no-fly zones
over northern and southern Iraq following the end of the 1991 Gulf
War. France later stopped flying the missions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States claims the scheme, which covers more than 60
percent of Iraqi territory, is designed to prevent Iraq from using
its air force to attack its neighbors or to bomb the minority Kurds
and Shiites who live in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that the United States would continue to
enforce the no fly zone. ``We have said we will vigorously enforce
the no fly zone, both in the south and in the north, and
(Tuesday's) action indicates we will continue to do that,'' said
White House national security spokesman P.J. Crowley. ``We take
these challenges seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq claims that no-fly zones are a violation of Iraqi
sovereignty. Since the US bombing campaign ended last month, Iraq
has repeatedly challenged American and British war planes
patrolling the zones. Last week, Iraqi anti-defense repeatedly
fired on American and British air patrols.
</P>
<P>
   The US crews returned fire, destroying air defense batteries in
northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to cow Arab nations into breaking ranks with the
United States, Saddam Hussein turned up the pressure, appealing to
the citizens of pro-Western Arab nations to rise up against their
leaders for helping Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolt against those who boast of friendship with the United
States, those who are guided by (US Defense Secretary) William
Cohen,'' Hussein said in the speech broadcast by Qatar's Al-Jazeera
Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dwarves on their thrones will be forced to hear you, or
else they will step down to give way for the people to say their
opinion and take their action.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq also has hinted at evicting 14 American or British UN
humanitarian workers on its soil, but the United Nations Tuesday
issued a statement rejecting any attempt to remove those workers.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's attempt to forge Arab antipathy toward Washington has
drawn a bitter response from some quarters. Egypt's
state-controlled media delivered a coordinated rhetorical attack on
Iraq's leader, calling him the worst leader Iraq has even known.
</P>
<P>
   Mursi Atallah, editor of the Egypt's official government paper,
Al-Ahram Al-Massai, went further: ``The only hope for the Iraqi
people is a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say Iraq's strategy is bearing fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, which provides military base for American
patrolling the southern no fly zone, told the Americans it can no
longer launch air strikes on Iraq from its country. The United
States, which normally uses Saudi Arabia as a base for its
operation in southern Iraq, called in Navy F-14 fighters jets from
the USS Carl Vinson to participate in Tuesday's patrol of the
southern no fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saudi Arabia said last week that it would not allow its soil
to be used to launch air strikes against Iraq,'' said Bill Arkin, a
Washington-based expert on the Iraqi military. ``The biggest danger
for the US is losing their operating bases on the basis of this tit
for tat.''

RYAN, BRETT, YOUNT ENTER HALL OF FAME IN FIRST-BALLOT BONANZA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a first-ballot bonanza unseen in more than 60 years, Nolan
Ryan, George Brett and Robin Yount breezed into baseball's Hall of
Fame Tuesday. Ryan and Brett made the trip in particularly
glittering fashion.
</P>
<P>
   With a record number of votes cast, 497, Ryan received all but
six for a record 491 and Brett all but 9. None of the 91 players
chosen by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers Association has
ever been elected unanimously. Ryan's 98.79 percentage is the
second highest, just a fraction behind Tom Seaver's 98.84 percent
in 1992, when five voters failed to vote for Ryan's old teammate.
Brett gained 98.19 percent, placing him fourth behind Ty Cobb's
98.23 percent in 1936, the first year of the Hall of Fame election.
</P>
<P>
   With Yount getting 385 votes, or 77.46 percent, the writers
elected the most first-time candidates since that first election,
when Cobb was joined by Babe Ruth, Honus Wagner, Walter Johnson and
Christy Mathewson. No more than two first-timers had been elected
in the same year since.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have to receive 75 percent of the ballots cast for
election. That figure this time was 373. Carlton Fisk, another
first-timer, fell 43 votes short with 330, the fourth highest
number in the annual election.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the voting was not surprising; the vote totals
for Ryan and Brett were impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly an honor, that I was thought of on that
level,'' Ryan said during a telephone conference call with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Brett said he was flabbergasted. ``It just knocked me on the
floor,'' he said of his vote total. But Brett's reaction to Yount's
election was even more emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining that he and Yount had become close friends, Brett
broke down and cried while talking about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was told I was in,'' Brett said, ``in all honesty I was
just as pleased that Robin was going in, too. Robin was the guy I
enjoyed playing with the most.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Yount had his call with reporters, he had heard that
Brett had cried while talking about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty touching that he'd do that,'' Yount said. ``For
whatever reason, we've always hit it off. To me, George was the
prototypical baseball player. I loved watching him play. When he
played, you couldn't tell whether he was out there in a Little
League game playing for a snow cone after the game. That was his
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was ever a player I would have wanted to be, it would
have been George Brett. He played the game the way it was supposed
to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 20 years and 21 days with the Kansas City Royals,
Brett, primarily a third baseman but a first baseman late in life,
played the game so hard that he often wound up paying for it.
Injuries cost him the equivalent of about two full seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He nevertheless found time to produce 3,154 hits, 13th most in
major league history, hit 317 home runs and drive in 1,595 runs in
2,707 games. He also rapped 665 doubles, fifth most in history, and
had 1,119 extra-base hits, the 10th highest total.
</P>
<P>
   Like Brett, Yount played his entire career with one team. Yount
joined the Milwaukee Brewers when he was 18, after only one season
in the minor leagues, and didn't leave until he retired 20 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Milwaukee and the whole state were part of me
staying there,'' said Yount, who began his career as a shortstop
(1,479 games) and ended it as a center fielder (1,218). ``They are
genuine, loyal, down home fans back there and they made it very
easy for me to play baseball in Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   As commissioner of baseball, Bud Selig Tuesday issued a
statement applauding the election of all three players, but in his
previous life, he was the owner and operator of the Brewers and he
lived and died with Yount every one of those 20 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, Yount collected 3,142 hits, now 15th on the
all-time list, and drove in 1,406 runs in 2,856 games. Like Brett,
he is his team's all-time leader in virtually every offensive
category. His most notable deficiency was his batting average,
which was only .285. Yount and Brett each gained his 3,000th hit in
the same month, September 1992, Brett three weeks after Yount.
</P>
<P>
   The two players had something else in common - they struck out
just about the same number of times against Ryan (Brett 18, Yount
16).
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' Brett said of Ryan, ``I didn't like
him too much because he was such a good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was a very good pitcher for a remarkably long time. His 27
seasons in the majors is the longest anyone has ever played, and no
other pitcher threw as hard for anywhere near as long as he did. A
New York orthopedic shoulder specialist recently was marveling at
how someone could last as long as Ryan did doing it the way he did
and accomplishing what he did.
</P>
<P>
   During his storied career, Ryan struck out 5,714 batters in
5,387 innings and pitched seven no-hitters. Those are two of the
many all-time records he holds. When he retired after the 1993
season, he held or shared 53 major league records.
</P>
<P>
   In his conversation with reporters Tuesday, Ryan, when asked
what he was most proud of from his career, didn't cite any of the
records or numbers but said he derived the most satisfaction from
``my longevity and that I was able to maintain my style of
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan played for the Mets, the California Angels, the Houston
Astros (who made him baseball's first $1 million-a-year player) and
the Texas Rangers. He said he expected to wear a Rangers cap for
his plaque at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel those five years with the Rangers brought a focus on my
career to another level,'' he said. Ryan, a right-hander, threw his
last two no-hitters with the Rangers, the last one 18 years after
his first.

WINE OF THE WEEK

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Simi Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 1994, Sonoma County,
California. About $46. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It must be nice to be LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the
luxury conglomerate, and own vineyards and wineries all over the
place. Take this luscious cabernet from Simi Winery, an LVMH
property. When Simi's winemakers ran out of grapes from their
Alexander Valley vineyards, still not fully recovered from the
deadly phylloxera blight, they turned to their Napa Valley sister
winery, Domaine Chandon, another LVMH operation, which had plenty
of good cabernet in its vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Because 76 percent of the grapes came from Simi's Sonoma
vineyards, the wine was entitled to the Sonoma County appellation.
It spent 16 months in French oak, then 18 months in bottle before
being released.
</P>
<P>
   One of California's oldest wineries, Simi has a reputation for
making fine cabernets. This one is no exception. It is a rich,
intense wine with a long, beautiful finish and good structure,
thanks in part to those Napa grapes. It is a bit expensive, though.

CLINTON EASES CUBAN EMBARGO A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND TERESA MEARS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Balancing demands from exile groups that want to
isolate Fidel Castro and US companies that hope to sell products in
Cuba, President Clinton slightly eased the Cuban embargo Tuesday,
mixing ``baseball diplomacy'' with modest trade concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would allow more flights to Cuba, increase sales
of farm products to Cuban entrepreneurs and start cultural and
athletic exchanges. But the president ignored the recommendations
of a bipartisan group that called for a presidential commission to
consider lifting the 37-year-old trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   While several analysts who specialize in Latin America called
the shift in policy an important symbolic opening, many business
leaders said it fell far short of the sweeping changes advocated by
the bipartisan group, which was led by senators John Warner, a
Virginia Republican, and Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those familiar with the fights over Cuba policy say
Castro's government is likely to reject many of the proposals.
``The safe bet is that Cuba will block some of the measures, and
they may block all,'' said Richard Nuccio, a former Clinton
administration Cuba specialist now at Harvard University's
Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for Cuba's diplomatic mission played
down the importance of the US moves. ``These steps don't indicate
that they want more relations because if they did they would have
followed the recommendations of the Warner committee,'' said the
spokesman, Luis Fernandez. ``If they want more relations, really
they should lift the embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright had consulted on the issue with a wide range of political,
business, and religious leaders, including Cardinal Bernard Law of
Boston. Law and several members of Congress, including J. Joseph
Moakley of South Boston and Jim McGovern of Worcester, Mass., both
Democrats, have urged Clinton to reverse the embargo and encourage
trade and tourism with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley and McGovern applauded the change Tuesday, but issued a
statement calling Cuba policy a Cold War relic. The two
congressmen, who visited Cuba in 1996 and last year, met Tuesday
with Cuban diplomats to plan another trip. In Havana, they said,
they will demand respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's move, which was leaked to several news organizations
Monday, has been interpreted in vastly different ways by exile
groups and business associations. The contrast was clear by the
headlines in Tuesday's Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald, newspapers
published by the same company. ``US Easing Contacts With Cuba,''
read the headline in the English-language paper, while the Spanish
version said, ``White House Says Cuban Embargo will Not be
Changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's two Cuban American members of Congress,
Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both
Republicans, blasted the announcement. ``While today's announcement
does have a few positive elements, these are merely included to
hide the damning items and to mask the Clinton administration's
true intention of normalizing relations with the Cuban dictator,''
Ros-Lehtinen said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line exile groups agreed with some aspects of the plan, but
they rejected the idea of selling food and agricultural products in
the island. That ``only reinforces the perception that what
motivates US foreign policy is greed and the corporate bottom line,
not freedom and solidarity with oppressed people,'' the Cuban
American National Foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said the slight thawing of relations was helped by
the visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba last January. Legislation
signed by Clinton three years ago leaves the president little power
to lift the embargo without approval from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One breakthrough announced by the administration is a plan to
allow the Baltimore Orioles to hold an exhibition game in Cuba and
to permit a Cuban team to play a game in Baltimore. Such games
would be a long way from starting a regular competition, but they
would be a break from the past, when the Treasury Department, which
oversees sanctions, routinely denied travel permits to both
American and Cuban organizations. In 1975-78, several major league
teams were invited to Cuba but were barred from playing there by
the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Clinton administration said the Orioles game will
be allowed only if profits go to humanitarian assistance in Cuba,
not to the Castro regime. The US government also is making it
easier to send Cuban families money _ up to $1,200 a year. And the
administration has proposed starting direct mail service to the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Birns, founder of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in
Washington, dismissed the policy as a ``limited response by the
administration to a clamorous demand being made internationally and
nationally for a revision of US policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro, a senior research associate at the North-South
Center at the University of Miami, called the measures an
``incrementalist, minimalist step that will have minimal results.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Miami, Jose Basulto, leader of the exile group Brothers
to the Rescue, whose four fliers were shot down and killed by the
Cuban military in 1996, was skeptical of the Clinton
administration's commitment to change in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement doesn't do anything,'' he said. ``I want
action, not promises.'' He suggested that the announcement was
motivated more by the coming of the next presidential election than
any desire to shake up policy. ``We're getting into the time when
politicians start making their overtures to the communities.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official acknowledged that politics entered
into the decision-making in this way: If Clinton had appointed a
prominent commission to reconsider the embargo, it would have taken
six months to agree on the members. It would have taken another six
months for the commission to make recommendations, and that would
have come at the start of primary season for the 2000 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any guide, the official said, the candidates
would simply harden their positions on Cuba instead of debating an
overhaul in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban American National Foundation thought that a
bipartisan commission would really open up the situation for a
rethinking of the embargo,'' said Dario Moreno, a political
scientist at Florida International University. ``Instead, Clinton
has done a little fine-tuning of the policy to try to give a little
to people of each side.''
</P>

BAY STATE WARRANT BACKLOG GROWING BY 5,000 A MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite an overhaul of the warrant system four years
ago, a Senate committee has found that Massachusetts courts have a
backlog of more than 275,000 outstanding warrants, and that the
number is swelling by more than 5,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that a criminal such as Charles Jaynes, one of two
men convicted in the 1997 murder of 10-year-old Jeffrey Curley,
felt able to defy the courts and walk the streets freely despite 75
outstanding warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Cheryl A. Jacques, a Democrat and chairwoman of the Post
Audit and Oversight Committee, Tuesday called for extensive changes
to the warrant system that would fully implement reforms and
improve the system's effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminals must fully understand that crimes have consequences
and that disrespect for the courts will not be tolerated,'' Jacques
said. ``Our goal is to prevent crime by getting more offenders off
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   A first-in-the-nation database of outstanding warrants was
established in Massachusetts in 1995, prompted by the February 1994
murder of Boston police Officer Berisford Anderson by a man who had
defaulted on a warrant in another shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Before this system began, outstanding warrants had been placed
in boxes and filing cabinets, making quick checks of a person's
court and criminal history difficult. The legacy of that process
lingers, Jacques said, because hundreds of thousands of warrants
issued before 1995 have not been entered into the database.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques criticized the Registry of Motor Vehicles as a major
hindrance to the state's efforts to punish people who ignore their
obligations to appear in court. The Registry does not comply with
state law to withhold new licenses from drivers with outstanding
warrants, Jacques said, and also has a poor record of refusing to
renew licenses for those who default on warrants.
</P>
<P>
   Angus McQuilken, Jacques's chief of staff, said the Registry
apparently does not check for warrants when applications for new
licenses are submitted. In addition, McQuilken said, the agency's
criteria for checking license-renewal applicants for defaulted
warrants is often too cumbersome to make speedy matches.
</P>
<P>
   Charles McDonald, a spokesman for the state Executive Office of
Public Safety, said the committee's report is under review.
McDonald said he could not confirm or deny if personnel at the
Registry, which falls under the public safety office, have failed
to check applicants for outstanding warrants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to better record-checking, Jacques wants to put
laptop computers into every police cruiser in the state. Now, she
said, fewer than 10 percent of motorists stopped by state troopers
are scrutinized for outstanding warrants, because either a laptop
computer is not in the cruiser or State Police radio channels are
being used for higher-priority purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as much about saving a police officer's life as it is
about catching a criminal,'' Jacques said, referring to the risk
that officers take when they approach motorists after a traffic
stop.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Curley murder, Jacques spotlighted two other
recent crimes linked to people with outstanding warrants. On Oct.
21, 1997, Annie Glenn of Lowell was shot and killed in front of her
three children by an ex-boyfriend wanted on warrants for possession
of cocaine and receiving stolen property. And last June 25, a
12-year-old Framingham girl was allegedly sexually molested by a
convicted sex offender wanted on six warrants including assault,
violating a restraining order, and defaulting on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can guarantee if a defendant can and should be held''
for defaulting on a warrant, said Judge Barbara A. Dortch-Okara,
the state's chief administrative judge, at a State House news
conference. ``But violent offenders, more likely than not, will be
held.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques included the following proposals, among others, for
change in the warrant management system:
</P>
<P>
   --Doubling the size of the State Police's Violent Fugitive
Arrest Squad to 12 officers.
</P>
<P>
   --Withholding state tax refunds, plus state financial benefits
such as worker's compensation and unemployment stipends from anyone
with an outstanding warrant.
</P>
<P>
   --Compelling the Registry to screen all new driver's license
applicants for arrest warrants, and to immediately suspend the
license of anyone wanted on an outstanding felony warrant.
</P>
<P>
   --Placing a laptop computer in every state and local police
cruiser in Massachusetts by Jan. 1, 2002.

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES BUDGET WITH AID FOR THE POOR
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ President B.J. Habibie announced his first
budget Tuesday, including a proposal for substantial aid for the
nation's 80 million poor people _ about 40 percent of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a recession brought on by the Asian economic crisis
and growing social unrest _ and with national elections looming in
mid-year _ Habibie made aid for the poor a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   The $29-billion budget, an increase of 17 percent from the
current fiscal year, includes $580 million for ``poverty
alleviation, the poor and the aged, street children, basic health
for the poor, extra food for babies and pregnant mothers and
families of primary school children living in poor and isolated
areas,'' the president said Tuesday in presenting the budget to
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The budget projects no economic growth for the year ending in
March 2000, compared with a decline in economic activity estimated
at 12 percent to 17 percent in 1998-99. Inflation is forecast at 17
percent, down from 66 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is the first since the country's longtime dictator,
Suharto, stepped down in May after a wave of rioting, in part
triggered by the economic crisis. The violence killed 1,200 people,
injured hundreds and caused millions of dollars in property damage.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto was replaced by Habibie, his designated successor who is
a mercurial, German-trained aeronautical engineer and former
technology minister.
</P>
<P>
   A senior government adviser and prominent economist, Professor
Mubyarto, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, said he
welcomed the emphasis on alleviating poverty, but he warned that
the social unrest already generated is a potential time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already happened,'' he said. ``People are robbing trucks
going from rural areas to the ports. They are stealing in broad
daylight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubyarto said the timely installation of a social safety net
should help. ``In the past, the government has been accused _ and
it is true _ of siding with the conglomerates,'' he said. ``But now
with the new government, it has switched 180 degrees in helping the
poor small people.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan on Dec. 19,
students held almost daily protests in Jakarta, seeking speedier
democratic reforms, an end to military involvement in politics and
economic affairs, and swift action to root out the endemic graft of
Suharto's 32-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the violence has been directed against ethnic Chinese,
who control a large share of the economy. But Mubyarto said that on
a recent visit to inspect the plight of urban poor in the central
Javanese city of Yogyakarta, he was surprised to discover that a
large percentage of the people in dire straits were ethnic Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The latest government figures show that 80 million people are
living in poverty, compared with 22.5 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the budget expenditure is for projects like dams, toll
roads or other big projects,'' Economics Minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said Tuesday. ``There will be small projects scattered
in regions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the priority would be on projects to create jobs
and that regional governments would have more autonomy in managing
the social safety net.
</P>
<P>
   The money will come from government revenues and international
loans and grants. The government plans to speed its privatization
program, and forecasts earnings of $1.6 billion from the sale of
state assets in the coming fiscal year, compared with $1 billion in
the current year.
</P>
<P>
   The budget includes increases for the country's powerful
military.
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices low, the nation's revenue from oil exports is
expected to fall. The price per barrel is forecast at $10.50 for
the coming fiscal year, compared with $13 this year. Oil export
income is projected at $52.3 billion, against $50.7 billion for
this year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the programs for the poor, the budget includes
$550 million in aid to agriculture. Indonesia's farmers were hit by
a devastating drought last year that left the nation short of rice
and many poultry farms bankrupt.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Alfred Lion, a refugee from Nazi Germany, founded Blue Note
Records in New York in 1939, he had no idea that the small label
would become an item of worship. This month, celebrating its 60th
anniversary, Blue Note is filling clubs in Manhattan with past and
present members of its roster.
</P>
<P>
   The widespread adoration of the label has its roots in the
Lion's extraordinarily high level of artistic production. Over the
years, the label recorded Bud Powell, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk,
Art Blakey, Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter. No other record
label in jazz has been as consistent in quality.
</P>
<P>
   And the art that has adorned its album covers has become iconic,
copied, used ironically on pop albums or as part of pop design. It
has become a brand name. In 1994, an English book of the label's
record covers confirmed that its imprimatur had extended beyond the
jazz world; a year later Rizzoli published a coffee-table book of
photographs by the label's co-founder, Francis Wolff, called ``The
Blue Note Years.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been earlier hints that the jazz world wasn't going to
be big enough for the label: a discography and several waves of
reissues, including previously unissued material, not all of it
worthy of Lion's stamp of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz fans could talk about their favorite Blue Note record, the
sumptuousness of the label's sound. They could even discuss who the
engineer was (usually Rudy Van Gelder) and where the sessions
mostly took place (at Van Gelder's studio in Englewood, N.J.). But
nobody would have predicted the sort of adulation that has
transpired.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the label, which had always been a small independent
company, was bought by the conglomerate United Artists, and the
quality plummeted; it was no longer run by the legendarily
fastidious Lion, who died in 1987. By 1976, the label had closed
down. Eight years later it started up again. At the time jazz,
which had undergone the worst period in its history, was beginning
to show a quickening pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Note had also become the jazz wing of a major label,
Capital, giving it the financial wherewithal to work with. It was
to be run by Bruce Lundvall, a jazz fan who had been the president
of Columbia Records and later president at Elektra and Capital. As
an inducement to run Capital, he was asked to restart Blue Note; it
was his favorite label.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the intense interest in the label is a testament to its
own marketing plan: Lundvall has always presented the company as
special, distinct from the rest of the jazz world. To take
advantage of the hunger on the part of rap artists, the label
packaged a series of compilations intended for sampling.
</P>
<P>
   It licensed material to the mail-order reissue company Mosaic,
which put out anthologies of Blue Note material in boxed sets that
appealed to the fetish collector in all of us. And the company has
routinely figured out ways of packaging and repackaging the same
catalogue, creating limited edition series along with boxed sets of
some of the labels bigger stars like Dexter Gordon and Herbie
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   During Lundvall's tenure Blue Note has come close to reproducing
the impulse of the original label. He has had failures, but in the
last few years he has taken the company to its best position since
Lion left. It's now the only major label dedicated to the
adventurous mainstream, just as it was under Lion's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   This month's celebration might be seen as cynical on the part of
the record company, as simple self-aggrandizement. But for anyone
who knows Lundvall, it's clear that marketing and love of the music
aren't mutually exclusive. And Lundvall is anything but cynical.
</P>
<P>
   At 63, he's one of the few jazz record company executives who
goes out to hear music regularly; if somebody tips him off to
promising young musicians, he'll actually stay out late to hear
them. He'll set up auditions for those who come highly recommended.
And he has done his best to balance the needs of a major label
accustomed to thinking in the economic terms of pop music and the
unpleasant reality of jazz sales.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So Lundvall has signed pop jazz artists like Everett Harp and
Richard Elliot, whose sales offset the losses incurred by the
serious young jazz musicians he has brought in. The reissue program
produces a windfall. The CD version of John Coltrane's ``Blue
Trane,'' for example, has sold some 300,000 copies in the United
States alone; Herbie Hancock's ``Maiden Voyage'' has sold 150,000
copies here. And he has tried to keep the scale of the original
label.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, it released slews of albums because the economy
was right; while the albums didn't cost much to make, they didn't
sell particularly well either, usually between 2,000 and 3,000
copies. Jazz record companies today, caught in the pop world, now
release fewer albums and expect them to sell more.
</P>
<P>
   Lundvall, like Lion, has let the other major labels take most of
the expensive jazz stars and has instead worked on signing
lesser-known musicians and turning them into important figures. The
result is a string of powerful albums by the saxophonist Greg Osby
and a promising first album by the vibraphonist Stephon Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Lundvall signed the singer Cassandra Wilson when she was a
virtual unknown; she's now selling well, even in pop terms, and is
one of the best-known singers in jazz. Joe Lovano, the veteran
saxophonist, has flourished on the label. Lundvall has also signed
two of Cuba's most brilliant pianists, Chucho Valdez and Gonzalo
Rubalcaba. He has nurtured the career of the young, gifted pianist
Jackie Terrasson, releasing four albums by him. And the trumpeter
Tim Hagens, virtually unknown, has released four albums, including
a recent mixture of jazz and the dance style drum-and-bass.
</P>
<P>
   Like the original Blue Note, Lundvall's version doesn't define
any single vision of the avant-garde, but it does tread between the
old and new styles. He likes swingers in the jazz tradition, but
swingers that think, that are looking for the new without
forgetting the old. And there are exceptions to even his
traditionalism: the clarinetist Don Byron now records for Blue
Note, as do Medeski, Martin and Wood, a jazz funk group.
</P>
<P>
   There's a farm system at the company, somewhat like the one at
the original Blue Note. Lundvall listens to musicians' advice; Osby
brought the pianist Jason Moran to his attention, and Lundvall
signed him. The young saxophonist Mark Shim came to his attention
through the singer Betty Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The pianist James Hurt, who has recorded with one of the more
thoughtful of the current crop of Blue Note musicians, the
saxophonist Sherman Irby, has a development deal with the label.
</P>
<P>
   The farm team guarantees the label a future, as long as Lundvall
can keep the company solvent by juggling the money makers and the
money losers. So far, it has worked, and he has made Blue Note the
best of the major labels in jazz. He, and the label, deserve their
month of recognition, if not more.

CHARLES F. ADAMS, CEO HELPED SPUR THE RISE OF RAYTHEON; AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Charles Francis Adams, the helmsman at Raytheon Co.
when it became the model of the sort of high-tech electronic
enterprise that rescued the Greater Boston area from the long
economic decline engendered by the loss of its manufacturing base,
died Tuesday in his home in Dover. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   A member of one of Massachusetts's most illustrious families,
Mr. Adams was the son of Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis
Adams, the great-great-great-grandson of President John Adams and
the great-great-grandson of President John Quincy Adams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, he stepped down as chairman of the board of Raytheon at
the mandatory retirement age of 65. He was president of the firm
from 1948 to 1964, during which time it became the Bay State's
largest industrial employer and the 82d largest corporation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dennis J. Picard, the current chairman of the board of
Raytheon, said Mr. Adams ``infused Raytheon with his very heart and
soul'' and described him as ``one of the most remarkable human
beings'' he had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Set up in business by the Navy in the years just after World War
I to make a reality of a new technology known as radio, Raytheon
moved smoothly through the years from vacuum tubes to help invent
radar, to facilitate moon probes and, eventually, to produce
produced the famous Patriot missile, which was used with some
effectiveness against Iraqi Scud missiles in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Raytheon in 1947, Mr. Adams was associated with
the investment firm of Paine, Webber, Jackson and Curtis, becoming
a partner in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Mr. Adams was a great lover of yachting. But
unlike his father, who won international fame as a yachtsman, the
junior Adams described himself as ``a cruising man, rather than a
racing man.'' Cruising along the Maine coast was a highlight of his
summers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Adams, who had held a commission in the Naval Reserve since
his graduation from Harvard College, commanded destroyer escorts in
the Atlantic and Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   With typical understatement, the former Navy skipper, who
participated in the invasions at Luzon and Iwo Jima, said of his
military service, ``I wandered around both oceans, and saw some
marine scenery.'' In the Navy, he said, ``you are bored 95 percent
of the time, and scared to death the rest of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   On his return to the United States in 1945 with the rank of
commander, he was attached to the staff of Admiral Jonas H. Ingram,
commander in chief of the Atlantic fleet. After the war, he was
assigned to the Navy's Bureau of Personnel in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Long involved in community affairs, Mr. Adams was a director of
the Massachusetts Bay United Fund and chairman of the 1969 fund
drive; chairman of the The International Center of New England,
Inc.; chairman of the board of trustees of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution; chairman of the board of visitors of
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University; and a
trustee of the Children's Hospital Medical Center, the Industrial
School for Crippled Children, the New England Aquarium, the
Massachusetts Humane Society, the Naval War College Foundation, the
National Security Industrial Association, and the New England
Colleges Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In addition he had been a fellow of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences and of Brandeis University; a member of the board of
overseers of Harvard University and a director of the Harvard
Alumni Association; a member of the corporation of Northeastern
University; and a director of the Massachusetts Higher Education
Assistance Corp., the First National Bank of Boston, the Gillette
Co., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., Sheraton Corp., Bath Iron Works
Corp., Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the Boston Chamber
of Commerce, and Pan American World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   He held honorary degrees from Suffolk University, Northeastern
University, and Bates College.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Adams was born in Boston. He was a graduate of St. Mark's
School and Harvard College with the Class of 1932.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Somerset Club, Middlesex Club, the Brook
Club in New York, The Country Club in Brookline, the Commercial
Club of Boston, the American Society of Engineers, the Eastern
Yacht Club in Marblehead, the New York Yacht Club, the New Bedford
Yacht Club, and the Cruising Club of America.
</P>
<P>
   During his years at the helm of Raytheon, the company became a
leader in the rehabilitation of the physically handicapped. For his
efforts Mr. Adams received the annual award of the Greater Boston
Committee on the Employment of the Physically Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Beatrice (Dabney); two daughters and a son
by his first wife, the former Margaret Stockton, who died in 1972,
Abigail A. Manny of Brunswick, Maine, Alison A. Hagan of Fairplay,
Colo., and Timothy of Louisville, Colo.; a stepson, Giannotto
Penati of Washington, D.C.; 9 grandchildren; and 13
great-grandchildren.

BORING CLUNKER MARKS JACKSON'S FINALE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also FBC-TENNESSEE) 
(JT) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 12:05 a.m. Tuesday, the Fiesta Bowl mercifully ended. The
Tostitos were soggy, the Diet Coke flat. After 3 hours and 50
minutes _ not counting a 15-minute pre-game show _ Tennessee won.
The Christmas Yule log burned faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had everything in this game,'' ABC's Bob Griese late in
the game. ``We've had missed extra points, missed field goals,
defensive scores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything,'' Jackson said, ``but beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauty may have revved up matters (and might have saved us the
pathetic sight of a Frito-Lay executive trying to hand the
victorious Tennessee Coach Phil Fulmer a bag of Tostitos; here,
Coach, betcha can't eat just one!).
</P>
<P>
   But in college football, games rarely end in less time than
``Lawrence of Arabia.'' They may be exciting, but they're not
quick. If they could rush along like Lou Holtz's mouth, victory
could be declared. But college games are slowed by first down clock
stoppages and 30 minute half-time shows; throw in a sloppy one with
21 penalties, like the Fiesta, and you're not in Hallelujah Land.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta was the lengthiest game in the Bowl Championship
Series' quartet, longer than the Rose, at 3:35, and the Sugar and
Orange, both at 3:34.
</P>
<P>
   The 3:38 average time was 12 minutes longer than last year's
four bowl games, but shorter than the 3:42 in 1997 and the 3:48 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the National Football League's postseason seems to
breeze by.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four wild-card playoff games last weekend needed
more than the New England-Jacksonville's 3:22. The shortest game
was the best, the taut San Francisco-Green Bay game, which required
only 3:05. Regular-season NFL games lasted an average 3:04:38, up
from 1997's 3:02:38.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiesta's lugubrious pace led viewers to abandon it before
the final gun. When nothing much happens, even the national
championship can induce surfing.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking at a 19.1 from 10-10:30 p.m., the game concluded
with a 16.2 thud from 11:30-midnight _ a loss of 2.6 million
households in 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the 17.2 final Nielsen rating routed ABC's competition _
CBS rated a 10.9 from 8-11 p.m., with ``Sleepless in Seattle'' as
its prime attraction _ and finished 27 percent above last year's
Nebraska-Tennessee Orange Bowl, which matched the two top teams
available to the former bowl alliance. Last year's Rose Bowl, which
made Michigan the co-national champion, rated a 17.6.
</P>
<P>
   And with network viewership fraying, a 17.2 can't be a
disappointment, even if it were hyped as if it were the Super Bowl,
which rated a 44.5 last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fiesta was not a fittingly glorious game for Jackson to
retire on. His finale merited a classic. He got a boring clunker.
But his rich voice, singular verbal skills and personal grace
provided the reasons to hang in.
</P>
<P>
   As the day darkened in Tempe, Ariz., Jackson said: ``Nighttime
in the land where the Chiricahua used to hunt.'' Few announcers
could get away with a reference to Apaches. Fewer still would know
enough to refer to them.
</P>
<P>
   After a Florida State five-yard penalty, Jackson said: ``Oh,
it's a little thing. It's five yards. It's a nickel. But if you get
enough nickels, first thing you know, you've got a quarter, then a
heavy sack, and then you ain't goin' nowhere.'' From any other
announcer, such words might seem excessive, but they emerged from
Jackson as naturally as anything from Red Barber.
</P>
<P>
   He will be missed because he defined his sport. When a defender
rocks a receiver, we'll want to hear the old hoss say, ``I mean to
tell you, he put some lumber on him.'' Or, ``That was some
licking.'' Or when the Big Uglies have put in a hard day, there
will be no one to say, ``Griese, the boys who played all game in
the trenches won't be so nimble at the dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Griese _ perhaps an unlikely pairing because the
latter can seem stiff _ had more than bonded by this, their 12th
year together. Jackson's goading for Griese to be more emotional
last season in calling Michigan games featuring his son, Brian,
brought a sense of on-air friendship to their partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the moon, wondering why you didn't call it a
possum hunting moon,'' Griese said Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's not possum hunting time,'' said Jackson. ``Snow's
too deep.''
</P>
<P>
   After a fumbled hand-off by Tennessee with 1:29 left in the
game, Griese asked, ``At a critical time in the game, how can you
miss the exchange?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder, when that happens, why does someone want to
coach?'' said Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   At half-time, Jackson turned misty when Griese informed him that
a $100,000 scholarship in his name had been endowed at his alma
mater, Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cup will always be half full because of people like you,''
said Jackson. Despite his protests, Jackson survived the myriad
tributes paid to him during his last season. Although flattered
that Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, wanted to visit
him off-camera booth Monday night, Jackson fretted that there might
not be enough time between halves, when he wanted to prepare for
the third period. Jackson relented, and they chatted briefly.
</P>
<P>
   At night's end, the 70-year-old Jackson thanked the ABC crew,
and concluded his career by saying: ``And so, Phillip Fulmer has
been validated. He's now one of the legends that have spent time at
the foot of the Smokies. And so it is done. I say goodbye to all of
you. God bless and keep you. Good night.''

CLINTON EASES CUBAN EMBARGO A BIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND TERESA MEARS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Balancing demands from exile groups that want to
isolate Fidel Castro and US companies that hope to sell products in
Cuba, President Clinton slightly eased the Cuban embargo Tuesday,
mixing ``baseball diplomacy'' with modest trade concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would allow more flights to Cuba, increase sales
of farm products to Cuban entrepreneurs and start cultural and
athletic exchanges. But the president ignored the recommendations
of a bipartisan group that called for a presidential commission to
consider lifting the 37-year-old trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   While several analysts who specialize in Latin America called
the shift in policy an important symbolic opening, many business
leaders said it fell far short of the sweeping changes advocated by
the bipartisan group, which was led by senators John Warner, a
Virginia Republican, and Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those familiar with the fights over Cuba policy say
Castro's government is likely to reject many of the proposals.
``The safe bet is that Cuba will block some of the measures, and
they may block all,'' said Richard Nuccio, a former Clinton
administration Cuba specialist now at Harvard University's
Weatherhead Center for International Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for Cuba's diplomatic mission played
down the importance of the US moves. ``These steps don't indicate
that they want more relations because if they did they would have
followed the recommendations of the Warner committee,'' said the
spokesman, Luis Fernandez. ``If they want more relations, really
they should lift the embargo.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright had consulted on the issue with a wide range of political,
business, and religious leaders, including Cardinal Bernard Law of
Boston. Law and several members of Congress, including J. Joseph
Moakley of South Boston and Jim McGovern of Worcester, Mass., both
Democrats, have urged Clinton to reverse the embargo and encourage
trade and tourism with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley and McGovern applauded the change Tuesday, but issued a
statement calling Cuba policy a Cold War relic. The two
congressmen, who visited Cuba in 1996 and last year, met Tuesday
with Cuban diplomats to plan another trip. In Havana, they said,
they will demand respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's move, which was leaked to several news organizations
Monday, has been interpreted in vastly different ways by exile
groups and business associations. The contrast was clear by the
headlines in Tuesday's Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald, newspapers
published by the same company. ``US Easing Contacts With Cuba,''
read the headline in the English-language paper, while the Spanish
version said, ``White House Says Cuban Embargo will Not be
Changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's two Cuban American members of Congress,
Representatives Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both
Republicans, blasted the announcement. ``While today's announcement
does have a few positive elements, these are merely included to
hide the damning items and to mask the Clinton administration's
true intention of normalizing relations with the Cuban dictator,''
Ros-Lehtinen said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-line exile groups agreed with some aspects of the plan, but
they rejected the idea of selling food and agricultural products in
the island. That ``only reinforces the perception that what
motivates US foreign policy is greed and the corporate bottom line,
not freedom and solidarity with oppressed people,'' the Cuban
American National Foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said the slight thawing of relations was helped by
the visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba last January. Legislation
signed by Clinton three years ago leaves the president little power
to lift the embargo without approval from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One breakthrough announced by the administration is a plan to
allow the Baltimore Orioles to hold an exhibition game in Cuba and
to permit a Cuban team to play a game in Baltimore. Such games
would be a long way from starting a regular competition, but they
would be a break from the past, when the Treasury Department, which
oversees sanctions, routinely denied travel permits to both
American and Cuban organizations. In 1975-78, several major league
teams were invited to Cuba but were barred from playing there by
the commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Clinton administration said the Orioles game will
be allowed only if profits go to humanitarian assistance in Cuba,
not to the Castro regime. The US government also is making it
easier to send Cuban families money _ up to $1,200 a year. And the
administration has proposed starting direct mail service to the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Birns, founder of the Council on Hemispheric Affairs in
Washington, dismissed the policy as a ``limited response by the
administration to a clamorous demand being made internationally and
nationally for a revision of US policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Castro, a senior research associate at the North-South
Center at the University of Miami, called the measures an
``incrementalist, minimalist step that will have minimal results.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in Miami, Jose Basulto, leader of the exile group Brothers
to the Rescue, whose four fliers were shot down and killed by the
Cuban military in 1996, was skeptical of the Clinton
administration's commitment to change in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcement doesn't do anything,'' he said. ``I want
action, not promises.'' He suggested that the announcement was
motivated more by the coming of the next presidential election than
any desire to shake up policy. ``We're getting into the time when
politicians start making their overtures to the communities.''
</P>
<P>
   An administration official acknowledged that politics entered
into the decision-making in this way: If Clinton had appointed a
prominent commission to reconsider the embargo, it would have taken
six months to agree on the members. It would have taken another six
months for the commission to make recommendations, and that would
have come at the start of primary season for the 2000 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   If the past is any guide, the official said, the candidates
would simply harden their positions on Cuba instead of debating an
overhaul in policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cuban American National Foundation thought that a
bipartisan commission would really open up the situation for a
rethinking of the embargo,'' said Dario Moreno, a political
scientist at Florida International University. ``Instead, Clinton
has done a little fine-tuning of the policy to try to give a little
to people of each side.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE FINGER IN THE BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BKN-NBA-LABOR) 
 By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A man named Smith once told me the story of his two uncles,
Uncle Sile and Uncle Howard. They were chopping wood on their farm
one day when Sile said, ``Howard, put your finger on that block and
I'll chop it off.'' Howard did, and Sile did. Howard didn't think
Sile would chop, and Sile didn't think Howard would leave his
finger there.
</P>
<P>
   And so we come to the labor dispute between the National
Basketball Association and the National Basketball Players
Association. The owners' ax is raised, and the players' finger is
poised.
</P>
<P>
   David Stern, the NBA commissioner, says that Thursday is the
absolute drop-dead deadline for the players to agree to terms on a
new collective bargaining agreement. The players union is taking a
vote Wednesday of its membership to determine whether to compromise
further or risk cancellation of the season and the members'
considerable individual annual incomes _ the median salary, or the
range into which most players fall, is around $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   With half the season wiped out, the owners threaten to pull the
curtain on the rest of it. The players have not really believed
this will happen, figuring, not wildly, that the owners love money
as much or even more than they do. And those who were deeply
skeptical _ including this correspondent _ now trust that the
purse-lipped owners are in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The players are comprehending that the owners are not going to
give in substantially to factors such as the percentage of revenues
targeted for salaries (owners around 54 percent, players around 57
percent _ a difference of multimillions of dollars), and are
serious about restructuring the global licensing-revenue deal.
Right now, to take one issue, the players are guaranteed $25
million or 50 percent, whichever is greater, on licensing of NBA
products. Stern wishes to drop the $25 million guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   The owners sound justified on this, but the players refuse, in a
classic labor position, ``to give back'' on many such points. But
the reasoning is antagonistic. Ewing, who possesses the smooth
public relations instincts of Linda Tripp, has said: ``We're
driving cars now. The owners want to bring us back to horse and
buggies.''
</P>
<P>
   Owners believe that players have too much control over the game
that they own. It's not just that Latrell Sprewell choked a member
of management, or that Derrick Coleman arrogantly refused to abide
by a team dress code for away games and paid fines totaling
$41,000, at $1,000 a game, for the season. It's players and agents
trying to take them hostage, the owners believe, and dictating whom
they should draft or trade, or both. Oh, and ego aside, it's also
paying the huge salaries. Many observers, and players, have said,
``Well, no one's sticking a gun to the owners' heads and forcing
them to pay. Now they're taking a stand.
</P>
<P>
   If one moment crystallized the hostility and wrongheadedness of
both sides, it was last Oct. 28, when Michael Jordan made a cameo
appearance at a meeting between players and owners. Abe Pollin,
owner of the Washington Wizards, asked the players ``to trust us.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, in heated dialogue, said that if an owner can't afford
to run a team, he should sell.
</P>
<P>
   While Pollin, according to a fellow owner, said that ``Abe
shouldn't have said that _ I mean, the players hate us,'' it also
hardened some other owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``A player can't tell us whether we should be in business or
not,'' said another owner. And Pollin was the wrong person at whom
to vent such criticism. At 75, and owner of his team for 34 years,
he is the oldest and longest-standing owner in the league, and one
of the most respected. He was among those who weathered the bad
times and helped build the league into one that can continue to pay
players so lavishly.
</P>
<P>
   While some wonder if the owners' rigid stance has racial
undertones _ the contention here is that it is overwhelmingly
commercial, with some cultural and generational gaps thrown in _ it
would be hard to put Pollin in that disreputable category. He has a
black general manager, a black coach and has spent his own money _
$200 million _ to leave the suburbs and build an arena in the
predominantly black city of Washington, hoping to help revitalize
it economically.
</P>
<P>
   So what will happen in the following days?
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a deal,'' one owner said. ``I've seen David turn
on a dime before.''
</P>
<P>
   And it says here:
</P>
<P>
   The players will make all necessary concessions because most
understand that the deal will hardly force starvation wages upon
them and their little ones. Stern will magnanimously accept.
</P>
<P>
   And when the ax smashes into the block, there will be no finger
there.

TV NETWORKS FACE BLACKOUT OF IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a solid year, TV viewers have been privy to every twist and
turn of the White House sex scandal, no matter how untelegenic (the
unloading of the Starr report from vans on Capitol Hill) or
unprecedented (President Clinton's grand-jury testimony).
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the clock swiftly ticking toward what Pennsylvania
Senator Arlen Specter has called ``the trial of all time,'' the TV
networks are unsure whether they will be allowed to televise the
climactic moments of the story that has consumed them for so long.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the jury-like deliberations of the 100 senators who
will decide Clinton's fate after legal arguments have been heard in
the Senate impeachment trial. Those deliberations could be stormy,
fateful, historic _ and private. Senate rules are clear on that
point, according to Senate parliamentarian Bob Dove, the arbiter of
rules and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliberations in an impeachment trial are never open,'' Dove
said emphatically Tuesday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though TV cameras will be barred entirely from the
Senate impeachment trial; networks anticipate no Senate opposition
to televising other proceedings, such as the arguments of House
``managers'' and White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the deliberations _ governed by rules devised in a
pre-television age _ are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of being denied a chance to televise the final act
of a hit drama has the TV networks on edge _ and could also
discomfit many viewers who have grown used to seeing their Congress
in action. TV ratings have soared during each pivotal moment of the
impeachment story; for instance, when the House of Representatives
voted to impeach Clinton last month, all-news networks CNN, MSNBC
and Fox News Channel got some of their highest ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   Another cable network, C-SPAN, has written to Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott requesting permission to televise the impeachment
deliberations, but has not yet received a response. C-SPAN
spokesman John Maynard said the network's interpretation of Senate
rules is that the deliberations are open unless the Senate decides
to close them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our argument is, hey, you've kept this process open the whole
time, we've seen the vote in the House, so let's keep the cameras
on during the (Senate) deliberations,'' said Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sesno, an anchor for CNN, said he understands why, from a
legal perspective, the Senate might want to bar TV cameras, but he
argues that the ``Andrew Johnson rules'' the Senate is relying on
don't fit the realities of the television age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it almost inconceivable that 100 senators would, in a
case like this, deliberate in total secrecy on the fate of the
president,'' said Sesno. ``I think they would want their
constituents to know what their thoughts are.''
</P>
<P>
   John Moody, vice president at Fox News Channel, noted that many
viewers have gotten in the habit of watching congressional
proceedings, and ``taking away something that many Americans have
grown accustomed to would be unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time there was a trial like this everybody was
writing their stories with quills,'' said Moody. ``Things have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, during a brief appearance before the media Tuesday, did
not speak to whether or how the proceedings will be televised.
</P>
<P>
   While coverage of the other aspects of the trial will be ample,
network executives recognize that the senators' deliberations _
with potentially fierce partisan debate and a presidency hanging in
the balance _ will likely contain the most drama. The networks are
also grappling with other questions, such as how long the trial
will run and how many witnesses will be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so fluid right now,'' said Cory Shields of MSNBC, an
all-news cable arm of NBC. ``There are so many conflicting stories,
but as of this time, the specific details are not known.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and New England Cable
News plan live coverage of as much of the Senate impeachment trial
as is allowed. Spokespersons for ABC, CBS and NBC said those
networks have not yet finalized their plans.

DEMAND FOR TECHNOLOGY SHARES SENDS STOCKS HIGHER
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks rocketed higher Tuesday, propelled by a
ravenous appetite among investors for technology shares.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight session, the Nasdaq composite index,
heavily laden with technology companies, set a record. It was the
11th time the Nasdaq index has set a new closing high since
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Monday, when blue chip stocks rallied during the
morning, retreated and closed little changed, on Tuesday large
capitalization stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index were also in demand, with the S&AMP;P
hitting a new high.
</P>
<P>
   But the breadth of the advance was limited: On the New York
Stock Exchange, 17 stocks rose in price for every 14 that fell. And
the Russell 2000 index of small company stocks barely moved.
</P>
<P>
   At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, helped by a
strong performance from IBM, was up 126.92, or 1.4 percent, to
9,311.19. Despite the gain, the Dow average is still more than 63
points below its Nov. 23, 1998 high of 9,374.27. Volume on the Big
Board was moderate, at 784.4 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P gained 16.68, or 1.4 percent, to 1,244.78. The Nasdaq
jumped 43.22, or 2 percent, to 2,251.27.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, this is a carry over from the euphoria of
the fourth quarter,'' said Richard Bernstein, chief quantitative
analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there should be some disconcerting signs: Small stocks are
still not participating, people are not looking at the fact that
corporate profits are eroding and long-term interest rates are
rising. Typically, that is not a good combination for equities.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock traders and investors paid little attention to those
concerns, preferring to focus on fast-growing technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A number of prominent Wall Street analysts raised price and
earnings targets on a number of the best-known technology names.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock jumped 5 1/2, to 146 1/2, after Lehman
Brothers analyst Michael Stanek said the stock of the world's
largest personal-computer software maker could rise 30 percent over
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom gained 5 1/16 after Salomon Smith Barney analyst
Jack Grubman said the long-distance company is likely to see its
earnings grow nearly 50 percent in each of the next two years, and
at a 28 percent annual rate through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   IBM gained 6 5/8, to 189 5/8. Oracle Corp. rose 1 5/16 top 44
5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make equipment to link computers into networks
also gained. Tellabs rose 13 1/16, to 78 13/16, Northern Telecom
gained 6, to 57 and Cisco Systems rose 1 5/8, to 96 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, however, it was not a good day for Internet stocks.
America Online fell 1 7/8, to 146 15/16. E-Bay slumped 16, to 224.
Amazon.Com, however was an exception. The leading online book and
music retailer's stock rose 6 1/8, to 124 1/2, after it announced
that fourth quarter sales nearly quadrupled from year-earlier
levels, to $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the run-up in the stock also reflected a 3 for 1
stock split that took effect Tuesday, which encouraged speculators
to buy more Amazon shares, which have risen more than nine-fold in
12 months.

INCREASINGLY ISOLATED, IRAQ VERBALLY ATTACKS OTHER ARAB NATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
(subs 14th graf _ beginning XXX In private, XXX _ to remove
unnecessary `the')   (See also IRAQ-U.S.) 
(bl) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ A bitter war of words between Iraq and its Arab
neighbors has followed December's U.S.-led bombings, leaving Iraq
more isolated than at any time since the 1991 Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   As Iraq has accused the Arabs of failing to stand by its side,
Egypt has responded with particular scorn, all but calling for the
ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The confrontation became
even more intense Tuesday as Saddam called on Arabs to rise up
against leaders who have not given his regime their full support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolt, sons of the great Arab nation, against injustice, and
let your voices be heard,'' Saddam said in an Army Day speech
broadcast by Qatar's Al-Jazeera Television, an Arabic-language
satellite channel that is viewed around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking Arab rulers who he said took their instructions from
Washington, he said: ``Revolt and unseat those stooges,
collaborators, throne dwarves and cowards. Revolt against
injustice. Surely we will remain forever as revolutionaries against
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Arab governments explicitly condemned the four
days of U.S. and British air strikes that ended Dec. 19, and in the
weeks since, none have been willing to align themselves with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean they supported the bombing, only that they
have grown increasingly uneasy with Saddam's behavior in recent
months as he has refused repeatedly to cooperate with United
Nations inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arab governments, including Egypt, lost patience long ago
with Saddam's regime. But since the Gulf war they have generally
shied away from direct criticism, choosing instead to emphasize
their sympathy for ``the Iraqi people.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been seen as prudent because it is does not contradict
an Arab public opinion that has often been willing to excuse Saddam
for Iraq's woes. Saddam does retain a small reservoir of admiration
among the Arab public _ the air strikes brought demonstrations in
Cairo and other Arab capitals _ making it possible that his call to
arms will be heard with some sympathetic ears.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats and other analysts said they believe that Iraq
will probably be the bigger victim in the war of words, because
Saddam's calls for an uprising are likely in the end only to
compound his isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials and newspapers began their war of words against
the other Arab countries last week, singling out Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and suggesting that he was little more than a stooge
of the West because he did not speak out against the attacks on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a commentary broadcast overnight on Egyptian state
radio suggested that the time had come for ``the beginning of the
end'' of the Iraqi regime. It included the harshest rhetoric that
Egypt has directed against Iraq since the Gulf war, and denounced
Saddam by name as a killer, a gangster and the ``destroyer of
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab Nation has never known, even in its worst periods of
decadence, a leader worse than the dictator of Iraq, who committed
the crime of invading Kuwait, which led to his Mother of Defeats,''
Egyptian radio said.
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore those sentiments, Egypt's ambassador to
Jordan was reported to have met there in recent days with leaders
of the Iraqi National Accord, one of the opposition groups vowing
to overthrow Saddam. Monday night, Egyptian television devoted much
of a two-hour broadcast to interviews with journalists and ordinary
people criticizing the Iraqi leader for the suffering of the
country's population.
</P>
<P>
   In private, Western diplomats said, Egyptian officials have
expressed little more than scorn for the support that the United
States has declared for Iraqi opposition groups, on the grounds
that none represent a real threat to the Iraqi leader. The
diplomats also said that the fresh criticism of Iraq from Egypt and
other countries should not be interpreted as support for December's
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Egypt's harsh new rhetoric was prompted mostly by pique,
though, the effect has certainly been to draw a sharp new line
between Arab regimes sympathetic to Iraq and those that clearly are
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt has made up its mind about Iraq, and there is no way
back,'' said Mohammed Sayed Said, a senior researcher at the Al
Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said that
Saddam's statement was ``a not-surprising diatribe'' that
``indicated his isolated position in the Arab world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The intemperate, unmeasured and desperate tone, I think,
speaks very clearly to the isolation that Iraq faces in the Arab
world and the isolation that Saddam Hussein faces around the entire
world,'' he said. ``He's lashing out as a result of his isolated
condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that Egypt, along with Saudi Arabia, was
instrumental in securing the postponement until Jan. 24 of a
meeting of Arab foreign ministers that the Iraqi government had
hoped would take up its cause.
</P>
<P>
   The United Arab Emirates and Yemen, which have expressed some
sympathy with Iraq, had pressed for an early meeting. But the
Egyptians and the Saudis were determined to keep other Arabs at
arm's length from Iraq _ ``to slow down the train'' in the
expectation that anger over the air strikes would fade, the
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the incendiary statements from Iraq that have fueled
intra-Arab tensions was Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz's
suggestion last week that Mubarak was ``the only one in this
world'' who had said that Iraq, and not the United States, should
bear the responsibility for the U.S.-led attack.
</P>
<P>
   Another, in the Iraqi newspaper Babel, which is owned by
Saddam's son Uday, urged Egyptians to topple Mubarak and thereby
``reject their shameless ruler who has lost everything, including
his self-respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the Iraqi attacks that angered Egyptian officials was
a cartoon in Babel that showed Mubarak clad in women's clothing and
dancing to the applause of U.S., Kuwaiti and Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Another Arab leader criticized by Iraq in recent days is Crown
Prince Hassan of Jordan, the country's acting leader since King
Hussein began cancer treatment in the United States six months ago.
Aziz said that Prince Hassan was responsible, along with Mubarak,
for the postponement of the meeting of Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's broadcast, Saddam did not mention any Arab leaders
by name. But he called on the Arab people to ``correct the
deviations of those who have deviated.'' He noted in particular
that the aircraft that have attacked Iraq were flown from Arab
nations and Arab waters and that there were Western troops ``in the
land of the holy sites'' _ a reference to Saudi Arabia.

HISTORY REPEATS FOR DRIVER IN FATAL CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER AND PAUL LANGNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROTON, Mass. _ His journey ended precisely as it had a decade
ago in a nightmarish cacaphony of screeching tires, wailing sirens,
shattered glass and ruined lives.
</P>
<P>
   Again rural police scanners crackled with news of teen-age
death. Again parents grieved for children with buoyant, unfulfilled
dreams. Again tearful students at North Middlesex Regional High
School in Townsend clung to each other for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   And again Irving Chapman, convicted of vehicular homicide 10
years ago after a fatal crash in Pepperell, was behind the wheel _
exactly, authorities said Tuesday, where he never should have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard for people to understand. But Irvy didn't
mean it,'' said Robert L. Hall, Chapman's life-long friend who rode
with him during the deadly crash in 1988 and was again his
passenger Saturday when a head-on collision killed two teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like he's an evil person. It's just a bad situation.
A bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   As Chapman stood mute and in a neckbrace in Ayer District Court
Tuesday, where not guilty pleas were entered on his behalf to
charges of vehicular homicide, driving while under the influence of
alcohol, and speeding, relatives and friends of the victims
struggled to contain anger and grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel hatred towards him (Chapman),'' said Ryan
Andrews, a 17-year-old senior at North Middlesex High School, where
Chapman was enrolled in 1988 when he was the driver in an accident
that killed schoolmate Shawn Kinsman, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he finally gets what he deserves. You would think he
would have learned from the first accident, but obviously not.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Chapman, who turned 31 Tuesday, was drunk
when the 9,000-pound dump truck he was driving crossed a double
yellow line on Route 119 here at about 5:30 Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Chapman's truck sideswiped a Dodge pickup
before plowing head-on into a 1990 Volkswagen Jetta that was
carrying high-school sweethearts, 18-year-old Sean Wellington of
Pepperell and 19-year-old Elizabeth Hughes of Townsend, home from a
post-holiday shopping trip to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Both died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean was madly in love with Betsie,'' said Patricia
Wellington, Sean's mother. ``He was going to ask her to marry him.
They were really happy at Christmastime.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-school happiness may have had time to blossom if
Chapman had obeyed a court order in 1988, which, according to
authorities, revoked his license after the first fatal crash, for
which he was sentenced to two years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Registry of Motor Vehicle records, Chapman
continued to drive. Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney
Andrea Nardone said Chapman was charged last fall with driving
without a license and released on the condition that he not get
behind the wheel again.
</P>
<P>
   Ayer District Court Judge James M. Geary Jr., the judge who
released him last fall, Tuesday ordered Chapman help without bail
following his arraignment.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, Chapman's lawyer suggested that Saturday's
accident may have been caused by the truck's mechanical failure.
Attorney Douglas Parigian said his client, who is scheduled to
appear at a Friday hearing, was ``depressed and sympathetic to the
victims and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chapman stumbled out from the twisted wreckage on Saturday,
police said he smelled of alcohol and slurred his speech. Treated
for a collapsed lung at UMass Medical Center in Worcester, he was
released at 3 a.m. on Monday and turned himself into the police
hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anything,'' Hall, Chapman's passenger and his
friend since they were 3 years old, said Tuesday. ``My arm was
pinned under the truck and Irvy was sitting up on the window,
asking me if I was all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said he was drinking, but we left the job site at 4:30
and the accident happened at 5:30 and I don't remember stopping
anywhere for a beer.''

   Hall said he had just been down to get a cup of coffee in a
luncheonette near his home and heard people, who don't know who he
is, talking about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The people were ``saying that they should be put us in a
remote-controlled test car without seat belts and let the families
(of the victims) run the remote control,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Chapman grew up next door to each other and now work
together as roofers at MC Construction in Tyngsborough. He said the
1988 accident changed Chapman, making him more aware of the
consequences of irresponsible behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd give you the shirt off his back,'' said Hall, who watched
the Patriots game with Chapman in his hospital room on Sunday just
before Chapman was released. ``He's an excellent guy. He'd do
anything for you. It's awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's sentiments aside, the sympathy in this rural of
north-central Massachusetts near the New Hampshire border, lies not
with the driver with a lengthy arrest record, but with his victims,
who dreamed of attending college together after high school
graduation.

   ``It's not like they were in the wrong place at the wrong
time,'' said Dave Stevens, who supervises a string of gasoline
stations where Wellington worked, earning healthy tips for friendly
service. ``They were innocents. They were in the right place at the
wrong time.''

   IRAQ-ARABS (Cairo, Egypt) _ A bitter war of words between Iraq
and its Arab neighbors has followed last month's American-led
bombings, leaving Iraq more isolated than at any time since the
Persian Gulf war. As Iraq has accused the Arabs of failing to stand
by its side, Egypt has responded with particular scorn, all but
calling for the ouster of the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. The
confrontation became even more intense Tuesday as Saddam called on
Arabs to rise up against leaders who have not given his regime
their full support. By Douglas Jehl. (The story has moved in ``i''

   RUSSIA-NORTH (Pevek, Russia) _ Here in Russia's most northern
city, a winter's day is two hours of cheerless gray, the
temperature plunges to 40 below, and delays in getting wages are
measured in years. It is the edge of the world and the end of the
line for thousands of Russians drawn here during Soviet times by
promises of high pay and patriotic appeals. The colonization of the
north was one of the Soviet Union's most audacious ventures. Now
the dismal economics of the north has finally caught up with these
far-flung regions. Russia's new market economy cannot bear the
colossal cost of feeding and heating the northern outposts. By

   NY-GUN-SUIT (New York) _ In a potentially precedent-setting

killed by firearms in New York shootings are seeking to hold the
gun industry collectively liable, just as many recent suits have
attacked the tobacco industry as responsible for deaths and
illnesses from smoking. The suit is considered potentially
precedent-setting because it invokes ``the theory of negligent
distribution'' of guns, rather than charging liability on the basis
of the product's inherent harmfulness. By Joseph P. Fried.

``That's an option,'' D'Amato said Tuesday, unpacking boxes at his

   BLACK-FARMERS (Greensboro, Ga.) _ While pleased by the public
acknowledgment of their plight, many black farmers say that the
settlement will do little to reverse the stunning decline of
independent black farming, a livelihood that has carried a special
nobility ever since freed slaves were granted 40 acres and a mule.
The relief, which calls for farmers who claim they were harmed by
discrimination to receive $50,000 tax-free and to be forgiven their
federal debt, is too little, they said, and it has come too late.
And it does not relieve them of the burden of commercial debt they
took in when they could not get government money. By Kevin Sack.

TV NETWORKS FACE BLACKOUT OF IMPEACHMENT PROCEEDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a solid year, TV viewers have been privy to every twist and
turn of the White House sex scandal, no matter how untelegenic (the
unloading of the Starr report from vans on Capitol Hill) or
unprecedented (President Clinton's grand-jury testimony).
</P>
<P>
   But now, with the clock swiftly ticking toward what Pennsylvania
Senator Arlen Specter has called ``the trial of all time,'' the TV
networks are unsure whether they will be allowed to televise the
climactic moments of the story that has consumed them for so long.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the jury-like deliberations of the 100 senators who
will decide Clinton's fate after legal arguments have been heard in
the Senate impeachment trial. Those deliberations could be stormy,
fateful, historic _ and private. Senate rules are clear on that
point, according to Senate parliamentarian Bob Dove, the arbiter of
rules and procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deliberations in an impeachment trial are never open,'' Dove
said emphatically Tuesday in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though TV cameras will be barred entirely from the
Senate impeachment trial; networks anticipate no Senate opposition
to televising other proceedings, such as the arguments of House
``managers'' and White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But the deliberations _ governed by rules devised in a
pre-television age _ are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of being denied a chance to televise the final act
of a hit drama has the TV networks on edge _ and could also
discomfit many viewers who have grown used to seeing their Congress
in action. TV ratings have soared during each pivotal moment of the
impeachment story; for instance, when the House of Representatives
voted to impeach Clinton last month, all-news networks CNN, MSNBC
and Fox News Channel got some of their highest ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   Another cable network, C-SPAN, has written to Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott requesting permission to televise the impeachment
deliberations, but has not yet received a response. C-SPAN
spokesman John Maynard said the network's interpretation of Senate
rules is that the deliberations are open unless the Senate decides
to close them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our argument is, hey, you've kept this process open the whole
time, we've seen the vote in the House, so let's keep the cameras
on during the (Senate) deliberations,'' said Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sesno, an anchor for CNN, said he understands why, from a
legal perspective, the Senate might want to bar TV cameras, but he
argues that the ``Andrew Johnson rules'' the Senate is relying on
don't fit the realities of the television age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it almost inconceivable that 100 senators would, in a
case like this, deliberate in total secrecy on the fate of the
president,'' said Sesno. ``I think they would want their
constituents to know what their thoughts are.''
</P>
<P>
   John Moody, vice president at Fox News Channel, noted that many
viewers have gotten in the habit of watching congressional
proceedings, and ``taking away something that many Americans have
grown accustomed to would be unpopular.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time there was a trial like this everybody was
writing their stories with quills,'' said Moody. ``Things have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, during a brief appearance before the media Tuesday, did
not speak to whether or how the proceedings will be televised.
</P>
<P>
   While coverage of the other aspects of the trial will be ample,
network executives recognize that the senators' deliberations _
with potentially fierce partisan debate and a presidency hanging in
the balance _ will likely contain the most drama. The networks are
also grappling with other questions, such as how long the trial
will run and how many witnesses will be called.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so fluid right now,'' said Cory Shields of MSNBC, an
all-news cable arm of NBC. ``There are so many conflicting stories,
but as of this time, the specific details are not known.''
</P>
<P>
   At present, MSNBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and New England Cable
News plan live coverage of as much of the Senate impeachment trial
as is allowed. Spokespersons for ABC, CBS and NBC said those
networks have not yet finalized their plans.

HIP-HOP/SOUL STAR LAURYN HILL NAMED IN 9 GRAMMY CATEGORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hip-hop has been roaring on the charts _ and now it's roaring
into the Grammy Awards in unprecedented fashion. Stealing the
spotlight in this year's Grammy nominations is crossover
hip-hop/soul singer Lauryn Hill, who figures in nine categories
that prove the artistic, not just commercial, ascension of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Hill won two Grammys last year with her parent group, the
Fugees, but her solo disc, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' a
brilliant coming-of-age album, is earning the hosannas this year,
despite her being slapped with a lawsuit from studio musicians
claiming they deserve a lot more credit for the songwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Hill, the leading nominees for the Grammy Awards _ to be
telecast Feb. 24 from Los Angeles _ are crossover country-pop
sensation Shania Twain and perennial Grammy fave Sheryl Crow with
six each. Boston's classical, rock, jazz, and blues performers are
also well represented in this year's nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, it's the Year of the Woman with the 10,000 voters
who compose the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
Females dominate the record of the year field with Celine Dion
(with the ubiquitous ``My Heart Will Go On'' from the ``Titanic''
soundtrack), Madonna, Shania Twain, and Brandy &AMP; Monica. The only
males preventing a complete sweep in that top category are _
surprise _ the Goo Goo Dolls, according to nominations released
Tuesday from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   As for the top male vote-getters, the leaders are country star
Vince Gill and gospel singer Kirk Franklin with four apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy nominations were notched by Aerosmith, which scored three
including the single ``I Don't Want to Miss a Thing'' from the
``Armaggedon'' soundtrack); Keith Lockhart and the Boston Pops (for
``The Celtic Album''); Gary Burton and Chick Corea (sharing two in
the jazz instrumental fields); Martin Pearlman and Boston Baroque
(with two for best engineered classical album and choral
performance); cellist Yo Yo Ma (two, for ``Soul of the Tango _ The
Music of Astor Piazzola'' and long-form video for his ``Inspired by
Bach'' programs on the Bach suites for solo cello); storyteller
Sharon Kennedy; jazz artist Nnenna Freelon (for jazz vocal
performance); and bluesman Luther ``Guitar Junior'' Johnson, the
ex-Muddy Waters sideman who won his first nomination in 15 years
for his album ``Got to Find a Way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so nervous that I don't know what to do!'' Johnson said
from his home in Antrim, N.H., Tuesday. ``But I worked hard on the
album to get my message across to the people. I sing about what's
happening now, like the song `Home Alone,' where you're sitting at
home waiting for your lover. I've also got to thank the folks at
Big Sound in Portland (Maine), where I recorded the album.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Boston Pops conductor John Williams will compete against
himself in the award for instrumental composition written for a
motion picture or television, where his entries are ``Amistad'' and
``Saving Private Ryan,'' recorded with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-rock field was overshadowed this past year, so it's not
surprising that the nominees for best performance are a motley
crew. They include arena pillagers Kiss for ``Psycho Circus,''
Marilyn Manson for the very average ``The Dope Show,'' Metallica
for ``Fuel,'' Jimmy Page and Robert Plant for the mystical ``Most
High,'' and hard-rock conscience-bearers Pearl Jam for ``Do the
Evolution.'' Overlooked completely was rap-metal phenomenons Korn,
though strangely, the baseless German band ``Rammstein'' received a
nomination for metal performance.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy voters are notoriously skewed toward older-demographic
artists _ and many of those still popped up in the nominations,
despite the new blood of Hill and Natalie Imbruglia (up for three
awards, including best new artist). Many veterans had disappointing
years for record sales, but still earning nods were Eric Clapton
(two), John Fogerty (including one for the album ``Premonition''),
Sting, Aretha Franklin, the Temptations (for R&AMP;B performance by a
duo or group), and Bob Dylan, who unexpectedly turns up in the
country song category with ``To Make You Feel My Love,'' a mega-hit
for Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Several '80s artists also made comebacks. Earning nominations
were Brian Setzer (the former Stray Cat, whose Brian Setzer
Orchestra affirmed the validity of the swing music craze), the
ever-flamboyant Boy George, and Cyndi Lauper. Her ``Disco Inferno''
is honored in one of two new dance music categories.
</P>
<P>
   As for Grammy novelty, former President Jimmy Carter earned a
nomination in the spoken word field for ``The Virtues of Aging.''
You must need White House clearance for this award, since Hillary
Clinton won it last year.

   Jobs told an overflow crowd of almost 5,000 at the annual
Macworld computer exhibition here at the Moscone Convention Center
that color and fashion would increasingly become more important
than measures of megabytes and megahertz that have traditionally
attracted computer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Color is really a big deal for consumers,'' he said. ``We
think the most important question this year is going to be: What is
your favorite color?''
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on the momentum of the iMac, which was the
best-selling computer in the U.S. retail market in the final
quarter of 1998, the Cupertino, Calif., computer maker has dropped
the iMac's price $100 and is now offering the machine in five
translucent colors: red, orange, purple, green and the original
blue.
</P>
<P>
   However, some industry analysts said Apple's rainbow of colors
might cause logistics problems for retailers who would have to
guess which colors to stock, leaving inventory _ and perhaps
pricing of some colors _ vulnerable to fickle consumer tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a reason that computer companies have made all their
machines beige,'' said Kimball Brown, an analyst at Dataquest, a
market research company.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said the company had shipped 800,000 iMacs, which are
marketed as Internet-ready home computers, since introducing the
machine on Aug. 15. He also said that the company later this month
would report its fifth consecutive profitable quarter since he took
over as Apple's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of the iMac, Apple's fortunes in 1999 may be
more closely tied to a redesigned group of business-class computers
the company began shipping on Tuesday. Priced between $1,600 and
$3,000, the new tower-shaped Power Macintosh G3 has been completely
redesigned around a new polycarbonate translucent blue and white
case notable for wildly flared carrying handles and a side door
giving access to internal components.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in his trademark jeans, complete with bleach spots and a
small hole below one front pocket, Jobs received numerous ovations
from an enthusiastic crowd of Macintosh users.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, while introducing a Microsoft executive who spoke
briefly to announce several new versions of Macintosh programs,
Jobs said that Apple's relationship with Microsoft was ``like a
marriage _ 99 percent of the time it's terrific.'' But he added,
``About 1 percent of the time we argue over stuff _ usually having
to do with multimedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, testifying for the government in its landmark
antitrust case, an Apple executive accused Microsoft of trying to
strong-arm Apple into abandoning its QuickTime multimedia software.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also poked fun at his now yearlong status as Apple's
``interim'' chief executive. Playing off the company's iMac logo,
he said his new business card identified him as Apple's ``iCEO.''

 &HT;    Accountability in education may soon begin with Georgia
Legislature
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The hot buzzword in education these days is
accountability _ making schools answer to the taxpaying public for
their students' failure or success. Now the word is starting to
buzz around the Georgia Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   There's talk of creating an independent Office of
Accountability. Like an agency started seven years ago in Florida
or just recently in West Virginia, such an office could be in
charge of overseeing school performance, establishing academic
standards and possibly intervening where schools fail to measure
up.
</P>
<P>
   Accountability means both carrot and stick: friendly help or
mass firings; merit pay or withheld funds.
</P>
<P>
   For years, no one took Rep. Charlie Smith (D-St. Marys)
seriously when he proposed making high schools pay for the remedial
classes that public colleges must give to about one quarter of
their freshmen. This year, Smith will be the House floor leader for
Gov.-elect Roy Barnes. He has recently proposed tying part of each
school system's state funding to its performance, taking functions
away from the state Department of Education to give to an Office of
Accountability and finding ways to identify the worst systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even state school Superintendent Linda Schrenko, after four
years of deferring to the authority of 180 separate school boards
to determine success or failure on their own, has joined the
bandwagon. She recently said she'd like to see schools rated on
their performance, forced to adopt an improvement plan where needed
and, for those still lagging, put under new administrators.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature this year may see dozens of bills related to
school accountability, said Sen. Richard Marable (D-Rome), a high
school teacher who hopes to be reappointed chairman of the Senate
Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Marable is reviving an idea of his that was vetoed
last year _ education care teams, a group of master educators
funded by the state to swoop in like a SWAT team to help any school
that asks for help. Marable acknowledged that the state must do a
better job of letting schools know when they aren't meeting
children's needs. But he would not label schools as failures or
impose change from on high. ``It's kind of like an alcoholic,'' he
said. ``They've got to ask for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. DuBose Porter (D-Dublin), chairman of the House Education
Committee, doesn't want to label failing schools either. But he
plans to submit a bill that would give those schools three years to
meet clearly expressed standards, possibly using new tests of the
state's curriculum that the state is developing, called
Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests (CRCT). Where problems
remain, you bring people in to take over, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting in more money and trying to solve problems
across-the-board isn't going to be the answer any more,'' Porter
said. ``We've got to find out where those problems are, and find
out how to solve them, and solve them fairly quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Barnes has his own ideas about school accountability,
shaped in part by long conversations with Charlie Smith and in part
by the dramatic examples of Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina,
states that have seized the power to hold schools' feet to the
fire, battled teacher groups and seen student achievement leave
Georgia in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   But he will use his first year to lay the groundwork. This year,
he said, his education agenda will be modest, increasing funding
for alternative schools and new after-school programs. But next
year, his agenda ``is going to be almost all education.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to chair an education commission this year, with heavy
representation from the business community, that will look at three
questions. One is whether the school funding formula, under the
13-year-old Quality Basic Education law, needs tweaking, to restore
fairness among big, little, rural, suburban, poor and fast-growing
systems. Two, he said, is how to make the pieces of the education
puzzle fit together better, aligning curriculum and credits so that
students can move more smoothly from pre-school to K-12 to
technical schools to universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But three is, what do we do about failing school systems _
schools and school systems? That is where I want to coordinate and
have a fresh look.'' He said he agrees, in general outline, with
the views of Smith, his House floor leader, that schools must be
held accountable to statewide standards through a state-level
mechanism of rewards and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a small-town lawyer, puts it this way: Taxpayers,
parents and students hold a contract with their schools that
carries a warranty that the schools will educate their students.
``I want to concentrate on the systems and the schools that are
what I call breaching a warranty,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Georgia doesn't have pieces of rewards and punishments
for schools.
</P>
<P>
   A school's test scores are now widely accessible to the public,
on state Web sites and school report cards published by private
groups. For rewards, the state offers Pay-for-Performance, a
program that gives every certified educator in a school $2,000 if
that school creates improvement goals that win state approval one
year, then largely meets those goals the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the state Department of Education offers to send a
School Improvement Team into any school that asks for help, which
it provides through a two-day comprehensive evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   But Pay-for-Performance and School Improvement teams are
piecemeal, and rely on a local school's initiative and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Georgia has hundreds of schools that fail students
year in and year out without triggering alarm bells in the form of
public outrage or state intervention.
</P>
<P>
   For example, among the 1,024 schools in Georgia getting an extra
$200 million in Title 1 funds from Washington because of their
poverty, 537 of them _ more than half _ have been identified by the
U.S. Department of Education as ``in need of improvement,'' meaning
they have failed to reach agreed-on improvement goals for both of
the last two years. It is possible for these schools to win
Pay-for-Performance awards and enjoy modest gains by focusing
intensely on the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills (ITBS), yet still have
no outsiders visit the school to apply state or national standards.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, 123 schools have sought a visit from
the state's School Improvement teams, only 23 percent of the number
identified by Washington as needing improvement _ and those 537
troubled schools are only Title 1 schools, not the comfortably
middle-class schools that may be mired in mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   For accountability to work, all the pieces have to be firing in
sync, like the pistons in an engine, said Jim Watts, author of a
recent 27-page report on accountability systems in Southern states
titled ``Getting Results: A Fresh Look at School Accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   One important piece is having tests that are a reliable
reflection of a state's curriculum standards, said Watts, who works
for the Southern Regional Education Board, an advisory agency for
the region's 16 governors. The CRCT that Georgia is now developing
could be such a test. But just how valid are the state's new
standards, the revised Quality Core Curriculum? That's another
question Barnes said his commission will study. Then the state will
face another set of political challenges _ where to draw the line
on the tests between failing and passing, and how to draw a similar
line for schools and districts.
</P>
<P>
   Accountability also is a delicate balance, Watts said. The state
should set clear, high standards, but local systems and schools
should enjoy maximum freedom to meet and exceed those standards in
their own way. The ideal, Watts said, would be giving all public
schools the freedom of a charter school, operating under a state
accountability system based on challenging academic standards. For
schools that fail to meet those standards, the state should have a
range of options that override local control if necessary, from
``targeted assistance'' to direct state takeover, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The example cited by many school accountability advocates is
from corporate America, such as the move of Xerox Corp. to
streamline its bureaucracy so that every group of employees has
decision-making authority and an incentive to achieve. ``So systems
are set up to make sure that units in the organization that make
continuous improvements are rewarded and that units that do not
improve face consequences,'' wrote Marc S. Tucker and Charles S.
Clark, of the National Center on Education and the Economy, in an
education magazine cover story this month on school accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes has assured teacher groups that he will continue to push
Georgia teacher salaries, now $37,378 according to the National
Education Association, toward the national average of $39,385, a
goal Gov. Zell Miller pursued.
</P>
<P>
   And he is sure to please the education establishment by looking
at ways to continue shrinking class sizes, especially in
kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   But he will not veer from his tort-law concept that schools
failing to fulfill their implied contract with children and
taxpayers should face damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you breach the warranty,'' Barnes said, ``the
damages are that you've got to pay for the breach.''

 &HT;    Grammys' wonder women
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Women rule the 1999 Grammy Award nominations. Or, to
put it in less politically correct terms: Grammy's gone girl crazy!
</P>
<P>
   And, surprise, the one it's craziest about isn't ubiquitous
``Titanic'' warbler Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   It's Lauryn Hill, the vocalist from hip-hop trio Fugees, whose
debut solo album, ``The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,'' boosted the
23-year-old New Yorker to 10 nominations _ including best new
artist, producer of the year and a big one for album of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a strong statement, in these days, that I can
make an album completely from my soul and without compromise and be
acknowledged for it,'' Hill said in a faxed statement. Her
breakthrough disc, which combines retro-soul and reggae grooves
with a strident moral consciousness, is a critical and commercial
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lauryn is a perfect representative for a lot of different
audiences, mainly because she's not coming from one particular
background or experience,'' said Minya Oh, music lifestlyes editor
at Vibe magazine. ``She's really well-versed in R&AMP;B and rap and
soul. She's been brought up on everything. And most importantly she
molds it in a really sincere way, so it doesn't come off as a
contrived hybrid.''
</P>
<P>
   Her album-of-the-year competition? All female, and, aside from
Sheryl Crow, a recent Grammy favorite who seems to have replaced
Bonnie Raitt as the award's requisite rock chick, not entirely
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Crow, whose ``Globe Sessions'' album helped to snag her
six nominations, album contenders include Madonna (''Ray of
Light''), the Shirley Mansion-fronted alternative rock band Garbage
(''Version 2.0''), and country-pop crossover star Shania Twain
(''Come On Over''), who tied with Crow at six nominations. Madonna
followed with five, a figure matched by producer Robert ``Mutt''
Lange _ Twain's husband and songwriting partner _ and engineer Jeff
Balding.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Dion need weep. The French-Canadian vocalist, whose
album sales are nearly as stratospheric as her soprano, nabbed four
nominations, topped by a record of the year nod for ``My Heart Will
Go On'' from the ``Titanic'' soundtrack. Yet, it's fascinating that
this most archetypal Grammy nominee was outpaced by a rapper
(Hill), a guitar-slinger who abides no Svengali (Crow), and a
phenom whose exposed navel raised a ruckus in Nashville (Twain).
</P>
<P>
   Other notable nominees included country newcomers the Dixie
Chicks and former Australian soap opera actress Natalie Imbruglia _
who'll contend with Hill, hot crossover tenor Andrea Bocelli and
hotter teen stars Backstreet Boys _ for best new artist; Grammy
perennial Diane Warren, whose Aerosmith/''Armageddon'' weepie ``I
Don't Want To Miss a Thing'' hangs tough for song of the year; and
Courtney Love of Hole, whose ``Celebrity Skin'' is up for three
awards, including best rock album.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta singer-songwriter Shawn Mullins began the new year right
with a nomination for best male pop performance. His
career-rocketing ballad ``Lullaby'' will compete with such Grammy
regulars as Eric Clapton and Sting. ``When I found out who I (was)
running against, I (was) like, `Holy moly','' Mullins said Tuesday
during a recording break in Atlanta. ``It's a beautiful gift.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta resident was last year's pop Cinderella story, but
he's only the latest local performer to win Grammy's attention. As
usual in recent years, the city was well represented across several
fields: R&AMP;B vocalist Monica was twice nominated for ``The Boy Is
Mine,'' her duet with Brandy, including a prestigious pick for song
of the year. The 16-year-old Atlanta resident was excited to
receive her first nominations. ``Then I started thinking, if I get
it I'll have to give it to my mom, like everything else,'' she
said. The singer, who was one of the presenters at Tuesday's Grammy
press conference in Los Angeles, found at least one new fan:
shock-rocker Rob Zombie, who kept asking to get into pictures with
her.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing the local spotlight was teen heartthrob Usher (''My
Way''), a nominee for best male R&AMP;B vocal. Outkast and
producer-rapper Jermaine Dupri will both vie in the group or duo
rap category. Dupri's ``Life in 1472 _ The Original Soundtrack'' is
also up for rap album.
</P>
<P>
   Dupri, 26, knew it wasn't any other Tuesday when he started
getting pages telling him ``Congratulations'' _ early in the
morning. ``People who have my pager number know paging me in the
morning is useless,'' he said. ``I'm in the studio until the
morning.'' And that's where Dupri was Tuesday afternoon after
learning he was nominated. ``I've produced artists who have been
nominated for Grammys, Kris Kross and Usher. But my name has never
been in the light. I'm proud. Grammys just mean more work coming
in!''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Shaw, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra's oft-lionized
conductor laureate, was nominated for best classical album and best
choral performance for the ASO recording of Barber's ``Prayers of
Kierkegaard'' and other works. If Shaw wins, his trophies won't be
lonely: The 82-year-old maestro, who spent Tuesday in Piedmont
Hospital (Atlanta, Ga.) with an undisclosed ailment, has won 15
Grammys.
</P>
<P>
   Departing ASO music director Yoel Levi also was nominated in the
best orchestral performance for the ASO's recording of ``Holst: The
Planets.'' Soprano Jennifer Larmore, an Atlanta native, was
nominated for classical vocal performance for ``Amor Per Rossini.''
</P>
<P>
   After rehearsing Tuesday for this weekend's ASO concerts, Levi
said he was taking a siesta when he got word of his first
nomination. ``I was exhausted,'' he said. ``The Brahms took all the
juice out of me so I felt drained.'' But he was delighted to hear
the news. ``I think it's wonderful that the Atlanta Symphony got so
many nominations. In today's world, when there are a thousand
recordings on the market, and any recording is recognized for the
quality of the performance as well as the orchestra, I think that's
an achievement by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Athens, Ga., hard-rock band Nashville Pussy would no doubt
agree. The group, best known for its firebreathing, 6-foot-6 bass
player, scored a nomination of its own. It joins fellow pyromaniacs
Rammstein and Metallica in the always lively metal category.

 &HT;    Al Franken's comic `Lifeline' revived
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBC's ratings this season are goin' down like temperatures in
Buffalo, N.Y. Executives blame it on the loss of ``Seinfeld.''
Another possible (probable) explanation: sheer boneheadedness.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit A in the ``all skull, no brains'' theory of why NBC is
foundering: its treatment of ``Lateline,'' which finally returns to
the schedule at 9 tonight. This very promising and pretty cool
sitcom _ a clever spoof of news and pop culture _ ran last spring
as a midseason replacement, got good reviews and reasonable ratings
and then didn't make NBC's fall schedule. Apparently that schedule
was too overflowing with winners like ``Encore! Encore!,''
``Working'' and ``Veronica's Closet.''
</P>
<P>
   So ``Latetline'' sat on the bench while Kirstie Alley
hyperventilated on Thursday nights. And as the final insult, when
NBC finally brings ``Lateline'' back, it goes up against the
established hit ``The Drew Carey Show,'' where it is likely to get
stomped.
</P>
<P>
   As deserving as ``Carey'' is, ``Lateline'' is worth your time,
too. It's not falling-down funny, but delivers its share of laughs
and is much smarter than most sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Al Franken (``Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot'')
was the star (he's still co-producer) of the fictional,
quasi-``Nightline'' show, but the first two episodes up now have
more of an ensemble feel.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, pompous anchor-twit Pearce McKenzie (Robert Foxworth)
starts doing comedy bits for Conan O'Brien's talk show and is soon
hooked on goofing on his own image, particularly when he finds it
helps him bed a younger demographic. Next week, Al Freundlich
(Franken) and producer Vic Karp (Miguel Ferrer), reportedly modeled
very loosely after former ``Nightline'' producer (now CNN
President) Rick Kaplan, go to jail rather than reveal a source and
glory in being poster boys for journalistic macho martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lateline'' continues to have fun with cameos, with O'Brien,
sidekick Andy Richter and William F. Buckley Jr. tonight and
presidential attorney Bob Bennett and O.J. Simpson attorney Barry
Scheck on next week. But what really makes it work _ not quite on a
``Larry Sanders'' level, but at least approaching it _ are the
little in jokes. Listen tonight, for instance, as McKenzie tapes
promo spots for local newscasts in various cities. Every city has
one white-bread male name (Bill Fleming, Brian Murphy) and one
minority female, keyed to the city (Kaneesha Watkins in Detroit,
Nancy Chang in San Francisco). It's not a knee-slapper, but
pointedly true, unlike so much else on NBC's schedule, which is
just pointless.

CHARLES F. ADAMS, CEO HELPED SPUR THE RISE OF RAYTHEON; AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Charles Francis Adams, the helmsman at Raytheon Co.
when it became the model of the sort of high-tech electronic
enterprise that rescued the Greater Boston area from the long
economic decline engendered by the loss of its manufacturing base,
died Tuesday in his home in Dover. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   A member of one of Massachusetts's most illustrious families,
Mr. Adams was the son of Secretary of the Navy Charles Francis
Adams, the great-great-great-grandson of President John Adams and
the great-great-grandson of President John Quincy Adams.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, he stepped down as chairman of the board of Raytheon at
the mandatory retirement age of 65. He was president of the firm
from 1948 to 1964, during which time it became the Bay State's
largest industrial employer and the 82d largest corporation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dennis J. Picard, the current chairman of the board of
Raytheon, said Mr. Adams ``infused Raytheon with his very heart and
soul'' and described him as ``one of the most remarkable human
beings'' he had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   Set up in business by the Navy in the years just after World War
I to make a reality of a new technology known as radio, Raytheon
moved smoothly through the years from vacuum tubes to help invent
radar, to facilitate moon probes and, eventually, to produce
produced the famous Patriot missile, which was used with some
effectiveness against Iraqi Scud missiles in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Raytheon in 1947, Mr. Adams was associated with
the investment firm of Paine, Webber, Jackson and Curtis, becoming
a partner in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Mr. Adams was a great lover of yachting. But
unlike his father, who won international fame as a yachtsman, the
junior Adams described himself as ``a cruising man, rather than a
racing man.'' Cruising along the Maine coast was a highlight of his
summers.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Adams, who had held a commission in the Naval Reserve since
his graduation from Harvard College, commanded destroyer escorts in
the Atlantic and Pacific during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   With typical understatement, the former Navy skipper, who
participated in the invasions at Luzon and Iwo Jima, said of his
military service, ``I wandered around both oceans, and saw some
marine scenery.'' In the Navy, he said, ``you are bored 95 percent
of the time, and scared to death the rest of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   On his return to the United States in 1945 with the rank of
commander, he was attached to the staff of Admiral Jonas H. Ingram,
commander in chief of the Atlantic fleet. After the war, he was
assigned to the Navy's Bureau of Personnel in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Long involved in community affairs, Mr. Adams was a director of
the Massachusetts Bay United Fund and chairman of the 1969 fund
drive; chairman of the The International Center of New England,
Inc.; chairman of the board of trustees of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution; chairman of the board of visitors of
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University; and a
trustee of the Children's Hospital Medical Center, the Industrial
School for Crippled Children, the New England Aquarium, the
Massachusetts Humane Society, the Naval War College Foundation, the
National Security Industrial Association, and the New England
Colleges Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In addition he had been a fellow of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences and of Brandeis University; a member of the board of
overseers of Harvard University and a director of the Harvard
Alumni Association; a member of the corporation of Northeastern
University; and a director of the Massachusetts Higher Education
Assistance Corp., the First National Bank of Boston, the Gillette
Co., Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., Sheraton Corp., Bath Iron Works
Corp., Associated Industries of Massachusetts, the Boston Chamber
of Commerce, and Pan American World Airways.
</P>
<P>
   He held honorary degrees from Suffolk University, Northeastern
University, and Bates College.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Adams was born in Boston. He was a graduate of St. Mark's
School and Harvard College with the Class of 1932.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Somerset Club, Middlesex Club, the Brook
Club in New York, The Country Club in Brookline, the Commercial
Club of Boston, the American Society of Engineers, the Eastern
Yacht Club in Marblehead, the New York Yacht Club, the New Bedford
Yacht Club, and the Cruising Club of America.
</P>
<P>
   During his years at the helm of Raytheon, the company became a
leader in the rehabilitation of the physically handicapped. For his
efforts Mr. Adams received the annual award of the Greater Boston
Committee on the Employment of the Physically Handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Beatrice (Dabney); two daughters and a son
by his first wife, the former Margaret Stockton, who died in 1972,
Abigail A. Manny of Brunswick, Maine, Alison A. Hagan of Fairplay,
Colo., and Timothy of Louisville, Colo.; a stepson, Giannotto
Penati of Washington, D.C.; 9 grandchildren; and 13
great-grandchildren.

 &HT;    CLINTON EASES EMBARGO AGAINST CUBA, DELIGHTING U.S. BUSINESS
GROUPS
 &HT;    With CUBA-EMBARGO-0106.
 &HT;    EDS: Corrects length of embargo in 3rd graf.
 &HT;    Moving in both the (i) International and (f) Financial
categories.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ President Clinton announced controversial steps Tuesday
aimed at easing U.S. sanctions against Cuba, drawing howls of anger
from some exiles, but enthusiastic support from U.S. businesses
that have lobbied hard for any loosening of the tough U.S. economic
embargo.
</P>
<P>
   In making the announcement, Clinton effectively rejected a
proposal for an all-out review of the U.S. policy of isolating the
hemisphere's sole communist holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``These steps are designed to help the Cuban people without
strengthening the Cuban government,'' Clinton said in announcing
the measures, which build on a previous easing of the 38-year-old
embargo last March.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measures, the United States will: allow direct mail
service to Cuba, expand direct charter flights to and from Cuba,
increase cash transfers from private Americans to needy Cubans, and
encourage the exchange of athletes, scientists and other
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles baseball team, for example, will be
allowed to arrange exhibition games with the Cuban national team in
both the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a substantial change in U.S. policy and probably the
single-greatest change in U.S. policy in more than a decade,'' said
John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council in New York, the largest nonpartisan U.S. organization
providing information on Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the most controversial measure is one that allows the
sale of U.S. food and agricultural supplies to non-governmental
entities on the island, including religious groups and Cuba's
emerging private sector, such as family restaurants and independent
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics blasted the measure, saying it would require too much
cooperation from the Cuban government, and could even be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing but smoke and mirrors,'' said Wayne Smith,
formerly the top U.S. diplomat in Havana during the Carter
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can sell food to groups in Cuba when the distribution
system is run by the state,'' he said. ``These moves just avoid a
serious and much-needed review of American policy towards Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith had hoped Clinton would agree with at least 21 senators
who have pushed for the establishment of a bipartisan commission to
analyze the effect of the embargo on America's economy and
relationship with its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., said the sale of food products may
empower Cuban President Fidel Castro more than the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since virtually nobody on the island has significant amounts
of hard currency except the government, who will be purchasing
these products?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Malone, an expert on Cuba at Georgetown University in
Washington, said the measure comes dangerously close to
manipulating the Catholic church in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has tried to be independent in Cuba, so it doesn't
help when the United States decides that food sales must go through
non-governmental groups, such as the Catholic church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. -- himself a Cuban-American --
said he will oppose any food sales to Cuba because they would
violate U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   The administration says any such sales would be limited to
entities independent of the government and therefore would be
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich said the sale of food commodities to Cuba could total
$300 million this year, but only if the Cuban government is allowed
to provide funds to non-governmental organizations so that they can
afford the purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most U.S. business groups applauded Tuesday's
announcement, saying it was a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think it's time to review our entire policy, and we
believe this is a step toward doing just that,'' said Frank
Kittredge, vice chairman of USA Engage, a coalition of 675
businesses working to end unilateral U.S. foreign-policy sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich added that the new moves could benefit a wide variety
of U.S. companies, including Atlanta-based United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on the Cuban market, U.S. businesses have pushed
hard for a relaxation of the embargo since the visit of Pope John
Paul II to Cuba last January.
</P>
<P>
   The number of American business executives traveling to Cuba has
grown from 500 in 1994 to some 2,500 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit, the pope emphasized his long opposition to the
embargo and urged the world to open up to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   In apparent reaction to the pope's visit, Clinton announced an
easing of sanctions in March that included a reinstatement of
remittances by Cuban-Americans to relatives on the island of up to
$1,200 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials reiterated this week that while the new
initiatives go even further in promoting people-to-people contacts,
none of them involve any softening of the U.S. embargo.
</P>
<P>
   They said that lifting the embargo would require a change in
U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would enrage Cuban-American voters, meaning it's one
the administration is unlikely to contemplate less than two years
before a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina greeted Tuesday's
announcement with some skepticism, saying it did not do away with
an unjust blockade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the first time that announcements are made of
initiatives that don't really go to the root of the problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright responded Tuesday
that U.S. policy toward Cuba was designed to promote closer ties
between people of both countries without providing aid and comfort
to a ``repressive and backward-looking regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The new measures are designed to build on the Cuba Democracy Act
of 1992, which tightened the embargo but also called for increased
exchanges between Cubans and Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But exile Frank Calzon, director of the non-profit Center for a
Free Cuba in Washington, warned that the measures mostly reward the
Cuban government, which is still a repressive one.
</P>
<P>
   ``These measures imply that the United States can play ball with
Castro, but that's not true,'' he said. ``Sure, you can play ball
with him, but Castro still makes the rules, which just isn't
right.''

   Movie musicals of the great studios of the 1930s, 40s and 50s
take the spotlight when the 29th season of the ``Lyrics and
Lyricists'' series begins on Saturday at the 92nd Street Y. With
Skitch Henderson as the host, Barry Levitt as the artistic director
and Fred Wells as musical director, the RKO musicals furnish the
subject of the opening program, which is scheduled for four
performances through Monday. Among the entertainers are Adriane
Lenox, Kevin Ligon, Ty Stephens, Deborah Tranelli, Sal Viviano and
Becky Watson; among the special guests, William Bolcom, Joan Morris
and Robert White; among the film clips, ``The Gay Divorcee,'' ``Too
Many Girls'' and ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''

   Royal art will get a royal outing in 2002 when Britain observes
the 50th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's accession to the
throne. Plans call for construction of a new gallery at Buckingham
Palace that will more than double the area devoted to the display
of the priceless royal art collection, numbering some 9,000
paintings, including works by Michelangelo, Rembrandt and van Dyck
as well as 30,000 Old Master drawings, 500,000 engravings and
etchings and 3,000 miniatures. At present the Queen's Gallery
houses only a fraction of the collection and is open to the public
for a relatively short time annually. Construction of the new
gallery, expected to be open year round, is to begin toward the end
of December.

   He acts, he writes, he directs. And now the multitalented
Italian star and filmmaker Roberto Benigni, whose ``Life Is
Beautiful'' has been capturing awards for most of a year, is going
to be the subject of a seven-film retrospective. Beginning today,
under the title ``Beyond `Beautiful': The Films of Roberto
Benigni,'' three films starring, jointly written and directed by
Benigni are to be shown at the City Cinemas Crown Gotham Cinema on
Third Avenue between 57th and 58th Streets. Besides ``Johnny
Stecchino,'' ``The Monster'' and ``The Little Devil,'' the
retrospective includes Benigni's performances in films by Federico
Fellini and Jim Jarmusch and ``Nothing Left to Do but Cry,'' his
collaboration with Massimo Troisi, director of ``Il Postino.''
Sponsored with Martin Scorsese, the event, through Jan. 14,

   If the acclaimed exhibition of Japanese art at the National
Gallery of Art in Washington since mid-November seems a little
different tomorrow, there's a reason. Because so many of the 150
works in ``Edo: Art in Japan 1615-1868'' are too fragile to stand
prolonged exposure to light, they are being replaced by an equal
number of masterpieces while the exhibition continues. The new
treasures will be installed during off hours between today and Jan.
14. The revised exhibition continues through Feb. 15.

   Current U.S. policy toward communist-ruled Cuba:
</P>
<P>
   The United States has had an embargo against trade with Cuba
since 1961. The embargo prohibits the export of all but a very few
products from the United States to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Travel to Cuba is allowed but Americans can't spend money there
unless they are licensed by the U.S. Treasury Department or their
trip is paid for by a non-U.S. entity. Journalists, for example,
can receive such licenses.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, President Clinton announced that the United
States would:
</P>
<P>
   resume licensing of direct charter flights to Cuba from Miami;
</P>
<P>
   allow Cuban-Americans to send remittances to family members in
</P>
<P>
   Cuba of up to $1,200 a year;

   streamline and expedite the issuance of licenses for the sale of

MARKET PLACE: KELLOGG MAKES CHIEF EXECUTIVE CHANGE AHEAD OF
SCHEDULE

<P>
   The Kellogg Co., struggling to wake up its sleepy breakfast
business, said Tuesday that its chief executive would be replaced
by the executive who had been widely expected to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In a special board meeting Monday, the directors named Carlos M.
Gutierrez chief executive, promoting him just six months after he
was named president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Arnold G. Langbo, who will officially step down as
chief executive on April 23 _ the day of the company's annual
meeting and a year ahead of schedule. He will remain as chairman
until April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Langbo's departure will end a seven-year tenure as head of the
maker of Frosted Flakes and Rice Krispies, a time in which
competitors stole once-loyal customers and investors became
increasingly frustrated with the cereal maker's repeated earnings
disappointments and weak stock performance. The stock has fallen 28
percent since its high of $50.50 in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While Kellogg denied that Langbo, 61, was forced to step aside,
analysts and investors said the company was under mounting pressure
from shareholders to make dramatic changes. Recently, many
institutional investors have sold their Kellogg shares. About a
third of the stock is held by W.W. Kellogg Foundation, the
company's largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would have to conclude after years of soft performance,
the board had reached a point of some frustration and end of
tolerance,'' said Art Cecil, a research analyst for T. Rowe Price
in Baltimore, which owns shares.
</P>
<P>
   Investors signaled their approval of the leadership change on
Tuesday, sending the stock up $1.8125, to $36.3125.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early but the direction seems to have turned right
_ for the time being,'' said Charles Mayer, a portfolio manager
with the Invesco Funds in Denver, which owns stock in Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the change surprised some analysts and investors,
who had expected it to come later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly there was a succession plan in the works but I think
it was accelerated a bit given the company's poor performance,''
said John McMillin, an analyst at Prudential Securities. ``I think
there was some encouragement on the part of the board.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Stewart, a company spokesman who only a month ago
emphatically denied that Langbo's departure was imminent, said that
there was ``absolutely no pressure'' on Langbo to step down. He
could not explain, however, why the board held a special session
Monday, just a month before directors were regularly scheduled to
meet. Several board members did not return calls and no company
executives were available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the changes, Langbo said, ``as the new
chief executive officer, we believe Mr. Gutierrez is well
positioned to execute the company's growth strategy amidst very
challenging marketplace dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, 45, has been seen as the force behind the company's
latest cost-cutting initiative, in which hundreds of employees at
its Battle Creek, Mich., headquarters were dismissed. He said his
top priorities would now be to restore revenues and earnings growth
to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that the key to growth for our company and the
category is investment _ in product innovation, in
franchise-building marketing and in the accelerated expansion of
our convenience foods business,'' Gutierrez said in a statement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like its competitors, Kellogg has been stung as consumers have
increasingly switched from cereal to more convenient breakfast
foods such as bagels and muffins. Kellogg has been particularly
hard hit by the trend because it is far more dependent on cereal
than its rivals. Moreover, prices of brand-name cereal have gotten
so high that shoppers have been switching to less-expensive generic
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   The company has struggled as a result. In the third quarter of
last year, Kellogg reported a 32 percent drop in profits, to $141.9
million, or 35 cents a diluted share. The company has also warned
that profits for the full year would be disappointing, possibly
falling as much as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As troubling, Kellogg has lost its place at many breakfast
tables in the last five years, with its market share dropping to 32
percent from 35.5 percent, according to Information Resources Inc.,
a research firm. While Kellogg is still the leader in market share
based on the number of boxes sold, the General Mills Inc. recently
surpassed Kellogg in dollar sales for a four-week period.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Gutierrez seemed the most obvious among company
executives, especially given the departures of top executives in
recent months, including the heads of the North American and
European divisions.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Havana, Cuba, Gutierrez joined Kellogg in 1975 as a
sales representative in Mexico. In 23 years at the company, he has
held executive positions in Kellogg's North America, Latin America
and Asia-Pacific operations. He was executive vice president in
charge of business development for two years before being named
president. In that time, Gutierrez was credited with pushing the
company to expand its offering of convenience foods, such as its
Nutri-Grain bars and Rice Krispie Treats, in order to be less
dependent on cereal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gutierrez has been a longtime manager at Kellogg and thrived
under Langbo's tenure. Many analysts said Tuesday that they would
have liked to have seen an outsider lead the company, which has
long had an insular corporate culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question we have is whether Kellogg needed more
change than could be provided by an internal executive,'' McMillin
of Prudential said. ``Should the company have looked more on the
outside for a CEO candidate?''
</P>
<P>
   If Kellogg continues to lose market share, the answer will be
clear.

THE WANDERING MUSEUM: OUTREACH TAKES ON NEW MEANING
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, Jan. 10) 
 (dal) 
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Art gets around. Museums are pretty well stuck in one spot, but
their treasures keep on truckin'. At a time when museums build
buildings that tend to be more significant than the collections
they shelter, some centers have gone the less expensive route of
converting existing industrial centers into galleries. A few others
are experimenting with putting art, at least temporarily, into
essentially unconverted places that respectable museums would once
have thought dreadfully infra dig: marginal retail areas,
department stores, dance halls.
</P>
<P>
   If a museum can install art in abandoned banks and garages, if
the New Museum in SoHo can call itself a museum though it has no
permanent collection, if the Contemporary Museum in Baltimore can
operate with neither collection nor home, has the museum been
redefined as merely a state of mind?
</P>
<P>
   A museum is still a museum if it's closed for a year or two, but
its exhibition potential drops alarmingly. At the Pompidou Center
in Paris, the permanent collection has been closed since September
1997 while the galleries are being restored, though the
contemporary galleries remain open for temporary exhibitions until
mid-1999. (The entire museum will then close until the year 2000.)
But France's modern treasures have not been stashed in mothballs.
Bernard Blistene, vice director for contemporary art of the
Pompidou, says with a tinge of horror in his voice that putting
such a great collection into storage for two years would amount to
confiscation.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Pompidou, a national museum and well aware that not
everyone can travel to the capital, considers decentralization part
of its mission. Already the biggest lender in the world, according
to Blistene _ approximately 6,000 items every year _ the Pompidou
is sending out more than 100 loan exhibitions while its doors are
shut. Among them are major shows of Kandinsky and Giacometti for
regional museums in France, 120 ``masterpieces of the collection''
for Tokyo, and the exhibitions of 20th-century art currently at
both branches of the Guggenheim in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Blistene is also organizing an enormous exhibition in a Paris
department store for March. This will occupy an entire floor _ more
than 16,000 square feet _ of Le Samaritain, a store where you can
buy a lipstick, a bike and a hamster in one outing. Le Samaritain
has never before regarded itself as a branch of the national
museums of France.
</P>
<P>
   This store, an early example of an emporium where people
discovered they could buy floor mops and frou-frou in one place,
will house a festival of art by young contemporary artists, many of
whom are marrying conventional arts to unconventional media. The
exhibition will include fashion, performance, music, dance,
lectures and happenings, all free. Blistene says he would ``like to
reconsider the generosity and diversity of art of this century, the
intensity and efficiency of contemporary art, not art as just a
dead object.''
</P>
<P>
   Why a department store? Michael Kimmelman pointed out in The New
York Times that in America, from the late 19th century to the
1950s, certain department stores maintained the populist ideal by
giving lowly shoppers a taste of high art. Some of these
exhibitions in the land of commerce were mounted with the aid of
museums. In the 1930s, the Museum of Modern Art's ``Machine Art''
show traveled to department stores in the Midwest. The French have
only occasionally shown art in a department store; depending more
heavily on Louis XVI than Thomas Paine, they have been more
inclined to use national fairs than commercial outlets to educate
the public taste in art.
</P>
<P>
   Blistene, however, is delighted with the opportunity to put art
where once only shoppers dared to tread. He notes that people go
where things are happening _ the Armory, for instance, the Piers
and the Gramercy Park Hotel in New York when they open up to art.
And he was looking for an empty place and a site for stimulation
and activity, ``a way to react against the temptation of being
melancholy,'' as he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that nostalgia is currently being used as a barrier
against contemporary reality but insists that art must remain
involved as well as critical. ``People think it was better
yesterday,'' he says. ``I think it's always better tomorrow.'' One
might think shopping was the way to cure melancholy in today's
society; perhaps Le Samaritain will provide an avant-garde
alternative to the capitalist anodyne it ordinarily prescribes.
</P>
<P>
   It seems only fitting that at a moment when museums are creating
virtual department stores within their precincts, the jazziest art
of the day should take up residence in the realm of the ladies who
lunch. And it is delicious to think that someday at Bloomingdale's
or Saks the mechanical voice that now and then pretends to be an
elevator operator might call out, ``Lingerie and intimates on four;
fifth floor, Pollock, Rothko and de Kooning.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who will not go to the mount of Parnassus, Parnassus
will obligingly come to them. Art long ago joined the rounds of
daily life via public sculpture in parks and airline terminals and
on occasional billboards and advertising pages. Museums, too, want
to creep into quotidian consciousness, to play a role in the
texture of ordinary, 9-to-5 life.
</P>
<P>
   They also need more space for display and are conscious that
they need to address different audiences. The Los Angeles
Contemporary Museum opened not one but two temporary spaces and,
like the man who came to dinner, they stayed on. In the late 1970s,
the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts had a wandering exhibition on an
``art truck'' until insurance and conservation permanently put on
the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years ago, the WPA/Corcoran, part of the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington but independent of it, began putting
on shows of emerging regional artists, many of them recent
graduates of art schools in the Baltimore, Washington and Richmond
area. The shows now appear in Project Space, temporary quarters in
a former nightclub called the Insect Club in a slightly rundown
business district. Metal grasshoppers as large as hallucinations
still stand guard by the door while the bar looms darkly along one
wall.
</P>
<P>
   This decor is appropriately rakish for the kind of installation
art that sends aluminum-foil leaves wafting across the gallery to
the sound of grinding gears, or displays suits that look like
torture instruments, with artists strapped into them on weekends.
MCI, the communications company, opened a sports arena nearby late
in 1977, and Nadine Gabai-Botero, the program director for the
WPA/Corcoran, says the area's economic good fortune will probably
drive out unprofitable contemporary art. Then art will be on to the
next marginal area, perhaps to spaces that are available only for a
month or two, prime for a lightning strike by the art corps.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guerrilla art tactic, to invade a location where art
never lived and billet the art troops there for a while, a maneuver
not usually employed by established museums. In the late 1960s and
70s, when artists were vigorously questioning and frequently
repudiating the role of museums, alternative spaces sprang up to
shelter art that did not want entry to museums, or could not gain
it. After a while a few museums saw the usefulness of such places
and began to set up their own alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Contemporary Museum has made guerrilla artfare a
modus vivendi. A museum without a museum, the Contemporary is a
full-time nomad, a homeless institution that not only has no
collection but has no location either.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1989 and headed since 1996 by Gary Sangster, the
Contemporary puts on two shows a year, one in, and in conjunction
with, a local institution and the other in some highly improbable
place, like a former Polish convent, a former Buick car dealership,
an abandoned bus garage without electricity and the former Famous
Ballroom, without either fame or heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish Dreamin','' a project by Alison Saar, was installed on
a 1959 Chevy pickup and driven into 80 neighborhoods in four states
over a period of five months, giving the term ``traveling show'' a
down-home dimension. ``Too Jewish?,'' a show organized by and first
shown at the Jewish Museum in New York, was exhibited in Baltimore
in a vacant shopping mall, a notable instance of art taking up
where commerce leaves off.
</P>
<P>
   This doggedly temporary Contemporary Museum first made a
national name for itself in 1992 when it worked with the Maryland
Historical Society to install Fred Wilson's ``Mining the Museum,''
an ironic look at the neglect of black people and American Indians
in historical displays. A show last spring, ``Mysterious
Voyages/New Photography,'' a bold exploration of the current search
for meaning in photography and art by artists like Sophie Calle,
Adam Fuss, Andreas Gursky and Thomas Struth, was in the vacant
ground floor of a downtown office building three blocks from
Baltimore's red-light district and two from a police station.
Visitor records revealed an audience drawn from both the
surrounding area and the art world; the attempt to reach a local
community must be working.
</P>
<P>
   Sangster says: ``We operate in the discourse of ideas about the
visual. We're not here just to expose artists or artworks but ideas
that influence the community through visual means.'' The
Contemporary asked visitors, including some local critics, to write
their own labels for ``Mysterious Voyages''; eventually three were
put up for each piece.
</P>
<P>
   Sangster would now like a more permanent space _ ideally an
aircraft hangar in the middle of Baltimore, if only he could find
one _ to give the museum a stronger identity. In the meantime he is
eyeing the Web, having already done one show on it, as the most
likely means to preserve the explorations of a museum that cannot
afford to publish. The Web, in fact, may be  &UR; the &LR;  outreach museum
of the future, bringing art straight to your desk at any hour.
Numerous museums and galleries beam it into your home right now,
unfortunately at a resolution not much more convincing than the one
you made on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   So what is a museum, and where? It may be whatever a director or
curator says it is, a rather new twist on Marcel Duchamp. Back in
the 1920s, Hannes Meyer, an instructor at the Bauhaus, thought that
museums should all be rededicated as soccer fields. The history of
art takes many curious turns; we may yet live to see soccer fields
rededicated as museums.

VODAFONE STEPS INTO AIRTOUCH BIDDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vodafone Group Plc, the largest British mobile phone service
company, is the latest entrant to engage in acquisition talks with
AirTouch Communications Inc., putting Bell Atlantic Corp. under
pressure to raise its purchase offer for the large West Coast
cellular phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone reportedly offered more than $45 billion Tuesday for
AirTouch, which exceeds an initial $43 billion offer by Bell
Atlantic that some AirTouch investors considered too low.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal sets up a potential bidding war for AirTouch
that could attract other offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the value of AirTouch is higher than the figures
quoted in the press,'' said Susan M. Passoni, managing director at
SG Cowen &AMP; Co. ``There is still no confirmation of an actual deal
from anyone, but based on what we've read about Bell Atlantic's
offer, AirTouch is worth more, and I guess Vodafone agrees.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Vodafone confirmed it had approached AirTouch
about a merger but declined to provide details, adding ``there can
be no assurance that any agreement can be reached.'' In turn, San
Francisco-based AirTouch confirmed receipt of a Vodafone
acquisition proposal which it is reviewing.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of a competing bidder with an apparently higher
offer sharply boosted AirTouch stock, which rose 9 1/4 a share to
$77.50, a 52-week high. About 11 million shares changed hands,
making AirTouch the most heavily traded stock on the New York Stock
Exchange. Bell Atlantic shares, which dipped on Monday, rose 3 1/16
to 55 Tuesday. And Vodafone's U.S. shares rose 4 1/2 to 179 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch, which was spun off in 1994 from Pacific Telesis Group,
is the nation's largest independent wireless carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``AirTouch is the last large and very good wireless property,
and if you believe having a global scale is important, the
challenge for Vodaphone is the same as Bell Atlantic: you need a
nationwide footprint in the U.S. to compete in a cost-effective way
against AT&AMP;T and Sprint,'' said Robert Fox, vice president and head
of the telecommunications practice at Mercer Management &AMP;
Consulting in Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vodafone's latest overture to AirTouch apparently was
touched off by the Bell Atlantic bid, the British wireless carrier
has wanted to purchase the San Francisco-based wireless carrier in
the past. Besides having a strong presence in California and the
Northwest, AirTouch is a significant player in the European and
Asian cellular telephone markets.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Christopher Gent , Vodafone chief executive, said
the company would enter the U.S. market ``if the right opportunity
arises.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Gent's statement, negotiations about an alliance
between AirTouch and Vodafone broke down because AirTouch teamed up
with Bell Atlantic to develop wireless carrier services in the
Midwest in a joint venture known as PrimeCo Personal Communications
LP.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts said Vodafone might split AirTouch,
taking the international assets for itself and selling the U.S.
operations. But some telecommunications industry analysts maintain
Vodafone wants all of AirTouch in order to become a global wireless
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vodafone wants a big play...they are one of the very few
remaining companies that can go after AirTouch,'' said Rebecca
Diercks, director of the wireless group at Cahners In-Stat, a
market research and consulting division of Cahners Publishing Co.
of Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which operates mainly in 13 Eastern states, is
eyeing AirTouch's dominant West Coast presence in wireless
communications. The New York-based Bell company also has agreed to
buy GTE Corp. Both acquisitions would help it become a nationwide
player in telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which has not released any details about its
stock offer for AirTouch, reportedly wants to avoid paying a high
premium. A key issue for the New York-based regional Bell phone
company is avoiding charges for ``goodwill.'' This is the
difference between AirTouch's book value or assets and the price
Bell Atlantic would pay to acquire the company.

FUND EXECUTIVES CITE FLAWLESS CONVERSION TO EURO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Executives with several major financial institutions
say the New Year's weekend conversion to the new European currency,
the euro, went off without a hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of hard work put in, but everything worked
well,'' Richard A. Heckinger, senior vice president with Boston's
State Street Corp., said Tuesday. ``There were no systemic problems
that I could see.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Matthew Keenan, a spokesman for Putnam Investments:
``Things went according to plan, exactly according to plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of computer programmers and finance specialists worked
through the long holiday weekend to convert billions of dollars
worth of accounts at the region's banks and investment firms from
the 11 European currencies in which they were originally
denominated into the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Executives said in advance of the effort that failure to pull
off the conversion could cost their institutions a fortune in lost
profits and a damaging exodus of clients. The executives were under
pressure to ensure the accounts were converted by late Sunday, when
financial markets opened for trading in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   State Street and other firms went to extraordinary lengths to
make the switchover flawless. In addition to months of advance
planning and legions of computer experts, companies rented
four-wheel drive vehicles and reserved blocks of hotel rooms on the
chance the work would have to be done, as it was in the Midwest,
during a blizzard. As it turned out, executives said, the effort
proved so flawless that it was almost dull.
</P>
<P>
   At State Street, where teams had expected to race right up to a
6 p.m. Sunday deadline, ``everything was pretty much done Saturday
night and they put the finishing touches on Sunday by noon,'' said
bank spokeswoman Darby Stott.
</P>
<P>
   At Fleet Financial Group, which fielded a team of more than 100
conversion specialists, ``things went very smoothly,'' said Charles
M. Lewis, the bank's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said the final test of whether the conversion came off
without trouble will occur in the next few days when trades made in
the new currency since Monday are settled. Typically, financial
transactions settle or are completed several days after they are
agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a week or so for everything to shake out,'' he
said, but added: ``Fleet has not had any operational problems and I
haven't heard of any locally.''

   ANDY-KAUFMAN-FILM (New York) _ The director Milos Forman stopped
the action with a delighted, ``Perfect, Perfect,'' and the crowd
reverted to unfashionably dressed extras recreating one of the
routinely bizarre moments in the career of the performer Andy
Kaufman, his Carnegie Hall Concert April 26, 1979, when he took
everyone in his entire audience of 2,800 people who chose to come
along in rented buses for milk and cookies at a nearby school when
the show ended. The comic's career ended in 1984 when he died of
cancer at the age of 35. The film on his life ``Man on the Moon,''
which is being directed by Forman and stars Jim Carrey is scheduled
for release sometime next fall. By Peter Applebome. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   DAVID-LEVEAUX-THEATER (New York) _ David Leveaux is drawn to
plays that are ``killers,'' he says, and one could argue that this
English theater director certainly knows how to slay the New York
critics. Although he has worked only three times over the last 14
years on Broadway, where his production of Sophocles' ``Electra'' _
starring Zoe Wanamaker _ is currently playing at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater, on each occasion he has come away with mostly
raves. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.

   CANBY-YEAREND-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby's reviews
`Cabaret'; `The Shaughraun' and `Bosoms and Neglect.' (Moved).

   CLASSICAL-MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   OLD-BROADWAY-SHOWS (Undated) _ There are many performing arts,
but they all ask the same questions. To judge from recent trips to
the theater, ``Swan Lake'' thrives while ``On the Town'' is doing
less well. Critics and audiences tend to love the first but can't
make up their minds about the second. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   GLASS-MUSIC (New York) _ By the late 1970s, Philip Glass was
poised to conquer the mainstream. ``Einstein on the Beach,'' of
1976, a non-narrative music-theater work created with the director
Robert Wilson, had solidified his reputation in the downtown arts
community. It had also served to clarify and codify Glass'
distinctive language. With remarkable facility, he explored new
media like film, dance and opera. Even today, he remains fascinated
with experimental hybrids of music and theater. ``Monsters of
Grace,'' a loose collaboration with Wilson, was given its premiere
last month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Billed as the ``first
3-D digital opera,'' it promised revelation but delivered only
titillation, since its special effects seemed marginal to both
scenario and music. By K. Robert Schwarz. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   POP-MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   BLUE-NOTE-RECORDS (Undated) _ When Alfred Lion, a refugee from
Nazi Germany, founded Blue Note Records in New York in 1939, he had
no idea that the small label would become an item of worship. This
month, celebrating its 60th anniversary, Blue Note is filling clubs
in Manhattan with past and present members of its roster. The
widespread adoration of the label has its roots in the Lion's
extraordinarily high level of artistic production. Over the years,
the label recorded Bud Powell, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Art
Blakey, Freddie Hubbard and Wayne Shorter. No other record label in
jazz has been as consistent in quality. By Peter Watrous. (Moved).

   KOETSU-ART-ANTIQUES (Washington) _ To his credit, the collector
Charles Lang Freer recognized the 17th century Japanese artist
Hon'ami Koetsu's accomplishments, particularly in calligraphy and
ceramics, and acquired several of his important works early in this
century. These formed ``the esthetic center of Freer's interest in
Japanese art,'' said Ann Yonemura, an associate curator at the
Freer Gallery of Art, who was an organizer of the current
exhibition, ``Japanese Art in the Age of Koetsu.'' It provides the
perfect complement to a larger show at the National Gallery
entitled ``Edo: Art in Japan 1615-1868.'' The 44 works on view at
the Freer, including paintings, calligraphy, ceramic vessels and
lacquer ware, demonstrate Koetsu's influence at a high artistic
moment when the traditional Heian culture in Kyoto was transformed
into a looser decorative style. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Congress inched closer to a
budget war Tuesday over how best to fortify a military system that
has been worn to the core from a decade's worth of doing more with
less.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton proposed the first long-term
Pentagon budget increase in years by saying his soon-to-be-released
spending plan for 2000 will include $12 billion in immediate cash
plus another $110 billion spread out over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   But when Pentagon leaders took the news to Capitol Hill Tuesday,
Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee were skeptical.
In addition to arguing that Clinton's budget increase is too small,
several questioned whether the service chiefs were as happy with
Clinton's plan as they claimed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what all the crowing is about here,'' said
Sen. Bob Smith, R-New Hampshire. ``You're getting about a third of
what you told us you needed in September.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the nation's military chiefs told the same Senate
committee that years of budget cuts and a multitude of overseas
missions had ``frayed'' the military and threatened America's
readiness for combat. At the time, they pleaded for an infusion of
money, $17 billion, to stem the deterioration of their forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Congress obliged by adding $1.1 billion in emergency
money to the 1999 budget, with a pledge to seek more in 2000. But
Clinton's latest proposal doesn't match the amount military leaders
said they needed to meet those ``critical'' September needs.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Michael Ryan acknowledged as much
but said the outline Clinton has given is a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what I'm getting yet because I haven't gotten the
bottom line, but... it would meet my critical needs, and that's the
turnaround in readiness,'' Ryan said. ``It wouldn't address some of
the other needs of modernization and infrastructure that we need
dearly to address.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate hearing went on for two hours before someone raised
the obvious, though volatile, budget issue of base closings. When
asked, all four generals replied that closing bases was an
essential component in planning long-term recovery for the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even when it was broached, the topic quickly receded from
the discussion. Congress is generally wary of beginning the painful
process of identifying military installations for closure. And
Republicans say they don't trust Clinton to keep politics out of
the process.
</P>
<P>
   But this reticence was contrasted by the position taken by an
administration official who briefed reporters on the same Pentagon
budget proposal just before the Senate hearing began. Robert Bell,
special assistant to the president for national security affairs,
made the need for base closings a centerpiece of his discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need new (base closing) authority _ in fact, our budget
projections assume we'll win approval of that.''

IN MIAMI, REACTION TO EASING OF EMBARGO IS MOSTLY POSITIVE
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CUBA-U.S., CUBA-HAVANA)

 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   MIAMI _ Hemley Gonzalez calls an aunt in Cuba every weekend, and
he travels to the island once a year to take medicine and clothes
to the scores of relatives he left behind when he moved here 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez favors the U.S. economic embargo against Cuba, he said,
but that does not deter him from his personal mission, helping to
ease his family's financial hardship and giving them a glimpse of
``what's going on in the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion has always been put people first and worry about
politics later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Cuban-Americans like Gonzalez, 23, a real-estate agent in
Miami Beach, the Clinton administration's decision to allow
additional contact between Americans and Cubans supports many
individual efforts to sidestep the Cuban government to break
through the isolation of their families and friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement also pleased those who advocate keeping
Cuba isolated because of the administration's refusal even to study
changing U.S. relations with the island.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban American National Foundation, the most politically
prominent exile group and an unwavering advocate of the embargo
against Cuba, was among those relieved that the policy was not
fundamentally altered. The foundation objects to proposals to sell
agricultural supplies to nongovernmental entities on the grounds
that Cuba has ``no true private businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization has also opposed bills to allow the sale of
food and medicine to Cuba by U.S. companies, fearing that such a
move would weaken the 37-year-old embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, what these steps may produce is that in the end
American taxpayers would subsidize the Cuban regime,'' the vice
chairman of the foundation, Jorge Mas, said. ``The government can't
pay. There'll be a need for credit and subsidies. It's a very
dangerous step that may have the opposite effect than promoting
democracy in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who want to end the ban called the steps positive but said
they fell short. Bishop Thomas Wenski, the auxiliary bishop of the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami who has visited Cuba several
times, called the restrictions Fidel Castro's ``whipping boy'' and
``dull instruments that hurt the people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The embargo cannot be sustained morally,'' Wenski said.
``Lifting the embargo would be both smart policy and a powerful
humanitarian effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Wilhelm, executive director of the Cuban Committee for
Democracy, a Cuban-American group that opposes the embargo, said
lifting restrictions that had failed in their goal for 37 years
would spur change in Cuba more quickly than gradual measures. Cuba
would no longer have the United States to blame for all that is
wrong with the country, Ms. Wilhelm said.
</P>
<P>
   But she welcomed the administration's announcement. ``Anything
that brings less dependency of the Cuban people on the government
is a step in the right direction,'' Ms. Wilhelm said, ``because
ultimately what we want is the people in Cuba to be empowered.''
</P>
<P>
   The relaxation will make a practical difference to Cubans on
both sides of the Florida Straits. Vivian Mannerud, owner of one of
two companies that offer charter flights to Cuba, said allowing
flights from cities other than Miami would increase the number of
flights and lower the cost of travel. Her Airline Brokers Co.
offers four Miami-Havana flights a week and carries a third of the
estimated 100,000 Cuban-Americans who fly to Cuba each year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our passengers are not wealthy people,'' Ms. Mannerud said.
``It costs them to come out from the West Coast just to catch the
flight here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the real-estate agent, predicted that rules allowing
more cash to go to Cubans would expand capitalism in the midst of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can send a Cuban $1,000,'' Gonzalez said, ``and he'd buy
three VCRs in an electronics store and sell them on the street in
the black market for $100 to about $150 more in Cuban currency. It
will create more underground business, money for the people, not
the government.''

RODGERS TO SEEK RECORDS IN VETERANS DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Although road running legend Bill Rodgers still
competes at shorter distances _ frequently winning his age group _
the four-time Boston winner retired from marathoning seven years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Come April 19, he'll be back. At a news conference Wednesday to
formally kick off preparations for the 103d Boston Marathon, it is
expected to be announced that Rodgers will not only run but mount
an assault on the record books that will give his multitude of fans
something to cheer for again on Patriots Day.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a ceremonial appearance in the 100th Boston Marathon
in 1997, Rodgers has not run here since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, 51, said Tuesday he is looking to get one, two, or
perhaps even three American records in the veterans division: the
American record in Boston (2 hours 31 minutes 34 seconds), the
course record (2:27:17), and the overall point-to-point record by
an American (2:25:46). In 1990, he finished Boston in 2:20:46; in
1979, he won in his fastest time here, 2:09:27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can get any of those records, but I'm going
to give it a try,'' Rodgers said from his home in Sherborn. ``To be
the fastest American over 50, I would love to be able to do that.
I'm nervous but psyched about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers, who already holds a slew of US masters (40-49) records
at distances from 8 to 30 kilometers, will be sponsored by Ronzoni
Pasta, for whom he also will make appearances promoting nutrition,
exercise, and goal-setting for those over 50.

CLINTON SHIFT ON CUBA MODEST DUE TO EXILES' POLITICAL CLOUT
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CUBA-HAVANA; CUBA-EXILES) 
(bl) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Foreign-policy experts, Catholic archbishops, the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and senior senators tried hard to push the
United States to change its policy toward Cuba significantly.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton and his intended successor, Vice President
Al Gore, rejected the idea of taking any large steps _ or even
opening policy toward Cuba to a serious review _ because of the
political power of the anti-Castro Cuban-American communities of
Florida and New Jersey, two crucial electoral states.
</P>
<P>
   The moves they approved, intended to allow more money and
perhaps more U.S. goods to flow into Cuba, were modest steps that
did not outrage the anti-Castro coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   The steps approved Tuesday included permitting any U.S.
resident, not just family members of Cubans, to send payments up to
$1,200 a year to Cuban families; increasing charter passenger
flights to and from Cuba, allowing them to serve cities other than
Miami and Havana; establishing direct mail service, and allowing
the sale of food and agricultural supplies to nongovernmental
bodies in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are forever dreaming of carrying Florida,'' said
Richard Feinberg, a senior National Security Council staff member
from 1993 to 1996. ``The basic presidential calculation on Cuba is
that any major change in policy involves short-term political
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other former senior Clinton administration officials agreed
that policy toward Cuba, more than most foreign policy issues, is
also a domestic political issue. In this case, policy is shaped by
the concerns of right-wing Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore opposed proposals to create a national
bipartisan commission on U.S. policy toward Cuba, one that would
have addressed the 37-year-old embargo against the island,
preferring that the issue be kept off the national agenda in the
coming political season, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a commission had been supported by some of the nation's
weightiest former diplomats, such as former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger. Its backers believed it had the potential to bring
about far-reaching changes that could have opened up the stagnant
political culture of Cuba, the last bastion of communism in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton at first showed indications he might go along,'' said
Wayne Smith, who was the ranking U.S. diplomat in Havana under
Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and is a leading critic
of the embargo. ``The right-wing exiles raised hell about it and
the administration backed down, and so we get these piddling steps.
There isn't much political courage in Washington these days.''
</P>
<P>
   More sweeping changes were backed by the Chamber of Commerce,
some Catholic archbishops, and a prestigious private foreign-policy
organization, the Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming report, the council argues for allowing far
more Cubans to travel to the United States, expanding the U.S.
diplomatic presence on the island, licensing a broad range of U.S.
businesses to work in Cuba and even promoting closer ties between
the Pentagon and the Cuban military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom is subversive,'' said Bernard Aronson, one of the
report's principal authors and a former assistant secretary of
state. ``The more people are exposed to free ideas and free
institutions, the harder it is to keep them suppressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Young people in Cuba did not grow up believing the
future lies in Cuban-style socialism. They believe that's a dead
end. And increasingly people in power in Cuba realize that change
has to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But change in U.S. foreign policy, for the time being, will be
largely incremental.
</P>
<P>
   One step Clinton approved Tuesday allows the sale of U.S.
supplies to independent restaurants, farms and cooperatives in
Cuba. ``Will these groups now be able to afford lots of U.S.
products and agricultural implements and food?'' said Peter Romero,
the acting assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere
affairs. ``The answer to that is probably no. Will they in the
future? That's our sincerest hope.''
</P>
<P>
   James Dobbins, a senior National Security Council staff member,
agreed. ``At the moment there's a very limited potential,'' he
said. ``Independent farmers, co-ops, would be eligible to buy seed
or fertilizer or those kinds of things if the Cuban government
permitted them to do so, and it's quite possible that they won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., another advocate of opening up
Cuba policy, said he was not sure these kinds of changes would make
a difference. ``The time has come,'' he said, ``to set aside an
outdated policy and begin a new conversation on U.S.-Cuban
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no one powerful advocate for dramatic change in
Havana or in Washington, no political figure with the stature to
bring about that kind of change, the way that Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., as a former prisoner of war in Vietnam, supported opening
up diplomatic relations with Hanoi, said Bill Goodfellow of the
Center for International Policy in Washington.

 &HT;    Welcome help for health care
 &HT;    By Joe Geshwiler
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all of the pressing needs President Clinton could have
addressed as his top new spending priority, he picked long-term
health care for seniors and the disabled. It is a good choice,
worthy of national concern for both practical and humane reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Practical, because as America grows grayer, the responsibilities
and the expenses of caring for its infirm population loom larger
every year despite advances in medicine and public health. Humane,
because many families who look after relatives unable to care for
themselves struggle under the burden and need help.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance Clinton envisions is not overly generous, but
that's in keeping with a start-up program. The centerpiece would be
a $1,000-a-year tax credit to offset expenses of long-term care,
such as direct outlays like home health visits or indirect costs
like a family caregiver's unpaid leave from a job.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Clinton would devote $625 million over the next
five years to train home caregivers and provide wider access to
adult day care through federal and state agencies that already
service the elderly. Encouraging home care this way is smart
policy; it's far less costly than institutional care.
</P>
<P>
   Two other initiatives make good sense. Clinton proposes that the
nation's largest employer, the federal government, institute an
affordable long-term health coverage program for its workers in the
hope that more private employers will follow the example. He also
plans a campaign to inform the nation's 39 million Medicare
recipients how to guard against long-term health crises with
supplemental insurance. The plain fact is, Medicare itself provides
little or no protection in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Congress has rebuffed Clinton before on health
legislation, the outlook for this initiative is not too bad.
Initial GOP reaction on Capitol Hill is that Clinton filched his
proposal from the Republicans' 1994 Contract with America, but they
indicate willingness to share credit for a long-term health program
as long as it doesn't mean a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must have anticipated that caveat. He made clear Monday
he intended to finance the most expensive portion, the tax credit,
by doing away with unspecified business tax loopholes or subsidies.
Funds for the rest would be freed up by nips and tucks in the
overall budget.
</P>
<P>
   The home-care initiatives and the budgetary manipulation
required to pay for them are both eminently do-able. Though modest,
the program would recognize the inevitability of infirmities and
reward those Americans who shoulder responsibilities that are part
of the cycle of life.

 &HT;    Managers want complete disclosure of facts in Senate trialBy
Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate meets today to decide how to proceed
with the historic impeachment trial of President Clinton, members
of the House Republican prosecution team remain determined to
present any and all evidence necessary to remove Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 House Republican prosecutors want a full fledged trial
during which the managers would call witnesses, cross-examine any
witnesses called by the White House and possibly present new
evidence from a vault of unreleased documents from the independent
counsel's investigation stored in the Ford Office Building.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that a full presentation of the facts would bolster
their charge that Clinton committed perjury and obstructed justice
to conceal his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain optimistic that we will have a full trial,'' said
Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a manager and a member of the House
Judiciary Committee which evaluated the evidence amassed by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr. ``I think we have to have a full
trial if only to show the evidence behind our action in the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial managers, selected from the Judiciary Committee after
the House voted to impeach the president on Dec. 19, got a boost
Tuesday when it appeared that there was a growing consensus for a
full trial rather than the expedited trial without witnesses
proposed last week by Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Slade
Gorton (R-Wash.).
</P>
<P>
   Conservative senators strongly opposed the Lieberman-Gorton
plan, saying the Constitution and precedent call for a full trial.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers are taking no chances, meeting behind closed
doors last week and earlier this week in small groups of two or
three to prepare for any possible direction.
</P>
<P>
   Under congressional rules, the new House must vote after today's
swearing-in ceremonies to reauthorize the managers and the
presentation of evidence in the Senate. Republicans are expected to
prevail, despite the loss of five House seats from the old Congress
to the new.
</P>
<P>
   Each manager has been assigned a special area to oversee. Barr
is expected to have a larger role than most, arguing any objections
to the evidentiary evidence as well as assisting in the cross
examination of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe there needs to be a lengthy trial, but there
needs to be one with witnesses,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) will deliver the opening
statement, presenting an overview of the case. The witnesses will
be prepared by Reps. Christopher Cannon of Utah, Steve Chabot of
Ohio, George Gekas of Pennsylvania and Bill McCollum of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Barr, Reps. Ed Bryant of Tennessee, Asa
Hutchinson of Arkansas and James Rogan of California will conduct
the questioning of witnesses and any necessary cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Motions on procedure would be handled by Reps. Steve Buyer of
Indiana, Charles Canady of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina. Any rebuttals of the evidence presented by the White
House would be the purview of Barr and Sensenbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The closing arguments will be presented by Rep. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent figure from the Judiciary Committee hearings who
isn't yet playing a role in preparations for the Senate trial is
chief investigative counsel David Schippers, who says he has not
even been consulted about how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what's going on.'' Schippers said Tuesday
night.

 &HT;    Broad outlines clear for Senate trial; specifics still a
question
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman and Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate will begin the first presidential
impeachment trial in 130 years Thursday, but whether witnesses will
be called and how long it will last remain unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) announced the start
date Tuesday after conferring with Sen. Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), the
minority leader, and Chief Justice William Rehnquist, who will
preside over the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events are expected to be largely ceremonial. Daschle
said he hopes the House members who will act as prosecutors can
begin presenting their evidence against President Clinton as early
as next week.
</P>
<P>
   But Daschle said the timetable would depend on whether the
Senate could reach an agreement on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Senators in both parties made clear that there is as yet no
consensus. ``It's all up in the air. It's just all up in the air,''
Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said following a midday meeting in
Lott's office.
</P>
<P>
   Lott himself acknowledged as much when he made a brief statement
and refused to answer questions. The rules for the trial ``will be
determined after the discussions and the meetings that will go
forth over the next two days,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, I'm going to do my best to make sure we
complete our constitutional duties under the rules of the Senate
and come to a conclusion that is fair and hopefully quick also,''
Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The indecision left the White House preparing an exhaustive
defense of Clinton that would challenge the basis for the two
articles of impeachment the House voted last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we'd like to know which direction we're going in,
but we understand the process,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) declined to endorse any specific
procedure for conducting a trial, saying that whatever results must
have bipartisan support and ``help heal the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said he has been surprised by how much remains in flux
since Clinton's impeachment Dec. 19, which he noted was the first
time the House had impeached an elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868, but he took office upon
the death of Abraham Lincoln. The Senate acquitted Johnson by a
single vote.
</P>
<P>
   The broad outlines of two plans were known Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal, put forward last week by Sen. Slade Gorton
(R-Wash.) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.), calls for an
abbreviated four-day hearing with no witnesses. The Senate would
follow the hearing with a test vote to determine whether two-thirds
of the Senate believe Clinton committed impeachable offenses. If
not, the Senate would vote to adjourn the trial and possibly
consider an alternative punishment, most likely a censure.
</P>
<P>
   A second approach described by Specter would involve a
three-week trial with witnesses that would give the House managers
one week to make their case and White House lawyers a week to mount
their defense. Senators would deliberate during the third week.
</P>
<P>
   One of the House prosecutors, Rep. Charles Canady of Florida,
also said a full trial could be carried out in such a time frame.
``We are certainly talking about days and weeks, not months,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Specter acknowledged that while the Senate could determine
the ground rules, it probably could not set the length of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said Tuesday the Gorton-Lieberman proposal
was unlikely to be adopted because it would infringe on the
constitutional mandate to hold an impeachment trial. But Daschle
warned against dismissing it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both the House and Senate will meet today to begin
the 106th Congress. The House will vote to re-affirm the action it
took last month appointing Republicans from the Judiciary Committee
to act as managers in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Thursday, the House members would appear in the Senate
to read the two articles of impeachment charging Clinton with
perjury in front of a federal grand jury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate would then notify Rehnquist that the articles of
impeachment had been read and request the chief justice's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist would take an oath of impartiality from Sen. Strom
Thurmond (R-S.C.), the president pro tempore of the Senate. The
chief justice would administer the same oath to the 100 senators.

 &HT;    Delta to offer Atlanta flights to Spain, Greece and Turkey
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta this summer will get its first nonstop air
service to Greece and Turkey, along with an added route to Spain,
as part of a seasonal expansion by Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   Delta on Tuesday said it will offer new flights between
Hartsfield International Airport and Athens, Greece; Istanbul,
Turkey; and Barcelona, Spain, starting June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Athens flights will operate four times a week, the Istanbul
flights three times weekly and the Barcelona flights daily. Delta
already flies daily to Madrid from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The new flights are set only for the summer tourism season, with
a decision on whether to make them year-round coming later, Delta
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are the latest in a long string of European schedule
adjustments by Atlanta-based Delta, which became a leading
trans-Atlantic carrier through a problem-plagued buyout of Pan Am's
routes in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Delta scuttled Pan Am's old connecting hub in
Frankfurt, Germany, and since then has focused on nonstop flights
from Atlanta and New York.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the coming summer's changes, Delta will add new
nonstop flights to Ireland from New York's John F. Kennedy Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airline previously announced plans for Atlanta-Rome nonstops
starting April 1, but it first must win an available route
authority under terms of a bilateral treaty. United Airlines and US
Airways also are seeking the route authority, which will be awarded
this winter by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The added flights come amid some concerns about softening travel
demand and the potential for overcapacity on international routes.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Reid, Delta's recently installed marketing chief, said the
expansion involves destinations where ``we are forecasting
significant operating profits, well above those for trans-Atlantic
routes generally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad time to expand wildly or indiscriminately, but
we're adding flights in markets with known strengths,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Most U.S. tourists and business fliers bound for Greece or
Turkey now go through New York, and Delta hopes to draw travelers
from across the Sun Belt through its huge Atlanta connecting hub.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will give Delta 259 weekly international flights and
nonstop service to 31 destinations from Atlanta, up from 245
flights to 28 destinations last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, however, also has pared a handful of destinations over
the past year, including Prague, Czech Republic; Berlin, Germany;
and Copenhagen, Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   Delta last year launched several new routes to Latin America,
but further expansion there is contingent on treaty changes.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Delta's stock gained $2.56 1/4
to close at $54.50.

<TEXT>
<P>
   IMABARI, Japan _ Some 25 years ago, Itsuhiro Ochi quit his job
as a salaryman at a large textile manufacturer and built a factory
here to make towels.
</P>
<P>
   He is now the proprietor of the biggest business in the biggest
industry in this quaint seaside town on the northern coast of
Shikoku, the smallest of the four main islands in the Japanese
archipelago, presiding over five factories and 600 employees that
produced 3,200 metric tons of towels last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ochi is a hardy survivor in a Japanese towel industry that is a
shrunken version of what it once was. Almost 50 percent of
Shikoku's towel companies closed down in the last decade, wrung out
of business by more competitive manufacturers in China and Vietnam
and by their own high cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many low-wage countries able to supply consumers
with towels, what is one of the most advanced industrial nations in
the world still doing with 250 factories continuing to churn out
many more towels than Japan needs?
</P>
<P>
   The question reveals a lot about Japan's current economic
distress, which has been exacerbated by a powerful bias against
eliminating the vast amounts of excess production capacity that
plague not just towel makers but also producers of cars, steel,
semiconductors, consumer electronics, auto parts and others.
</P>
<P>
   Wasteful and unneeded production facilities are the biggest drag
on Japan's vast manufacturing sector, pulling down profits at
giants like Toyota and Hitachi as well as thousands of anonymous
mom-and-pop suppliers. ``The real problem in Japan is not the
credit crunch,'' said Kathy Matsui, the chief strategist at
Goldman, Sachs (Japan) Ltd. ``The real problem is excess
capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies continued to invest in factories and
equipment even after the so-called bubble economy burst in 1989,
blindly continuing to pursue the export-led growth strategy so
successfully used to create economic strength after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   As the economy slid into its deepest recession of the post-war
years, tangible fixed assets climbed more than 60 percent,
according to Matsui. Now, a huge portion of those assets are unused
or underused, making it all but impossible for companies to justify
new investments to spur growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government officials here and abroad have been mistaken in
describing this recession as a consumer-led recession,'' said
Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist. ``It's a recession of
over-investment.''
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is everyone's favorite illustration of the
problem. Japanese automakers collectively can produce 14 million
vehicles here, but this year they will make just 10.4 million _ 8.5
percent fewer cars than they made in 1997. And as auto operations
expand abroad, the need for so much capacity in Japan will probably
dwindle even more.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, companies have either ignored the problem or tried
to tackle it with chopsticks when they need a battering ram. The
closing of the Nissan Motor Co. factory in Zama, southwest of
Tokyo, in 1995 is the only significant effort at tackling the
problem that anyone can remember. Yet the company retained the
plant's employees, a traditional and generous move that left it
saddled with the bulk of the plant's costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not let the markets work to close inefficient or
unprofitable factories and inefficient and unprofitable
businesses,'' said Akio Mikuni, founder and president of Mikuni &AMP;
Co., Japan's oldest independent credit rating agency. ``Factories
have to be closed, but in most cases, they will keep their
factories open and running and producing things for which there is
no demand.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few signs of change. The Toyota Motor Corp. and
Nissan are considering closing production lines to improve
efficiency, and the Mitsubishi Rayon Co. is closing an acrylic yarn
plant in Ogaki and relocating it to Indonesia, reducing capacity at
one of its subsidiaries by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Capital investment is finally in a steep decline, a slump that
Nakamae finds encouraging. ``Companies are correcting
over-investment and at an accelerating rate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Imabari has already seen a sharp correction. The Shikoku Towel
Industrial Association had more than 400 members a decade ago; it
now has 240. Domestic production of towels fell to 54,397 tons in
1997, from 101,792 tons at the industry's peak in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Yet supply still exceeds demand by about 30,000 tons, according
to Yoshide Yoshihara, the association's chairman, largely because
of cheaper imports, which have more than tripled in the last
decade. He insists, however, that the domestic industry is not
suffering from too much output, an opinion echoed by Ochi and other
towel makers. He says it is normal to have about 30,000 tons of
stock on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is that much over-capacity,'' Yoshihara
said, although he wistfully added that he would not mind seeing
some mergers or acquisitions take place. ``I would like to see
those kinds of changes, but it's difficult.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because consolidation aimed at reducing production capacity
and costs will almost inevitably involve laying off employees,
which is nearly taboo in Japan where lifetime employment is still a
critical component of the tacit social code. In discussing the
possibility of Toyota closing a plant, for instance, Tetsuo
Kitagawa, a spokesman, repeatedly stressed such a closure ``would
not mean direct layoffs or significant unemployment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatsuya Higaki, the assistant manager of the industry division
of the Imabari municipal government, said, ``The social aspects of
employment here make it difficult to fire people just because the
economy is bad or demand is declining.''
</P>
<P>
   So most Japanese companies rely on a slow process of natural
attrition to winnow their ranks and pray that the economy will
improve before they are forced to take more drastic action. Despite
the efforts to avoid layoffs, unemployment has risen sharply in
Japan, actually matching the United States level of 4.4 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Seiichiro Murakami, who represents Imabari in the lower house of
Parliament, is sadly convinced that his district's biggest business
has no choice but to consolidate further. ``With the higher yen and
high labor costs we have in Japan, companies like Toyota and Nissan
started building factories overseas,'' he said. ``In the towel
industry, the same thing has happened, and now factories in China
and Southeast Asia are producing towels of the very same quality
you find in Imabari but at a fraction of the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Murakami figures there need be no more than 100 companies in
Shikoku making towels, noting that Germany makes do with just one
domestic towel manufacturer. The United States has only a handful
of highly efficient major towel makers, who also produce a
substantial share in low-wage countries in Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But as plainspoken as Murakami is in an interview about the
industry's need to shrink, he has yet to breathe a word of his
thoughts to his constituents. ``I can't say it to them,'' he said.
``It's too cruel.''
</P>
<P>
   So over the last five years the prefectural government has spent
upwards of 465 million yen, or about $4.2 million at current
exchange rates, in an effort to put some zip into the local towel
business. It has urged manufacturers to cut out wholesalers and
streamline distribution to retain more of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Higaki and others have worked hard to steer the
towel-making business away from towels as commodities and toward
making high quality, designer towels suitable for gift-giving. In
conjunction with the local government, the towel association is
developing a brand name, fuwari, which means soft and light, for
the region's towel products. Towel makers are also incorporating
design elements into their products to distinguish them from those
made in Southeast Asia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The target? Japanese consumers, who give towels on all sorts of
occasions and particularly in return for the traditional cash gifts
from friends to family members of someone who dies.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to build a high quality image, Yoshiyuki Yano has
embraced the effort wholeheartedly. His company, Hisao K.K., is
working to increase specialty towel making, which currently
accounts for a little less than 10 percent of its output. Hisao has
begun making a gift towel with threads embedded with porous ceramic
filaments filled with an oil extracted from the skins of the
mandarin oranges that proliferate on Shikoku. According to Yano,
the extract has antibacterial properties _ and it also imparts a
nice scent to the towels.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also exploring the use of natural dyes, and each
month it sells about 30,000 highly textured, loofah-like towels
made from unbleached cotton, a small success that has taken Yano by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Cheap imports from China and Southeast Asia keep chipping away
at the prices he can charge for the hotel towels that accounts for
40 percent of Hisao's production. He is unable to reduce costs any
further because Hisao's looms are old, operating at one-third the
speed of brand new looms and in need of more maintenance. The
company lacks the capital to invest in more modern equipment. But
Yano is a bit thankful for Hisao's limited financial capacity
because it has inhibited the company's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel the problem of excess capacity that much because
we haven't invested in expensive equipment,'' he said. His older
looms have also perversely allowed him the flexibility needed to
take advantage of the woes of the beleaguered hotel industry, which
is placing more orders for small quantities of towels that major
producers find unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger companies, too, are adjusting their business to the new
realities. Ochi built a factory in China in 1984, where he employs
600 people to produce towels at a lower cost and ships them back to
Japan to sell to the mass market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw ahead of time and I thought it might be a good idea,''
said Ochi, who now owns Japan's fourth-largest textile
manufacturing business.
</P>
<P>
   In his Japanese factories, he produces high-end towels under
license to various European design companies like Renoma and Fendi.
A best-seller is a gift set that includes tea and two towels woven
with the trademark of Fauchon, the French food retailer that has a
tremendous following in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Kontex, the second largest towel maker in Shikoku, is also
reorienting its business toward higher-margin products, including a
towel woven with silver.
</P>
<P>
   But as these bigger players find better ways of doing business,
they will inevitably threaten smaller companies. At Kontex, Kanji
Kondo, who will be the third generation of his family to run the
business, is planning to increase production in hopes that higher
volume will mean greater profits.
</P>
<P>
   That will only add to the glut of Japanese-made towels, however.
``This isn't like semiconductor chips,'' Murakami said sadly.
``There's not much value added in towels.''

   The obituary of Marshall Perlin, a civil liberties lawyer, sent
by the New York Times News Service on Sunday, January 3, misstated
his age and the number of his war decorations. He was 78, not 79,
and the Air Medal he earned in World War II had three oak-leaf
clusters, not two.

BRETT, YOUNT SAY INDUCTIONS FITTING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   George Brett and Robin Yount have much in common. They both were
hard-nosed, gritty competitors. They both are members of the
3,000-hit club. They both spent their entire careers with one,
small-market team.
</P>
<P>
   Each respected the way the other played the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's only fitting that they will enter baseball's Hall of Fame
together.
</P>
<P>
   Brett, the longtime star of the Kansas City Royals, and Yount, a
two-time American League most valuable player for the Milwaukee
Brewers, joined Nolan Ryan in being elected to the Hall of Fame
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `Can you believe that two guys like us ended up in a
place like this?' '' Yount said, recalling a conversation he had
with Brett after the vote totals were announced. ``I've never been
a stats guy, never got overly excited with awards. But this has got
to be something special. My stomach's been in knots for three or
four days.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, Brett and Yount were elected in their first year of
eligibility by voting members of the Baseball Writers' Association
of America, and will be enshrined in the Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y., on July 25. It's the biggest class of first-time
eligibles since 1936, when Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson,
Honus Wagner and Christy Mathewson were chosen in the original
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I was very, very pleased,'' Brett said. ``But in
all honesty, I was just as pleased for Robin.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett made it to the majors in 1973, and compiled a .305 batting
average in 21 seasons with the Royals. He finished with 3,154 hits,
13th all-time, and 665 doubles, fifth in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   He was named on 98.19 percent of the record 497 ballots cast,
the fourth-highest total in history behind Tom Seaver's 98.84
percent in 1992, Ryan's 98.79 percent and Cobb's 98.23 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted,'' Brett said. ``It just knocked me to the
floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount played for the Brewers from 1974-93, and finished with a
.285 career batting average and 3,142 hits, the 15th-highest total.
He was named on 77.46 percent of the ballots, just meeting the
criteria of 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible honor for me to be even thought of as a
potential Hall of Famer,'' said Yount, the AL MVP as a shortstop in
1982 and as a center fielder in 1989. ``To be in the class with
Nolan Ryan and George Brett, it's just very difficult for me to
imagine being mentioned in the same breath with those people.''
</P>
<P>
   Yount said he had no special love for pitchers but respected
Ryan as much as any he ever faced. He admired Brett more than
anyone he ever played against.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt he was the prototypical baseball player,''
Yount said. ``He was as fierce a competitor as I've ever seen. If
there was one player I'd ever want to be like, it'd be George
Brett. Very seldom did I talk to players on the other team, but
George and I had a relationship on the field. We could talk and
joke one minute and then knock each other on the butt the next.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was mutual, so much so that Brett's voice cracked
with emotion when talking about Yount.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the guys I played against, probably Robin is the guy I
enjoyed playing against the most,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk, the all-time leader in home runs by a catcher with
376, missed induction in his first year on the ballot. Fisk
received 373 votes or 66.40 percent, 43 short of election.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Perez again fell short in his eighth attempt. Perez, whose
1,652 runs batted in are 18th all-time and the most among eligible
players not already in the Hall, appeared on 302 ballots, or 60.76
percent. He received 68 percent of the vote last year.
</P>
<P>
   This class is the largest since 1991, when Ferguson Jenkins,
Gaylord Perry and Rod Carew were elected. Ryan, Brett and Yount are
the first players to make it in their initial year of eligibility
since Mike Schmidt was elected in 1995.

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ President Andres Pastrana said Tuesday that
ending the civil war that has ravaged his country for nearly 40
years depends on the rebels' willingness to help stamp out drug
trafficking in areas under their control.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's assessment came as he prepares to open talks with the
leftist rebels. The United States has strengthened his position by
offering substantial help in increasing military and police power.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who took office five months ago, is slated to meet
leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, the
country's most powerful insurgency, on Thursday in the remote
jungle town of San Vicente del Caguan. The government evacuated
security forces from an area as big as Switzerland to allow the
talks to take place, as the rebels demanded.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the Narino Presidential Palace Tuesday, the
43-year-old president noted that American aid has so far gone
largely toward supporting police efforts to halt drug trafficking,
mostly through fumigation. Pushed by Conservative Republicans in
Congress, the United States more than tripled aid to Colombia
recently, to $289 million this year from $88.6 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   This week, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin announced
that a mid-level State Department official, Philip Chicola, had
secretly met with FARC leaders in Costa Rica to discuss the rebels'
recent declarations of willingness to eliminate drug crops in areas
they control. Chicola also discussed the rebels' policy on
kidnapping foreigners and the fate of three missing missionaries
whom they are accused of having kidnapped five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first enemy of peace is narco-trafficking,'' Pastrana said
Tuesday. ``If the FARC takes the decision to eradicate drug crops,
they'll do it. Because they definitively have the influence to
carry it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana reiterated earlier criticism of American policy as
relying almost exclusively on police tactics to fight drug dealing,
and noted that some in the U.S. Congress had an interest in
promoting war in Colombia. Under the current budget passed by
Congress, Washington plans to spend $10 million on crop
substitution in drug-producing regions, but $9 million of the money
will go to Peru and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S. Congress, there are those who believe that only
through repressive, policing measures can you put an end to this
business,'' Pastrana said. ``I maintain that for the first time
ever, there's a different window of opportunity. And it's that the
guerrilla group is saying it would agree to eradicate drug crops.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first opportunity we have to consider our policy of
fighting drug trafficking in a different way,'' Pastrana said.
``Why not look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is unfolding against a backdrop of intensifying
violence in a war that has torn this country apart for decades.
Last week, the FARC took advantage of a temporary cease-fire
declared by a right-wing paramilitary leader, Carlos Castano, to
launch an all-out attack on his home base in the Nudo de Paramillo
region.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 people were killed, including a 3-week-old infant
and a 3-year-old child. Some victims died after being dismembered,
and were castrated afterward. Others were beheaded. Only 11 of the
dead were identified.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, the fate of Castano remained uncertain, with
the rebels claiming to have killed him. On Sunday, however, Castano
contacted a radio station in Medellin to say he was alive.
</P>
<P>
   With the paramilitary cease-fire ending Wednesday, Pastrana
appeared most eager to dampen expectations of instant progress in
ending the conflict. He stressed that the talks beginning Thursday
were not peace negotiations, but merely an effort to hammer out the
logistics of eventual peace talks, and to gauge the willingness of
the rebels to negotiate an end to the war that has claimed 35,000
lives in the last decade and made more than a million Colombians
refugees in their own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Thursday, we're not going to negotiate,'' Pastrana said.
Earlier this week, he named four ``spokesmen'' for peace, including
Nicanor Restrepo, an industrialist, Maria Emma Mejia, the former
foreign minister under President Ernesto Samper, who will represent
the opposition; Fabio Valencia, the president of Congress, and
Rodolfo Espinosa, governor of Atlantico province. ``We're going to
install the table for a dialogue, to see if there's an interest in
getting to the negotiating table,'' Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the rebels have not pledged to lay down their arms as
part of any agreement. An analysis by the U.S. Defense Intelligence
Agecy last year predicted the rebels could win control of the
Bogota government within five years.
</P>
<P>
   The questions that will be discussed over the next month in San
Vicente del Caguan will largely involve logistics, including where
and when negotiations will be held, and what role, if any, other
countries should play in mediating or monitoring any agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said that the single most important gauge for the
future of talks would be whether or not a proposed agenda for
negotiations emerges over the next month. Government security
forces are now scheduled to retake the temporarily demilitarized
zone in southeastern Colombia on Feb. 7, but Pastrana did not rule
out extending the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he believed the rebels were sincere in their desire
to negotiate peace in exchange for participation in the country's
political life, and added that he did not believe they were seeking
control of territory. Pastrana noted that an earlier rebel effort
to create a political party called the Patriotic Union fell apart
with the steady, unexplained extermination of some 5,000 of its
members over the last 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great problem that the FARC has had is that the state
never gave the guarantees that would allow them to pursue political
activities,'' the president said. Asked what would happen if
parties allied to the rebels won control of 40 percent of the
country's municipalities, Pastrana said, ``To me, that's fine. It's
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Tuesday whether the top rebel leader, Manuel
Marulanda, would come out of hiding to meet the president, whom he
first met shortly before Pastrana's inauguration on Aug. 7. Rebel
representatives in San Vicente del Caguan said that the
preparations so far appeared to center largely around ceremonial,
rather than substantive, aspects of the upcoming meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Fabian Ramirez, leader of insurgent forces in Southern Colombia,
complained that the delegates Pastrana named to lead talks held
``no decision-making power.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, we may send similar delegates,'' he told
the Reuters news agency in San Vicente del Caguan. ``We could all
end up around a table talking and nobody will be able to decide
anything.''

SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL SET TO BEGIN ON THURSDAY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, announced on
Tuesday that he expected Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to open
the impeachment trial of President Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he hoped for a conclusion ``that is fair and hopefully
quick,'' but gave no details of how the trial would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Republican's reticence reflected the unsettled
and fluid situation in the Senate as leaders from both parties met
frantically throughout the day, in hideaways all across the
Capitol, negotiating ceaselessly to craft some kind of bipartisan
plan that could avert a lengthy trial that would tie up the Senate
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties said that a bipartisan proposal for
an expedited trial that had been drafted by Sens. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., and Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., was foundering because
of objections from conservative Republicans, just a day before the
106th Congress formally convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the depth of the opposition, Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho,
a member of the Republican leadership team, said of the plan, ``I
think it's dead and finally, I hope it's dead because I do not
think one should short-circuit the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But still hopeful, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic minority leader, said: ``Contrary to rumors of its
demise I think that there's still a great deal of interest in
pursuing some framework along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle had their first of several meetings of the day
early in the morning and then journeyed across the street to the
Supreme Court, where they met with Rehnquist for about a half hour
to plan for the first presidential impeachment trial in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Daschle called the timing still ``tentative,'' he and Lott
both said they expected Rehnquist to swear in senators as jurors on
Thursday. On that same day, House managers led by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde _ who are expected to be reappointed by the new Congress on
Wednesday _ are to read the two articles of impeachment on the
Senate floor, charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the day will be a holding action, buying time
for Senate leaders to keep working out the details of what comes
next as they strive to avoid the partisan rancor that overtook the
House, which approved the two articles of impeachment on near
party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   Senators huddled in all kinds of groups on Tuesday, some
bipartisan, some by party. Some senators consulted with Gorton and
Lieberman while others floated their own modifications of the plan.
One Democrat said that so many proposals were now flying around the
Senate that ``it's like dim sum right now. They're picking and
choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who met with Lott several times on
Tuesday, said the majority leader still hoped to open a trial
Monday, as envisioned under the compromise plan. ``There is an
interest in starting this as soon as possible,'' she said. Even
conservatives said they wanted the trial to end by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this all pieces together and what it looks like is very
much up in the air.'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House the press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said the
uncertainty leaves the president's lawyers ``in the position of
preparing for all eventualities. In general, we'd like to know
which direction we're going in, but we understand the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drafted by Gorton and Lieberman had been designed
to avoid a long Senate trial that once again showcases the details
of Clinton's affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. It was also propelled
by the fact that no one expects the Senate, which has 55
Republicans and 45 Democrats, to have the 67 votes necessary under
the Constitution to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   It called for an expedited trial of the president to begin next
Monday without witnesses. House prosecutors and the White House
would get one day each to present their cases. On a third day the
senators could question the two sides by sending written notes to
the chief justice. On Thursday and Friday, the senators would be
able to state their views in debate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the senators would take test votes on each of the two
articles of impeachment to see whether either of them met the
standard for Clinton to be removed from office. If, as expected, 34
senators decided the articles did not meet the standard, a majority
vote would allow the Senate to adjourn the trial and move toward
censure.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is supported by most Democrats, and Lott, who
desperately wants the Republicans to put forward an agenda of its
own this year, has been sounding out his colleagues for days.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Republicans have complained that the
plan does not give the managers from the House enough time to make
their case. Some, in deference to House Republicans, want an actual
vote on the articles of impeachment and others object to test votes
that allow the Senate to move forward with a full trial only if
two-thirds of the Senate agreed. Still others want to hear from
witnesses
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-seven sounds like we're looking for a deal, not our
duty,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who met separately on
Tuesday with Lieberman and with Gorton. ``We shouldn't be
artificially truncating this.''

 &HT;    Expanding while keeping sight of core values fuels MindSpring
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell and Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring, the beloved and quirky Internet service
provider on West Peachtree is maturing from a local favorite into a
national presence, but growth of any kind comes at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Once the company's only challenge was signing up subscribers.
Now the company must wrestle with rapidly changing technology and
regulatory issues while still holding onto the principles that made
the company so successful.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring is no longer a start-up, run on caffeine and good
intentions. It's now big enough to acquire a string of other
Internet service providers, but still small enough to be seen as a
potential takeover target.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring, the nation's fifth largest dial-up ISP, also happens
to be betting on the Internet_ an industry widely expected to
change the way business is done.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring revenues pale next to those of an average department
store chain. Yet, unlike most Internet companies, MindSpring is
profitable _ making it one of the more provocative investment
targets in Wall Street's recent Net stock frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's subscriber list has more than tripled in the last
two years to 455,000, with more subscribers coming on board soon
from the SpryNet acquisition. That's a lot of people expecting
perfect customer service. Indeed in the past few months, a seeming
avalanche of spam, and mail server problems have created unexpected
temporary server glitches which halted e-mail delivery. ``I don't
think it's unique that they have these problems,'' says Jupiter
Communications analyst Zia Daniell. ``With dial-up services, you
are looking at problems across the board. Users want speed, few
disconnections and availability. People are becoming more and more
dependent on the Net. They are turning to it for tasks, to get
things done and when they can't get those things done, the
frustration level runs even higher.'' ``The overall industry
improved all through 1998,'' says MindSpring president and COO
Michael McQuary. ``But some people still expect it to have the same
reliability of the telephone network and that isn't there yet.''
And in that atmosphere, what separates MindSpring from the rest of
the ISPs fighting for subscriber dollars are the company's
so-called ``Core Values and Beliefs,'' which even the most cynical
analysts are forced to admit are a force that drives the company.
Wall Street also believes that founder and CEO Charles Brewer
really does run his company with the best interests of his
employees, subscribers and investors at heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the key to creating a truly great organization
is an intense focus on the values that guide its people's
actions,'' reads the preamble to the MindSpring list of guiding
principles, which includes: ``We require complete honesty and
integrity in everything we do'' and ``We are frugal. We guard and
conserve the company's resources with at least the same vigilance
that we would use to guard and conserve our own personal
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer says the core values have a resonance for him that
doesn't always follow through to the rest of the company or the
public at large. ``Some think it's naive, and others think it's
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer, along with thousands of loyal subscribers and investors
believe integrity and a little pull in Washington will carry the
company into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Way back in 1993, MindSpring was Charles Brewer. Armed only with
his ``Golden Rule'' business philosophy, he ran MindSpring out of
his apartment, slapping labels on software, answering the phone,
and going without sleep. Now, he heads one of the nation's largest
ISPs with 455,000 customers, about $100 million in annual revenue
and a stock price that has ballooned nearly 600 percent in a year.
MindSpring now boasts 732 employees in addition to Brewer.
(Employee and subscriber numbers do not include the acquisition of
Bellvue, Wash.-based ISP SpryNet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just manifest destiny,'' Brewer said in an interview.
``Our strategy sounds so simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has honed a reputation for fastidious customer
service, and _ along with the Net itself _ MindSpring's fortunes
have soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer service is the strongest part of what we have,'' says
Brewer. At least 50 per cent of MindSpring's employees man phones
in the company's call centers across the country. ``Turnover is low
for a call center environment,'' he says. ``If you really believe
tech support is the most important job, and they are the most
important people, then they are.''
</P>
<P>
   But increased growth also brings increased attention to both the
good and the bad. In recent months, MindSpring has faced some bumps
in the road _ something the company says is a temporary blot on its
otherwise spotless record.
</P>
<P>
   A one-man Internet shop might be forgiven for occasionally
having trouble making connections or permitting junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   But when a company like MindSpring grows large and high-profile,
when it charges market rates and its customers include businesses,
serious Internet addicts and e-mail obsessives, and there is a
problem with the service, then there's trouble. Then, you'll see
unforgiving customers _ just ask America Online.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not just growth that is changing MindSpring. Technology
is, however gradually, reshaping the playing field. Cable companies
are spending billions of dollars to upgrade their networks,
allowing customers Net access over high-speed cable modems.
Meanwhile, phone companies like BellSouth are painstakingly rolling
out an alternate path called digital subscriber lines, or DSL.
</P>
<P>
   Both cable modems and DSL keep users continually connected to
the Net, and neither requires a dial-up through an ISP.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing MindSpring as it looks toward the 21st
century is how to stay viable in a rapidly changing environment in
which users won't need a dial-up service to hook up to the
Internet. Currently MindSpring does not offer cable modem or DSL
service to its subscribers. Even though Jupiter Communications
projects that dial-up providers such as MindSpring will be the
primary way to access the Net for at least the next five years,
there's still a question of what will happen when broadband finally
reaches a mass audience. Currently, cable companies aren't required
to offer any ISPs but their own when they hook up cable modem
customers. With DSL, MindSpring is still not convinced it can make
a profit selling the service, given what BellSouth and other phone
companies charge wholesale. BellSouth, however, maintains that a
company of MindSpring's size should easily be able to compete with
them and turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Given a chance to compete with the new technologies, MindSpring
can abandon charges for dial-up, Brewer said. With that in mind,
MindSpring has also begun aggressively lobbying federal regulators
for the same ``openness'' in cable that exists with phones, where
the law forces local phone companies to sell use of the ``last
mile'' to the home.
</P>
<P>
   The company believes its reputation for quality service and
support is a strong enough brand to be attractive to broadband
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the service and support part increasing even more in the
future. I think it will be the main thing to be paid for,'' said
Brewer, ``Our business is getting to be the main thing in
telecommunications, the core. And the thing that we are the best
at, service and support, is increasing in importance. It's the core
of the core.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless regulatory laws are changed, however, broadband users
won't be able to chose an Internet provider _ their ISP will be
either the phone or the cable company. Brewer and other ISPs
believe there should be just as much choice for the user in the
broadband arena as there is in the dial-up universe. Other ISPs
such as America Online, Earthlink and US West are all advocates of
shared lines for the ``last mile.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, MindSpring has bought much of its growth, adding the
dial-up businesses of providers like SpryNet and PSI. But the Net
is increasingly seen as the future of communications, a
trillion-dollar potential that is barely being tapped.
</P>
<P>
   As a mid-sized company in a rapidly maturing and consolidating
industry, MindSpring faces new questions as it grows from private
start-up to larger publicly-held company. Is the company that has
been hunting for new acquisitions about to become prey for larger
companies? There are some truly deep pockets that want to play.
</P>
<P>
   The deepest of those belong to the long-distance providers like
AT&AMP;T, Sprint and the local phone companies like BellSouth. All of
them already have Net businesses, all want to be national players
and all are communications Goliaths to MindSpring's David.
BellSouth, for example, has revenues of more than $22 billion a
year.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring also faces another dilemma: In the manner of many
entrepreneurial companies, its fate seems bound up with Brewer, its
founder.
</P>
<P>
   Many start-up companies have had similar experiences: even
though the founder had the initial vision and set the company's
course, often that same person may not be the right one to steer
through a later crisis. A company has often capsized when it sailed
into unexpected trouble and its founder wouldn't let go of the
wheel. And as a technology company goes from the garage to the
corporate suite, the move is often accompanied by mutinies and
executive plank-walking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss of chief financial officer Michael Misikoff,
generally credited with building MindSpring's reputation on Wall
Street, MindSpring has already gone a long way toward avoiding the
pitfalls of corporate growth. Brewer remains chief executive and
chairman, but he has surrendered day-to-day control to Mike
McQuary, company president. MindSpring has added several key
executives, including Dave Baker, who left the Public Service
Commission to help guide MindSpring over the shoals of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the transitions have been fairly smooth. To avoid future
discord, Brewer said he wants to screen candidates _ including the
next CFO _ for philosophical compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, MindSpring will encounter challenges that are part
business, part personnel, part regulatory politics. The company
must protect its reputation for service, expand into new parts of
the country, convince regulators to grant entre into high-speed
data game.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer says success comes from changing quickly while holding on
to the principle that brought the company this far.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is, 'what is it like to work there?' If we
make it the kind of place that people aspire to be, that's what
will make us dramatically more productive and that will drive
financial results. You never hear that question from financial
analysts _ that's not even on their list. But the value chain
starts with the question, 'what is it like to work there?'''

 &HT;    A mystery is being unearthed in Miami.
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Beneath this city of intrigue, where capers and various
forms of subterfuge seem to unfold around every corner, a mystery
is being unearthed.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the flavor of mystery from here to which we've grown
accustomed; a city hall deception or international drug smuggling
kind. But a genuine puzzle in the form of a perfect circle,
measuring exactly 38 feet across and carved in bedrock four feet
deep at the mouth of the Miami River.
</P>
<P>
   Discovered in July, the formation is likely a structure of the
ancient Tequesta Indians, the extinct tribe that once inhabited the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But while archaeologists think they know who built it, why
constitutes the mystery. And if solved, it could mean a new
understanding of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like this, where it was actually hewn out of rock,
this shape and this size, of Tequestan culture has ever been found
before,'' said John M. Ricisak, an archaeologist supervising the
dig and soon-to-be director of the Miami-Dade Historic Preservation
Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you find something in a place where it's never been
found before, it raises all kinds of questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions, it appears, almost everyone is happy to help answer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the force of volunteers that has done almost all the
delicate digging, more curious folks have flocked to the site. On
Tuesday, a representative of the Miami UFO Center showed up. The
day before, a woman claiming to be a time-traveler offered her
talents to track down the old ones and discern the structure's
significance. Some Buddhist monks visited Sunday. Police also
chased away scavengers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Miami cops said people were leaving with bones in
their pockets,'' Ricisak said.
</P>
<P>
   Up until Monday, Brickell Pointe Ltd., the developer that plans
to erect luxury apartments on the site, allowed tours. But Tuesday
a sign discouraging trespassers hung on the eight-foot fence
enclosing the property. The firm, which has paid for much of the
excavation, has hired a security company to patrol the site,
Ricisak said. Calls to the company Tuesday were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those hoping to see the site Tuesday hiked onto the
Brickell Avenue bridge for a better view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm calling it Biscayne-henge,'' said Marcos Moure, who works
for a nearby ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   While the structure looks basic, it is not. Twenty irregular
basins form the circle, surrounded by dozens of post holes. Two
holes face true north, with the cardinal points precisely engraved
around the circle. The east point is in the shape of an eye.
Ricisak believes the formation served as a meeting place or a
stockade for animals or slaves.
</P>
<P>
   The site is significant because archaeologists have found very
little evidence of Tequestan communities on the south side of the
Miami River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know why. This gives us an opportunity to find
out,'' Ricisak said.
</P>
<P>
   But finding that answer is turning into a race against time.
</P>
<P>
   When a project goes up in an area suspected of archeological
importance, Ricisak's office is contacted. So when demolition of
the 1950s era low-rise apartment buildings came before the city of
Miami to make way for the twin towers, the city contacted the
county.
</P>
<P>
   Brickell Pointe agreed to let Ricisak and his boss, Bob Carr,
study the site, but only until it obtained its permits.
</P>
<P>
   The two figured the site would yield something because
archaeologist John Goggin surveyed it in 1940 and found artifacts.
The site is also part of trader William Brickell's early estate.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough demolishers ripping up the foundations in June
uncovered items made of shell, bone and pottery. They also found
beads, probably traded by Brickell.
</P>
<P>
   Trenches were dug for a quickie survey and revealed the holes in
the bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   With financial help from the Archaeological and Historical
Conservancy, Ricisak and Carr began an intense excavation,
measuring 5-by-5-foot foot sections and instructing volunteers to
dig 10 centimeters at a time. Surveyor Ted Riggs also stepped in
and, after only a section was unearthed, guessed the holes formed a
circle and calculated the remaining arc.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs spray-painted the ground where he thought remaining holes
would be located, a backhoe was hired and in September the holes
emerged. ``I know we're going to get criticized for doing things
the way we did, but again in our own defense, we never knew how
much time we'd have,'' Ricisak said.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs theorized the holes, aligned like compass points, formed
an observatory constructed by Mayans, or perhaps influenced by
Mayans.
</P>
<P>
   But Carr, Ricisak and other archaeologists suspect that is not
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Mayan contact with North America, in fact, has long been the
subject of great debate among scientists. No evidence of Mayan
habitation in North America has ever been found, though some
scientists believe they traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not reliable evidence of sustained contact between
those areas and South Florida,'' said University of Florida
professor William Marquardt. ``So if new findings point toward
connections between them, that would be big evidence indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   While a primitive observatory made of rocks arranged in a circle
was found along the St. Johns River in Crystal River,
archaeologists do not know who built it or why, said University of
Miami professor John Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real good chance this (Brickell site) is in fact
some sort of prehistoric observatory without telescopes . . . but
not derived from the Mayans,'' said Gifford, who visited the site
in October.
</P>
<P>
   If the structure has some sort of celestial significance, that
too would be rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there are all kinds of indications in ancient North
America of a variety of native American people who had fairly
sophisticated observance of astronomical phenomenon,'' said Jeremy
Sabloff, director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of
Archeology and Anthropology, the center for Mayan studies in the
U.S.
</P>
<P>
   Ricisak is not offering any conclusions just yet. He's more
worried about time. Last week, the developer told him they expect
to receive permits from the city next week. Before then, Ricisak
needs to convince them _ and find money _ to cut the structure en
masse from the bedrock, or at the very least make a mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayan or not, celestial or not, it's very important,'' he
said.

OFFENDERS' DRUG USE INCREASES BUT TREATMENT DECLINES, STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proportion of new prison inmates who were drug users at the
time of their arrest increased this decade, while drug treatment in
state and federal prisons fell sharply, according to a study
released on Tuesday by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is particularly tragic,'' said Richard Rosenfeld, a
professor of criminology at the University of Missouri at St.
Louis, ``is that drug treatment in prison, where it can be coerced,
has proven to be effective as an anti-crime program.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unintended consequence of prison expansion,''
Rosenfeld said in an interview. ``Each time we spend a dollar on
building a new prison or expanding an existing one, it is one less
dollar for drug treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, President Clinton announced that he would propose
$215 million in his next budget for testing and treating prisoners
for drug use. About $115 million is currently budgeted for
combating drug use by prisoners, parolees and probationers.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug proposal had been planned for some time as a
significant part of Clinton's overall anti-crime strategy, White
House aides said. Anticipating bad news in the Justice Department
report, they timed its announcement for Tuesday in hopes of
blunting the report's impact.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, reported
that the proportion of state inmates who were had been drug users
before arrest _ that is, had used drugs in the previous month _
rose to 57 percent in 1997 from 50 percent in 1990, as the
proportion among federal inmates increased to 45 percent from 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   During those same years, the study said, the proportion of
inmates in state prisons who received treatment for their drug
abuse fell to 9.7 percent in 1997, from 24.5 percent in 1991, while
the number receiving drug treatment in federal prisons declined to
9.2 percent from 15.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that participation by inmates in state and
federal prisons in other, nonmandatory drug abuse programs, like
group discussions, did increase from 1991 to 1997. But Rosenfeld
and other experts said these programs, which are cheaper to
administer but lack forced participation, are much less effective.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in drug use by prisoners in state and federal
prisons in the period leading up to their crimes appears to be the
result of increased attention by both law-enforcement officials and
legislators to drugs, singling out drug users for more arrests and
giving them longer sentences if they have a history of drug
involvement, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The actual number of criminals sentenced to prison for drug
crimes increased 6.4 percent a year from 1991 to 1997, only
slightly faster than the rate of 6.3 percent for those convicted of
nondrug offenses, the Justice Department said. But police,
prosecutors and judges are now more likely to take previous drug
use into account when making an arrest, bringing charges or passing
sentence, the experts suggested.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the huge increase in the number of Americans
in jail or prison, which has more than doubled since 1980 to 1.8
million, has forced many prisons to cut back on a variety of
counseling and educational programs in order to make space for more
beds for inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Johnson, the director of the Institute for Special
Populations Research at the National Development and Research
Institutes in New York, a nonprofit research organization, said,
``The drop in substance abuse treatment reflects a systematic
decision to reduce these treatment programs and the need to use the
space for more inmates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report underscored the strong link
between drug use and criminality, finding that 83 percent of
inmates in state prisons and 73 percent of those in federal prisons
had used drugs at some point in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased substance abuse and criminal offending,'' said
Andrew Golub, a principal investigator also at the National
Development and Research Institutes, ``are often characteristic of
the downward spiral experienced by many individuals who end up in
prison.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Golub have found that crack cocaine use has dropped
sharply among young people in New York during the 1990s, an
important factor in the decline in violent crime in the city. But
young people now are more likely to smoke marijuana, the
researchers have found, a conclusion echoed by the Justice
Department report.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department report also found that more violent
crimes were committed by people who had been drinking alcohol than
by those under the influence of drugs.

   Small-business goups see fruitful Legislature ahead
</P>
<P>
   By Kim Tyson
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Small-business advocacy groups hope the Texas
Legislature will adopt the credo of physicians when its session
opens Tuesday: First do no harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably spend a lot more of our bullets opposing stupid
bills than trying to get things passed,'' says David Pinkus,
president of Small Business United of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's two main small-business advocacy groups are also
bullish about the upcoming session and the prospect that
small-business owners may get some tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   They may have good reason to be cheery. Working in businesses'
favor will be an expected $6 billion state surplus _ which may
lessen the chances of new fees and taxes _ and a host of
pro-business Republicans coming into office.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective we're going to have a very pro-business
state Legislature,'' says Robert Howden, state director for NFIB.
</P>
<P>
   Says Pinkus: ``I think we're going to have a good session for
two reasons: The economy is pretty good and there is very little
pressure to do anything negative toward business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is we might even see some rollback in regulation,''
he says. ``That would be a victory for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kim Brimer, R-Arlington, chairman of the House Committee on
Business and Industry, is in the process of drafting an omnibus
small business bill that could address several small business
issues ranging from health care reform to privatization of state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   NFIB surveys members to develop its legislative agenda, SBU
holds a dozen meetings with members around the state to come up
with its positions. But the 40,000-member NFIB and Small Business
United of Texas, with 8,000 members in the state, have different
agendas for what they'd like to see passed.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at the groups' wish lists for the upcoming
Legislative session: Small Business United of Texas _
Across-the-board cuts in state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limits on health care mandates that cause increases in
small-business insurance premiums. Gov. George W. Bush and some
legislators have come out in support of health care reform that
would allow patients to choose their own physicians.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation and funding of a new office of Small Business
Advocacy. Staff would provide help to small businesses and give
research and assistance to state agencies and the Legislature on
the impact of new regulation on small business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation of a $5 million state fund that can be used by
community development financial institutions to make small-business
loans in economically distressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislation to encourage and protect employers who give
truthful and accurate references when somebody checks on the work
record of a former employee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reductions in the unemployment insurance rate for new
businesses from 2.7 percent to 1 percent of a company's payroll.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elimination of sales taxes on the purchase of business
equipment. (Manufacturing equipment is already exempt).
</P>
<P>
   National Federation of Independent Business
</P>
<P>
   _ Franchise tax exemptions for companies that generate less than
$100,000 in sales. Howden says a cut in the sales tax, which is
supported by Small Business United, may be too costly for the
state.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elimination of ``social promotions'' that allow students to be
promoted to higher grades without the necessary skills. ``Maybe
it's time as small business owners we take the time to see what we
can do to help the education system so these workers coming out of
school don't have to be retrained,'' Howden says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislation that would help employers give better information
when giving employee references. Rep. Brian McCall (R-Plano) has
already introduced legislation that would give some legal
protections to former employers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limits on a business owner's liability when someone is hurt
through a criminal act on their property.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislation that would limit the ability of workers covered by
worker's compensation insurance to sue other employers.

 &HT;    MindSpring's efforts to battle glitches pay off with customer
satisfactionBy Frances Katz and Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ MindSpring prides itself on its high level of customer
service and reliability. Billboards along Atlanta's I-85 tout the
supremacy of MindSpring's service and support. One reads ``Their
hold music is better than ours. It has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that when it comes to troubleshooting and on and
off-line problem solving, the company trounces its competition and
has the awards to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to any third party assessments (of ISPs), we are
still at or near the top,'' says MindSpring president and COO
Michael McQuary says. ``That is in server up-time and network
availability. I would put our service up against anybody's.''
</P>
<P>
   But even most patient, best-trained, technically astute customer
service representative can't calm customers irate over the recent
avalanche of spam many subscribers received. Nor can they repair
the mail servers when they crash or break down as they did in
December.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring is somewhat reluctant to talk about service glitches,
even though the problems are small compared with the litany of
troubles that plague America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, however is that AOL never claimed the high moral
ground for its service and support. MindSpring does. The company
built its reputation on the fact that hardly anything ever goes
wrong, that it takes special care of its customers. The 455,000
MindSpring subscribers are used to service that is virtually
problem-free.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most routine maintenance problem can send MindSpring
members into a tizzy, but analysts say it doesn't take much to
upset Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our customers from day one have held us to the highest
standards,'' McQuary says. ``I don't think that has changed much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are just becoming more and more dependent on (their
Internet Service Providers), says Jupiter Communications analyst
Zia Daniell says, as the online population shifts from hobbyists to
mainstream consumers using the Net to shop, send e-mail and conduct
business, Net service interruptions are more frustrating than they
used to be for casual surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Daniell says consumers are quick to lose patience with their
ISPs because each company is competing harder than ever for
business. ``Consumers are being courted left and right,'' she says.
``They have a zillion choices.''

   ``The difference between the way MindSpring handles the problems
and the way others do, is that we post the problems and the
estimated time it will be corrected,'' says MindSpring spokesman Ed
Hansen. ``We don't hide the problems. MindSpring posts daily status
reports on its Web page at http://help.mindspring.com/netstatus.
``We are not just sitting back and giving you a splash screen
saying sorry, service not available. We're out front really trying
to get them fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen says spam is an ongoing problem all ISPs experience and
spammers tend to go all out during the holiday season. ``Spam is
really a nasty problem and the people who send it are determined to
send it no matter what,'' he says. ``And it takes all the ISPs time
to figure out how to stop it, it's a vicious cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Spam is just a huge issue,'' McQuary says. ``Spam increased
about 300 percent in the last three months. We are filtering as
fast as we can, and some gets through. But we are doing nothing
different on our end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen also says the server slowdowns were due to people sending
animated attached files_ such as electronic Christmas cards to
MindSpring subscribers. When that type of file is send out it
resides on MindSpring servers until the user downloads it, slowing
down the system.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen also confirms a major mail server breakdown in
mid-December. Mail service was shut down for about three hours
while the machine was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen compares the recent troubles to a PC crash. ``You don't
know why but your PC will sometimes fail.'' He's also quick to
point out that while mail service was down, no e-mail was lost.
``We were very lucky.''

 &HT;    Ellis ``Jeb'' Bush was sworn in as Florida's 43rd governor
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Servic--
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ On a day that was so frigid even the elephant
needed a blanket, John Ellis ``Jeb'' Bush was sworn in as Florida's
43rd governor Tuesday on the coldest inaugration day since 1899.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice has Florida elected a governor from Miami. The first
was U.S. Sen. Bob Graham who told the shivering crowd that a
newspaper editorial once said ``it would be a cold day in hell when
anyone from Miami is elected governor.''
</P>
<P>
   When Graham took the oath in 1979 it was 27 degrees and snowing.
Tuesday, Bush woke up to 22 degrees with a wind chill making it 11
degrees. It did not snow.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:02 p.m., as his parents, former President George Bush and
Barbara, his big brother, Texas Gov. George Bush, the new govenor's
wife, Columba, and their three children stood near him, Bush, 45,
removed his overcoat and took the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a 10-minute speech, Bush spoke about his relationship
with God, his belief in the compassion of Florida's people and his
concern that government has grown too large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith, family, friends _ These are what's best. These will
endure. We should trust in these more than we trust in
government,'' Bush said. ``State government, now and forever, must
respect and nuture and rely on these enduring institutions so that
we can unleash their amazing potential.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush, Florida's third Republican governor in this century,
offered no specific goals or plans in his speech, Graham, a
Democrat who served from 1979 to 1987, said inaugural speechs
should not be specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jeb Bush has outlined a philosophy of individual
responsibility, of government that knows its limits, and asking for
standards of excellence that I would agree with,'' Graham said.
``The conversations I've had with him indicate his intention to
govern from the center.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father said he, ``never dreamed it would be this exciting
for a family. We're a lucky family.'' Any words of wisdom for his
son? ``No, he doesn't need any advice from me.'' Then he turned to
the reporters and said, ``Be nice to my boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Big brother George did have a bit of advice for his sibling
about his speech. The Texas governor, who is considering a run for
president in 2000, said, ``keep it short.''
</P>
<P>
   During the prayer breakfast, Boca Raton Rabbi Kenneth Brandor
read from Psalm 23, asking Bush to put his trust in the Lord and
for God to guide Bush and Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan in the coming
years. ``When a person has the capacity to feel God's hand on their
shoulder, the charisma of that relationship empowers one to go
forward with clarity.''
</P>
<P>
   While the cold weather made hats necessary, many of the women,
led by Bush's wife Columba, planned to wear hats anyway as a show
of support for Brogan's wife Mary. She is undergoing treatment for
a second bout of cancer that was discovered recently by her
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Brogan, who left his job as education commissioner to run with
Bush, and Florida's six independently elected Cabinet officers also
took the oath of office before the new governor was sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   Newly elected Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher and Secretary
of State Katherine Harris join Comptroller Bob Milligan as the
Republicans on the Cabinet along with Treasurer Bill Nelson,
Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford and Attorney General Bob
Butterworth _ all Democratic incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing Gov. Buddy MacKay, who became the chief executive early
Dec. 13 following the unexpected death of Gov. Lawton Chiles,
pledged his support to the man who defeated him in the Nov. 3
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge my prayers, my goodwill, my support to help you
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's new secretary of labor, former West Palm Beach City
Commissioner Mary Hooks, said, ``Jeb's foremost theme is that this
is going to be a compassionate government. It's going to be a
government from the bottom up. He's going to bring a new culture
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooks, a Democrat, predicted the new Republican governor would
win over many Democrats and others who didn't support him.
``There's going to be a lot of good, positive surprises for some
people. He will be a governor for all the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the speeches, there was a parade with 25 bands. At one
point, just blocks from the Capitol, Bush, wearing just a sweater
to keep warm, began sprinting toward the parade finish line with
his two sons, aides and security agents joining him. Bush was
grinning the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   As the blanket-draped elephant passed, concluding the parade,
Bush motorcaded to a private party hosted by the Associated
Industries of Florida, a leading business lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended with a street festival, tours of the Governor's
Mansion and a laser light show.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the day's over? Graham remembered it this way:
``You feel like the stars of the universe have fallen upon you.
That may be a slight hyperbole, but you have a sudden realization
of the hopes people have invested in you.''
</P>

A PEEK INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S HEART
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   G &UR; ail Sheehy &LR; 's portrait of the Clinton marriage in the latest
issue of Vanity Fair reveals that first lady  &UR; Hillary &LR; 
 &UR; Rodham Clinton  &LR;  hasn't discussed her relationship with  &UR; Bill &LR;  with
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk to Hillary about anything deeply personal
concerning her marriage. We don't sit down and have those
mother-daughter discussions about how she relates to her husband,
her daughter or anything else as far as her personal life is
concerned. We don't talk about deeply personal things.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dorothy Rodham &LR;  said she had trained her daughter to maintain
her equilibrium. ``She doesn't go into one of these horribly
overwrought kinds of tizzies. That's one thing I never did,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the Clinton marriage _ Bill is Hillary's
 &UR; Monica &LR; , writes Sheehy _ the author discusses the post-White House
future of this very private first lady. Will she run for the
Senate? Will she move to New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those closest to her say Hillary will definitely write a
book,'' she writes, ``probably more than one.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In response to  &UR; Sally Quinn &LR; 's recent Washington Post
trashing of the Clintons' manners and mores, Clinton defender
 &UR; James Carville &LR;  came out with guns blazing. Quinn, whose opinion is
said to have been the result of a perceived snub by the Clintons
early in the administration, ``describes Washington as a village,''
said Carville, in comments quoted in Washingtonian magazine.
``Well, every village has an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S.  &UR; Gar Smith  &LR; passes along word that ``The Mess on the
Dress'' by  &UR; Revengade &LR;  has taken first place in the 1998 St. Croix
calypso contest. The refrain: ``The mess on the dress make the

   Mindful of the fuss over the Modern Library's list of the

``Sunday in the Park With George'' and ``The Music Man.''

 &HT;    COLD-WEATHER
 &HT;    A freeze advisory in Palm Beach County
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Temperatures that have fallen into the 30s and 40s in Palm Beach
County and the Treasure Coast for the past two nights should
rebound to the mid-60s today, but the respite may be brief.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's another cold front poised to move into North Florida
on Saturday night,'' said Joel Rothfuss, a meterologist with the
National Weather Service in Miami. ``We might have cool days Sunday
and Monday. Expect another shot.''
</P>
<P>
   A freeze advisory was extended further south in the Florida
peninsula Tuesday after extending to Orlando and Cape Canaveral on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross shelters in West Palm Beach and Belle Glade remained
open again last night, when temperatures were expected to hit the
lower 40s in Palm Beach County and the mid-30s in Martin and St.
Lucie counties.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, 23 people took advantage of the West Palm Beach
shelter, said Red Cross spokeswoman Paula Sirois.
</P>
<P>
   The freezing and near-freezing temperatures can dry out and kill
some ground vegetation, providing more fuel for flames to spread.
That coupled with winds expected at 20 mph _ with higher gusts _
Tuesday and early Wednesday could make for an incendiary
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Power &AMP; Light planned on plugging in some extra power
plants to keep the heaters and electric blankets toasting.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Dale Thomas said the short cold snap wouldn't really
tax the FPL system, but the company would bring in extra service
personnel and put extra plants online to meet increased demand.
</P>
<P>
   While temperatures must drop to 28 degrees or below for several
hours to hurt citrus fruit, most vegetables begin to sustain damage
at 32 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable grower John Thomas put his entire 1,000-person work
force on harvest duty Tuesday, picking as many tomatoes, peppers
and green beans as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are picking all we can . . . to get them under cover
tonight,'' said Thomas, president of Boca Raton-based Thomas
Produce Co., which has 10,000 acres in six counties including Palm
Beach, Martin and St. Lucie.
</P>
<P>
   Because forecasts call only for low 30s, Thomas said he decided
not to drape his crop rows with a protective covering _ an
expensive and time-consuming process.
</P>
<P>
   The recent cold snap in Florida increased the danger of forest
fires, and state officials Tuesday urged hunters, leaf burners and
others near the woods to be extra careful.

 &HT;    Q and A with MindSpring founder Charles Brewer
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell and Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting in a sparse office, with his faithful, three-legged
Rottweiler at his feet, MindSpring Enterprises founder Charles
Brewer talked recently about MindSpring's humble beginnings and its
surge to its position as a leader in the ISP industry. Excepts from
the wide-ranging interview follow:
</P>
<P>
   Q: With MindSpring growing so fast, is it hard to keep it the
kind of company you want it to be?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``As we got bigger, some things have gotten harder and in
other ways, things have gotten easier. I compare it to gravity. The
bigger we get it seems like there's a force trying to suck us back
to being like any other company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, having the right people is a big part of the battle.
And we still talk about our core values and beliefs a lot. When
something happens, we train ourselves to ask what do the core
values and beliefs have to say about this? A lot of the time, the
answer is clear from that. If we do that, the core values and
beliefs will do a lot of the managing for us. Which means that
managers don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see the Internet industry and the role of ISPs
changing and growing over the next few years?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The advent of high-speed broadband will lead to a
transition over the next few years. It's very certain that's going
to happen. It's on its way to becoming the core of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Net) is going from being a relatively minor and kind of
quirky branch of the telecommunications business to being the main
thing. It's certainly something I never anticipated when I started
the company, and that's very exciting for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the execution that makes MindSpring extraordinary _ not
the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't you threatened by the deployment of cable modems and
DSL?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Broadband is now deployed here. Well, so what? If the only
choice for a provider is somebody you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last mile owners are having an awfully difficult time
learning to help customers have a satisfactory experience hooking
up to the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you say that regulators should guarantee that you and
other Internet service providers have access to those new
high-speed connections to the home, what you call 'the last mile'?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We are arguing that it is absolutely crucial for the open
system structure of the last mile to survive the transition to
broadband. If there is only one choice and the one provider
controls what you see on the Internet ... (that won't work). If DSL
has a deal with the last-mile provider that becomes the only
communications you can get, that concern becomes more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But would it pay for broadband companies to install the
technology if they can't be sure they will be the ISP instead of
MindSpring or someone else?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I've actually done this _ you get a spreadsheet. I think
that if we could drive customers to broadband, we could drive the
market much, much faster than the cable companies could drive it on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to take a risk. Those companies deserve to make a
lot of money out of their investments. But the way they do it is
not through having regulations reward them with a monopoly or
duopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: As the company grows and changes, as others run it day to
day, are you feeling distant from that? Do you miss it?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``On the one hand, I think delegating comes naturally to me.
Still, frequently there are some things that I wish I could be
doing that I can't. I used to say that one of my most important
jobs was to organize things so I had no work to do anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do best when I can focus on one big thing until it's done. I
don't do well with a Unix multitasking kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: MindSpring stock has been in the thick of what's happening in
the Internet business. You went from less than $10 a share to over
$60 this year. What does that do for the business?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Focusing on the stock day to day, with it moving up and
down so much, does nothing for us doing our job well. One of my
strongest psychological needs is to not let people down, so when
the stock is gyrating around it's tough not to feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is, 'What is it like to work there?' If we
make it the kind of place that people aspire to be, that's what
will make us dramatically more productive and that will drive
financial results.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you look into the future? Can you say how long you are
likely to stay where you are?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We try to run the business figuring that we will own it and
run it forever _ which may not be the case. As for me, I guess you
don't know 'til you get there. So far, so good. I've gotten to be
the pioneer, pushing into each new area. Who knows what the next
one will be?''

 &HT;    Sprint jumping into wireless
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sprint PCS plans to launch wireless service in metro
Atlanta Monday, joining a fray in which a half-dozen rivals are
already jostling for business.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint has spent $300 million building a network in the area.
Despite the late start, the company believes it can go from zero
subscribers to market leader within two years, according to Brad
Mitchell, area vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's doubt in anyone's mind that the market
cannot sustain seven wireless companies, but we intend to be one of
the ones left standing,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which paid $36 million for the Atlanta license in 1997,
arrives with some obvious strengths: digital technology, a national
network and a well-known brand name. Sprint can also offer to
``bundle'' other services _ like Internet access _ along with
wireless service.
</P>
<P>
   But in Atlanta, the company also must fight for space in the
minds of customers already besieged by ads from other carriers.
Playing catch-up, Sprint must pour money into marketing, while
shaving profit margins to make sure prices are competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint PCS, which has about 1,600 employees in metro Atlanta,
doesn't need to make a profit for seven to 10 years, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless service has been getting cheaper in recent years.
National providers like AT&AMP;T have also moved to lump long-distance
calls with local, with the same per-minute charges. However,
customers must usually spend upward of $80 to $120 per month for
that offering. Sprint in Atlanta will up the ante by lowering the
price: A user can get 120 minutes of any kind of calling for $30 a
month; for $50, a customer will get 500 minutes, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch, AT&AMP;T, BellSouth, Nextel, Powertel and Southern LINC
already offer wireless service in metro Atlanta. Powertel's
licenses are concentrated in the Southeast. So is coverage offered
by Southern, which _ like Nextel _ has a combination of cellular
phone and dispatch radio.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, which has service in 225 markets, is not alone in
building a national network. AirTouch, AT&AMP;T and Nextel can also
promise customers the ability to use the same phone around the
country with various deals that cut out charges for piggybacking on
someone else's system. To get that national ``footprint,'' Bell
Atlantic is negotiating to pay upward of $50 billion for AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by contrast, BellSouth offers wireless service only in the
Southeast, although it owns wireless interests in several cities
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That gives Sprint a leg up, Mitchell said. ``If you fly to
Seattle, when you step off the plane, the phone will work exactly
the same as it did in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has been one of the nation's hottest wireless markets,
with an estimated 1.2 million wireless phone users. Although no
company here releases subscriber figures, BellSouth is widely
believed to hold the largest chunk of the market, followed by
AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   But BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher was blase at Sprint's vow
to become leader of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose everyone needs to have a goal,'' he said. ``But
we've already got five or six competitors in a number of markets,
so this is just another one here.''

BRITAIN'S TOP WIRELESS CARRIER JOINS BATTLE TO ACQUIRE AIRTOUCH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Britain's largest wireless carrier, Vodafone Group, confirmed
Tuesday that it had approached Airtouch Communications, the largest
all-wireless carrier in the United States, with a preliminary
proposal to buy the company, complicating merger talks between
Airtouch and Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, the largest local phone company in the United
States, has been in talks with Airtouch to acquire the company in a
$45 billion stock swap. But executives close to the deal said
representatives for Airtouch and Vodafone had spent the weekend
trying to hash out what price Vodafone would be willing to pay for
Airtouch shares.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, an on-again, off-again suitor for Airtouch, confirmed
its current talks after The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday
that the British company had offered to pay more than $45 billion
for Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   While a combination of Airtouch and Bell Atlantic would create a
U.S. wireless giant poised to take on AT&AMP;T Corp. and the Sprint PCS
venture, a combined Vodafone-Airtouch would focus on overseas
markets, particularly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone until now has shunned the U.S. market. If it acquired
Airtouch and retained Airtouch's U.S. operations, the overall
impact on domestic consumers could be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Airtouch representatives received a preliminary
proposal from Vodafone to enter into merger negotiations for a deal
that would include an exchange of shares and possibly a cash
component, the executives said. While no price was disclosed by the
companies on Tuesday, industry observers suggested that a Vodafone
offer could go as high as $90 a share. Whatever the price, it is
likely to be a premium to any Bell Atlantic offer.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Barwick, director of corporate affairs at Vodafone, said
executives from his company and Airtouch had talked in recent
weeks. One person close to the companies, said that while in Europe
recently, executives from Airtouch had met with Vodafone's top
managers, including Christopher Gent, Vodafone's chairman, who is
currently on vacation in Australia. He said there had been no
high-level discussions in recent days between Gent and Sam Ginn,
chairman of Airtouch.
</P>
<P>
   Barwick said his company had been surprised by recent reports in
the news media of talks between Bell Atlantic and Airtouch and, as
a result, decided to make a preliminary offer quickly. Both Bell
Atlantic and Vodafone have long flirted with Airtouch. Earlier this
year, analysts said, Vodafone made an offer to buy Airtouch's
international operations but was rebuffed. It was then that
Airtouch turned its attentions to Bell Atlantic, though those
discussions did not heat up until recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very serious about this offer,'' said Robert Gensler,
a telecommunications analyst at T. Rowe Price, a mutual fund
company based in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Since splitting from Racal Electronics in 1988, Vodafone has
grown into Britain's largest wireless carrier, with almost 5
million customers, largely on the power of attractive price plans.
In the last quarter of 1998 alone, for instance, the company added
more than 930,000 customers, mostly on the appeal of a plan that
does allows users to pay as they call, rather than sign up for a
long contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic and Airtouch still have several issues to work
out, including what tax treatment the two companies would receive
in a merger. Any deal between the two would dilute Bell Atlantic's
earnings. Also, Bell Atlantic agreed to buy GTE Corp. this summer.
That deal has yet to be approved by regulators, and some analysts
expressed concern that it could be jeopardized by the past week's
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the GTE and Bell Atlantic deal could be broken up over
this,'' said Tim O'Neil, a wireless telecommunications analyst at
Soundview Technology Group. ``I would assume that, excluding
Vodafone, Bell Atlantic would be more prepared to go forward with
Airtouch than GTE.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Bell Atlantic, which is based in New York,
said the company was not surprised by Vodafone's entry into the
bidding for Airtouch, which is based in San Francisco. While those
executives have said since the weekend that Bell Atlantic could
offer as much as $50 billion for Airtouch, or about $83 for each
Airtouch share, it was not clear Tuesday whether Bell Atlantic had
committed to raising its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone has been thought to be interested at least in
Airtouch's overseas operations at least since the fall. Until now,
it appeared that Vodafone was not keen on entering the U.S. market,
partly because competition is more intense domestically than it is
in many foreign markets. Another complicating factor has been that
while wireless networks in much of Europe and the Middle East are
technologically homogenous, U.S. carriers use a variety of
technical standards, potentially raising operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   But in Europe, Airtouch's properties would mesh well with
Vodafone's existing operations. Vodafone's customers outside
Britain are largely in northern Europe, including Sweden, France,
Germany and the Netherlands. Airtouch's European operations are
mainly in the southern part of the continent, in Spain, Italy and
Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts and investors suggest that Airtouch would be
better off cutting a three-way deal with European properties going
to Vodafone and domestic operation given to Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way you maximize your benefit to the Airtouch
shareholder is to split it up,'' said Michael J. Mahoney, manager
of the AIM Global Telecommunications Fund, which owns 439,000
shares of Airtouch. ``If the offers were even-steven, I might have
a preference for Bell Atlantic because it's more liquid, but what I
really care about is just getting more money for my shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   In another scenario, said Gensler, Vodafone could buy the whole
company and then enter into a joint operating agreement venture
with Bell Atlantic regarding Airtouch's domestic operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic could be a huge winner without having to buy the
assets,'' he said. ``There is a chance that Airtouch would get than
a full price in a bidding war if Bell Atlantic and Vodafone cut a
deal without them.''

 &HT;    Q and A with MindSpring founder Charles Brewer
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell and Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting in a sparse office, with his faithful, three-legged
Rottweiler at his feet, MindSpring Enterprises founder Charles
Brewer talked recently about MindSpring's humble beginnings and its
surge to its position as a leader in the ISP industry. Excepts from
the wide-ranging interview follow:
</P>
<P>
   Q: With MindSpring growing so fast, is it hard to keep it the
kind of company you want it to be?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``As we got bigger, some things have gotten harder and in
other ways, things have gotten easier. I compare it to gravity. The
bigger we get it seems like there's a force trying to suck us back
to being like any other company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, having the right people is a big part of the battle.
And we still talk about our core values and beliefs a lot. When
something happens, we train ourselves to ask what do the core
values and beliefs have to say about this? A lot of the time, the
answer is clear from that. If we do that, the core values and
beliefs will do a lot of the managing for us. Which means that
managers don't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see the Internet industry and the role of ISPs
changing and growing over the next few years?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The advent of high-speed broadband will lead to a
transition over the next few years. It's very certain that's going
to happen. It's on its way to becoming the core of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Net) is going from being a relatively minor and kind of
quirky branch of the telecommunications business to being the main
thing. It's certainly something I never anticipated when I started
the company, and that's very exciting for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the execution that makes MindSpring extraordinary _ not
the strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Aren't you threatened by the deployment of cable modems and
DSL?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Broadband is now deployed here. Well, so what? If the only
choice for a provider is somebody you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last mile owners are having an awfully difficult time
learning to help customers have a satisfactory experience hooking
up to the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you say that regulators should guarantee that you and
other Internet service providers have access to those new
high-speed connections to the home, what you call 'the last mile'?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We are arguing that it is absolutely crucial for the open
system structure of the last mile to survive the transition to
broadband. If there is only one choice and the one provider
controls what you see on the Internet ... (that won't work). If DSL
has a deal with the last-mile provider that becomes the only
communications you can get, that concern becomes more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: But would it pay for broadband companies to install the
technology if they can't be sure they will be the ISP instead of
MindSpring or someone else?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I've actually done this _ you get a spreadsheet. I think
that if we could drive customers to broadband, we could drive the
market much, much faster than the cable companies could drive it on
their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to take a risk. Those companies deserve to make a
lot of money out of their investments. But the way they do it is
not through having regulations reward them with a monopoly or
duopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: As the company grows and changes, as others run it day to
day, are you feeling distant from that? Do you miss it?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``On the one hand, I think delegating comes naturally to me.
Still, frequently there are some things that I wish I could be
doing that I can't. I used to say that one of my most important
jobs was to organize things so I had no work to do anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do best when I can focus on one big thing until it's done. I
don't do well with a Unix multitasking kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: MindSpring stock has been in the thick of what's happening in
the Internet business. You went from less than $10 a share to over
$60 this year. What does that do for the business?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Focusing on the stock day to day, with it moving up and
down so much, does nothing for us doing our job well. One of my
strongest psychological needs is to not let people down, so when
the stock is gyrating around it's tough not to feel it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is, 'What is it like to work there?' If we
make it the kind of place that people aspire to be, that's what
will make us dramatically more productive and that will drive
financial results.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you look into the future? Can you say how long you are
likely to stay where you are?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``We try to run the business figuring that we will own it and
run it forever _ which may not be the case. As for me, I guess you
don't know 'til you get there. So far, so good. I've gotten to be
the pioneer, pushing into each new area. Who knows what the next
one will be?''

A PEEK INTO HILLARY CLINTON'S HEART

<TEXT>
<P>
   G &UR; ail Sheehy &LR; 's portrait of the Clinton marriage in the latest
issue of Vanity Fair reveals that first lady  &UR; Hillary &LR; 
 &UR; Rodham Clinton  &LR;  hasn't discussed her relationship with  &UR; Bill &LR;  with
her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't talk to Hillary about anything deeply personal
concerning her marriage. We don't sit down and have those
mother-daughter discussions about how she relates to her husband,
her daughter or anything else as far as her personal life is
concerned. We don't talk about deeply personal things.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dorothy Rodham &LR;  said she had trained her daughter to maintain
her equilibrium. ``She doesn't go into one of these horribly
overwrought kinds of tizzies. That's one thing I never did,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing the Clinton marriage _ Bill is Hillary's
 &UR; Monica &LR; , writes Sheehy _ the author discusses the post-White House
future of this very private first lady. Will she run for the
Senate? Will she move to New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those closest to her say Hillary will definitely write a
book,'' she writes, ``probably more than one.''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In response to  &UR; Sally Quinn &LR; 's recent Washington Post
trashing of the Clintons' manners and mores, Clinton defender
 &UR; James Carville &LR;  came out with guns blazing. Quinn, whose opinion is
said to have been the result of a perceived snub by the Clintons
early in the administration, ``describes Washington as a village,''
said Carville, in comments quoted in Washingtonian magazine.
``Well, every village has an idiot.''

   PALM BEACH _ A lot has happened to Gen Colin Powell since he
last spoke to The Society of the Four Arts three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hasbro toy company has included my likeness as one of
their G.I. Joe action figures, so I've been immortalized,'' Powell

 &HT;    Two vicitms settle sex abuse suit against priest
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two more victims of a priest connected to Palm Beach Bishop J.
Keith Symons _ who resigned last year after admitting to sexually
abusing several boys _ have settled their suits against the
Archdiocese of Miami, according to court records and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The two Palm Beach County men were among five who have said the
Rev. Rocco D'Angelo sexually assaulted them in the 1960s when they
were attending St. Mark's Catholic Church in Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of Miami has admitted in court papers that while
it promised boys' parents in the 1960s that D'Angelo would be kept
from children, it instead sent him to the Tampa area, where he
worked for more than two decades. Suits there accuse D'Angelo, now
76, of abusing at least four more young boys _ one as recently as
1987.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers sued in March 1997, each seeking more than $15,000
in damages from D'Angelo and more than $15,000 against both Symons
and Miami Archbishop John Favalora.
</P>
<P>
   The cases were settled Dec. 11, Palm Beach County Circuit Court
records show.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were confidentially resolved,'' Sheldon Stevens, lawyer
for the brothers, said from Cocoa Beach. He would not say how much
the church paid or describe other terms of the settlement. The men
and James Gilbride, attorney for the Archdiocese of Miami, declined
to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Worth mail carrier Kevin Sidaway, now 42, was the first of
D'Angelo's victims to come forward. After learning in 1993 that
D'Angelo had been allowed to continue in the church, Sidaway
pursued criminal charges. Palm Beach County prosecutors were
thwarted by a quirk in the law that made it a crime to abuse young
girls, but not boys. Sidaway then sued the Archdiocese in 1994.
That case was settled March 19; details were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Diocese of St. Petersburg has said no one ever reported an
assault by D'Angelo in the 25 years he was a priest there.
Documents from the mid-1970s show the Archdiocese of Miami did
advise St. Petersburg officials, including then-Chancellor Symons,
of D'Angelo's problems and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As chancellor in St. Petersburg from 1971 to 1981, Symons
compiled ``the professional psychiatric evaluations that at the
time clearly demonstrated the fitness of Reverend D'Angelo to serve
as a priest,'' Symons said in a statement to The Palm Beach Post
for a 1996 story about the D'Angelo case. The mother of the two
Palm Beach County men has said Symons paid about $725 for therapy
for the older son, leaving cash in installments in plain envelopes
at the Cathedral of St. Ignatius Loyola in Palm Beach Gardens.
Symons has declined to comment or confirm the payments, citing
pastoral confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Symons, spiritual leader for 200,000 Catholics in five counties,
was forced to step down June 1 after admitting he had sexually
molested five boys more than three decades ago. He became the
highest-ranking American Catholic to be forced out of church office
for molesting minors.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers and Sidaway have not dropped their cases against
D'Angelo, who their lawyers have been unable to serve with a
summons. Lawyers have said they believe he is in a psychiatric
hospital in Maryland or back in the Tampa area. A call Tuesday to
D'Angelo's Tampa listing got no answer.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo's personal attorney, Joseph Ciarciaglino of St.
Petersburg, would not comment. The Diocese of St. Petersburg
retired D'Angelo in 1993 after an Orlando man said D'Angelo
sexually assaulted him in Broward County in 1964.

 &HT;    Jacor buys four radio stations in Georgia
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jacor Communications Inc. will increase its stake in
Georgia with the acquisition of four radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Jacor, based in Covington, Ky., one of the nation's largest
radio companies, said Tuesday it had signed a definitive agreement
to buy the stations from MetroSouth Communications LLC, City of
Homes Radio LLC and Radio LaGrange LLC for $4.4 million. The
stations are WCOH-AM of Newnan, WMKJ -FM of Peachtree City and
WMXY-AM and WZLG-FM of Hogansville.
</P>
<P>
   The company declined to comment further on the deal, which is
subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close during the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jacor already owns five stations in Georgia _ WGST-AM, WPCH-FM,
WKLS-FM, all in metro Atlanta; WHEL-FM of Helen, and provides
programming to WGST-FM in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We operate on the philosophy of building hubs and surrounding
them with spokes,'' said Jacor spokeswoman Pam Taylor. ``The idea
there is you can leverage some of the administrative overhead and
programming overhead and other costs into smaller markets from your
base and therefore reduce the overall cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions represent ``small items in a big, big ocean,''
said analyst Tom Burnett, founder of New York-based Merger Insight,
an institutional research firm.
</P>
<P>
   With the pending acquisitions, Jacor now owns, operates or
represents 244 radio stations in 62 broadcast markets.

 &HT;    Massaging the microchip
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James D. Meindl, more than most, knew the importance
of the landmark research project to work on the next generation of
computer microchip. So did nearly every other specialist in
microelectronics, the science of shaping, massaging and activating
the tiny brains of computers.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Georgia Tech, under the guidance of Meindl and his
colleagues on the North Avenue campus, that won the role of
directing the $19.5 million, three-year program _ leading a
consortium of schools from the Bay Area to Cambridge, Mass., to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   How Meindl, a veteran professor and university administrator,
corralled such important work for Georgia Tech gives clues about
the larger strategy to put the Georgia school in the first rank of
engineering centers.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, Meindl knows his business and all the players. He
taught engineering for 20 years at Stanford, and served five years
as provost at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, where
he initiated a chip research program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in the business, more or less, for 40 years,''
Meindl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word reached us two years ago that this research program was
in the works, and we began to prepare for it,'' he said. The ``we''
was a circle of professional acquaintances involved in
microelectronics research.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that among the proposals was the suggestion that
he form a team and base it in the Bay Area, but he decided Georgia
Tech would be most suitable because he had a suitable professional
network in this area. And the research will be divided among Tech,
MIT, Stanford, Cornell, RPI and the State University of New York at
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   So how will the work be divided?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have decided that at Tech we will work on the connectivity
problem between the newest chip and the outside environment,'' he
said, ``while others will concentrate on the internal wiring
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he preferred the assignment to improve exterior
connectivity because it will lead more directly into the new roles
or jobs that the latest chips can perform. The new project, funded
by a combination of private industry and government funds, has
widespread growth implications for Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the microelectronics lab sits cheek-to-jowl with
several departments that will contribute to the new technology,
including the electrical engineering, chemical engineering,
materials science and physics departments.
</P>
<P>
   Already the jackhammers are pounding the earth to expand the
7,000 square feet of ``clean room'' work space for research, adding
another 1,500 square feet. Moreover, there will be additions to the
professional research staff, and a plan to add platoons of graduate
assistants and even undergraduates later.
</P>
<P>
   And the way things work in academia, the research activity will
be a magnet for more bright students and teachers, gradually
bolstering the infrastructure of the university and its status as a
research center.
</P>
<P>
   What will be taking place is mind-boggling to the layperson. In
the strange and immaculate environment of the clean rooms, staff
and researchers pad about clad from toe to head in white, sanitary
garb, staring at transistors so small they can be seen only through
microscopes, redesigning multiple levels of wire connections
between the parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our environment must be much, much cleaner than a hospital
operating room,'' Meindl said, ``because the tiniest particle could
create problems for us. Soon, as the devices become ever smaller,
we will be able to work only through electron microscopes.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole march of the exotic work is part and parcel of the
pledge last summer by Wayne Clough, president of Georgia Tech, to
put the school in the front rank of research institutions
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview recently, Clough said his aim is to put Tech in
the same league as MIT, Stanford and the other research elite, and
the microchip research prize is a significant step in that
direction.

SPORTS COLUMN: `HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE MADE AN ILLEGAL BET?'  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ In its scarlet and black practice uniforms,
the Rutgers men's basketball team gathered in the Rutgers Athletic
Center meeting room where the players usually listen to Coach Kevin
Bannon and watch game tapes. But Tuesday there were no X's and O's
on the chalkboard, no videos rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Rutgers athletic director, Bob Mulcahy, introduced
a guest speaker, Arnie Wexler, 59, who informed the players that
``gambling is the biggest killer on college campuses _ bigger than
drugs, bigger than alcohol.'' And now Wexler was asking them
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you,'' he said, ``have made a legal bet?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 players sitting there, three raised a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler nodded and asked, ``How many of you have made an illegal
bet?''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat slowly but honestly, one hand went up.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler seemed surprised, but pleased. He wasn't there to take
the names of those who raised their hands.
</P>
<P>
   He was there, in a way, to hold their hands.
</P>
<P>
   As a recovering compulsive gambler since his last bet on ``April
10, 1968, that's 11,228 days,'' Wexler was there as a certified
compulsive gambling counselor to warn the players about the
pitfalls of gambling that can lead to the crime of point-shaving in
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many kids,'' Wexler asked now, ``have tried to bleed you
for information on, say, how a teammate's ankle is?''
</P>
<P>
   When none of the players raised a hand, Wexler, once the
executive director of the New Jersey Council on Compulsive
Gambling, looked around at the young faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle,'' Wexler said, ``if it hasn't happened to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler knew that it has happened too often on too many other
campuses in recent years, notably in the point-shaving scandals at
Northwestern and Arizona State and the gambling scandal at Boston
College.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the better our team gets,'' Mulcahy said, ``the more we're
going to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler's 90-minute lecture was a tribute to Mulcahy's concern
about campus gambling everywhere and its repercussions, a concern
that more college athletic directors should address, a concern that
the NCAA finally recognized in 1996 with the appointment of Bill
Saum as its first director of agent and gambling activities.
</P>
<P>
   Saum has visited 25 colleges to warn of campus bookies; he has
also arranged for Federal Bureau of Investigation agents to speak
to many other college teams.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the NCAA, according to Saum, show that 25 percent, or
some 6,000, of the so-called student-athletes on Division I
basketball and football teams have bet on college or pro games. And
4 percent, Saum said, bet on games they played in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the bookmakers,'' Wexler was saying now, ``are other
students on the same campus.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how the Arizona State basketball point-shaving scandal
started. Steven Smith, the Wildcats' point guard, won a few dollars
on video basketball with a campus bookie, Benny Silman, then
switched to betting on real games and soon owed $10,000. Silman
suggested shaving points. Smith and a teammate, Isaac Burton Jr.,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Silman has been sentenced to 46 months in prison. Smith and
Burton will be sentenced Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In 1951 the college basketball point-shaving scandals involved
big-time New York gamblers in Madison Square Garden. Now it's
student gamblers on college campuses. And if the NBA season is
canceled, there will be more gambling than ever on college
basketball this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are betting in high school too,'' Wexler said.
``They're betting $100 a game on high school point spreads.''
</P>
<P>
   Wexler knows. He hears the gambling stories all the time from
people who call his 24-hour national hot line, 1-888-LAST-BET, and
ask how they can kick the compulsion as he did. But he didn't kick
it until gambling had brought him to the brink.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our baby was born, I asked the doctor the weight,'' he
remembered, ``and when he told me 7 pounds 1 ounce, I called my
bookie and bet the 7-1 daily double. It got so that I owed 32
people three years' salary and had $8 in the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Arnie Wexler finished talking Tuesday, Kevin Bannon
turned to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is on the money,'' the coach said. ``We really appreciate
it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the players seemed to appreciate it, too. They can't say
they weren't warned.  &QL;

CUBANS SKEPTICAL ABOUT EXPANDED CONTACTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also CUBA-U.S., CUBA-EXILES) 
(bl) 
 By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ Cuban officials reacted with cool skepticism Tuesday to
President Clinton's decision to expand contacts between Americans
and Cubans, while Cuban leader Fidel Castro maintained a pointed
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials and economists said they doubted that the
decision to allow additional people and organizations to send money
to Cuban families and charities would ease the deep economic crisis
here.
</P>
<P>
   Most Cuban officials, from Castro on down, fault the embargo for
this nation's dismal economic performance.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials also said it appeared that the Clinton
administration had given up on the idea of a bipartisan commission
to consider lifting the embargo, a signal that there would be no
fundamental change in policy under Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing surprising, just more of the same,'' said a
high-ranking official who insisted on anonymity. ``The purpose of
the embargo was always to undermine the revolution from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina said on his arrival on a visit
to Haiti that the measures announced by Clinton ``don't really go
to the root of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The root of the problem is still a blockade that is unjust,''
Robaina said.
</P>
<P>
   Payments to Cubans from family members make up one of the
country's largest sources of hard currency, estimated from $500,000
to $800,000 a year. They have fueled a growing dollar-based
economy. Clinton's proposals would be expected to increase the flow
of cash to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials said, however, that the changes were cosmetic
and would neither influence the economy nor public opinion here.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Romero, an economist with the University of Havana, said
an increase in payments from abroad might help individual families
but would not cure the underlying malaise. ``It will have an
economic impact, but only at the micro level,'' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. embargo, he added, makes Cuba less attractive to
foreign investors and keeps interest rates on bonds in the high
teens, making it almost impossible for Cuba to obtain capital to
modernize its aging Soviet-style factories.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in the capital knew little about Clinton's overture
by late evening. The state-controlled television broadcast a short
report that outlined the proposals, saying they would ease the
blockade ``very little.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people with family members in the United States said they
were happy to hear that additional people could send them money,
though it was unclear to many who in addition to their relatives
would be willing to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Carmona, 21, a chemistry student at the university,
said although he would be happy to receive additional money from
his uncle and other relatives in Miami, he would be even happier to
hear that the embargo had been lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not only be very good for us, but it would be the
just thing to do,'' he said. ``The whole world outside the United
States has realized there has to be a change toward Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Stalwart members of the Communist Party, many of whom have
survived on meager government salaries while watching other
citizens receive cash from abroad, reacted to the news with
predictable bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they want is that our opposition has more money to fight
against the revolution,'' said one low-level official over a beer
at a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Another government employee, who insisted on anonymity, said the
proposals from Washington continued the same patronizing attitude
that the United States had taken since the early 1960s. ``For 40
years the United States has been imposing conditions on us,'' the
official said. ``They do not respect us. If the blockade had never
existed, the revolution would have solved all the problems we have
now.''

A COMPOSER'S BOHEMIAN SPIRIT IN A THREE-PIECE SUIT
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few composers in any age have been able to live solely from
writing music without also pursuing careers as teachers or
performers, or having private means. The life of Hans Werner Henze,
who has dedicated himself to composition for more than 50 years of
vigorous industry, is all the more instructive, and in his rich,
informative and engaging new autobiography, ``Bohemian Fifths''
(Princeton), he has much to say about his career and the music that
has filled it.
</P>
<P>
   He writes of the ``hundreds and thousands of different shades of
dissonance'' that constitute ``one of the most eloquent and
multifaceted means of expression available to living, modern music
in all its baroque opulence.'' The kind of music he describes is,
to be sure, his own.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody does baroque opulence like Henze. The evidence is a
sumptuous and vivid recent recording of ``Undine,'' his score for
Frederick Ashton's three-act ballet of 1958, with Oliver Knussen
conducting the London Sinfonietta on Deutsche Grammophon. Much of
the score is Stravinsky-like, but its muscle is Henze's, as is its
sensuous orchestration. The subject dictated a lot of watery music,
from fountainlike sprinklings of harp strings for the title
character to brass-led splendor for sailing on the open sea. There
was also much grandeur and pathos for the humans in the story.
</P>
<P>
   Henze, who is 72, has also welcomed into his life the same
multifarious shades of dissonance, as well as grandeur and pathos,
that are in his music. At the age of 26, with his first big opera
and a host of smaller works behind him, Henze left his native
Germany for Italy, which has remained his principal home. Like so
many German artists before him, he loved the light of the south,
the warmth, the ease; all can be heard in ``Undine,'' written five
years after his move.
</P>
<P>
   His long-term commitment to Italy, though, was unusual, and
created one of his life's discords, between a Mediterranean
environment and a mind still German. ``I work,'' he writes, ``with
the echoes left in my psyche by all that is German, especially
German folk tales.'' And increasingly he has been drawn back to
German subjects, most of all in his choral Ninth Symphony, which is
scheduled for a premiere in this country next year with the New
York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   Other dissonances in his life have been sexual and social.
Various love affairs are mentioned in the book fleetingly and with
discretion, but many seem to have ended in disappointment. And as a
social animal, Henze has the look, bearing, status and financial
magnitude of the class _ the comfortable bourgeoisie _ he most
detests.
</P>
<P>
   During a youthful stay in Berlin in the immediate postwar years,
when he frequented ``notorious bars and nightclubs,'' he ``longed
to be accepted by this alternative Germany, this aggressively
antibourgeois, bohemian world of misfits.'' Here we must remember
his book's title, for though ``Bohemian Fifths'' is a musical term,
signifying the unlawful parallel fifths that were played by
Bohemian hornists, it surely also refers to the vie de boheme Henze
was wishing for himself.
</P>
<P>
   A decade and a half later, in the mid-'60s, he pursued that
desire in a sudden and spectacular manner by aligning with
revolutionary socialism. His account of that episode suggests the
excitement of the times. He is an excellent memoirist and his book
is full of vivid sketches of places and people, from Havana in the
1960s to Westphalia through the eyes of a boy growing up in the
Nazi era, from the composer William Walton to Ingeborg Bachmann,
the Austrian writer with whom he collaborated several times.
</P>
<P>
   But the account of his time in Cuba reflects the calm and
seriousness of his concerns. Maybe he was lured there by a taste
for the exotic, but he also did his bit planting citrus trees and
loading crates, besides working with local composers and
challenging himself by writing his Sixth Symphony for the Cuban
National Symphony, with whom he knew he would have to work hard to
get what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he moved to Cuba without really shifting his ground.
He has always been generous with the young and inexperienced, and,
though his music became more combative from 1969 to '70, it
retained its abiding lushness and propulsiveness _ indeed, its
baroque opulence. ``I could not have appeared in public,'' he
writes, ``with a new style, a new cast of mind and an unprecedented
type of new music.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``in public'' is revealing. Henze makes a convincing case
for himself as a bad boy, self-destructive in love,
anticonventional in his creative beliefs and belonging at heart in
that demimonde of what he elsewhere describes as the Sodom and
Gomorrah of war-wrecked Berlin. But as a composer, in public, he
puts on his three-piece suit.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, he insists on his irony and skepticism. ``I was
permanently preoccupied,'' he recalls of the time around
``Undine,'' ``with dreamers and nymphs, spirits and monsters,
artificial psychoses and genuine neuroses, but without seeing
myself as a Romantic.'' Later he objects to a critic's view of him
as the heir to Richard Strauss, for ``the occasional late Romantic
exuberance that is found in my works is not intended to be
exuberance as such but its anachronistic opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   One might ask how the listener is to detect these subtleties of
perspective. It sure sounds like late Romantic exuberance to me in
``Undine,'' to mention only that work.
</P>
<P>
   Henze's predicament has been that to make his way as a composer
he has been obliged to write for a public he professes to dislike
(the German bourgeoisie) and in a style from which he seeks to
distance himself. Brought up to believe in art as challenge, he can
hardly tolerate his own success.

 &HT;    Newfound celebrity helps 'Dirty Birds' wrestle attention as
Goldberg bodyguards
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Given the way the season has gone for the Atlanta
Falcons, and taking into consideration the personality of All-Pro
running back Jamal Anderson, maybe it shouldn't have been a
surprise to see him grab a microphone and scream at a big Georgia
Dome crowd. Then again . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our house,'' Anderson yelled Monday night as he stood
on the ropes of a wrestling ring while 40,000 fans cheered. ``The
Dirty Birds' and Goldberg's.'' So it has come to this.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons, riding the wave of a franchise-best 14-2 record and
their second NFC West title in 33 years, are big enough celebrities
to sell all 71,228 seats in the Dome and even to fit in pro
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Center Robbie Tobeck is one of several wrestling fans on the
team. After getting last weekend off before Saturday's playoff game
against San Francisco, Tobeck encouraged Anderson and 16 teammates
to serve as ``bodyguards'' for pro wrestling sensation Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Goldberg, who played at Georgia, had 16 tackles and four
quarterback pressures as a reserve defensive tackle for the Falcons
(1992-94).
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of us are still friends with Goldberg,'' Tobeck said.
``We had to stand up for him.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they stood up too late.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons came from behind in half their 14 victories, but
their sense of timing was off at the Dome in what was supposed to
be a rematch between Goldberg and Kevin Nash for the heavyweight
title.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg ended up being ``arrested'' by Atlanta police officers
on charges trumped up by legendary wrestler ``Hollywood'' Hulk
Hogan, who supposedly retired a few months ago to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   In a twist, Hogan ended up in the match with Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, however, famed ring announcer Michael Buffer
welcomed the crowd to the Georgia Dome, ``home of the National
Football League's NFC West champion Atlanta Falcons.''
</P>
<P>
   Nash let Hogan pin him, then they celebrated together.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Goldberg came running into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he was beaten up and handcuffed, as Hogan, Nash and three
pseudo-hooligans spray-painted his bald head and back.
</P>
<P>
   As the five bad guys tried to leave the arena, Tobeck, Anderson
and teammates Travis Hall, John Burrough, Chuck Smith, Cornelius
Bennett, Dave Widell, Adam Schreiber, Shane Dronett, Ruffin
Hamilton, Jessie Tuggle, Ben Huff, Greg Studdard, Eugene Robinson
and Lester Archambeau entered.
</P>
<P>
   Backup quarterback Tony Graziani, punter Dan Stryzinski and team
doctor Andrew Bishop looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen this before; that's why I'm here,'' Graziani
said. ``I'm just another body _ a small body.'' The wrestlers
backpedaled and fled through another exit as the Falcons _ several
of them wearing practice jerseys with names on the back _ cavorted
about the ring, Smith flexing, Anderson doing the team's ``Dirty
Bird'' dance and Graziani grinning.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg vowed revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do to Nash what my boys here are going to do to
the Niners,'' Goldberg thundered to the crowd. ``We've always been
hunted, but now we're the hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene was not new to the 6-foot-3, 300-pound Tobeck.
</P>
<P>
   A couple years ago, a friend named Ron Reis _ known as 7-2,
405-pound ``Big Reese'' to WCW fans _ was working at a high school
in north Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wrestling in an independent circuit,'' Tobeck said,
``and I came running out of the crowd and jumped in the ring and
hit the guy that was choking Ron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, the guy came off the ropes, and I gave him a shoulder
block, and he went down. Wrestling is cool. I always flip back and
forth between Monday Night Football and Monday Nitro.''
</P>
<P>
   Surely, there will be a future Monday Nitro match between Hogan
and Goldberg, who took the title from Hogan last summer in the
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Tobeck and some teammates are sure to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Goldberg beat Hogan last summer, there were people beside
me in the Dome literally crying,'' he said. ``I was laughing,
going, 'What the (heck) is going on?' ''

DEATH TOLL RISES IN SUMATRAN VIOLENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The death toll from separatist violence in
Aceh province has reached 16 and security forces were continuing
house-to-house searches for suspected rebels on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Hamzah, chairman of a local legal aid office in
Lhokseumawe, the scene of the worst violence on Sunday, said in a
telephone interview that more that 170 civilians had been arrested
by security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Lhokseumawe is a coastal industrial town in northwestern
Sumatra, 1,000 miles northwest of Jakarta, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people, all civilians, were killed on Sunday when security
forces fired on a crowd of 3,000 separatist supporters who had set
fire to several police stations and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Hamzah said Tuesday that another seven people had died in the
hospital from bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Aceh has been a hotbed of separatist violence since Dutch
colonial times. Antimilitary feeling is running high after a brutal
9-year counterinsurgency operation by the armed forces. Two
separatist attacks against Indonesian security forces last week are
believed to have killed eight soldiers, and two others are
missing. &QL;

TEXACO IS SAID TO SET PAYMENT OVER SEX BIAS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Colo, La.)  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texaco Inc. has agreed to pay $3.1 million to 186
of its female employees who were found by the Labor Department to
have been systematically underpaid relative to their male
counterparts, people involved in the case said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is the largest under a Labor Department
affirmative action compliance program. It was signed by Labor
Department officials Tuesday and is scheduled to be made public on
Wednesday. The agreement follows several years of efforts by Texaco
to deal with separate allegations of racial discrimination made by
minority employees.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement covers women who were employed between 1993 and
1996 in managerial and support jobs at the petroleum company's
headquarters in White Plains, N.Y., and in offices in seven other
cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is based on an examination begun in May 1995 as part of a
program under which the Labor Department audits employment
practices of companies that do business with the federal
government. Documents outlining the settlement stated that it was a
result of a ``joint effort'' by Texaco and the Labor Department and
that it ``does not constitute an admission by Texaco'' of
violations of any laws or regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In draft documents describing the settlement, Labor Secretary
Alexis M. Herman said the review ``found that women in mid-level
positions throughout the company were underpaid as a matter of
course for years.''
</P>
<P>
   The 186 women found to have been underpaid represent 2 percent
of the 9,000 women employed by Texaco in the United States.
Texaco's total work force in the United States is 19,800.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly McAndrew, a spokesman for Texaco, said the company worked
``cooperatively'' with the government, and that Texaco was pleased
that the agreement cited no violations of employment laws or
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for $2.2 million in back pay to be
distributed to the 186 women, in amounts from $1,500 to $51,000,
depending on salary, length of employment and other factors. A
further $816,000 has already been distributed as salary increases
to bring the paychecks of the women into line with those of male
counterparts, and a further $84,000 has been set aside to deal with
any future claims of salary inequity.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.1 million package is the largest resulting from an audit
by the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance
Programs, which monitors affirmative action programs in companies
that do business with the government. Last spring, Corestates
Financial Corp. agreed to pay $1.5 million in back pay and salary
adjustments after the Labor Department found a pattern of
inequities affecting women and minority employees.
</P>
<P>
   Those agreements, though, are dwarfed by settlements reached in
civil lawsuits and in other government actions against employers.
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission agreed to a $81.5
million discrimination settlement in 1997 with Publix Super Markets
Inc. And Texaco itself settled a racial discrimination lawsuit in
late 1996 for $176 million.
</P>
<P>
   The racial discrimination allegations led Texaco to adopt a
program aimed at promoting equality, diversity and tolerance within
the company. Last month it hired Deval L. Patrick, a former head of
the Justice Department's civil rights division, as its general
counsel, making him the company's highest-ranking black official.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the Labor Department investigation said that
it had no connection to the racial discrimination allegations,
which drew wide attention two years ago after a former Texaco
official provided lawyers with tapes of Texaco executives speaking
contemptuously of minority employees and planning the destruction
of documents demanded in the discrimination lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement signed Tuesday by the Labor Department requires
Texaco to analyze the compensation of its entire salaried work
force every year, and in particular to look at the salaries paid to
men and women in the midlevel pay grades covered by the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The company also agreed to take steps to expand opportunities
for women employees and to submit a report within 45 days
discussing what it has done to bring more women into upper-level
managerial jobs and to recruit more women.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Texaco has 30 days to notify the 186
eligible women that they are owed money. The government audit
covered Texaco headquarters in White Plains and offices in Dallas;
Houston; Denver; New Orleans; San Antonio; Belair, Texas; and
Beacon, N.Y.

FULMER HAS VOLS AT MOUNTAIN'S TOP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ History was made Monday night at the Fiesta Bowl
when Tennessee won the first national title arranged by the Bowl
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers' 23-16 defeat of Florida State not only achieved
the school's first championship in 47 years and its first 13-0
season, it established them as one of the nation's top programs.
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Florida State, Florida and Nebraska. All three might
lay claim as ``team of the 1990s,'' but Tennessee is positioning
itself for millennial domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts us at the top,'' said senior wide receiver Jermaine
Copeland, clutching an unlit victory cigar. ``With the coaching and
the talent we get in here, we're set to stay there for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   This season validated Phillip Fulmer's status as the active
coach with the best winning percentage. He poked and goaded a team
that could have rested on last season's Southeastern Conference
championship and Orange Bowl trip.
</P>
<P>
   Their victory against Florida State exemplified this Volunteers
team. Tennessee got two huge plays from its Tee Martin-Peerless
Price passing combo. And its defense overcame an injury epidemic.
At various times, three starters in the secondary and two starting
linebackers were out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad because this was my last game with this team,'' said
senior linebacker Al Wilson, the defense's fulcrum. ``I've never
been on a team that was as close and as together as this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Before playing Alabama, Fulmer displayed a walking stick he had
been given. The team jokingly called him Moses. The stick became a
fixture at team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called it the synergy stick,'' Fulmer said. ``The idea was
to bring 'em back to focus, give them another motivational toy. The
players bought into it. Other than them calling me Moses, it was a
great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer, 48, required just seven seasons to win his first
national title. The only stain on his resume is that former
Tennessee coach Johnny Majors accuses Fulmer, his former assistant,
of staging the coup that resulted in Fulmer becoming the school's
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer's focus has been moving Tennessee's program from good to
great. Now, all he has to do is maintain that level of excellence
in the nation's toughest football league, the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``With success comes expectations,'' said Fulmer, a former
Tennessee offensive lineman. ``We want to be in the mix of the
teams that are the best teams in the country ever year. Now, I know
the expectations are going to be high again, but they always are.''
</P>
<P>
   Not 10 minutes after Monday night's game ended, Fulmer fielded a
question from a fan who wanted to know about Tennessee's redshirt
freshmen. It's like that for a college football coach. Next year is
seconds behind this year.
</P>
<P>
   The national championship is likely to provide a boost that's
largely unnecessary; the Volunteers already have a commitment from
Chris Simms, who is regarded as the nation's top high school
quarterback. Count on Fulmer's recruiting class to be regarded as
one of the nation's best when signing day comes around Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes after arriving in Knoxville, Tenn., last night,
Fulmer was scheduled to get on a private plane for a recruiting
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see him working that hard, it makes you want to work
harder,'' said assistant Randy Sanders, who had a marvelous outing
in his first game as the team's offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to hearing Tennessee's foot-tapping theme song. ``Rocky
Top'' is at the top of the college football charts.

<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: America Online has $4.5 billion dollars to buy
Netscape, but it's too \Rdarned\S cheap to put a server in my area
code, therefore I have to go long-distance for E-mail and what
little I do on the Internet. Question: What is a server, what does
one cost, and can a group of people set up their own server? _ Fed
Up
</P>
<P>
   Dear Up: Of course people can set up their own servers. How do
you think this whole Internet thing got so out of hand?
</P>
<P>
   An Internet server is just a big computer running programs that
serve up Web pages or other stuff when you ask it to. There's
nothing special about them, except that they tend to cost an arm
and a leg and you have to hire some major Poindexter right out of
college to run them for you so you can concentrate on making your
clients pay.
</P>
<P>
   Your problem isn't that AOL is too cheap to put a server near
you. It just hasn't gotten around to putting in a local-access
modem number in your town. That would let you dial a local number
that's part of a special long-distance network and that magically
hooks you up to AOL in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Don't keep sending your money to the long-distance company. Get
a local Internet account for 20 bucks a month. You can connect to
AOL through that. You'll need to go into the AOL setup (where you'd
change the phone number) and change the connection type to TCP/IP,
which is a bunch of letters geeks like to use instead of saying
``Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Connect with the Internet provider, then start AOL and log in.
Now you can change your billing method to the
``bring-your-own-access'' plan, which is about half the regular
rate. You can send the difference to me. I really think it's the
least you can do after how much I'm saving you.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: What does it mean to format, and is it
something I should do? _ Perplexed
</P>
<P>
   Dear Perp: You know how when your kid plays his Raffi cassette
until your head explodes and then you do a Nixon to the tape in a
moment of blind rage? That's pretty much what a format will do, so
don't attempt it unless you really do want to erase everything from
your hard drive and start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Make a bootable startup disk (go to Control Panel, then
Add/Remove Programs) and make sure Format.com is on it. Boot with
the disk, then type Format c: /u /s at that old-fashioned DOS
prompt and stand back. When it's done, you'll have to re-load all
your programs. Won't that be fun?
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Who are you? Underneath all the insults,
blather and excellent commentary, I suspect there lurks a very
intelligent, well-educated twentysomething woman, perhaps very
petite and pretty, who's afraid to reveal herself for fear she
won't be accepted. Come on _ this is the late '90s! You could be 5
foot 2, eyes of blue and still be a fearless lampooner of the
ignorant. Or are you a scaredy-cat?! _ Just Curious
</P>
<P>
   Dear Just: It's not that I don't like to wear dresses as much as
any other man. I just have a feeling you might be in for a nasty
surprise on our first date. See you tonight. I sure hope you're
open-minded!
</P>
<P>
   Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay isn't really a
cross-dresser. That was just a Halloween costume. No, really. It
was. Send complaints to drbombay\Nstar-telegram.com or snail-mail

SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL SET TO BEGIN ON THURSDAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 16th graf to correct to 67, sted 34, the number of senators
needed to decide preliminary vote in compromise plan.)   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, announced on
Tuesday that he expected Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to open
the impeachment trial of President Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he hoped for a conclusion ``that is fair and hopefully
quick,'' but gave no details of how the trial would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Republican's reticence reflected the unsettled
and fluid situation in the Senate as leaders from both parties met
frantically throughout the day, in hideaways all across the
Capitol, negotiating ceaselessly to craft some kind of bipartisan
plan that could avert a lengthy trial that would tie up the Senate
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties said that a bipartisan proposal for
an expedited trial that had been drafted by Sens. Slade Gorton,
R-Wash., and Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., was foundering because
of objections from conservative Republicans, just a day before the
106th Congress formally convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the depth of the opposition, Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho,
a member of the Republican leadership team, said of the plan, ``I
think it's dead and finally, I hope it's dead because I do not
think one should short-circuit the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But still hopeful, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic minority leader, said: ``Contrary to rumors of its
demise I think that there's still a great deal of interest in
pursuing some framework along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle had their first of several meetings of the day
early in the morning and then journeyed across the street to the
Supreme Court, where they met with Rehnquist for about a half hour
to plan for the first presidential impeachment trial in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   While Daschle called the timing still ``tentative,'' he and Lott
both said they expected Rehnquist to swear in senators as jurors on
Thursday. On that same day, House managers led by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde _ who are expected to be reappointed by the new Congress on
Wednesday _ are to read the two articles of impeachment on the
Senate floor, charging Clinton with perjury and obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the day will be a holding action, buying time
for Senate leaders to keep working out the details of what comes
next as they strive to avoid the partisan rancor that overtook the
House, which approved the two articles of impeachment on near
party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   Senators huddled in all kinds of groups on Tuesday, some
bipartisan, some by party. Some senators consulted with Gorton and
Lieberman while others floated their own modifications of the plan.
One Democrat said that so many proposals were now flying around the
Senate that ``it's like dim sum right now. They're picking and
choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who met with Lott several times on
Tuesday, said the majority leader still hoped to open a trial
Monday, as envisioned under the compromise plan. ``There is an
interest in starting this as soon as possible,'' she said. Even
conservatives said they wanted the trial to end by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this all pieces together and what it looks like is very
much up in the air.'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House the press secretary, Joe Lockhart, said the
uncertainty leaves the president's lawyers ``in the position of
preparing for all eventualities. In general, we'd like to know
which direction we're going in, but we understand the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drafted by Gorton and Lieberman had been designed
to avoid a long Senate trial that once again showcases the details
of Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. It was also propelled by
the fact that no one expects the Senate, which has 55 Republicans
and 45 Democrats, to have the 67 votes necessary under the
Constitution to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   It called for an expedited trial of the president to begin next
Monday without witnesses. House prosecutors and the White House
would get one day each to present their cases. On a third day the
senators could question the two sides by sending written notes to
the chief justice. On Thursday and Friday, the senators would be
able to state their views in debate.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the senators would take test votes on whether each of the
two articles of impeachment met the standard for the president to
be removed from office. If, as expected, 67 senators decided the
articles did not meet the standard, a majority vote would allow the
Senate to adjourn the trial and move toward censure.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is supported by most Democrats, and Lott, who
desperately wants the Republicans to put forward an agenda of its
own this year, has been sounding out his colleagues for days.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Republicans have complained that the
plan does not give the managers from the House enough time to make
their case. Some, in deference to House Republicans, want an actual
vote on the articles of impeachment and others object to test votes
that allow the Senate to move forward with a full trial only if
two-thirds of the Senate agreed. Still others want to hear from
witnesses
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-seven sounds like we're looking for a deal, not our
duty,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who met separately on
Tuesday with Lieberman and with Gorton. ``We shouldn't be
artificially truncating this.''

OUT OF SENATE, D'AMATO IS BOTH OPTIMISTIC AND NOSTALGIC

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In discussing the Senate seat he lost so painfully
last year, Alfonse D'Amato, private citizen, has to admit to a
certain yearning about the other New York's other Senate seat,
which Daniel Patrick Moynihan plans to leave in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an option,'' D'Amato said Tuesday, unpacking boxes at
his new Park Avenue business consulting office and sounding
politically restless after taking four tennis lessons last week.
``It's not something I am actively pursuing or planning, but it's
an option. Hey, listen: in politics, change is on an hourly basis,
let alone projecting out two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months after a sound political thrashing at the hands of
Rep. Charles Schumer, D'Amato is restoking his optimism and
pronouncing himself firmly on his feet, not his back.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks off the public stage, D'Amato gave one of his first
in-depth, post-election interviews, but stipulating that it be via
telephone. He talked at length about his time in the Senate,
gradually brightening at his memories of political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what?'' he asked, sounding more grateful than bitter
after 18 years in the Senate. ``The curtain comes down on even the
best Broadway plays. The actors go out on the road and the play
lives on in the audience's memories. But to have been a part of
that _ Ah, that's still a thrilling thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, D'Amato conceded some shortcomings and outright
gaffes in his re-election campaign, including his use of a vulgar
Yiddishism in belittling his opponent. But he believes he paid a
far more costly price in the way the that conservative Republicans'
impeachment drive against President Clinton energized New York
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national scene hurt us tremendously,'' he said, noting a
near doubling of the 1994 Democratic vote in minority neighborhoods
in New York City and a steep drop in turnout in his suburban
Republican power base.
</P>
<P>
   ``People resented the influence of what they perceived as the
hard-core right,'' he said of his party's impeachment campaign.
``They overdid it. They made Clinton the victim,'' he added,
warning that the Senate must find an expeditious conclusion to
impeachment or the Republican Party would be at risk of losing its
majority control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``But 18 years is a long time and I think people wanted a
change,'' D'Amato said in a more basic explanation of why he failed
in reaching for a fourth term. ``It was the totality. It was
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to heal after his first loss in a 28-year political
career, the 61-year-old politician has stepped into a new career as
a consultant specializing in banking, communications and other
big-ticket Washington issues. His new firm, Park Strategies, is a
partnership with Wayne Berman, a poker pal and Republican lobbyist,
fund-raiser and Bush administration veteran based in Washington.
D'Amato said he would also be dabbling in political commentary on
television and be hanging an ``of counsel'' shingle with a major
law firm.
</P>
<P>
   A prodigious fund-raiser in his former perch as head of the
Senate Banking Committee, D'Amato said he would not be registering
as a lobbyist nor would he be a political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strategic consulting,'' the Ex-Senator Pothole said of
his new life on Park Avenue. ``Corporate clients who want advice as
to how to handle problems, where to go, who are the best people to
use in terms of a specific problem. My background at state, local
and international levels ought to make that worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   As a combative Republican, D'Amato managed to make some
Democratic allies like Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al will be missed,'' Dodd said. ``He was the kind of person
who wasn't afraid to come across the aisle and develop friendships.
He showed tremendous candor. The guy's addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato talked fondly about a raft of issues in which he fought
to play a principal role in federal showdowns over mass transit,
environmental cleanup and hospital resources in New York. ``And I
was proud to to call Saddam Hussein the Butcher of Baghdad,'' he
continued. ``And to be the first to go after Noriega in Panama.''
</P>
<P>
   He relished his 15-hour Senate filibuster in 1992 to protect New
York jobs from the cheaper labor of Mexico. ``I went totally
wild,'' he proudly recalled. ``South of the border, where all the
jobs are going,'' he suddenly began singing in a croaking reprise
of one of his filibuster riffs.
</P>
<P>
   He paused in remembrance of those past fights, as if his loss
was striking home deeper upon citizen D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved being able to do that,'' he admitted. ``I made a
difference there. I loved it there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fighting to stay there, he did not at all like the ``too many
lies for too long'' tag-line accusation against him by the Schumer
campaign, D'Amato said. ``If I had ever done that, the media would
have come down on me like a ton of bricks,'' he insisted. ``I think
the media showed a double standard in the campaign,'' he added.
Invited to elaborate, D'Amato warily considered his complaint in
silence, then finally responded in his best New York rasp, ``Aah,
let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the former senator extended a certain pugilistic
appreciation of the way Schumer came at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely not bitter,'' he said of the Democrats' attack
ads. ``That's all fair. The guy put his career on the line and went
for it, and a person less determined wouldn't have done it. He'll
be a good senator, bright and energetic.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato sounded embarrassed to admit he cried once, a month
after losing, when Moynihan showed up at a goodbye party. There,
Moynihan, the senior senator, recalled greeting the brashly
ambitious newcomer in 1981. ``I liked him then,'' said Moynihan.
``I love him now.''
</P>
<P>
   In looking back, D'Amato seemed to focus most on the sheer
scrappiness of his life as a senator. But he steadfastly denied
having lost the heart of his life when New Yorkers denied him
another round as their aggressive center of political attention in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I've been a fighter,'' D'Amato said. ``Now I'm going to
be fighting for my clients. I'm not going to retire from life.''
The former senator from New York took care to add, ``And again,
there's the Moynihan seat.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of President Clinton's appointees to a federal
advisory commission studying the future of Medicare said Tuesday
that new taxes or other revenues would be required to keep the
program intact for millions of baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   The comments by Commissioner Bruce C. Vladeck injected an
explosive new element into the panel's deliberations. From 1993 to
1997, Vladeck was administrator of the Federal Health Care
Financing Administration, which runs Medicare. He talks frequently
with Clinton administration officials and Democrats in Congress
about health policy.
</P>
<P>
   Barring unrealistic assumptions about future Medicare spending,
Vladeck said, ``there is no way to continue to finance even the
existing federal share of the costs of health insurance for the
elderly and disabled without more revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck's comments reflect a view widely held by health policy
experts, who contend that modest tax increases should be considered
as part of any comprehensive plan to modernize Medicare and solve
its long-term financial problems. Republicans said they suspected
that Vladeck was floating a trial balloon for the administration,
but White House spokesman Barry Toiv said Vladeck ``doesn't speak
for the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladeck made his remarks in front of about 100 people at a forum
held by the Urban Institute, a research and policy center. He spoke
just 90 minutes before the commission met Tuesday on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, headed by Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., has
considered a wide range of options to reshape Medicare, but has had
no serious discussion of new taxes. Speaker Newt Gingrich of
Georgia, who appointed four of the 17 commissioners, said in
December 1997 that he had set a precondition for his appointees:
They had to promise that they would not support a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   The commission must submit its recommendations to Congress and
the president by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   Another commission member, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said he
agreed with Vladeck that taxes should not have been taken off the
table. ``Sometimes people in politics don't like to speak the
truth,'' McDermott said, ``but if you are going to provide the high
quality of health care we expect in this country, it will cost
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, rejected the idea of new taxes,
saying they would not solve Medicare's financial problems. ``At a
time when the government has a surplus, it's unfortunate that some
of the president's Medicare commissioners still advocate
tax-and-spend solutions to the nation's problems,'' said Archer,
who is not a commission member, but shapes tax legislation as
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million people who are
elderly or disabled. Congress created the panel, the National
Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, to recommend ways
of keeping the program solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Medicare's growth has slowed in recent years, experts
say the costs are unsustainable in the long run. The administration
estimates that the trust fund that pays hospital bills for the
elderly will run out of money in 2008, three years before the first
baby boomers reach the eligibility age of 65.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's forum, Robert D. Reischauer, former director of the
Congressional Budget Office, said: ``I agree 100 percent with Bruce
Vladeck that there is no way that we're going to get out of the
situation we're in now without devoting more tax revenue, either
payroll tax or general revenues or both, to the health care of the
aged and the disabled. But that shouldn't be our first stop. It
should be the last stop on the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Reischauer is not a commission member, but Breaux and others
have sought his advice.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal gaining support on the commission, the federal
government would offer a fixed amount of money to each Medicare
beneficiary to help buy private health insurance covering a
specified package of benefits. The benefits would be at least as
generous as those in the current Medicare program. The government
would pay a certain proportion _ perhaps 90 percent _ of the
average premium charged by all health plans participating in
Medicare. Beneficiaries would have to pay at least 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux and most Republicans on the commission support this
approach, which would remodel Medicare in the image of the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program. The federal employee program
covers nine million people, including members of Congress, federal
workers, retirees and their dependents. They have a wide range of
insurance options, including traditional fee-for-service plans and
health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's meeting, many commissioners expressed support for a
proposal to increase the eligibility age for Medicare by two years,
to 67. The increase would occur gradually, from 2003 to 2027.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, Ga. _ Willie E. Adams, a fourth-generation black
farmer, is raising 48,000 chickens here on the same land that his
ancestors farmed, some 85 miles east of Atlanta. But with $150,000
in debt, $90,000 to the federal government and $60,000 to banks,
Adams says he is ``just keeping my head above water.''
</P>
<P>
   By Adams' reckoning, he could be raising more than twice as many
chickens if only the U.S. Department of Agriculture had been more
fair and more efficient in processing the farm loans he has applied
for over the last 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to turn to higher-interest commercial loans, but
could carry only so much debt. So three of his five chicken houses,
each longer than a football field, have stood empty for more than
three years because Adams cannot afford to modernize his feeding
and watering equipment to meet the standards of today's poultry
processors.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other black farmers, Adams maintains that he
has not gotten a fair shake from federal farm loan officials
because of his race. On Tuesday, the federal government essentially
conceded as much when the secretary of agriculture, Dan Glickman,
announced the settlement of a class-action discrimination lawsuit
that black farmers had filed against the government in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Though pleased by the public acknowledgment of their plight,
many black farmers said on Tuesday that the settlement would do
little to reverse the stunning decline of independent black
farming, a livelihood that has carried a special nobility ever
since freed slaves were granted 40 acres and a mule.
</P>
<P>
   The relief, which makes farmers who claim they were harmed by
discrimination eligible to receive $50,000 tax-free and to be
forgiven their federal debt, is too little, they said, and it has
come too late, particularly for those who have lost their farms to
foreclosure or whose children soured years ago on a life of
farming. And it does not free them of the burden of commercial debt
they took on when they could not get government money. Nor does it
punish the mostly white county agents who for decades denied them
money.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, 14 percent of the nation's farms were owned by blacks,
according to federal statistics. By 1992, the number had dwindled
to 18,816, or 1 percent, and now, hobbled by age, racism and
corporate competition, even fewer blacks till the land. The average
age of black farmers is now 70.
</P>
<P>
   Young black people raised on farms have fled for other
professions in other places, and nothing may lure them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see my children and other young blacks be able to
have pride in agriculture,'' said Adams, while touring the
rank-smelling sheet-metal sheds where his roosters are fattened,
wing-by-thigh, before being processed into chicken nuggets. ``But
with the way the USDA treated us, young people don't see any future
in farming.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, 48, and several other black farmers said on Thursday that
the settlement did nothing to address the paradox created by the
government's discriminatory practices. When denied federal loans or
granted loans insufficient to meet their needs, black farmers often
went to banks for help. But commercial loans carry higher interest
rates than those offered by the government, and the farmers' debt
accumulated quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Though the settlement will eliminate the farmers' debt to the
government, which typically ranges from $75,000 to $150,000, it
still leaves many with substantial commercial debt, and the $50,000
payments may not be enough to pay off or restructure the bank
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Black farmers have the option of forgoing the $50,000 and
negotiating a higher settlement through an arbitrator, but that
requires extensive documentation of discriminatory practices that
most probably do not have.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the settlement, it's not going to be of help to
me,'' said Charles Dennard, 47, a black farmer who grows cotton,
peanuts, soybeans and watermelon on 90 acres in Pineview, Ga. ``If
all your debt is with the USDA, it'd be a great help. But I'm tied
up with debt to the bank and the USDA.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennard said that $72,000 of his $160,000 in debt is with the
government and presumably would be forgiven under the settlement.
That still leaves him with $88,000 in debt to private lenders. Had
he been granted the government loans he sought in the first place,
he would never have applied for the commercial money, Dennard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're on my neck at the bank to foreclose,'' Dennard added.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Billy Hunter has said all along he didn't want to submit
the owners' final labor-contract proposal for ratification by a
vote of the members of the National Basketball Players Association.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And he won't.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hunter, the NBPA's executive director, is mustering
the union membership today for a vote on the owners' final
collective-bargaining proposal, the outcome of the vote will do
nothing more than indicate whether the players support the
negotiating committee's recommendation to reject the owners' final
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Only if the players reject the committee's recommendation and
accept the offer would the union consider putting the owners' final
offer to an actual ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the union members, however, thought they were heading to
town for a ratification vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were voting on whether to accept the (owners')
proposal or not,'' New Jersey's Jayson Williams said. ``But when I
was watching Billy Hunter on TV, I came away with the impression
that we were voting on whether or not to accept the (negotiating
committee's) recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was, `Are we going to play?' or `Are we not going
to play?' I think guys are upset a little bit about the whole
situation because they want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   If the players vote to support the committee's recommendation,
which Hunter predicts will happen, the union would then ask NBA
commissioner David Stern and the owners to return to the bargaining
table and resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, however, has stated that if the union rejects the
proposal, he will recommend canceling the remainder of the 1998-99
season when the league's Board of Governors meets here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I'm hearing,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik
said, ``I don't expect much to come out of that vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Others apparently feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting them to vote in support of the position
promoted by the negotiating committee,'' Hunter said. ``We called
the vote because everyone suggested we call a vote. We want to get
it out there and get it over with because we think the message that
we have to send to the owners is that our players are still
unified.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 of the union's 430 players are expected to be on
hand to vote, and many in the union are expecting the rank and file
to support Hunter and the negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance of it passing are slim and none,'' former union
president Buck Williams said, referring to the owners' proposal.
``All it says is that what David Stern was asking for all along was
impossible (for the players to bail out the owners by approving
their proposal). It has to be done at the bargaining table.''
</P>
<P>
   Still up in the air is whether the vote will be by secret
ballot, a show of hands or other means. A final decision on the
balloting rules won't come until today, and Jeffrey Kessler, the
union's lead outside counsel, said the means will not be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that some players might feel intimidated if any
means other than a secret ballot were employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a man, you know what's in your best interests,'' New
Jersey's Sam Cassell said. ``No man is going to help me with my
decision. I'm a man. What's good for them may not be good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Union lawyers worked up a presentation that will be made to the
players before today's vote, outlining the pros and cons of each
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler deflected any talk of coercion or intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the players will have any concern about the
legitimacy of votes, and I don't think anybody will be coerced,''
he said. ``Everyone will have a chance to vote their conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing they have a chance to vote at all.
</P>
<P>
   Some players took exception to the short notice, pointing out
that severe weather conditions around the nation made travel
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is (ridiculous),'' Miami's Keith Askins said. ``Who's
going to fly to New York on two days' notice after a blizzard?
Then, you want to vote on something, and they tell you you can only
vote on something else (not a ratification vote).
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a vote. This is out of control. A vote is when you
go to the federal building and cast your ballot. This is wrong. I
feel ashamed to be part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more bewildering aspects of today's vote is the
union's assertion that the owners are bluffing when they talk about
canceling the season Thursday. Many in the union feel that when the
league's final proposal is rejected, Stern and the owners will
simply return to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the players know it's a poor deal,'' Buck Williams
said. ``You have to trust the negotiating committee to recommend a
good deal. You have to do a vote, but you must understand that the
best deal you're going to get is after the seventh (of January).''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter apparently agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that the message that we have to send to the owners
is that our players are still unified,'' said Hunter, predicting
that at least 75 percent of players attending the meeting will
reject the league's offer. ``I'm hoping that this will cause the
owners to be a little bit more pragmatic and a little bit more
prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players, however, are tiring of the union's stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just doesn't make any sense why we're not playing,'' Dallas
guard Hubert Davis said. ``I've talked to a lot of NBA guys, and a
lot of guys said they'll take it (the offer). Hopefully, everyone
will wake up and see how lucky we are and get back on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   If the league votes to cancel the season, the NBA will become
the first major professional sports league to lose an entire season
to a labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't blame the fans if they didn't come back,'' said
Utah's Jeff Hornacek, long a critic of the union. ``Neither side is
coming out of this thing looking good.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
TEMPE, Ariz. _ By 2 a.m., his wife had him moving boxes, readying
for the trip home. Before stopping by to pick up a few more
trophies Tuesday morning, he already had attended an organizational
meeting or two.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Phillip Fulmer planned to be back out on the
recruiting trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to get home around 5:30,'' the Tennessee coach
said with a smile. ``And I've got a private plane out about 6.''
</P>
<P>
   So much, then, for basking in the afterglow of his first
national championship and Tennessee's first in 47 years. In case
Fulmer had any illusions about resting on his laurels for oh, say,
a day or two, they were dashed even before Vicky Fulmer literally
sent him packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't 10 minutes after a lot of the hullabaloo had settled
down, and I was doing my radio show,'' he recalled. ``I got an
unusual question: `Coach, tell us about some of your redshirt
freshmen, and are we going to be able to beat '
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Gosh, let us enjoy this one _ at least this
evening.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Tennessee and its fans, this unlikely 13-0 season and title
run left plenty to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   There was the opening-game victory over Syracuse that got the
bandwagon rolling, and the win over Florida that propelled the Vols
from the lower rungs of the preseason Top 10 to genuine contenders.
</P>
<P>
   There was a big road victory over Georgia and a great escape at
home against Arkansas. There was the comeback against Mississippi
State in the Southeastern Conference title game that secured a spot
in the first Bowl Championship Series designated title game.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, there was quarterback Tee Martin's emergence from
Peyton Manning's shadow, and the work of young running backs Travis
Henry and Travis Stephens after star Jamal Lewis was lost to a knee
injury. There was the inspirational play of middle linebacker Al
Wilson, who played much of the season with a partially separated
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   There were lucky breaks along the way, too, but such are the
things of which championships often are made. When the smoke
finally cleared Tuesday, the party in the Smokies was still going
strong as Tennessee finished No. 1 in the both the Associated Press
media poll and the ESPN/USA Today coaches survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an unbelievable year,'' Fulmer said. ``Going back to
spring practice, there were so many ifs on this team. We pushed an
awful lot of the right buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that standpoint, it couldn't have happened any better for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   While the orange-and-white-clad Tennessee fans left the Valley
of the Sun in high spirits, others were left Tuesday to ponder the
might-have-beens of this eventful college season.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State lobbied for consideration for No. 1 after its Sugar
Bowl victory over Texas A&AMP;M but received none from the AP voters,
all 70 of whom cast their ballots for Tennessee. The Buckeyes
finished No. 2 in both polls, followed in each by Florida State and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Wisconsin split the next two spots, with the Gators
coming in fifth in the AP and sixth among the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M finished 11th among the media and 13th with the
coaches. Texas, coming off a Cotton Bowl win over Mississippi
State, placed 15th in the final AP survey and 16th in the coaches
poll.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the controversial BCS left no controversy. Tennessee
ran the gantlet and was left standing.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Vols do it all again? Maybe. This was a team that
arrived a year early, and many of the principals will be back to
attempt a repeat in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee loses five seniors _ wide receivers Peerless Price and
Jeremaine Copeland, guard Mercedes Hamilton, tackle Jarvis Reado
and fullback Shawn Bryson _ from Monday night's offensive starting
lineup. Tailbacks Henry and Stephens will be juniors next year, and
Lewis is expected to recover completely from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, meanwhile, returns for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can get better, and he will be better,'' Fulmer said.
``Will the results be better? That's hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, Tennessee loses only four starters _ Wilson, tackle
Ron Green, end Corey Terry and cornerback Steve Johnson _ from
Monday night's starting lineup, so the Vols should be solid on that
side, too.
</P>
<P>
   A title figures to help recruiting, too. Highly touted
quarterback Chris Simms _ son of former New York Giants QB Phil
Simms _ already has committed to a program that has recruited as
well as any in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that Fulmer hit the ground running Tuesday
morning. Time to load up some shiny new hardware and hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the expectations are going to be high,'' he said. ``At
Tennessee, they always are. But that's the world we live in. With
success come expectations. And we're accustomed to that. We want to
be in the mix of the people who are known as some of the best
football programs in the country, and I think we've put ourselves
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vols will be there next year, too. Whether they will be good
enough _ and lucky enough _ to repeat will make for just the sort
of offseason debate sure to keep Phil Fulmer running.

SENATE LEADERS SEEK UNITY AS IMPEACHMENT TRAIL DATE SET 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate leaders tried to avoid a partisan standoff
Tuesday as they agreed to launch President Clinton's impeachment
trial this week despite their inability to forge a compromise on
the scope of the proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the gridlock, lawmakers in both parties declared a plan for
an abbreviated, four-day trial all but dead. And the Senate faced
the prospect of starting the monumental process with no indication
of whether the trial will drag on for months, as the last
presidential impeachment trial did 130 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The formal process to determine Clinton's fate is scheduled to
start at 1 p.m. Thursday, when Representative Henry J. Hyde,
chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, reads articles of
impeachment to the Senate charging Clinton with committing perjury
and obstructing justice to try to cover up his sexual affair in the
White House with a former intern, Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   After the presentation, Supreme Court Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist will be sworn in as the trial's presiding officer.
Rehnquist will then swear in the 100 senators, who will pledge to
provide ``impartial justice'' in deciding only the second
presidential impeachment case in history.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, ``all bets are off'' on how the process will
unfold, said the Senate Democratic leader, Thomas A. Daschle, after
meetings Tuesday night with members of both parties, including the
Senate majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle each pledged to continue struggling to reach a
bipartisan consensus to prevent the sex-related trial from turning
into a protracted spectacle that could tarnish all three branches
of government.
</P>
<P>
   But as rank-and-file senators on both sides strengthened their
footholds in the final hours before the trial, several lawmakers
warned that partisan strife soon could begin roiling, as it did
throughout the House proceedings, which produced the two
impeachment charges last month.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, who serves on Daschle's leadership team,
said he was ``almost certain'' the Senate will agree on ``some kind
of variation'' of the imperiled four-day plan to prevent a
protracted trial. But he expressed concern that Republican
resistance to any such proposal could lead to a major showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may leap off the deep end, as they have shown a capacity
to do in the past months, and decide it's open season,'' Kerry
said. ``In that case, you will have a very different kind of
reaction here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who met privately with members of both parties throughout
the day, said he was seeking a way to complete the impeachment
trial ``fairly and expeditiously.'' But he invoked a spiritual
allusion in suggesting he was searching for guidance amid the
darkness of partisan divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a constitutional duty here,'' Lott said. ``It's one
that we must carry forward. And we will do our very best to do that
duty in the proper way in the light that God gives us, the light to
see that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first sign a Democrat might vote to remove Clinton from
office, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia said in an
interview on C-Span, ``I could go either way based on the evidence
as I've seen it or heard it. And I've followed it pretty closely.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest roadblocks to a compromise is the desire
among many Republicans to permit witnesses to present fresh
testimony to the Senate, a plan, Daschle said, ``virtually every
Democrat'' opposes.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate decides to allow the 13 House managers, who
essentially act as prosecutors, to call witnessess, Clinton's
lawyers said they are likely to call their own witnesses and
question the prosecution's witnesses, possibly adding days, if not
weeks, to the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say, `We'll have a little trial with just a few
witnesses,' '' said a White House aide involved in Clinton's
defense. ``That's when you get a wide-open process. So that's
really what the next couple of days will tell us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers said they have prepared a strong defense in
case the Senate demands a lengthy trial. The White House officials
said Clinton's legal team is likely to file motions to adjourn the
trial and possibly challenge the constitutionality of a lame-duck
House impeaching the president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton's lawyers are preparing to deviate from
their strategy in the House, where they mostly declined to
challenge the facts of the case. In the Senate, the president's
lawyers will try to pick apart some grand jury testimony of several
witnesses, including Lewinsky, whose sworn statements formed the
basis for the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the uncertainty in the Senate, Lott and Daschle have been
trying to rally support for a plan by Senators Joseph I. Lieberman,
a Connecticut Democrat, and Slade Gorton, a Washington Republican,
that could complete the impeachment trial next week.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Hyde and 12 other Republicans on the House
Judiciary Committee would spend next Monday presenting the
prosecution's case against Clinton. The White House would give its
rebuttal on Tuesday, and senators would have Wednesday to question
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Jan. 14, the Senate would vote on whether the
charges warrant Clinton's removal from office _ a vote that Clinton
would be all but certain to win.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition to the proposal continued to flourish Tuesday, as
a growing number of Republicans said the plan would short-circuit
the Senate's constitutional duty to fully examine the charges.
``From all I can tell, that proposal doesn't have a lot of life
left in it,'' said Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, who is chairman
of the Senate Republican Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican, agreed. ``I
guess you might say Gorton and Lieberman is on life support right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords and several other moderate Republicans from New England
who are seen as likely supporters of a censure alternative to a
protracted impeachment trial met Tuesday with Lott. The others were
Senators John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, and Olympia J. Snowe and
Susan M. Collins, both of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffords said the four senators recommended that Lott achieve
``a pre-trial agreement to limit the evidence to a reasonable time.
''
</P>
<P>
   But some members of the group also expressed support for
censure, particularly with the possibility that Clinton will not be
convicted by the Senate. ``We have to bring this to closure,''
Jeffords said. ``Some of us feel very strongly that we ought to at
least have censure rather than just acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many other Republicans, including New Hampshire
Senators Judd Gregg and Bob Smith, strongly oppose censure. Gregg
said a censure would be unconstitutional and would be taken lightly
by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we to expect that a president who with a stiff upper lip
and a straight face can debate the meaning of `is,' a two-letter
word, could not dance forever on a seven-letter word like
`censure?' '' Gregg said.

HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY BATTLES BACK TO POST STRONG GAINS IN 1998
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The nation's $20 billion home video industry has
rebounded impressively from a dismal 1997, easing a major worry for
Hollywood studios.
</P>
<P>
   Industry trackers have estimated rentals posted a gain of as
much as 10 percent, while sales rose as much as 8 percent. Analysts
believe the recovery from 1997's plunge, which saw more than $1
billion in revenue vanish, is due to addressing the longtime
complaint that retail outlets didn't have enough inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry looks good,'' said Barbara McNamara, an Alexander
&AMP; Associates analyst. ``Big chains are doing particularly well
because they're answering customer concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The top rental for 1998 was Sony's ``As Good as It Gets,'' with
$64.2 million in revenue, followed by Sony's ``Air Force One'' with
$61.3 million, according to the Video Software Dealers Association.
Paramount's ``Titanic'' sold 22 million copies, setting a record
for live-action video. Disney's direct-to-video ``The Lion King II:
Simba's Pride'' took second with 15 million units sold.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney won the title for total rental revenue with
$1.6 billion, or 19.8 percent of the market, according to
VideoScan. The tracking service also estimated Disney came in first
in sales with 19.2 percent as it took the next six slots after
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The improved industry performance is crucial for Hollywood's
bottom line since studios count on videos as the source of half of
film profits. Sales of videos, which are heavily discounted at
giant retailers such as Wal-Mart and Target, had fallen by as much
as 10 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rebound doesn't look spectacular, it's impressive
because there's not much room for expansion. Not only do four out
of five American households own a videocassette player, but smaller
video stores are closing as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The video business is a mature industry,'' said Marvin Roffman
of the Philadelphia-based investment firm Roffman Miller
Associates. ``Like a lot of other industries, you're going to see
more consolidation because it's difficult for the mom-and-pop
operations to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry projections vary widely because videos are sold and
rented through more than 100,000 outlets, ranging from block-size
entertainment centers to hole-in-the wall liquor stores. VideoScan
estimated 1998 rentals rose 10 percent to $8.1 billion; Alexander &AMP;
Associates calculates they fell 1.9 percent to $11.02 billion.
Sales gains estimates range from 4.2 percent to 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that the key to the recovery has been the
turnaround of Blockbuster, and they point to its ``revenue
sharing'' and ``copy depth'' strategies. Blockbuster pays studios
as little as $5 per tape and splits rental revenues, which cuts
per-copy profits but leads to larger inventories of current titles.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was clearly a hit with customers, as Blockbuster's
third-quarter revenue jumped 18 percent at stores open at least a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blockbuster's third-quarter numbers were stupendous,'' said
Thomas Adams, president of Adams Media Research. ``Since they have
a third of the volume, their numbers are pretty indicative of how
the overall business is performing, although some of (their)
increase comes out of the hide of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Bernstein analyst Tom Wolzien said Blockbuster should be
able to increase revenue by more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studios now have a vested interest in promoting videos,''
he said.

COMMENTARY: DISCIPLINE US, PLEASE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In politics, as in romance, you often crave the
complete opposite of your last relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is undisciplined, unruly and untoward. His bawdy
appetites and reckless indulgences have been sloshing over into our
lives for what seems like an eternity.
</P>
<P>
   So once our tortured involvement with this president ends _ once
all those confessions and apologies and late arrivals and extra
toppings and all-night cramming sessions are no longer our concern
_ what sort of president will we want next?
</P>
<P>
   A control freak, of course. Someone who is all discipline and no
spontaneity. All trust and no lust. Someone who knows how to dot
the i's, go by the letter, follow the script, keep every hair in
place and every button buttoned. After President McMurphy, we will
want Nurse Ratched.
</P>
<P>
   And now she wants us. We have been without adult supervision for
too long.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole is turning in her crisp Red Cross uniform to give
us our meds.
</P>
<P>
   She is perfect. Not only because she would bring along Bob Dole,
the first first lady to be a Viagra spokesman. Not only because the
election may now feature, in a bit of perverse nostalgia, a
Bush-Dole ticket. Not only because her aides ironed the Magnolia's
skirts to perfection before she stepped in front of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   She is perfect because she has not said or done anything
off-the-cuff in several decades. Those who traveled with her in
'96, when her husband was the monosyllabic candidate and she was
the smiling spouse, said she delivered the same stump speech
several times a day, pause for pause and chuckle for chuckle. ``It
was eerie,'' said one Bob Dole supporter. ``She was just like a
Stepford wife at the podium. You expected a spring to jump out of
her mouth any minute.''
</P>
<P>
   She prepares and rehearses and memorizes exhaustively from
Yellow Pages-sized briefing books, so that she can drop the name of
the local mayor or ball team in a deceptively breezy way. She is so
fastidious that a prized possession is a ballpoint pen with a
flashlight on the end so that, when she wakes up in the night with
organizational inspirations, she can jot them down.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first women to graduate from Harvard Law School, Mrs.
Dole drives herself hard, and her staff crazy. She is a tree,
rather than a forest, kind of gal, who obsesses on details and
brooks no imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   During the '96 campaign, when I asked an aide to Bob Dole
whether husband or wife got more upset by bad press coverage, the
aide replied wife. ``Bob thinks in terms of a one-day gaffe in the
newspaper,'' he said. ``Elizabeth thinks in terms of Nexis.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the informality of her nickname ruffles her. When Lesley
Stahl called Mrs. Dole ``Liddy'' during a ``60 Minutes'' interview
in '96, the Republican nominee's wife icily corrected, ``Elizabeth,
Lesley.''
</P>
<P>
   She has never been elected to office. One of her big
accomplishments is the Liddy light. Not the one on her pen, but the
brake light in cars' back windows _ where those wobbly-headed dolls
used to sit _ a safety feature instituted when she was President
Reagan's transportation secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But she is the un-Clinton, the perfect antidote to the most
undisciplined president in history. She proved that in two
memorable appearances during her husband's last presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   There was that scary performance at the Republican Convention in
San Diego when she played an Oprah dominatrix, striding into the
audience with a seamless smile and wireless microphone, which she
tended to snatch back whenever any of the people giving tribute to
Bob Dole threatened to make an unscripted comment.
</P>
<P>
   She was so tightly wound when she appeared with her husband on
the Larry King show, you could almost hear her teeth grinding. As
her husband rambled, with not much to say and not many syllables to
say it, she jumped in with that good old Nancy Reagan ventriloquist
flair.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth patted Bob's arm firmly, interrupted him to answer
questions, finished sentences for him, reminded him of his message,
expanded on his comments, cut him off mid-thought with ``That's
it!'' She was so robotically on message that she actually referred
to her husband as Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Ratched for president. It's about time our cuckoo's nest
got a good tidying up.

FATHER AND SON ABOARD 2 PLANES THAT CRASHED IN ANGOLA WAR ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ As a special U.N. envoy held talks
in Angola trying to negotiate a rescue mission to the crash sites
of two U.N. chartered planes reported to have been shot down over
rebel territory, a South African family got bitter news on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The first plane, which went down on Dec. 26, was piloted by John
Wilkinson, who had been working in Angola for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the second plane, U.N. officials confirmed Tuesday, was
John Wilkinson's son, Hilton, 25, who had gone to Luanda in the
hope of helping rescue his father. He had hopped a ride on the
second U.N. flight on Saturday just to catch a glimpse of his
father's plane so that he might have something to tell his family
about.
</P>
<P>
   At first the United Nations denied that the young man was aboard
the second flight, because his name was not on the passenger list.
But Tuesday U.N. officials said Hilton had probably been
``smuggled'' aboard the second flight. For the Wilkinsons the news
was not unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilton called us on Friday and told us he was going to fly
over the area on Saturday,'' said his sister Judith Russell. ``His
feeling was that if no one was going to do anything, then he was
going to take a look at least.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has been unable to approach either wreck as
both planes went down in the outskirts of Huambo, where heavy
fighting has been under way for weeks between government and rebel
forces. Huambo is about 350 miles southeast of Angola's capital
Luanda.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what happened to the two Hercules C-130 transport planes
remains unclear. Government officials have accused the rebels of
shooting them down, but rebels, known as Unita, the National Union
of the Total Independence of Angola, have denied the charges and
said it was the government that was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The charter company that owns the planes, Transafric, has said
that it spotted the wreck of the first plane and that it looked
almost intact. There have been reports that some of the 14 people
aboard that plane are alive and being held by Unita. But the rebels
have also denied any knowledge of survivors.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say they believe that the second plane, with nine
people aboard, was far more badly damaged and was hit by missiles
shortly after taking off from Huambo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said her brother Hilton had recently obtained a
commercial pilot's license and was hoping to follow in his father's
footsteps by working for Transafric in Angola. But her father, she
said, had tried to discourage him, saying it was much too dangerous
these days.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 20 years of almost continuous civil war, the
government and the rebels signed a peace treaty in 1994. But it has
always been an uneasy truce which appears to have broken down
completely in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials in Luanda on Tuesday demanded a cease-fire to
allow access to the planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our appeal is to all parties,'' Benon Sevan, the U.N.
undersecretary-general for security, told reporters in Luanda after
a meeting with Angola's vice foreign minister, Sebastinao Isata.
``There is no cease-fire with one side.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy fighting reportedly continued around Huambo and the nearby
town of Cuito. Shelling was also reported in the northern town of
Malanje.

IRANIANS ASSERT ROGUE AGENTS WERE KILLERS OF FIVE DISSIDENTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In an extraordinary statement, Iran's
Intelligence Ministry said Tuesday that rogue Iranian intelligence
officers were responsible for the killings late last year of five
prominent critics of the government's conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure seemed to confirm the suspicions of the many
Iranians who had said that the series of slayings could not have
been carried out without some kind of official complicity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that an acknowledgment was made public could
suggest that, under President Mohammad Khatami, Iran may be
becoming the kind of country in which embarrassing secrets can no
longer be permanently harbored.
</P>
<P>
   All five of those who were slain had criticized the hard-line
clerics within Iran's government who have been the principal
opponents of Khatami's moves for greater moderation and openness.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings have left many people in Iran deeply shocked, and
they have fueled fears that the country's political schisms might
spill over into a campaign of broader violence. Intellectuals had
already become the main targets in the country's internal tussle,
with newspapers shuttered and books banned for overtly political
reasons. But the turn to killings had prompted Khatami to vow that
those responsible would be identified and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing that intelligence officials had played a role in
the killings, an Intelligence Ministry statement distributed by
Iran's official news agency condemned the killings as ``having
inflicted grave damage to the credibility of the sacred system of
the Islamic Republic of Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   But the statement raised as many questions as it answered. It
blamed the killings on ``a number of our colleagues _
irresponsible, misguided and unruly personnel.'' It did not
identify them, however, or say how many had been arrested, and it
asserted without substantiation that those involved had
``undoubtedly been manipulated by clandestine agents and were
serving foreign interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the information was made public, reports from Teheran of
an assassination attempt against an outspoken conservative
suggested that an era of political violence is by no means over.
The target, Ali Razini, who leads the Teheran judiciary, was
reported to have been slightly wounded in a grenade attack in the
capital; at least one bystander was killed.
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian opposition group committed to overthrowing the
country's Islamic regime has taken credit for similar assassination
attempts in the past, including the fatal shooting last summer in
the Teheran bazaar of Assadollah Lajevardi, the former director of
Iran's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the dissidents killed last year, Dariush Foruhar,
and his wife, Parvaneh, belonged to an outlawed but tolerated
opposition party. They were found stabbed to death on Nov. 22 in
their Teheran home, which associates have said was under
surveillance by the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In the following weeks, Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad
Mokhtari, both writers, disappeared, and their bodies were found
dumped separately on the outskirts of Teheran. Each appeared to
have been strangled. Both men had tried to set up a writers'
association, and each had been questioned by authorities about
their activities.
</P>
<P>
   A third writer, Majid Sharif, who had been critical of
conservative clerics, was found dead after disappearing from his
home.
</P>
<P>
   Western human rights groups and literary societies had called
for independent inquiries into the killings, which they said raised
disturbing questions about Iran's willingness to tolerate
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that hard-line death squads were responsible for
the killings is likely to play into the hands of Khatami's moderate
supporters. In the uproar that followed the killings they expressed
strong suspicions of the Intelligence Ministry, which is under the
control of their conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students and intellectuals have demonstrated to
protest the killings and have called for the dismissal of Iranian
intelligence officials. The ministry, which has domestic and
foreign responsibilities, has long functioned outside ordinary
government channels, and has been blamed by Western governments for
dozens of killings of Iranian dissidents abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Khatami has taken steps to put the ministry
under his own control, but it remains a bastion of the conservative
clerical establishment that is hostile to his agenda. Iranian
officials say it has managed to retain extraordinary power and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Under Iran's diffuse power structure, the elected president
wields little official influence over the security forces, the
judiciary or the police. Those powers lie with the supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who under the country's Islamic system is
chosen by a body of Shiite clerics.

 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government backed away Tuesday from remarks
by a Cabinet member suggesting that Japanese were unhappy with
their ``Peace Constitution'' and that the United States bullied
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet member, Justice Minister Shozaburo Nakamura,
apologized for his remarks and said he had not meant them. The
comments were the latest in a long tradition of top Japanese
officials making incendiary statements and then sheepishly
retracting them after they become public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called free-market economy cited by the U.S. is not
real freedom,'' Nakamura told several hundred ministry officials at
a New Year's party, Japanese newspapers reported. ``It is a kind of
freedom that lets loose atom bombs and missiles just when another
country appears to gain an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Nakamura, 64, did not elaborate. But he specifically denounced
the United States for threatening sanctions against countries
accused of unfair trade practices.
</P>
<P>
   To many Japanese the most striking comments by Nakamura were his
suggestions that the constitution was burdensome and should be
changed to give Japan the right to use military force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are struggling under a constitution that prevents us from
having an army and denies us the ability to revise'' it, Nakamura
was quoted by the daily Asahi Shimbun as saying. He added that the
constitution ``was handed down by the Allied forces to the Japanese
people'' after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Hiromu Nonaka, the chief Cabinet secretary, said at a news
conference Tuesday that Nakamura had made ``very inappropriate
remarks'' and that the matter was serious. But he added that
Nakamura had shown remorse, and the government seems to regard the
matter as closed.
</P>
<P>
   Most historians agree with Nakamura's view that the constitution
was imposed on Japan by the United States in the aftermath of World
War II, but legally Japan has every right to amend it. Such a move,
though, would lead to protests around Asia among countries that
Japan invaded during the war.
</P>
<P>
   At a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi raised
the matter of Nakamura's remarks and asked him to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The true meaning of these remarks I made on the occasion of
the New Year ceremony at the Ministry of Justice was to explain
various issues facing our country as well as the complicated
international situation, in the context of emphasizing the need for
judicial reform in Japan,'' Nakamura told the Cabinet. ``I would
like to apologize sincerely for the inappropriateness of my
remarks, and I withdraw them.''
</P>
<P>
   Countries including China and South and North Korea get nervous
whenever Japanese talk about changing their constitution _
especially Article 9, which forever renounces ``the threat or use
of force.'' The article also says Japan will never maintain ``land,
sea and air forces, as well as other war potential.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Japan manages to have Asia's most impressive armed
forces and the world's third-largest military budget by deploying
what it calls self-defense forces, which it says are not banned by
Article 9.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to gauge how widespread Nakamura's views are.
Many conservatives in Japan say that such views are common but that
politicians do not feel free to express them because they get in
trouble whenever they say such things.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in rural areas, which are hugely overrepresented in
Japan's political system, Nakamura's sentiments seem to resonate
with many ordinary voters.
</P>
<P>
   There is deep resentment at what is perceived as American
bullying and insistence on ruthless market policies, and many
people also feel that half a century after World War II, it is time
for Japan to stand up and adopt a more muscular constitution and
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   There have been growing calls for revision of the Japanese
Constitution, but the issue is so sensitive at home and around Asia
that it is expected to be many years before any changes might
actually be enacted.

A TRIPLE FOR THE HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It had all the drama of a Kentucky Derby stretch drive. At least
four thoroughbreds had a chance to join the Baseball Hall of Fame.
Only three had enough to make it to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan, George Brett, and Robin Yount will be in
Cooperstown, N.Y., for induction ceremonies July 25, but former Red
Sox catcher Carlton Fisk will be home wondering what it would have
been like if he had picked up just 44 more votes.
</P>
<P>
   In voting announced Tuesday by the Baseball Writers Association
of America, Ryan was named on 491 of a record 497 ballots cast, a
98.79 percentage that is second in history to only Tom Seaver
(98.84).
</P>
<P>
   Brett wasn't far behind, with 488 votes and a 98.18 percentage,
fourth-best ever. Yount earned his way in with 385 votes (77.5
percent). To gain induction, players need 75 percent of the vote,
which this year meant 373 ballots. Fisk received 330 votes (66.4
percent).
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time since 1936 that three players were
elected in their first year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   While Fisk made a relatively good showing, the same was not true
for other players with Red Sox ties. Jim Rice finished eight in the
balloting with 146 votes (29.4 percent). Luis Tiant received only
53 votes and Dwight Evans only 18, which means he will be dropped
from the ballot because his total was less than 5 percent. Two
pitchers who spent parts of their careers with Boston, Mike
Boddicker and Frank Tanana, did not receive a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the final chapter of my career,'' said Ryan. ``From the
standpoint of the professional athlete, it's the highest honor you
can receive. When it does happen to you, you don't know how to sum
it up other than to say it's overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's election was a no-brainer. In 27 seasons, he racked up
324 victories and a record 5,714 strikeouts. He took his
100-mile-an-hour fastball coast to coast, pitching for the New York
Mets, California Angels, Houston Astros, and Texas Rangers. He had
only two 20-win seasons but hurled a record seven no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel best about the five years I played with the Rangers,''
said Ryan, a native of Alvin, Texas. ``It brought the focus of my
career to another level that I hadn't experienced. Some of the
things that happened there, plus the longevity, probably enhanced
my chances of being inducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett and Yount made it despite playing for what today are
called ``small-market'' teams, Kansas City and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Brett played 21 years for the Royals and had a career .305
average. He was a 13-time All-Star and made a celebrated run at
.400 in 1980, when he finished at .390.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flabbergasted when they called me,'' said Brett. ``While
I was pleased for myself, I was just as pleased for Robin, who is a
good friend. We were laughing this morning on the phone, saying,
`Who the hell are we to be in the Hall of Fame?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start playing, it's something like a dream that
someday you'll make it. But you don't go out and try to make it. Of
all the guys I played against, Robin is the guy I enjoyed playing
against the most. That's what makes it special.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Brett, Yount played away from the bright lights, though he
called Milwaukee a ``good fit'' for his personality. He played 20
years for the Brewers and twice won MVP awards. He is a lifetime
.285 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I was brought up in Los Angeles,'' said Yount, ``I
enjoyed being there because I enjoyed the city of Milwaukee, the
low-key atmosphere, and the way the fans treated you. The
organization was great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always very comfortable there. We didn't play nearly as
many postseason games as I would have liked. But it was still a
place where I loved playing. Other than a chance to win a little
more, I had no other reason to go anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   His friendship with Brett grew out of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt George Brett was the prototype baseball
player,'' said Yount. ``George was as fierce a competitor as I've
ever seen.''

 &HT;    FALCONS PASS NOTES: Chandler hang time often poses liability
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons quarterback Chris Chandler passed for career
highs of 3,154 yards, 25 touchdowns and a passer rating of 100.9
that was fourth in the NFL this season.
</P>
<P>
   One of his best characteristics, however, remains his worst. He
hangs on to the ball in an attempt to make plays. That sometimes
results in sacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons allowed 53 sacks, an average of once every 7.9
passing plays _ next-to-worst in the league. Chandler was sacked 45
times, or once every 8.3 pass plays.
</P>
<P>
   The league average was a sack every 13.8 pass plays.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco had 51 sacks, third-most in the league, 10 in the
two Falcons games.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Holding the ball) allows him to make some big plays,'' coach
Dan Reeves said. ``If there's some area you'd like to work on . . .
it is to try to develop the ability to throw the ball away to where
you don't take the extra shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.. . .
</P>
<P>
   In the two 49ers games, wide receiver Terance Mathis caught
eight passes for 208 yards and three touchdowns. The Falcons will
not be surprised if San Francisco free safety Merton Hanks
occasionally double-covers Mathis. . .
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons were 11th in the NFL in pass offense, averaging
211.6 yards per game. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers count as much on running back Jamal Anderson as
Chandler. ``When we're running real well, that brings (49ers strong
safety) Tim McDonald down in the hole to play against the run, and
we have one-on-one coverage on that side,'' Martin said. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Rookie right tackle Ephraim Salaam's improved play and injuries
to 49ers defensive linemen mean the Falcons only occasionally will
afford Salaam special help with a back or tight end in passing
situations. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Falcons wide receivers caught 146 (61.6 percent) of the team's
237 completions, running backs 55 (23.2 percent), and tight ends 35
(14.8 percent). Chandler caught one pass from receiver Tim Dwight.

 &HT;    Falcons Notes: Shell to interview in Cleveland
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons offensive line coach Art Shell is expected to
fly to Cleveland after Saturday's home playoff game against San
Francisco to be interviewed as a candidate to coach the expansion
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Shell had a 54-38 record as coach of the Raiders from the fifth
game of the 1989 season through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While a team is still in the playoffs, only the Browns are
allowed to seek permission to speak with members of that team's
coaching staff, and Cleveland president Carmen Policy got that
permission last Friday from Atlanta coach/executive vice president
of football operations Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Some published reports had Shell, 52, interviewing with Policy
Monday, the same day the Falcons began preparing for the 49ers
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first time talking with Carmen Policy was Monday morning
(January 4),'' he said. ''How could I have an interview when I
hadn't talked to (Policy). The next thing is, why would I have an
interview Monday when I have to be here?
</P>
<P>
   ''My plan is to talk with (Policy), if I can get out of here, on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell, an African-American who would join Minnesota's Dennis
Green and Tampa Bay's Tony Dungy as the NFL's only minority
coaches, said he is tired of hearing that.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought we were beyond that,'' he said. ''I'm a candidate as
a potential head coach, not a minority. I'm just glad to have the
opportunity to (interview).''
</P>
<P>
   Practice report
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons boarded three buses Tuesday with signs in the front
window reading, ''Falcons Dirty Bird Express,'' and shuttled down
I-85 from Suwanee to practice two hours and 20 minutes. It was the
first time Reeves was involved since undergoing quadruple heart
bypass surgery Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   He said the benefit of getting out of the cold weather, even if
the team only had half a field because of ongoing cleanup from
Monday night's pro wrestling event, was substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were able to concentrate a lot better,'' he said. ''And I
did better than I thought I would; I had more energy. The real test
will be when I try to get up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons are likely to practice at the Dome again today if
the weather doesn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's more on the line, and when there's more on the line I
think your focus and concentration have to be a little bit
better,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   Starting cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who missed both practices
last week after sustaining a slight right shoulder separation in
the Dec. 27 season finale against Miami, said things went fine
Tuesday. With his shoulder heavily taped, he participated in the
entire session. He will be held out of contact this week, which
will be light anyway. . . . Reserve linebacker Craig Sauer, who
missed both practices last week with a strained hamstring, did not
finish practice as the injury bothered him. . . . Fullback Bob
Christian is scheduled to have surgery next Tuesday rather than
yesterday to repair his torn left anterior cruciate ligament.
Doctors hope his torn medial collateral ligament will heal itself.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket talk
</P>
<P>
   Falcon officials are cautioning fans who try to purchase tickets
to Saturday's game from scalpers to be wary of counterfeits. There
were about 70 counterfeit tickets confiscated for the Nov. 22 home
game against Chicago, and Atlanta police arrested a man selling
counterfeit tickets to the Miami game. . . . If any tickets are
returned by the 49ers or the NFL today, they will go sale Thursday
at 9 a.m. only through the Ticketmaster phone center (404 249-6400)
and Ticketmaster outlets.
</P>
<P>
   He said it
</P>
<P>
   Asked Tuesday about winning the Associated Press NFL coach of
the year last weekend Reeves said, ''I'm sure the sympathy vote
helped. I wouldn't recommend that anybody go through heart bypass
surgery to try to get coach of the year, though.''

 &HT;    Falcons have recent performance against the 49ers on their side
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, the San Francisco 49ers seemed to hold a
psychological edge over the Falcons, but the swagger in the Atlanta
locker room indicates that that notion has died. The Falcons set a
franchise record by going 14-2 and winning the NFC West, two games
ahead of the 49ers (now 13-4). But what means the most going into
Saturday's home playoff game against the 'Niners, the players said,
is that they beat San Francisco 31-19 on Nov. 15 in the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   So far, nobody is more fired up than free safety Eugene
Robinson, who went to the last two Super Bowls as a member of the
Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (the win over San Francisco) did for our team was tell
our guys we can play with those guys and win,'' Robinson said,
talking about a 49ers team that had defeated Atlanta 11 of 13 games
before the November meeting and 23 of the previous 29. ``That does
a lot for the psyche of our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in here is the same (as in Green Bay),'' he
said. ``I'm going through a deja vu kind of thing. We're playing
with consistency, and things are clicking. I haven't gotten any
sleep yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, a 12-year veteran, said players
young and old are caught up a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating them before, . . . you have more confidence in your
ability,'' Tuggle said. ``We're going to be the ones to try . . .
and set the tempo. I'm not going to wait around. I'll tell you
what, there's too much fight in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Second-year cornerback Michael Booker is excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is old hat for them,'' he said. ``We want to make a
statement: we are the team of the new millennium, and this is our
start.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers have been to 12 NFC Championship Games and won five
Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible the Falcons even gained something in their 31-20
loss on Sept. 27 at San Francisco, when they fell behind 31-7 in
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never quit,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``I didn't think
the 49ers' intensity in the second half was what it was in the
first half. But the way we played in the second half showed a lot
to our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is 8-0 at home this season, the 49ers were 4-4 on the
road, and the Falcons are favored.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson seems to think the world is against his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the 'lowly Falcons.' I'm tired of that stuff,'' he
said. ``There's too much character (on the team). It's a whole
mindset. This game is about accepting a challenge.''

 &HT;    49ers will try to keep emotion high
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ There were hugs all around and tears on
the field. In the locker room, the celebration was loud and
extended. The 49ers rid themselves of a playoff albatross when they
defeated the Green Bay Packers Sunday in dramatic, late-game
fashion at 3Com Park. And the relief sparked unabashed emotion that
lasted two days.
</P>
<P>
   And so, with a short week before facing Atlanta Saturday at the
Georgia Dome, the challenge now facing the 49ers _ other than the
rested, eager Falcons _ will be their ability to generate the
emotion neccessary to perform at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   Most Niners admitted that their 30-27 victory over the Packers _
secured on Terrell Owen's 25-yard touchdown pass from Steve Young
with :3 left _ sapped all their juices, to the point where they
coach Steve Mariucci said it'll take until gametime Saturday for
the team to be recharged.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a lot of recovery time,'' Mariucci said after
the Niners' practice Tuesday. ''We spent all of our energy in the
Packers game. Each day is a step toward getting it back. But we
won't be ready until game time.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever energy lacking by then probably will be supplemented by
natural adjernaline once the 49ers hit the turf at the dome. After
all, San Francisco has veterans who've made extended playoff runs,
and their recuperative powers have been tested.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on an emotional high and we're confident,'' quarterback
Steve Young said. ''With this team, the veterans we have and all
that we've been through, we're mentally tough. I'd match our mental
toughness with anyone's.''
</P>
<P>
   But can they start with the necessary energy and enthusiasm?
Summoning similar emotion might not be so easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''As hard as it may be to raise to that level of emotion, we've
got to do it,'' safety Tim McDonald said. ''It's always tough with
a short week after playing such an emotional game. But there is no
such thing as a letdown in the playoffs. I don't think there's a
chance for that. Somehow, we'll be ready to roll on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also point to a growing rivalry with the Falcons as a
motivation. Atlanta took the NFC West crown from San Francisco,
which had won 10 division titles since 1986. Throw in the Falcons'
rousing 31-19 victory in Atlanta on November 15, and the Niners
have much to be excited about.
</P>
<P>
   ''We chased them for two months,'' Young said, ''and they didn't
blink. We wanted that division title and they got it. You've got to
give them credit for that. We chased them hard. So, the fact that
we're back against them. . . is great.''

 &HT;    Pass defense notes: Short-term memory loss a help to Walker
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Darnell Walker has emerged as the 49ers'
most reliable secondary man. And this after stepping in for injured
Marquez Pope, who was sidelined with a bad back. Walker, who once
played for the Falcons, did not relinquish the job.
</P>
<P>
   He and Merton Hanks were beaten twice by Green Bay's Antonio
Freeman in the 49ers' 30-27 wild-card victory against the Packers.
But, as defensive backs routinely do, Walker showed a short memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a different group and different kind of secondary from
other teams in the past here,'' Walker said. ``We hold together.
There are all kinds of ways to get the job done. We just get the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who was supposed to be used only in nickel coverage,
instead was superb. He tied for the team lead in interceptions (4),
tied his career high in tackles (60) and had a team-high in passes
defensed (32). The latter tied the passes defensed in his previous
five seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Walker played both sides of the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a job to do and we do it,'' Walker said. ``Against a
team like Atlanta, we've got to stop the run, so we can't rely on a
lot of help. It's up to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pope back in lineup
</P>
<P>
   Pope has been hampered with a bad back, but he deemed himself
fit to start at right corner. The 49ers have had three different
starting cornerback tandems this season. When Pope and Walker
started against the Packers, it was the first time they had opened
a game together since Nov. 8 against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   High on Jamal
</P>
<P>
   In two years, Hanks has gotten flattened three times by the
Falcons' Jamal Anderson. So, it's no surprise he holds the running
back in high regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's big and talented,'' Hanks said. ``He has quick feet. He
reminds me of (Pittsburgh's) Jerome Bettis. They're built the same,
but Jamal gets low to the ground. . . . We've got to get him on the
ground collectively.''

 &HT;    49ers aren't seeking style points
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ The way Merton Hanks sees it, there is no
call for the 49ers to change their pass defense schemes.
</P>
<P>
   So what if the Falcons made several big pass plays against them
in the regular season. So what if one of them _ a Terance Mathis
78-yard catch and run _ sealed the November victory in the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   It all means nothing now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the playoffs, that's all that matters,'' Hanks said
Tuesday. ``With this unit, we do what's necessary to win. We've got
everybody healthy. We feel good about ourselves. You can't analyze
it like you're going to fix something in the middle of the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chris Chandler passed for only 222 yards and 184 yards,
respectively, in the two meetings against the 49ers, he had three
touchdown passes _ all to Mathis and all over 31 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the big plays hurt San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a team that's good with the deep ball, the long-range
stuff,'' Hanks said. ``We have to keep the passes of 40-plus yards
down. We have to give ourselves a chance to win. They have a fun
receiving group with Tony Martin and Terance Mathis. I know Terance
well, and it's always fun to match up against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending Mathis on the game-breaking play at the Dome was
rookie R.W. McQuarters. To that point he had done a creditable job.
``But the Falcons have big-play capability,'' coach Steve Mariucci
said. ``Their passing game is based on selling the run. Then,
they'll throw in some trick passes and it's bombs away.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Tim McDonald said: ``Chris Chandler made some big plays
against us. He made some great throws when they needed them. That
one pass to Terance Mathis was big. Mathis only had one catch that
game and it was a doozy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest doozy is Anderson. Because the Falcons run the
ball so well, San Francisco is fearful of a ground game that grinds
yards and the clock. To do so, Mariucci said the 49ers must commit
``seven or eight to stopping the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``When you do that, you'd better play (good)
coverage because Martin, Mathis and Chandler are good, really good,
off play action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they have a legit running back, it makes it tough,''
McDonald said. ``Do you commit an extra guy to try to contain Jamal
(Anderson) or do you keep him back, which could be to Jamal's
advantage? They can always stick you with a big play.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a challenge the 49ers are prepared to meet, Hanks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our style? Get it done,'' he said. ``That's a trick I've
enjoyed around here over the years. We don't have egos where guys
want to play one way or another. We just play. The goal is to play
the next week. That's all we're concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back Darnell Walker added: ``We're not the traditional
49ers defense. We make adjustments as we go, whenever we have to.
It's worked for us so far. I mean, we're here aren't we?''

 &HT;    San Francisco Notes: Two coaches, two different goals in NFC
West
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ Steve Mariucci took over the 49ers the
same time Dan Reeves took over the Falcons. And while both clearly
have done credible jobs, Mariucci marveled Tuesday at the quick
work Reeves has done in reversing Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest part of Mariucci's challenge was to not let San
Francisco fall off the high standards set by Bill Walsh and George
Seifert. He basically had to fit in and slowly impose his will on
the team. The talent was there.
</P>
<P>
   With Reeves, Mariucci said, ''He sure has done a good job. He
had to change the personnel. They had that run-and-shoot offense.
What he's done well is plug in some free agents with the draft and
then kept the good talent they had. He got some tight ends, which
they had to have.
</P>
<P>
   ''Also, he kept a real good continuity. They are a very fine
football team. They can run the ball, pass it, stop the run and
defend the pass. They are very well coached. You have to like what
Dan Reeves has done with that team.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, the Falcons are more impressive than their
record indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their record is better than 14-2 when you take the last eight
games of last year,'' Mariucci said. ''They're a good team, much
improved in a short time. I watched the tape of the last game
against them. We didn't play well and they played great.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Garrison Hearst nor Jerry Rice practiced Tuesday because
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst watched practice while resting his sore hamstring.
Mariuccis said the running back reported some soreness, but that he
indicated he'd be healthy come Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably more optimistic this week than I was last week,''
he said. ''Last week, I asked him how he felt and I never got that
smile or creaky voice. This week, he's saying, 'I'm OK. I'll be
fine.' He thinks he might have caught a cramp in the hamstring
Sunday because it was wrapped so tight for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rice, both his knees have bothered him since the Falcons
game in Atlanta on November 15. He got one knee drained last week
and three weeks before that. Mariucci said Rice might not practice
today or Thursday, but he expected the best receiver of all time to
be ready for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't been as healthy as he'd like to be,'' the coach
said. ''It's remarkable considering that he had two knee surgeries
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers lost four road games this season, but they believe
there was growth in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had more penalties on the road, more turnovers and more
miscommunication,'' Mariucci said. ''And we let that bite us. We
have to go to Atlanta and be better at the intangible things. I
think we've matured as a team. We're more used to the hostile
environment each time we're in it.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco will practice with speakers blaring today to
simulate the anticipated noise in the dome.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the road,'' quarterback Steve Young said, ''we definitely
want a quick start. We want to eliminate some of the emotional high
of them being at home. The game against them down there, we kind of
fiddled around. We've got to play cleaner football.''

 &HT;    Fulmer takes time to savor Vols' title
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ It was 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, and Phillip Fulmer,
coach of college football's 1998 national champions, was informed
by his wife, Vicky, that he had celebrated long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had me packing and hauling boxes out to the bus,'' Fulmer
said a few hours later. ``We were going to leave on time today. She
made sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer did have time on his way out of town to pick up several
big chunks of hardware. After Tennessee's 23-16 win over Florida
State in Monday night's Fiesta Bowl, athletics director Doug Dickey
is going to have to build a new trophy case in Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer received the Grantland Rice Award from the Football
Writers Association of America, the Associated Press national
championship trophy and the Sears Trophy, which goes to the winner
in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll.
</P>
<P>
   All meant the same thing: For the first time in 47 years,
Tennessee was college football's national champion.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Vols their first 13-0 season and made the
polls a formality. Tennessee was a unanimous No. 1 pick in both,
with Ohio State (11-1) second. Florida State (11-2) was No. 3,
giving the Seminoles their 12th top-four finish in a row. Arizona
(12-1) was No. 4 and Florida (10-2) was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 Georgia Tech (10-2), which defeated Notre Dame in the
Gator Bowl, finished in the top 10 for the first time since 1990,
when it won the UPI national championship. Georgia (9-3), which
beat Virginia in the Peach Bowl, was 14th.
</P>
<P>
   After a few hours of sleep and a meeting with the media Tuesday
morning, it was back to work for Fulmer. After a bus ride to the
airport, his charter plane arrived in Knoxville at 5:30 p.m. At 6
p.m. Fulmer hopped a private jet to go recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a lot of days between now and (the national
signing day on) Feb. 4,'' Fulmer said. ``We will not have any down
time until after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulmer did find time Monday night to share his celebration with
a few old friends.
</P>
<P>
   He called former offensive coordinator David Cutcliffe, a
longtime friend who left the Volunteers on Dec. 6 to become head
coach at Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional conversation,'' Fulmer said. ``But I
assured him that he had a national championship ring coming.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw former Tennessee quarterback Peyton Manning before and
after the game. Even though the national championship came the year
after Manning left for the NFL, Manning, Fulmer said, ``was one of
the people who paved the way for it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong to say that this group of guys did it and
Peyton didn't,'' Fulmer said. ``Without him and without a bunch of
other great players who have come through here, we would not have
been in his position.''
</P>
<P>
   The season was especially sweet for Fulmer and friends in part
because it was unexpected. After losing Manning and several other
NFL draft choices, Tennessee was picked behind Florida in the SEC
East. Now, Tennessee has two SEC titles in a row and as many
national championships as the Gators.

IRANIANS ASSERT ROGUE AGENTS WERE KILLERS OF FIVE DISSIDENTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to correct spelling of `Tehran' sted `Teheran' throughout)   (nk) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ In an extraordinary statement, Iran's
Intelligence Ministry said Tuesday that rogue Iranian intelligence
officers were responsible for the killings late last year of five
prominent critics of the government's conservative wing.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure seemed to confirm the suspicions of the many
Iranians who had said that the series of slayings could not have
been carried out without some kind of official complicity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fact that an acknowledgment was made public could
suggest that, under President Mohammad Khatami, Iran may be
becoming the kind of country in which embarrassing secrets can no
longer be permanently harbored.
</P>
<P>
   All five of those who were slain had criticized the hard-line
clerics within Iran's government who have been the principal
opponents of Khatami's moves for greater moderation and openness.
</P>
<P>
   The slayings have left many people in Iran deeply shocked, and
they have fueled fears that the country's political schisms might
spill over into a campaign of broader violence. Intellectuals had
already become the main targets in the country's internal tussle,
with newspapers shuttered and books banned for overtly political
reasons. But the turn to killings had prompted Khatami to vow that
those responsible would be identified and arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing that intelligence officials had played a role in
the killings, an Intelligence Ministry statement distributed by
Iran's official news agency condemned the killings as ``having
inflicted grave damage to the credibility of the sacred system of
the Islamic Republic of Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   But the statement raised as many questions as it answered. It
blamed the killings on ``a number of our colleagues _
irresponsible, misguided and unruly personnel.'' It did not
identify them, however, or say how many had been arrested, and it
asserted without substantiation that those involved had
``undoubtedly been manipulated by clandestine agents and were
serving foreign interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the information was made public, reports from Tehran of
an assassination attempt against an outspoken conservative
suggested that an era of political violence is by no means over.
The target, Ali Razini, who leads the Tehran judiciary, was
reported to have been slightly wounded in a grenade attack in the
capital; at least one bystander was killed.
</P>
<P>
   An Iranian opposition group committed to overthrowing the
country's Islamic regime has taken credit for similar assassination
attempts in the past, including the fatal shooting last summer in
the Tehran bazaar of Assadollah Lajevardi, the former director of
Iran's prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the dissidents killed last year, Dariush Foruhar,
and his wife, Parvaneh, belonged to an outlawed but tolerated
opposition party. They were found stabbed to death on Nov. 22 in
their Tehran home, which associates have said was under
surveillance by the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   In the following weeks, Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh and Mohammad
Mokhtari, both writers, disappeared, and their bodies were found
dumped separately on the outskirts of Tehran. Each appeared to have
been strangled. Both men had tried to set up a writers'
association, and each had been questioned by authorities about
their activities.
</P>
<P>
   A third writer, Majid Sharif, who had been critical of
conservative clerics, was found dead after disappearing from his
home.
</P>
<P>
   Western human rights groups and literary societies had called
for independent inquiries into the killings, which they said raised
disturbing questions about Iran's willingness to tolerate
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that hard-line death squads were responsible for
the killings is likely to play into the hands of Khatami's moderate
supporters. In the uproar that followed the killings they expressed
strong suspicions of the Intelligence Ministry, which is under the
control of their conservative rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students and intellectuals have demonstrated to
protest the killings and have called for the dismissal of Iranian
intelligence officials. The ministry, which has domestic and
foreign responsibilities, has long functioned outside ordinary
government channels, and has been blamed by Western governments for
dozens of killings of Iranian dissidents abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, Khatami has taken steps to put the ministry
under his own control, but it remains a bastion of the conservative
clerical establishment that is hostile to his agenda. Iranian
officials say it has managed to retain extraordinary power and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Under Iran's diffuse power structure, the elected president
wields little official influence over the security forces, the
judiciary or the police. Those powers lie with the supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who under the country's Islamic system is
chosen by a body of Shiite clerics.

 &HT;    Hall voters generous this year, but not to Murphy
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ By checking another part of the paper, you know by
this time that Dale Murphy didn't make the Baseball Hall of Fame. I
didn't expect him to the first time around, but I looked at the
generous switch among the baseball writing constitituency and
figured anybody might have had a chance. Even Mike Witt, a mystery
candidate who won one game more than he lost.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it's tougher to get past these voters than it is to get
into Augusta National. At other times it's as easy as the United
Nations. In the past six years, only five candidates got elected.
This time a deluge of three made it, Nolan Ryan, Robin Yount and
George Brett. Poor old Tony Perez didn't make it again. He drove in
more runs than both Brett and Yount. Carlton Fisk missed his first
time around, and he holds the record for home runs by a catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy finished way down the list, and that gives you a clue
that it's going to be a long haul for him, if ever. That in spite
of Item 5 in the voting instructions. It reads, among everything
else, that ``integrity, sportsmanship, character and contributions
to his team'' should be considered. On that score, Murphy would be
a shoo-in. The .265 batting average didn't impress the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Five times he was the Gold Glove center fielder in the National
League, but you'll notice defense gets about as much play as a girl
with pimples. I cite Dwight Evans here. This guy played the tough
field at Fenway Park, had a gun of an arm and was one of the finest
outfielders you'll ever see. He was no donkey with the bat either,
.272 average, 385 home runs and 1,391 runs batted in. Brett and
Yount both hit fewer home runs. Evans was buried.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three who survived this electoral triathlon, I voted for
two. Once I'd done it, I was sorry I voted for Nolan Ryan. I'm not
certain either is first-time quality, and I say that because Joe
DiMaggio didn't make it the first time. Joe DiMaggio. I remember
reading that Henry Aaron ``would go in by acclamation'' when he
came up. Nine writers didn't vote for him. Only six didn't vote for
Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan was a candidate for down the road, not yet. Sure, he struck
out thousands, he pitched seven no-hitters. A strikeout counts one
out. Throw three strikes to three batters and you could have three
infield outs. A no-hitter looks no better in the standings than a
seven-hitter. For all his firepower, and the help of Advil, he won
only 52 percent of his decisions. Don Sutton won just as many
games, but he grew grayer by the year waiting to pass this stern
board.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan never pitched a team to the World Series. The one he played
in, he was a relief pitcher before that one-inning wonder, the
closer, was invented. Later, he would have made my ballot, but I
booted it. He's not a first-timer.
</P>
<P>
   Just as I have voted for Evans, I cast losing ballots for Maury
Wills for years. I voted for Johnny Mize. I never voted for Gaylord
Perry. He cheated and bleated about it, and still made it. I voted
for Jim Bunning. One I would like to have voted for was Mickey
Lolich, a hero without blemish in the shadow of the reprobate Denny
McLain. There's one last chance from the guys in the back room, the
veterans committee. They're not in charge of correcting oversights;
it just works out that way a lot of times. But they can't resist
voting in some of their old cronies, whose records on the field
might be questionable, but who contributed fine harmony at the bar
around midnight.

 &HT;    Vols radio man Ward given magical last season
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ The old radio man held good thoughts on the ride
over to his last football call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever needs to happen, however it has to, (Tennessee) will
win it,'' John Ward told his partner in commentary, Bill Anderson.
It was not a selfish claim. He wouldn't presume that the Volunteers
were going to win one for an old radio man.
</P>
<P>
   Simply, Monday was no time for Tennessee to kick the victory
habit, not after such a long chain of stirring finishes and minor
miracles. A Fiesta Bowl date with Florida State was just the last
stop on the way to a national championship, the inevitable
conclusion. And as he had done for 31 seasons, Ward would give the
moment voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's football time in Tennessee!'' he had alerted the orange
rabble for all that time. He is one of the rare distinctive voices
amid the well-modulated flock. A rallying point for a region, not
just background noise. One who decided to fall silent after this
season, at the age of 64, before the voice began to crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the Vols,'' coach Phillip Fulmer says. That would be
Phillip Fulmer of Winchester, Tenn., who can remember when he used
to take the AM radio to a high point and listen to Ward's telling.
</P>
<P>
   The old radio man said he did not dwell on this being the final
football call. ``Never once during the broadcast did I think about
this being my last game or about this being a great way to go
out,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was the business of making sense of a sloppy,
out-of-sync game. Ward felt himself falling victim to the halting
play. Maybe he warmed up as the night progressed, during Peerless
Price's dashes through the FSU secondary and the defense's slow
suffocation of the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the 13-0 Vols closed in on a 23-16 victory and their
first national championship since 1951, the old radio man never
stepped out of character. ``In essence, I was understated,'' he
said. ``I didn't go berserk. I counted down the last five seconds,
like I usually do. I don't really remember what I said at the end,
but I think it was something like, `The national championship is
painted orange.'''
</P>
<P>
   He'd make his way down to the chaos of the locker room one last
time to do the postgame with Fulmer. For a man of words, Ward said
little off the air. ``John doesn't get very emotional,'' Fulmer
said. He signed off never mentioning that this really was goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   When Ward returned late that night to the Tennessee hotel, he
bypassed the raucous fans and went directly to the quiet of his
room. On the bed was spread the chart for tonight's Tennessee-LSU
basketball game. He has one more season to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a magical experience,'' he said while
decompressing, still speaking for Vols nation.
</P>
<P>
   There were all these times when Tennesse might have lost _ at
Syracuse, against Florida _ or should have lost _ against Arkansas.
All these opportunities to land just short again. But Ward's last
season would be his best, and reality doesn't often supply those
kind of endings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was something out there at work. I may never know what
it was.'' The old radio man had found the event that was impossible
to describe.

 &HT;    Ryan, Brett enter Hall on first try
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Baseball Writers' Association of America, criticized as
haughty in recent years, threw open the doors to Cooperstown with a
flourish Tuesday, a gesture that didn't end up doing a whole lot
for Dale Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Strikeout master Nolan Ryan, Kansas City legend George Brett and
Milwaukee mainstay Robin Yount all were voted to baseball's highest
honor, in the biggest class for first-year eligible inductees since
the Hall of Fame's charter year of 1936. It was the largest
contingent elected in eight years, and Ryan and Brett posted two of
the strongest ballots in history. ``For me to have a date with
these two guys in July of 1999, God, hopefully I'll be able to to
compose myself by then,'' said Brett, who broke into tears during a
conference call with writers after the vote was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the seven-time Atlanta Braves All-Star, expected to
finish behind in his first year on the ballot, but perhaps not so
behind. Of a record 497 ballots cast, Murphy drew only 96 votes,
just 19.3 percent; 75 percent, or 373 votes, was required for
admission this year.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk, also in his first year of eligibility, drew 330
votes, just 43 short. Holdovers Tony Perez (302), Gary Carter
(168), Steve Garvey (150), Jim Rice (146), Bruce Sutter (121) and
Jim Kaat (100) all finished ahead of Murphy, who has 14 more years
to gain admission.
</P>
<P>
   After voting in only five players in the past six years and
drawing criticism for making Phil Niekro and Don Sutton sweat
several Januarys before admitting them, the writers never so
strongly endorsed a group as this one. In the previous 62 years,
only 26 players were admitted in their first years of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and Brett placed among the highest four returns in history.
Ryan drew 491 votes (98.79 percent), second only to Tom Seaver, his
old New York Mets teammate, whose 98.84 percentage of 1992 is the
highest percentage. Brett came in at 98.19 percent (488 votes), the
fourth-highest, just behind Ty Cobb (98.23) and ahead of Hank Aaron
(97.83).
</P>
<P>
   The only previous class with so many players admitted in their
first year of eligibility was the first group of Cobb, Babe Ruth,
Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson and Walter Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan never viewed himself as Cooperstown material until late in
his career. ``I felt like my last few years with the Rangers,'' he
said from his hometown of Alvin, Texas, ``and with some of the
things that happened late in my career, that I'd enhanced my
chances of being inducted.''Thomas Stinson writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first confrontation between American and
Iraqi jet fighters in more than six years, American warplanes on
Tuesday fired on _ but missed _ Iraqi jets that were reported to
have penetrated the ``no flight'' zone over southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. jets fired six air-to-air missiles in a pair of clashes
that occurred about 15 minutes and 60 miles apart, Defense
Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first incident, two Air Force F-15 jets fired their
missiles after Iraqi MiG jets latched on to them with radar but did
not fire, the officials said. In the second, they said, two Navy
F-14 jets from the carrier Carl Vinson fired on Iraqi MiG's that
also dipped into the no-flight zone.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesay's military confrontation was the third and most dramatic
in less than two weeks with Iraq, which has appeared eager to test
American resolve after last month's American and British air
strikes against military and industrial sites in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier confrontations, on Dec. 28 and 30, American
warplanes attacked Iraqi air defense batteries after Baghdad
carried out its threat to fire on American and British aircraft
patrolling the no-flight zones in northern and southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The zones were imposed on Iraq by the United States and its
allies after the Persian Gulf war of 1991 as a way of protecting
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from President
Saddam Hussein's forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said the American warplanes involved in Tuesday's
clash returned home safely but that an Iraqi MiG fighter had
apparently crashed in southern Iraq, possibly after it ran out of
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that the jet did not appear to have been
involved in either of the altercations on Tuesday. They said the
pilot may have been the victim of an Iraqi military policy that
bars pilots from filling their fuel tanks completely, apparently
out of fear that the pilots might take advantage of a full tank to
defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been reports of defections in the past in Iraqi
aircraft, so it could well be part of Saddam Hussein's military
management philosophy to send his airplanes up with too little
fuel,'' said Kenneth Bacon, the Defense Department spokesman,
referring to the Iraqi leader. ``We speculate that it ran out of
fuel and the guy just didn't get to the airfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the Pentagon speculated that Hussein had chosen to
confront the United States in the no-flight zones in hopes of
luring American jets to areas where they could be shot down by
Iraqi surface-to-air missiles, allowing American pilots to be taken
prisoner for propaganda purposes and for use as bargaining chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're being very careful not to be lured into traps that he
may be setting up for us,'' Bacon said. ``But we are also being
aggressive in protecting the no-fly zones, and I think that what
happened today is an example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was not surprising that the six missiles had missed
their targets, and that there was enough distance between the
American and Iraqi planes that the Iraqi pilots were able to turn
around quickly to get out of missile range.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our missiles are extremely accurate, and they're the best
there are,'' he said. ``But the fact of the matter is that
air-to-air combat is an extremely engaging and demanding type of
war.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House said that President Clinton had been briefed on
the clashes over southern Iraq and that the missile firings were
proof of the American commitment to enforce the no-flight zones.
The zones were imposed on Iraq after its military launched attacks
on Kurdish communities in northern Iraq and dissident Iraqi Shiites
in the south after the gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important part of our containment policy,'' Joe
Lockhart, the White House spokesman, said of the no-flight zones.
``There's no smart money in trying to psychoanalyze Saddam Hussein,
but we've seen over the last eight years that he often takes these
steps when he's frustrated and when he's isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq confirmed Tuesday's confrontation but denied that any of
its jets had crashed. It was the first such clash between American
and Iraqi jet fighters since Dec. 27, 1992, when an American F-16
shot down an Iraqi MiG-25 after it reportedly latched onto the
American plane with its radar.
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi News Agency said that Iraqi planes
``confronted and clashed with the aggressive British and American
aircraft'' before ``the aggressive aircraft withdrew. All of our
Air Force planes returned to base safely.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that despite the Iraqi statement,
British warplanes, which also patrol the no-flight zones, were not
involved in Tuesday's incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month's four-night American and British air campaign
against Iraq, Iraq has said that it would resume flying over the
no-flight zones.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi Air Force chief, Gen. Khaldoun Khattab Omar, said in
an interview published on Tuesday in an Iraqi government newspaper
that Iraq intended to ``tear down the lines'' delimiting the
no-flight zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraqi fighter planes are totally free to fly the skies of
Iraq, in the north and the south,'' he was quoted as saying. ``They
have the right to defend our territory and no one can stop them.''
Hussein announced recently that the no-flight zones have no basis
in international law and that Iraqi will respond to violations of
its air space ``with all its courage and bravery.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony Tuesday on Capitol Hill, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he believed that the
recent provocations by Iraqi aircraft reflected the fact that
``they lost the initiative, which we feel they are trying to regain
now.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that last month's large aerial bombardment of Iraq had
done greater damage to the Iraqi military that had been previously
reported by the Pentagon. He also said the Pentagon estimates that
1,400 soldiers of the elite Republican Guard, which is involved in
personal security for Hussein and in guarding Iraq's programs to
develop chemical and biological weapons, had been killed.

CADENCE RAISES VALUE OF OFFER TO ACQUIRE QUICKTURN
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cadence Design Systems Inc. said Tuesday that it had raised the
value of its offer to acquire Quickturn Design Systems Inc. to $15
a share in stock from $14.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence has played the white knight to Quickturn, which faces an
unsolicited takeover offer from the Mentor Graphics Corp. Quickturn
shareholders will vote at a special meeting on Friday on whether to
replace the company's board with a slate nominated by Mentor, which
proposes selling the company to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Cadence, based in San Jose, Calif., and Mentor, based in
Wilsonville, Ore., are bitter rivals in the market for the
electronic automated design software used to fashion new chips.
Quickturn is a leader in the related market for specialized
computers that can emulate a new chip design before it is formed in
silicon, providing verification that the circuitry will work as
intended.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor initially offered $12.13 a share in cash, but its offer
was rebuffed by Quickturn, which has been battling the deal in
court. Last month, Mentor raised its bid to $14 a share for 2.1
million shares. Those shares, added to the 591,500 shares of
Quickturn stock Mentor already owns, would result in Mentor owning
14.9 percent of Quickturn's outstanding stock, the maximum amount
that can be acquired without setting off a poison-pill defense.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Quickturn rose 76.5625 cents, to $15.0625. Cadence
fell 37.5 cents, to $29.6875, and Mentor fell 28.125 cents, to
$8.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor officials did not comment on Cadence's increased bid, but
they have said in the past that their offer is the more certain
because it is in cash, and less likely to be blocked by antitrust
considerations.

LIABILITY SUIT TARGETS GUN INDUSTRY FOR NEGLIGENT DISTRIBUTION
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Ill., Pa., Mass., Fla., Calif., La., Va., N.C., S.C.,
Ga.)  (bl) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the night of July 27, 1993, Njuzi Ray, 17, was
fatally shot in a dispute on a Brooklyn street. A suspect was later
acquitted, and nobody else has been arrested for the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a case like this would have long disappeared from
public awareness, lost in the city's crime statistics and recalled
only by the victim's family and friends. But the slaying in
Bedford-Stuyvesant is once more in the spotlight, as a subject of a
potentially precedent-setting lawsuit against the gun industry in
which opening arguments could begin Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the case, Ray's mother, Freddie Hamilton, and the relatives
of five other people killed in separate shootings in New York City
and Yonkers in recent years are seeking to hold the gun industry
collectively liable for the deaths, just as many recent suits have
attacked the tobacco industry as responsible for deaths and
illnesses from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the claims is the argument that more than 30 gun
manufacturers and distributors have marketed and distributed
handguns so negligently that dealers in states with lax gun control
laws are oversupplied with them. Many of those guns, in turn, end
up in the hands of criminals and youths in states with tough gun
laws like New York, the suit contends.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is considered potentially precedent-setting because it
invokes the theory of ``negligent distribution'' of guns, rather
than charging liability on the basis of the product's inherent
harmfulness, said David Leebron, the dean of Columbia University
Law School and an expert in tort litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as one supporter of the suit boiled down the argument, the
defendants _ including Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt's Manufacturing Co.,
and Beretta USA _ ``knew or should have known that they were
oversupplying the legitimate market, thereby creating a pool of
weapons available for the illegitimate market.''
</P>
<P>
   The supporter, Joshua Horwitz, executive director of the
Washington-based Educational Fund to End Handgun Violence, said
past suits seeking to hold gun makers and distributors liable for
intentional killings often focused on narrower issues, like whether
a single gun was marketed in a way that made its manufacturer or
distributor culpable. These suits have been repeatedly defeated in
court.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will be closely watched not only by the gun industry
and gun control advocates, but by lawyers for municipalities across
the nation that have sued or are considering suing gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Chicago, for instance, recently filed suit against
nearly 40 gun manufacturers, distributors and retailers, accusing
the industry of flooding suburban stores with many more guns than
the lawful market could absorb, allowing many of the weapons to
supply the illegal market in Chicago, where gun control laws are
among the strictest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, Boston, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles are
among cities considering similar suits. And New Orleans has filed
suit on different grounds, contending that gun makers failed to
include enough safety devices in their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Leebron of Columbia said, however, that the theory of
negligent distribution ``is a difficult theory to prevail.'' While
he said the argument was not without legal foundation, the
applicable laws in the case do not ``particularly favor
collectively imposing liability or imposing special duties on
manufacturers regarding the distribution of the product.''
</P>
<P>
   And one of the defense lawyers in the suit, Anne Kimball, held
in an interview Monday that there was no evidence of any illegal or
careless sale by any manufacturer or distributor in any of the
shootings, and that the plaintiffs had ``no facts that connect''
any of the gun makers or distributors to any of the seven crimes
cited in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   They include the six homicides and a case in which a young man
survived a brain wound in a Queens shooting. He, like the relatives
of the murder victims, is seeking to hold the firearms industry
collectively responsible.
</P>
<P>
   But Horwitz said he was optimistic, contending that the argument
about the gun industry's marketing practices was easy to understand
and likely to prove persuasive to the average juror.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn suit was filed in 1995. A year later, Judge Jack
Weinstein rejected the gun companies' motions to dismiss it, saying
it was possible that the plaintiffs would ``be able to show that a
substantial cause for the killings that are at the heart of this
suit is the operation of a large-scale underground market''
stemming from a handgun sales system that is ``without adequate
concern over the channels of distribution and possession.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the evidence that Elisa Barnes and the three other
plaintiffs' lawyers are expected to offer are economic consultants'
statistics that show, the consultants say, that handgun sales in
states with weak gun control laws _ like Virginia, Florida,
Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina _ ``are higher than can
be explained by legitimate demand, suggesting that a substantial
proportion of sales in such states are not for legitimate purposes
but for resale to the criminal market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, an Atlanta-based gun industry group, said in an
interview that to hold makers, distributors or sellers liable ``for
the criminal misuse of a lawfully sold product is to turn our whole
tort system upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnes said the suit did not state a figure for the damages
being sought in the trial, in which the gun companies are
represented by about a dozen lawyers and in which jury selection
began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the woman who helped start it all, Freddie Hamilton,
said Monday that she was ``apprehensive but optimistic'' as she
awaited the opening arguments and testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by telephone from the Brooklyn child welfare group
where she is the executive director, she said that the case was
``about the number of young people who get murdered by guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Her goal, she said, was ``keeping guns out of the hands of
people who shouldn't have them.''

affect what phones look like, where they stand, who runs them and
how they are used for advertising. Applications are pending for

 GREENSBORO, Ga.: Dennard added.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John DeCourdreaux, a blueberry farmer from South Haven, Mich.,
said he, too, was not satisfied with the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' DeCourdreaux said, ``this is a pat on the back from
the Agriculture Department, saying, `We acknowledge what we did.
Here's enough money to get out of our hair.' Well, I don't want a
pat on the back and it's not enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   DeCourdreaux said the $50,000 payments may appease those who are
no longer farming. ``But for people like me who are still currently
farming and have all the documentation, $50,000 isn't going to buy
me a good truck,'' he said. ``I was denied hundreds of thousands of
dollars in loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary R. Grant, 55, whose family grows peanuts, cotton, corn and
soybeans on 250 acres in Tillery, N.C., said it was ``neither moral
or just'' that the settlement does not include punishment for the
federal officials who denied black farmers loans, crop subsidies
and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``These folks took our homes, took our credit rating, took our
man and womanhood and personhood,'' said Grant, the president of
the Black Farmers and Agriculturists Association and a plaintiff in
the lawsuit. ``These folks are not even getting slapped on the
wrist as far as we know.''
</P>
<P>
   In most of the documented cases, racial discrimination against
black farmers came not from the Department of Agriculture
bureaucracy in Washington, but from committees of local agents who
administer federal farm programs in their counties. These county
committees, known as Farm Service Agencies, are usually elected and
are usually all-white in the South, where most black farmers live
and where most of the alleged discrimination took place.
</P>
<P>
   In hundreds of complaints filed in Washington over the last 15
years, black farmers say they were routinely denied the assistance
granted almost automatically to white farmers. Sometimes, they
maintain, federal officials demanded evidence of agricultural and
financial expertise that was not required of white farmers, or
delayed processing loans until after the planting season had
arrived. Other times, they contend, their applications were
rejected with overt racial rebuffs.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Environmental Working Group, a research
organization, concluded that between 1985 and 1994, the average
black farmer received less than a third of the amount in federal
subsidies that the average white farmer received.
</P>
<P>
   The Farm Service Agencies lost much of their jurisdiction over
determining who is eligible for Agriculture Department aid in
December 1997, when Glickman, seeking to repair the department's
civil rights record, announced that decisions on loans would be
made in Washington. He also required state executive directors of
the department to review half of all rejected loan applications to
minorities and women to insure that any denials of loans were for
legitimate reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the settlement does not specifically require the
Agriculture Department to admit that it discriminated against black
farmers, Glickman and his aides have said as much in the past. A
1997 report by the department's civil rights review team concluded
that ``minority farmers have lost significant amounts of land and
potential farm income as a result of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Washington on Tuesday night announcing
the settlement, Glickman said he was ``embarrassed'' by the
discrimination, and said the department had a great deal of repair
work to do. Though the settlement itself does not admit or deny any
discrimination, he said that civil rights was the most important
single issue facing the department.
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement ``will close a painful chapter in USDA's
history and open a more constructive front in our efforts to see
this department emerge as the federal civil rights leader in the
21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   He said civil service rules made it difficult to discipline the
current employees of the department who participated in the
discrimination or oversaw it, but he said it was more important to
look ahead and help future black farmers than to look backward in
recrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to abolishing the role of the largely white county
committees in determining who gets department loans, he said every
employee of the department, including himself, would receive civil
rights training and would be evaluated on their civil rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman said the final cost of the settlement to the government
would not be known until it was clear how many farmers would file
cases, but he said that the 1,000 farmers now part of the
class-action lawsuit would likely receive about $200 million. If,
as expected, another 1,000 to 2,000 farmers file claims, that
amount could double or triple.
</P>
<P>
   He said the federal judge hearing the class-action lawsuit
brought by the farmers had granted his preliminary approval to the
settlement, and said that final approval would come after a formal
hearing in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ About 500 people were massacred in eastern
Congo during the New Year holiday, a Roman Catholic news agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   No independent confirmation of a massacre or of its size was
available Tuesday night. If the report is true, it would appear to
be the largest massacre since the start of a rebellion in August
against Congo's president, Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila came to power in May 1997, after a military campaign
across the country, then Zaire, during which his soldiers and their
supporters were reported to have carried out more than a dozen
massacres. Those killings, never fully investigated, had their
roots in the region's bitter ethnic conflict between the Tutsi and
Hutu, and in the massacres of more than half a million Tutsi in
Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic group, the Missionary Service News Agency, reported
Tuesday that the killings on three days last week were carried out
by soldiers aligned with the rebels, who are led by Tutsi. But the
victims were not Hutu and ethnic tensions did not appear to be the
cause of the slayings, said the Rev. Giulio Albanese, the news
service's editor.
</P>
<P>
   He said the killing began last Wednesday in the town of
Makobola, in the far east of Congo across Lake Tanganika from
Burundi, and ended on Friday. He said that local people told the
agency that the killers shot their victims or hacked them to death
with machetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it's hell,'' Albanese said in a telephone interview
Tuesday night from Rome. ``The smell of dead bodies is awful in the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious groups, both Catholic and Protestant, are active in
the area, and are well-connected with aid groups and other
international institutions working there.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, president of the main rebel group, the
Congolese Rally for Democracy, said Tuesday night that he was not
aware of any massacre and could not make any comment.
</P>
<P>
   But a rebel commander, Jonas Padiri, strongly denied that any
massacre took place. ''It's impossible,'' he told Reuters. ``The
area around Uvira is calm and has been calm. There have been no
problems there.''
</P>
<P>
   Uvira, the nearest large town, is less than 10 miles to the
north of where the massacre was reported.
</P>
<P>
   The reported killings last week took place
</P>
<P>
   In Kivu, the area where the killings allegedly took place last
week, ethnic tensions are further complicated by another group, the
Mayi-Mayi, a loose band of fiercely independent warriors. They are
not identified with any single ethnic group, and some claim to
fight for Kabila and others against him.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mayi-Mayi are against the rebels. According to Albanese
and other reports, the Mayi-Mayi forced the rebels to retreat from
the town into the mountains nearby. The Mayi-Mayi then left the
town, too. At that point, according to these reports, the rebels
returned and began to kill villagers, for their suspected support
of the Mayi-Mayi.
</P>
<P>
   Albanese said the killings, which he said may have involved
soldiers from Rwanda, was organized by a rebel commander with the
nom de guerre of Shetani. He is reportedly based in Uvira.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kabila and the rebels have accused each other of carrying
out mass killings since this latest rebellion began in August.
Though few outsiders have been able verify the claims, human rights
groups have laid blame on both sides. Kivu is an area with many of
the turbulent tensions between Tutsis and Hutus that lead to the
massacres in Rwanda and Burundi. Over the last several years, the
entire Kivu region has been the center of two rebellions in Congo
and the base for Hutu militiamen carrying out attacks on Rwanda and
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu, who human rights groups say have been gathering in
greater numbers along the Congo border, fight largely for Kabila.
Many of them were soldiers and militiamen who fled Rwanda after
having carried about the massacres there.
</P>
<P>
   The Tutsi in Congo, most of whom grew up in the country's east,
are generally on the side of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's rebellion began with support from Rwanda and Uganda,
which were determined to drive large numbers of Hutu rebels away
from the border areas of those countries. During the rebellion,
there were widespread reports of massacres of Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
   When a new Rwanda-sponsored rebellion against Kabila sprung up
last year, however, Hutu forces in Congo reportedly fought on the
government's side against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Albanese said the massacre was similar to one that took place in
August, at the start of the rebellion, in Kasika, also in South
Kivu. At least 350 people were killed by rebels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have claimed that Kabila's forces carried out
massacres in other towns, like Kindu and Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   When Kabila came to power, overthrowing the dictator Mobutu Sese
Seko, he was backed by roughly the same alliance now turned against
him. Then, as his forces moved west across the vast and
inaccessible nation, Tutsi troops apparently took vengeance on
Hutus, many of whom had fled Rwanda and some of whom had taken part
in the 1994 killings there.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kabila has aligned himself with the Hutu militiamen and
soldiers, but is also backed by Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered groups of refugees escaping the war have been moving
into Tanzania, Uganda and, since last week, the Central African
Republic during fighting between Kabila's forces and the rebels in
northern Congo.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN FRANCISCO _ Over a 10-day period, Steve Mariucci has become so
popular that new California Gov. Gray Davis should be glad the San
Francisco 49ers coach is unable to run for his office.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite rampant speculation that, even with three years left on
his contract, he would be run out of town and replaced by Green Bay
coach Mike Holmgren, Mariucci handled himself with class and
dignity as the 49ers prepared for their NFC wild-card playoff game
against the Packers. He wore a stone face and showed his players no
signs of the intense pressure he was feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after the 49ers' extraordinary 30-27 victory over the
Packers, the Bay Area media came to Mariucci's defense. After Steve
Young's 25-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens gave the 49ers one
of the most dramatic wins in franchise history, Mariucci's players
spoke out and sent a collective message that they wanted Mariucci _
Mooch, to his friends _ to be retained.
</P>
<P>
   With exiled owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. unable to run his
organization until his legal problems in Louisiana are settled and
with former president Carmen Policy and director of football
operations Dwight Clark bailing out for Cleveland, the 49ers were
passengers on a rudderless ship.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday. San Francisco's dramatic comeback _ called The
Catch II by Northern California media _ meant so much that it has
put Mariucci at the helm. He disclosed Monday that he was offered
an extension last week but didn't sign it because he didn't want to
be distracted from preparation for the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Because negotiations have resumed, Mariucci is confident an
agreement will be reached and he will remain with the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a new contract proposal,'' Mariucci said. ``There was
a time when the talks didn't go on for a couple of weeks. For a
while, there was minimal discussion. That's when the rumors began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The club did begin talks again. They contacted (his agent) Don
Yee, and when he called me, I said, `What did they say?' He said,
`Forget it. Coach the team. Worry about the week ahead.' Nothing
has been signed, but I was encouraged by that. It's the same thing
as before. We'll get it done later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we both know what we want. It's just a matter of
getting it worked out. I'm committed to being here, and the club
has told me that they want me here long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that the 49ers have appeared to be in
disarray. Interim president Larry Thrailkill is an attorney from
Nashville, Tenn., who is running the front office. They brought
former general manager John McVay out of retirement in midseason.
There are reports that Bill Walsh will be hired again to take over
the personnel side of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil, Mariucci has been a tower of strength to
his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's handled all the things that have come to him, including
this disintegration of our organization that we've seen over the
last couple of years,'' Young said. ``It's not fair for him to be
so excellent, facing the things he's had to face. If you think
about it, it's 48 players, a few coaches and Steve Mariucci. As far
as I'm concerned, his record kind of speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci, 43, came to the 49ers in 1997 from the University of
California, where he had been the head coach for one season. From
1992-95, he was the quarterbacks coach at Green Bay under Holmgren.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season in place of George Seifert, whose .755
winning percentage is the best in NFL history, Mariucci led the
49ers to a 13-3 record. But they were eliminated from the playoffs
by Green Bay for the third consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite injuries in the offensive line, significant free-agent
losses, average special teams and the worst 49ers defense in a
couple of decades, San Francisco finished 12-4 this season but lost
the NFC West title to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Thrailkill, one of DeBartolo's attorneys, was thrust into an
unfamiliar role with the 49ers. He made trips to San Francisco from
Nashville. On one, he vowed to complete the contract extension with
Mariucci by Dec. 1. When it didn't happen, the speculation began.
</P>
<P>
   Because Holmgren could leave Green Bay if he got a job as a
coach/general manager, he would be a natural fit in San Francisco,
his hometown. With Policy and Clark out of the picture, Holmgren
could have the total control he covets.
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem, though. Everyone in the organization
wanted the popular Mariucci to stay. Although he said nothing last
week, Mariucci breathed a sigh of relief when contract talks
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told we were going to get this done,'' he said. ``I know
it's not a written contract, but my word means something and I know
the club's word means something. Even though it's not done, I have
faith that it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would have already signed the extension if one that
suited him had been offered, he said, ``Sure. I would have done it
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a question in my mind, because I was told that it
was not an issue. I'm sure there was a question in everybody else's
mind because nothing had been done. And being that it wasn't done,
signed, sealed and delivered, it was just out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci wants more control of personnel decisions, but the
49ers don't even know who is going to be running the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision hasn't been made on who makes the decisions,''
Mariucci said.

ANALYSIS: DID STERN GOAD HUNTER INTO PLAYER VOTE?  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did David Stern goad Billy Hunter into calling Wednesday's vote
of National Basketball Association players, or has the head of the
union scheduled a vote whose outcome he knows?
</P>
<P>
   On the answer to that question may rest the future of the NBA
season, Stern's reputation as a peerless leader and Hunter's future
as the players' labor leader.
</P>
<P>
   When the head of a union in another area was asked Tuesday if he
would allow his membership to vote the way the NBA players will
Wednesday, he said, ``Sure, if I know what the vote is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter isn't saying he knows what the vote will be. He won't
even say that he will resign if he loses, though what other choice
would he reasonably have if his membership repudiates him, his
leadership and his negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   But if Hunter doesn't know that he has the votes for an
in-your-face, Stern, he has taken a risk calculated to place him
and the union in grave jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a particularly difficult negotiation for the NBA
players because they have never experienced this kind of work
stoppage. Stern locked them out in 1995 while he was negotiating a
deal with a friendlier union leader, Simon Gourdine, and the union
itself had a major intramural scrap. But a settlement was reached
in time for the season to be played in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   The perception among league negotiators and owners as they began
this lockout seemed to be that the players would have no stomach
for a prolonged, costly dispute. They would not want to miss
paychecks. But the players have missed hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of paychecks, showing they have the stomach and the
resolve to hold together to try to keep the league from getting
what it wants.
</P>
<P>
   As the weeks went by, however, signs of the players'
inexperience began popping up. Here and there, a lone player would
speak up, express his opposition to the negotiating committee's
bargaining stance and say all of the players should be allowed to
vote on what the league has offered.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, a shrewd, go-for-the-jugular labor strategist, exploited
each voice, trying to disrupt the union by calling louder and
louder for the union to conduct a vote. It mattered not that 400
other voices had not been heard.
</P>
<P>
   In eight baseball work stoppages, no commissioner ever clamored
for a vote or did anything else to try to usurp the position of
Marvin Miller or Donald Fehr. Any commissioner who tried would have
been laughed out the door.
</P>
<P>
   From the first work stoppages in the early 1970s, baseball
players have shown an education far above the level of their
colleagues in the other major professional sports. This was
Miller's legacy to the sports union movement.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA union has gone through a succession of leaders in recent
years, since the death of Larry Fleisher, and players have not
received a similar education. Worse, the present leader had no
previous labor experience upon which he could rely and pass on to
his members.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter is said to have compounded that lack of experience by his
internal operating style, in which he won't bounce ideas off people
unless he is certain they will agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   If the players haven't been informed or educated on the current
negotiations before now, it won't happen at their meeting
Wednesday. Proposals as complex as those made by the league and the
union need more than a cursory explanation before a vote that will
show the confidence or lack of same the players have in their
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   That's why player unions leave the negotiating to a selected
committee. It's easier for 10 or 20 players than the entire
membership to become intimately acquainted with proposals, then
recommend them for acceptance or rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hunter summoned the players to New York to vote, the league
immediately raised the question of whether it would be open or
secret. The league, of course, opted for secret, saying players
wouldn't be intimidated that way.
</P>
<P>
   Fehr, who led the baseball players through a 234-day strike in
1994-95, said he didn't have any inside knowledge of the NBA
proceedings, but he said he did know one thing. He said Stern
shouldn't be talking about a secret ballot ``when he has a gag rule
on the owners with steep fines and makes an effort to be as
secretive as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Fehr knows one other thing. Stern has tried to put the fear of
the future into the locked out players by saying the league would
have to consider using replacement players next season if there is
no this season. Fehr knows about replacement players from the
baseball owners' embarrassing, misguided attempt to use them in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion of replacement players strikes me as
positively bizarre,'' Fehr said. ``The market is there to watch NBA
quality players, not a group of guys who couldn't play if the
others were. The notion that you would float it now is scare
tactics. It doesn't strike me as the likeliest development on the
horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Stern hopes that when the players vote Wednesday, that fear
in some minds will translate into votes for him and against Hunter
in their deadly game of one-on-one.

HUMAN DRUGS APPROVED FOR MENTAL PROBLEMS IN DOGS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.C., Pa.) (fb) 
By DENISE GRADY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration announced on Tuesday that it
had approved two drugs already used in people as the first
treatments ever marketed specifically to treat mental problems in
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs may save animals' lives, veterinarians say, by
eliminating or reducing behaviors that would otherwise drive some
owners to have the animals put to death. About 7 million dogs a
year are destroyed because owners can no longer stand their
behavior, said Nicholas Dodman, a veterinarian who is a specialist
in animal behavior at Tufts University, and author of the book
``The Dog Who Loved Too Much.'' (Bantam, 1997)
</P>
<P>
   One drug, Clomicalm, will be prescribed for dogs suffering from
separation anxiety, which causes them to act out when they are left
alone, by barking, chewing their owners' belongings, drooling
copiously, or defecating or urinating inside the house. Clomicalm
is manufactured by Novartis Animal Health U.S. Inc., of Greensboro,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The other drug, Anipryl, will be recommended for ``senior dogs''
suffering from canine cognitive dysfunction or ``old dog
syndrome,'' a mental deterioration that comes on with age. Such
dogs often seem to forget that they were housebroken, and may fail
to recognize their owners. Pfizer, Inc., of Exton, Pa., makes
Anipryl.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous human-animal bonding relationship
established, especially with senior dogs,'' said Edward Kanara, a
veterinarian at Pfizer. The relationship breaks down when the dog
forgets who its owner is, Kanara said, but Anipryl can restore the
bond.
</P>
<P>
   Both drugs are reformulated versions of medications that have
been used for years to treat depression or nervous system disorders
in people. Clomicalm is the name given to clomipramine, an
anti-depressant. Anipryl is the name given to the drug known as
selegiline or deprenyl. The drug, which does not improve cognition
in people, has been used as a treatment for Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians, like medical doctors, may legally prescribe any
approved drug for any purpose and many have already been
prescribing the human versions of those drugs and others for
animals, adjusting the doses for big or small dogs and instructing
pet owners to cut up the pills when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The new products contain the same drugs, but the doses and
labeling are meant for dogs, and Clomicalm tablets contain meat
products, though FDA officials said the pills were not meat
flavored.
</P>
<P>
   By law, the agency approves all veterinary medicines except
vaccines, which are approved through the Department of Agriculture.
There are about 1,500 approved veterinary medicines on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got an old dog that's about to be put down because
it's been tinkling on the floor, you have another option,'' Dodman
said, referring to Anipryl. ``You can buy that dog some time, buy
it an extra year where you would have been at your wits' end in a
sort of latrine situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodman said Prozac is often the best treatment for dogs with
behavior problems, including separation anxiety, and fear of crowds
or thunderstorms. He prescribes Prozac when owners can afford it.
He would like to see a canine version of Prozac marketed,
particularly to treat aggression, which accounts for 50 percent to
60 percent of behavior problems in dogs. But he said that drug
companies were afraid to pursue drugs to treat aggression in dogs,
for fear that they would be sued if a dog on a drug bit someone
anyway.

2 CHEMOTHERAPY OVERDOSES LEAD TO REVIEW OF NURSES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (bl) 
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an action that reopens the question of how much
responsibility nurses have in carrying out doctors' orders, a
Massachusetts licensing board said Tuesday it had issued charges
against 16 nurses in the chemotherapy overdoses of two women in
1994 at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Two other nurses have agreed to have their licenses placed on
probation for one year, the Board of Registration in Nursing said.
</P>
<P>
   Both patients, who were involved in experimental treatment for
breast cancer, died after the overdoses. The deaths helped spur a
new international effort in identifying and correcting errors in
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Lehman, a 39-year-old health columnist for The Boston
Globe, died shortly after the overdose in November 1994. Maureen
Bateman, 53, a North Andover teacher, suffered heart damage from
the overdose and died in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The chemotherapy was given intravenously over 24 hours. One
nurse hung the infusion bag and connected it to the patient. Nurses
in following shifts monitored the flow. The total amount was
supposed to be given over a four-day period; instead, it was given
on each of four consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   The board said it had issued orders that, after hearings, could
lead to disciplinary action against the nurses. The orders contend
that the nurses failed to meet the standards of nursing practice,
because in either administering or monitoring chemotherapy, they
failed to recognize that the doses administered were in excess of
those called for.
</P>
<P>
   Dana-Farber's president, Dr. David Nathan, vigorously defended
the nurses, saying that they had been exonerated by three groups
that investigated the incident _ the Massachusetts Department of
Public Health, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations and Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses went through all the appropriate steps and followed
the standards of practice, Nathan said in an interview. He blamed
the error on a misreading of an ambiguous protocol, the scientific
blueprint that doctors and nurses follow in conducting experiments
that a hospital's ethics committee have approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nurses got bamboozled by a difficult-to-read protocol and
they should not be attacked in this way,'' Nathan said. ``We think
the nurses did their job in each case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan said that his institute has taken responsibility for the
deaths and has since adopted a wide range of corrective actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported the board's action in Tuesday's issue.
Nathan said late Tuesday that his hospital had not had a chance to
talk to the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board's executive director, Theresa Bonanno, said that the
professional standard of care extends beyond a hospital's
guidelines. Massachusetts law states that ``each individual
licensed to practice nursing in the commonwealth shall be directly
accountable for safety of nursing care he delivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bonanno said that when she was a practicing nurse, she
understood that a when a doctor's order seemed unclear, the
physician should be contacted for clarification.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not new,'' Ms. Bonanno said. ``That's not written _
that I know of _ in any institution. It's a professional standard
of care that is expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Reardon, an attorney representing the 18 nurses, said they
``are highly trained, extremely competent individuals'' who ``feel
terrible about what happened.'' Reardon and Nathan said that most
of the nurses still work at Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   David Schildmeier, director of communications for the
Massachusetts Nurses Association, agreed with Dr. Nathan that the
systems in place, not the nurses, were responsible for the errors.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Foer, a spokeswoman for the American Nurses Association in
Washington, said the Massachusetts Board's action ``sends an
alarm'' and renews attention to the problem of errors in
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Had Dana-Farber's nursing leadership position been filled at the
time, Ms. Foer said, ``this incident may not have happened.''
Dana-Farber has since corrected the problem, Ms. Foer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Foer said many health care facilities have slashed positions
of nursing leadership, and often cut their most experienced nurses,
so ``there is no one there to ask for guidance on an order.''
``Brand new nurses may be the only nurses on the floor,'' Ms. Foer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in
Medicine disciplined Dr. James Foran, who wrote the incorrect

AVIATION AGENCY DELAYS DEBUT OF SATELLITE NAVIGATION SYSTEM
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md.) (fb) 
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After spending $430 million to begin a ``new era''
of aviation in which planes would navigate using satellite signals,
the Federal Aviation Administration announced a delay on Tuesday,
saying it cannot write the software that assures pilots the system
is working, and it does not know enough about vulnerability to
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had hoped to begin operating the system in July 1999,
but has pushed that date back to September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The program is supposed to save hundreds of millions of dollars
for the government and the airlines by using enhanced satellite
signals to guide planes to landings in limited visibility at rural
airfields that lack sophisticated instrument-landing systems. It
would allow the FAA to abandon those systems _ and other
ground-based navigation aids _ that are wearing out and are
expensive to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon maintains a Global Positioning System of satellites
used by military aircraft and units to determine their exact
position. Civilian receivers are not accurate enough for precision
guidance of an aircraft landing with limited visual cues. The FAA
plan calls for an extra signal that pilots can use to know where
they are within seven meters, or about 21 feet.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency's associate administrator for research and
acquisition, Steven Zaidman, said on Tuesday that writing the
software was ``a much greater challenge than originally
anticipated.'' The software is supposed to monitor the system's
many components and tell pilots within six seconds if the system
has malfunctioned, time enough to abort landings.
</P>
<P>
   The system was so attractive, saving $3 for each dollar spent
under its original plan, according to the FAA, that the agency had
tried to speed up the project. But the software could not be
rushed, officials said. ``We met reality and they are us,'' Zaidman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has built ground stations and leased space on two
existing satellites. The system is supposed to receive signals from
the network of 24 satellites in low orbit that make up the
Pentagon's Global Positioning System. Then it measures errors and
sends correction signals to two satellites that relay them to
planes in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Private planes can make some use of the signals this summer, the
agency said, but planes that must use instruments to navigate,
including all airliners, cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The system also has safety benefits, experts say. Robert Hilb, a
pilot at UPS Airlines, is helping his company develop a navigation
system in which planes will broadcast their positions to each
other. He said the system could be used to reduce the chance of
runway collisions, and would end ``nonprecision approaches,'' in
which pilots have no guidance from the ground on whether they are
at the proper angle to cross the beginning of the runway just a few
feet above the ground. Pilots who miscalculate can hit terrain
short of the runway, or reach ground level too late, with too
little runway left to land on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Hilb said.
</P>
<P>
   The program was under heavy criticism even before the most
recent delay. Rep. John J. (Jimmy) Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., chairman of
the Aviation subcommittee of the House Transportation Committee,
complained at a hearing in October 1997 that if the cost ``is going
to continue to increase, it might reach a point that it is just not
worth continuing the program.'' The FAA, he said, has a history of
programs that were never completed, and he said the program risked
becoming a ``billion dollar boondoggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan was in a Republican caucus on Tuesday afternoon and not
available to comment, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Zaidman said Tuesday that he was ``80 percent confident''
that his agency and its contractor, Raytheon, could stick to the
new schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the delay is that the FAA is waiting for a
report from the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, of
Laurel, Md., on the vulnerability of satellite signals to
interference, either natural, unintentional or deliberate. Johns
Hopkins is supposed to report back this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that there's vulnerability,'' Zaidman said. He said he
expected Johns Hopkins to advise the agency on steps to minimize
the problem. Satellite signals are very weak compared with signals
from ground-based navigation aids, and could easily be disrupted,
some experts say, raising questions about what kind of back-up
system will be needed.

MAGNETS LESSEN FOOT PAIN OF DIABETICS, A STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In one of the first scientific studies of the
centuries-old and highly debated use of magnets for treatment of
medical disorders, a neurologist reported today that he had
significantly lessened the foot pain that afflicts millions of
diabetics.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael I. Weintraub, a clinical professor of neurology at
New York Medical College, emphasized that his study was small,
involving only 24 patients, and must be regarded as preliminary to
much more clinical research. But he said the early results were
clear and that the treatment ought to be put to use immediately,
provided the correct magnets are used and the treatment is limited
to the types of pain that have been studied.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which appears in this month's issue of the American
Journal of Pain Management, a peer-reviewed journal, runs counter
to many previous studies that have failed to show any beneficial
effect from treatment with magnets.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul J. Rosch, president of the American Institute of
Stress, who has written about the history of magnet therapy, said
the study was well designed and discounted placebo effects in
patients who reacted positively to the fact that treatment was
being given rather than to any real physiological change.
</P>
<P>
   Rosch, whose organization is based in Yonkers, N.Y., called the
therapy ``a real breakthrough for treatment of diabetic pain'' in
cases thought to be progressive and until now irreversible. But,
noting the small size of the study, he cautioned that more research
was needed. ``We have no idea how or why the magnets work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Magnets have been used for centuries in efforts to treat a
variety of conditions, from broken legs in horses to reducing
dandruff with magnetic combs and, in recent years, reducing wrist
pain in people who have carpal tunnel syndrome. But until recently,
no clinical studies taking into account the placebo effects have
established that they actually work.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, reporting in the Archives of Physical and
Rehabilitation Medicine, Dr. Carlos Vallbona of the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston said that he applied low-intensity magnets
to his own knee pain and that the pain was gone in minutes. He then
did a small study of patients with post-polio-syndrome pain. One
group was exposed to small magnets, the other to sham magnets. The
patients with real magnets reported a 50 percent reduction in pain,
while the others reported less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 million diabetics are subject to painful burning
sensations, numbness and tingling in the feet and hands, as are
millions of others with other diseases that inflict constant and
often excruciating pain to the hands and feet.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, Weintraub began a four-month study of magnet use
on diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Twenty-four patients with
chronic foot pain caused by diabetes, multiple myeloma, uremia,
ischemia, lupus and alcoholism were enrolled in a randomized
placebo study.
</P>
<P>
   In the first month, each patient was given a pad equipped with
special, low-intensity magnets for one foot and a nonmagnetized pad
for the other foot. Patients were not told which pad was which, and
were told to wear them 24 hours a day. They were asked to quantify
their pain twice daily on a five-point scale. Nineteen patients, 10
of them diabetics and 9 with other disorders, completed the
four-month trial.
</P>
<P>
   After the first month the pads were blindly switched, and the
patients reported a slight and approximately equal lessening of
pain in both feet. But differences began to appear in the next
three months because of the cumulative effect, Weintraub said. By
the end of the study, nine out of 10 of the diabetics reported less
pain by an average of a full point. In the nondiabetic group, three
out of nine reported a similar lessening of pain. The placebo
effect was similar, however, in both groups, with only 22 percent
overall reporting a benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Weintraub said he believed that the magnets target the small
C-fiber nerves in the soles of the feet and that the magnetic
fields create ionic flux and electric energy, which calm the small
nerves made hyperactive by disease. But that theory, he
acknowledged, remains to be proven.

 &HT;    Voting method unclear
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They don't know the procedure for voting or even if
they are going to have a fair opportunity to vote, but between 200
and 300 NBA players will be here today, hoping to decide whether to
salvage their season before the league threatens to kill it on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA on Tuesday authorized its teams to get out the vote, and
Hawks president Stan Kasten said that most Hawks players and free
agents will be here today. Three _ Dikembe Mutombo, Steve Smith and
Tyrone Corbin _ sit on the 19-member executive committee, which
recommends turning down the league's final offer.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, nearly 24 hours after union executive
director Billy Hunter announced a vote open to the 411 players
association members, it was determined that the players will meet
at a Fifth Avenue address at 1 p.m. today. The committee apparently
will determine voting methodology this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Some players who want a secret ballot say they have a growing
distrust of the process. In fact, it is unusual that there is even
a vote at all, according to lawyer Greg Hare.
</P>
<P>
   Hare, a specialist in labor law and a basketball fan, said
Tuesday, ``A union can treat its members any way it chooses. They
don't even have to have the vote. In most unions, it's impossible
to have a membership vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare says the union actually is making a public-relations
gesture _ ``an extension of good faith, because they realize there
are more midlevel and marginal players who can't afford to sit out.
They're basically doing them a favor. This way (union president)
Patrick Ewing and his pals can make them feel they are being
treated fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and Detroit's Joe Dumars and
Grant Hill reportedly headed here and in favor of playing, the
outcome might depend on which clique of top players can dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Hare predicted the meeting will be scripted and held behind
closed doors. ``You may have leaders say, `Anybody who wants to go
against our leadership and accept the NBA proposal, stand up.' That
would be very difficult to do under the circumstances.''

Vodafone Group, a British wireless company, jumped into the bidding
for San Francisco's AirTouch Communications yesterday, reportedly
topping Bell Atlantic's $45 billion bid for the world's largest
wireless company by $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch said it is ``reviewing the proposal'' from Vodafone and
that it ``could lead to a combination of the two companies.'' The
news sent AirTouch's shares soaring $6.50 to $74.75.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone, which has more than 9.1 million customers, is
Britain's biggest cellular company and the second-largest wireless
worldwide after AirTouch, which has more than 16 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several AirTouch stockholders sued the company
yesterday, saying that Bell Atlantic's reported offer _ about $73
in Bell Atlantic stock for each share of AirTouch _ is too low.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic did not say whether it plans to make a higher
offer, but industry watchers say they expect the Baby Bell to put
up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really crucial for Bell Atlantic,'' said Ira Brodsky,
president of St. Louis' Datacomm Research, which tracks the
wireless industry. ``AirTouch is a really strategic acquisition for
somebody, and I wouldn't be surprised if they get into a bidding
war.''
</P>
<P>
   AirTouch is in demand because of its strong financial position,
large worldwide customer base and its own wireless infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone wants to expand its reach globally, and acquiring
AirTouch would help achieve that goal, analysts said. AirTouch has
more than 4 million customers overseas in countries such as Spain,
Sweden and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   While a Vodafone/AirTouch merger would create a global wireless
powerhouse, the pairing would not help AirTouch expand in the
United States because Vodafone does not operate here.
</P>
<P>
   That's a drawback, analysts said, because AirTouch needs to
expand domestically if it wants to be the nation's biggest wireless
carrier. Right now, AirTouch, with service in 25 states, is the
nation's second-largest after AT&AMP;T Corp. AirTouch operates in the
Bay Area through Cellular One, a joint venture with AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   A pairing with Bell Atlantic would catapult the company to the
No.1 spot domestically. &UR;  &LR; Bell Atlantic wants to merge with AirTouch
so it can offer nationwide wireless service and compete with other
national carriers, such as AT&AMP;T and Sprint PCS.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts said a Bell Atlantic/AirTouch merger would be a
hand-in-glove fit, many agreed that a deal with Vodafone would be
another natural pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a fantastic fit for Vodafone and it would give
them their first wireless presence in United States,'' said Kevin
Roe, an analyst with ABN AMRO. ``Vodafone is AirTouch's mirror
image,'' in terms of strategy and management philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact the two companies are already partners in two
international ventures: Each owns a 30 percent interest in Egyptian
mobile operator Click GSM; and in Sweden, AirTouch has a 51.1
percent interest in Europolitan and Vodafone owns 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would make sense,'' said Susan Passoni, an analyst with
SG Cowen and Co. ``The broad, international footprint that Vodafone
has would only be further complemented by AirTouch's footprint. It
would be a pan-European as well as a global carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal could also be better for AirTouch's 13,000 employees,
about 1,000 of whom work in the Bay Area. Some industry watchers
said Bell Atlantic, which is also acquiring GTE Corp., would most
likely reduce its combined staff after the mergers to eliminate
overlap among the three companies. Since Vodafone has no U.S.
operations, there would be less &UR;  &LR; overlapping staff to get rid of,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts are bullish on Vodafone, the wireless carrier has
taken a drubbing in recent months by the British press for dropped
calls and poor reception on its network. Articles in the British
media have blamed the poor call quality on Vodafone's aggressive
rollout, saying the company's network is unable to handle the
demand. Vodafone has recently begun issuing refunds to frustrated
consumers who have trouble using their phones.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bell Atlantic will counter Vodafone's bid depends on how
committed the firm is to being a national player, Passoni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one AirTouch out there. The question becomes how
important Bell Atlantic thinks being global is to the long-term
strategy of the company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the industry say Bell Atlantic's reported $45 billion
offer is too low for AirTouch, but Jeffrey Hines, an analyst with
BT Alex. Brown, questioned whether the company would pay more
because it could dilute its earnings for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   While no details of the discussions have emerged, some observers
are speculating that AirTouch might try sell its U.S. operations to
Bell Atlantic and its foreign business to Vodafone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to see the synergies between AirTouch and Vodafone
in the U.S. and I wouldn't be surprised if the answer is to split
the company into two,'' Hines said.
</P>
<P>
   But Vodafone, which held talks with AirTouch in 1997 to buy its
European assets, says it now wants the whole package. And sources
close to Bell Atlantic said the company is not interested in buying
just a piece of AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   The transatlantic bidding war boosted both suitors' stock.
Vodafone shares rose $1.42 to $17.30. Bell Atlantic rose $2.94 to
$54.88.

 &HT;    Some NBA players ready to work on owners' terms
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Clustered in the training room at Life University,
dressed in sweats and jackets, they were basketball players in
search of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the gym was closed because freshmen were undergoing
orientation. Downstairs, Ivano Newbill borrowed a cell phone and
started calling around for a place to play. And while Newbill
dialed, players talked.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim, the 1996-97 NBA Rookie of the Year and
Newbill's Vancouver teammate last season; Orlando free agent
Darrell Armstrong; the Hawks' Mookie Blaylock; Toronto's Kevin
Willis; and rookie Matt Harpring from Georgia Tech all have more at
stake today than a little scrimmage in the gym. Their professional
season is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The majority sentiment among them Tuesday morning was to fly to
New York and vote today along with the rest of the league's players
on whether to play this season. Although Harpring has no vote
because he has not yet signed a contract with Orlando, they all are
willing to go back to work on the owners' terms.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Tuesday
that 150 players _ including Hakeem Olajuwon, Isaac Austin, Charles
Oakley, Voshon Lenard, Carlos Rogers, Luc Longley and the entire
squad of the Western Conference champion Utah Jazz _ have told
members of the players union's executive committee, or others in a
position to pass along the word, that they want to vote on the
offer from league management. It was not clear how many would
accept the owners' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The move to force a vote picked up support on the executive
committee, which until now was going to vote for all players.
Committee member Juwan Howard of Washington is believed to be one
of the players pushing the union to allow a vote. Milwaukee's
Michael Curry reportedly is the player compiling a list of players
headed to New York to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether a simple majority will express the
sentiments of Orlando's Nick Anderson, who said Tuesday, ``I'm
voting to play. This has gone on long enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong agreed. ``I'm going to vote to play,'' he said while
waiting at Life. ``But I think a lot depends on how the vote is
handled.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong related a late-night conversation with committee
member Danny Schayes, his Orlando teammate. ``Danny said if it's a
secret ballot, it's going to go one way,'' said Armstrong, meaning
that the owners' offer would be accepted. ``But if it's an open
vote, he doesn't know how it's going to turn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdur-Rahim said he was ready to play in November but he is of
two minds now. ``I want to get started. I don't want to lose the
whole season,'' said the 22-year-old from Marietta. ``The reason I
left school (after his freshman year at California) was to take
care of my family. I don't want to see this season just wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, I think the deal could be a little better
for guys like me, so that's got me thinking. But I'll probably vote
to play, because that's what I really want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong was of like mind. ``It could be a little better, but I
think we can live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Newbill, a former Georgia Tech player, the issue is a
no-brainer. ``I want to play,'' he said. ``I can't see the sense of
missing the whole year. I know this is a good deal for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, Newbill said he could not afford to go to New
York to cast his ballot. But he had changed his mind by Tuesday.
``I talked it over with my wife, and we decided I could not afford
to stay home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blaylock, however, was in no mood to go to New York. He said he
intended to stay home and telephone in his vote. ``They better take
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, as of Tuesday afternoon, the league had no mechanism in
place that would accept absentee ballots, and it appeared that
Blaylock might be disenfranchised by remaining at home. Still,
Blaylock could change his mind and fly to New York for the same
reason he showed up at Life looking for a pick-up game Tuesday: He
wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   At the Concourse Athletic Club, the six players' perseverance
paid off; Newbill found an open court. The question is whether the
players will be able to find an NBA court after they vote today.

UCLA'S DAVIS RETURNS TO FORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, he stumbled and flailed and clanked shots off
the bottom of the rim. But lately, the jet has returned to Baron
Davis' step.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly overnight, Davis has regained the strength and
confidence in his surgically reconstructed left knee. As a result,
he's blowing past and jumping over befuddled opponents like the
Davis of old. He elevates, he hangs, he dunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better as far as getting into the lane and
jumping over people,'' said Davis, a sophomore guard. ``Two weeks
ago, I didn't have the confidence I do now. Each game, each
practice, I get more confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also helps that I'm in better shape. I'm about 204 (pounds)
now. A few weeks ago, I was 217.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' return to form began two nights before Christmas, when he
made 5 of 9 shots in 27 minutes in UCLA's sluggish victory over
American. He had 13 points and six assists against Loyola Marymount
on Dec. 29, then played one of the best games of his career
Saturday, carving up Arizona with 20 points and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loyola Marymount and Arizona are two of the best games he's
played in terms of complete games, with leadership, maturity and
decision-making,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said. ``Overall, his
stops and starts, his change-of-direction, explosion and confidence
(are returning). He seems to have pushed through. He's not as
cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   A pain in the foot: Guard Earl Watson probably will play
Thursday at Oregon State despite a bruised right foot that has
plagued him for weeks. X-rays taken before Christmas were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to heal on its own, and the only treatment I can get is
to sit out,'' Watson said. ``That's something I don't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps UCLA's fiercest competitor, Watson played 44 minutes
Monday against Arizona State and was in so much pain Lavin thought
he was crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not hold him out, I'd love to taper off his minutes,''
Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins have a comfortable lead over either Oregon State
or Oregon, watch for Lavin to give Watson a rest. With Davis'
recovery and the improved play of Ryan Railey and Ray Young, Lavin
has more backcourt depth than he did when Watson got hurt last
month.
</P>
<P>
   A big in-flu-ence: Freshman guard Ray Young played longer and
better against Arizona State than he has all season, with 11 points
and four rebounds in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Young attributed his improved play to improved health. He had
the flu over Christmas and was unable to practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really excited to get so many minutes,'' he said. ``I
had a chance to play, and I just went after it. It was really the
first game I've felt totally well since before Christmas.''

 CHRON - BOFA  
 OLD BOFA STAFF TO GET LESS FROM NEW STOCK PLAN  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The new BankAmerica has introduced an employee stock option program
that raises benefits for NationsBank staff members while cutting
benefits for employees at the old BofA.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's NationsBank, which bought San Francisco's BofA
three months ago and took its name, launched the new version of the
``Take Ownership! &LR; '' program Monday by handing out options to more
than 150,000 full- and part-time employees around the world.
</P>
<P>
   For NationsBank employees, the program is a valuable new benefit
potentially worth thousands of dollars, since the North Carolina
bank didn't award options on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   But for those from the old BofA, the new program provides 41
percent fewer options than they would have gotten under the old
plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the new program, employees are getting from 400 to 720
options to buy shares of the new BankAmerica over the next three
years, depending on their rank. That compares with the 678 to 1,224
options the old BofA would have awarded over three years, after
taking into account the conversion of the bank's shares to
NationsBank stock.
</P>
<P>
   Options vary in value, but experts said the stock prices and
growth prospects of the old BofA and the new bank are close enough
that the values of their options are comparable.
</P>
<P>
   The old BofA's plan was ``one of the more generous,'' said Corey
Rosen, executive director of the National Center for Employee
Ownership, an Oakland group promoting employee stock options
programs.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank's cutbacks put grant levels at a more typical level
for big companies that have such programs, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   A NationsBank spokeswoman said she didn't know how the bank set
award levels. She described the plan as ``one of the broadest
programs around, based on the size of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies give high-ranking employees stock options to give
them a stake in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Programs such as BofA's, which hand out options to rank-and-file
employees on a regular schedule, are less common. Only about 7
million people nationwide work for companies that award options to
almost all employees, Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   Options give holders the right to buy stock at a preset price.
Their value increases if a company's stock rises.
</P>
<P>
   The new bank's first installment under the redesigned plan
awarded from 200 to 360 options. These can be used to buy
BankAmerica shares at $60.50, the stock's closing market price on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two years, the bank will grant two more awards of
100 to 180 options, half the level of the first installment.
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter of the options will become eligible to be exercised
a year after they are granted, another quarter in two years and the
rest in three years. All options expire five years after they are
granted.

</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - STREET SMARTS   Why Suze? Why All the Hype? Orman's Publicist Goes on the 
 Defense 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Suze Orman may know the way to financial freedom, but she doesn't
know how many years she spent working for Wall Street firms. Before
the holidays, this column spotlighted a hard-hitting article in
Forbes magazine about the best-selling East Bay financial advice
author.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Forbes piece questioned a number of Orman's claims
about her business, Suze Orman Financial Group of Emeryville, and
Orman's representations about her credentials. In general, Forbes
found misleading information in everything from her biography to
marketing materials.
</P>
<P>
   Several Chronicle readers, who apparently are loyal Orman fans,
objected to the column item. (Orman's publicist's best defense _
which was pretty lame in my opinion _ was to attack my presentation
of the facts as reported in Forbes. So, I suggest that &UR;  &LR; you read
the magazine piece that ran in the December 28 edition
for &UR;  &LR; yourself. But more on that later.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's the crux of the matter. Forbes unequivocally stands by
its article. ``We have absolutely no intention to retract any part
of the story,'' says Forbes spokesman Ray Healey.
</P>
<P>
   No problem there. So, where's the rub? As a desperation measure,
Orman's flack has opted to defend her client by attacking me for
not reprinting the Forbes piece verbatim. You see, I used the word
``lie,'' which Forbes didn't use and apparently her client didn't
like.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here are some facts: Orman's company and the public
relations firm it employs were called by me before it ran. And the
first rule of journalism is: If you want your side told, you have
to return reporters' telephone calls. But alas, no callback.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in response to some reader angst about the column, I
again contacted Orman's firm and her New York publicist, Sandi
Mendelson, immediately after the column ran. After all, if Forbes
was inaccurate, I wanted to set the record straight. On Wednesday,
December 6, Orman's publicist said that  &LR; a written response to the
Forbes piece and the Street Smarts column would be sent by
facsimile to The Chronicle that day. However, no fax was ever sent.
They blew me off. Twice.
</P>
<P>
   In what was becoming an extraordinary effort to be fair, I
placed more telephone calls over several days to Orman Financial
and the publicist, asking for either an interview with Orman or an
official response. If Orman didn't fudge about her years on Wall
Street or didn't let her commodity-trading adviser license lapse,
surely we could straighten all of this out, right?
</P>
<P>
   Still, no answer. Nada. On December 17, I called yet again.
Finally, literally on deadline, a woman who identified herself as
Orman's ``consultant'' called me to talk ``off the record'' about
the column. What she ended up doing was bashing the Forbes piece
and my column but not for publication. More importantly, she
offered no official retort to allegations made by veteran Forbes
writer William Barrett. I have to say, it was an incredibly
unprofessional attempt at spinning. And I've been spun by the worst
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody loves Suze. So if Orman needed to set something
straight, why not just talk on the record? Either Forbes was right
or it was wrong. I asked the consultant to have somebody, Orman or
whomever she chose to speak for her, call me back on the record.
</P>
<P>
   Once again. No callback. (I was on vacation for two weeks, but
there were no messages left.) Finally, after placing calls
yesterday to Orman Financial and Mendelson, I received a fax from
the publicist.
</P>
<P>
   And with only one exception, the written statement does little
to disprove any facts presented by Forbes. Chalk one up for Barrett
and the magazine's fact-checkers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after nearly four weeks, the best defense Mendelson could
muster was that my column was ``full of inaccuracies and
manipulations of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   I would call it splitting hairs. But you decide for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Street Smarts stated: Orman calls her company ``a financial
planning firm. (But) despite that claim, Forbes contends that she
doesn't perform financial planning work any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of STREET06 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Forbes said: ``Neither she nor the firm has done any paid
financial planning work in years.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Orman's response via Mendelson: ``It is true that she had not done
any paid planning work in the past couple of years ... (but Orman
offers) her services without charge to more than 3,000 individuals
who have contacted her with financial inquiries. ... The definition
of doing business cannot be based solely on the amount of paid
services one does.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Let me get this straight. She writes letters and e-mails to
readers and calls them clients. She doesn't charge them, but it's
still supposed to be called a business. And you really want to seek
financial advice from this person? (In fact, Forbes' Healey says
its investigative reporter was first alerted to Orman's
self-promoting ways after reading her ``outrageous claims'' about
new clients.)
</P>
<P>
   Well, now we know. Her clients are pen pals. Of course, the bulk
of Orman's revenues come from selling books and tapes, which led to
another of Mendelson's bones to pick.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Street Smarts said: ``Her primary strength is selling insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said: ``Orman's earned income has come mainly from
selling insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Orman's response: ``That statement is ludicrous ... the amount of
money Suze Orman made to date in 1998 from insurance sales was
$28,178. In 1997, that figure was $54,819.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. Fine. That's about $82,000 more that she earned from selling
insurance than she gained from financial planning fees. What's
more, we still don't know how much her company earned from
insurance sales. It would be interesting to know, but Mendelson has
yet to answer any questions in four weeks. Suffice it to say, Suze
sells a little insurance on the side. And as for my interpretation
of the Forbes' text, you tell me whether I was ``distorting'' facts
from the article.
</P>
<P>
   In case you were wondering, the actual number of years that
Orman worked at major Wall Street firms was seven _ not 18 as her
video jacket states. And yes, Orman's commodity-trading adviser
license lapsed in 1990 despite a book-jacket biography that states
it is current. But Mendelson says the publisher, Crown Books, put
the bogus information on the flap without Orman's knowledge. Hey,
that's the kind of attention to detail I look for in a financial
adviser _ even a free one.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Blame the publisher. Shoot the messenger. What's the difference.
But heck, don't listen to me. I could have it all wrong.

A new software program that runs Sony PlayStation games on
late-model Apple Macintosh computers drew large, enthusiastic
crowds at Macworld yesterday, but no one was more excited than
11-year-old Justin Berman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' said the Southern California boy, who was beaming
while his mother waited in line at Macworld to buy the new product
_ Virtual Game Station from Connectix Corp. of San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go out and buy some new PlayStation games,'' said
Justin, who received a Nintendo 64 for Christmas but doesn't own a
PlayStation.
</P>
<P>
   Mac fans began snapping up the new $39 Virtual Game Station
faster than you could say Crash Bandicoot after Apple interim CEO
Steve Jobs announced the product during his morning keynote speech.
</P>
<P>
   The news heartened Apple loyalists, who believe Virtual Game
Station will help fill a void that stands in the way of long-term
success for the Cupertino company. In recent years, most software
developers stopped writing game software for the Mac, opting
instead for the much-larger Windows market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can do more for Apple than the iMac itself,'' said
Oakland computer consultant William Sequeira, after buying a copy
for himself. ``It's a huge breakthrough for the Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Sony, there are about 500 PlayStation titles
available.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Virtual Game Station will only play about 80,
including popular titles like Crash Bandicoot, Madden NFL 97 and
Tomb Raider on the Mac. Connectix has posted a list of them at
 &LR; www.virtualgamestation.com, &LR;  and is working on making more titles
available.
</P>
<P>
   There are other limitations. Some of the games occasionally skip
video frames, although Connectix says only hard-core gamers will
notice. And the software requires an iMac or Power Macintosh G3. It
won't run on older Macs or ones that have a G3 upgrade card.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the program is only available at Macworld, and Connectix
officials don't know when they will start shipping to retail
stores.
</P>
<P>
   And Sony, which has not authorized or endorsed Virtual Game
Station, could mount a legal challenge. Connectix officials said
they did not need to license the product from Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Computer Entertainment America, based in Foster City, had
no comment on Virtual Game Station.
</P>
<P>
   But James Staten, a game industry analyst with Dataquest of San
Jose, said he would be surprised if a licensing controversy did not
arise. Gamemakers in general hate similar software available free
on the Internet to simulate old game platforms such as Atari on a
Mac or PC, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Sony, which makes the bulk of its profit from
PlayStation games and not the $129 console, could see the product
as a way to boost game sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Sony has sold more than 50 million PlayStation consoles
worldwide, making it the biggest-selling game platform of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Connectix developed the Virtual Game Station in the last six
months by building on technology used in its Virtual PC, emulation
software that allows Windows programs to run on a Macintosh, said
Jonathan Garber, Connectix co-founder and chief technology officer.
</P>
<P>
   Connectix is also working on a Virtual Game Station for
Windows-based PCs, but the technology is more complicated because
it's less uniform than the Mac, Garber said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kao of South Pasadena was so excited about Virtual Game
Station he bought two copies, one for a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty cool,'' Kao said. ``With one box (a Macintosh) you
can do everything. It can free up your TV, too.''

HENRY PAOLUCCI, 77, SCHOLAR AND A LEADER IN CONSERVATIVE PARTY
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Henry Paolucci, a prolific scholar of classical
politics and literature, professor emeritus of government and
politics at St. John's University and vice chairman of the New York
Conservative Party for the last 20 years, died on Jan. 1 at New
York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. He was 77 and a resident of
Beechhurst, N.Y., in Queens County.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from prostate cancer, said John
Hamill, a spokesman for the City University, where his wife, Dr.
Anne Attura Paolucci, heads the board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Paolucci taught comparative literature as well as ancient Greek
and Roman history at Iona College, Brooklyn College and City
College before he joined the St. John's faculty in 1967. He was
American correspondent for Il Borghese of Italy and contributed to
the Encyclopedia Americana and to national magazines and dailies,
including the Op-Ed page of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   He was the founding president of the Walter Bagehot Council on
National Sovereignty. Its affiliate, the Council of National
Literatures, published his studies on subjects from Aristotle and
Dante to Southern political history and Dr. Henry A. Kissinger's
persona and policies. Many of them remain in print.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife as collaborator, he did a translation of
Machiavelli's ``Mandragola'' (Macmillan, 1957), which is in its
32nd printing. He also wrote the introduction to his translation of
``Beccaria: On Crimes and Punishment'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1963).
</P>
<P>
   Paolucci, a Bronx native, graduated from City College in 1942.
In World War II, he was a navigator in the Army Air Forces in
Africa and Italy, where he spent a year as a prisoner of war. He
completed his education at Columbia University with an M.A. degree
in 1948 and a Ph.D. in 1961 and also studied at the University of
Florence and the University of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, Paolucci was persuaded to run as the Conservative
candidate for Senate against Sen. Kenneth B. Keating, a Republican,
and Robert F. Kennedy, who won the seat for the Democrats. Paolucci
was named vice chairman of the Conservative Party two years later.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from St. John's in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, he is survived by two sisters, Lucille Gorton
of Stamford, Conn., and Phyllis Albano of Queens.

   IRAQ-ARABS (Cairo, Egypt) _ A bitter war of words between Iraq
and its Arab neighbors has followed last month's American-led

Persian Gulf war. As Iraq has accused the Arabs of failing to stand
by its side, Egypt has responded with particular scorn, all but
calling for the ouster of the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. The

temperature plunges to 40 below, and delays in getting wages are
measured in years. It is the edge of the world and the end of the
line for thousands of Russians drawn here during Soviet times by
promises of high pay and patriotic appeals. The colonization of the
north was one of the Soviet Union's most audacious ventures. Now
the dismal economics of the north has finally caught up with these
far-flung regions. Russia's new market economy cannot bear the

illnesses from smoking. The suit is considered potentially

distribution'' of guns, rather than charging liability on the basis

The relief, which calls for farmers who claim they were harmed by
discrimination to receive $50,000 tax-free and to be forgiven their
federal debt, is too little, they said, and it has come too late.

U.N. REJECTS IRAQI REQUEST TO REPLACE RELIEF WORKERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations on Tuesday rejected Iraq's
request that American and British relief workers be replaced,
saying that only it could make decisions about its workers there.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen U.N. staff members _ 13 Britons and one American _ were
on an Iraqi list sent to the organization on Monday along with a
note saying that anger over American and British air strikes had
created a hostile environment that threatened their safety. But the
Iraqis inexplicably left three other Americans off the list, one of
them the secretary to Prakash Shah, Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
special envoy.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has more than 400 civilian employees in Iraq,
working in the ``oil for food'' relief program and in de-mining,
among other projects.
</P>
<P>
   A British diplomat, Peter Eldon, told reporters Tuesday morning
after the Security Council was briefed on the Iraqi request that
the organization would tell Iraq in a letter on Tuesday ``that it
was for the United Nations to determine who works for its program
in Iraq, not Iraq.''

 CHRON - IPO  
 SECRETS OF IPO SUCCESS  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Making the leap from a privately owned business to a publicly
traded corporation is a bit like jumping from a college squad to
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   A lot more people are watching and the stakes are a lot higher
if you fumble. The quarterbacks of several local companies that
launched successful initial public offerings last year offered
advice to The Chronicle to help other chief executives who are
thinking of going public.
</P>
<P>
   Topping their list of lessons are the ability to maintain both a
dream and discipline, meet financial projections and deal with the
public and investors as well as customers and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you are in the public fishbowl, you have to deliver
results with microscopic precision,'' said David Peterschmidt,
chairman, president and CEO of Inktomi Corp., the San Mateo
Internet search engine company that was second-best IPO performer
last year. ``As a public company, you have to set proper
expectations and deliver exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a company backed by venture capital might miss its
sales and profit targets by 5, 10 or even 20 percent, according to
Peterschmidt, and still suffer no major negative consequences as
long as the company ``has forward momentum, designs and completes
its products on time and wins some big contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   By many measures Inktomi and other Internet companies in their
rookie stock market seasons are still small companies.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, for example, has 250 employees, up from 88 when it went
public in June. Although it doesn't expect to turn a profit until
the first half of the year 2000, it has a market value of more than
$3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many other company founders, the professor and graduate
student who founded Inktomi recognized early on they lacked the
managerial experience to build Inktomi and take it public. Two
years ago they recruited Peterschmidt, who previously was chief
operating officer at Sybase with experience at several other public
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The co-founders of San Francisco's Xoom.com, which provides more
than 5 million members free e-mail and other services on the
Internet and then sells them products, also believe firmly in
``making your (sales) numbers.'' But Chairman Chris Kitze and
President and CEO Laurent Massa did not have to recruit an
executive from a public company, since both had previously worked
for several such companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors want to know you are familiar with public markets,''
said Massa. Xoom.com, the best-performing local IPO in the past
quarter, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go
public on August 28, just before the stock markets crashed. Xoom
pushed ahead with its offering, while many other startups stayed on
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The company is grateful to its lead underwriter Bear Stearns for
sticking with it. But Massa warns, ``Investment bankers in general
are not your friends. They look at your company as another deal and
are basically gatekeepers.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes it important to establish personal relationships with
the bankers and analysts who will follow your company and maintain
a market for its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies are happy to get financial backing and management
advice from venture capital firms. But Kitze says Xoom.com
preferred to raise less than $10 million from about 85 private
investors. Not only did these ``super angels'' require less
financial control, Kitze said this savvy support group provided
more ``feet on the street'' and expert advice than a VC firm.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Greer, CEO of Abgenix, a Fremont bio-pharmaceutical
company that went public last July, suggests one way to prepare
oneself for life as a public company is to start out as a unit of a
larger publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case at Abgenix, which was spun off by Cell
Genesys. Greer says that one of the greatest challenges ``is
getting investor attention.'' And Abgenix got useful training in
investor and public relations from its previous parent.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Gordon, CEO of Restoration Hardware in Corte Madera, is
not your stereotypical chief of a public company. He has an M.A. in
counseling psychology rather than an MBA and never worked at a
public company. In fact, he founded Restoration Hardware, which now
has 65 stores and 1,250 employees, because he was unable to find
the right fittings and fixtures when he was remodeling a Victorian
bed &AMP; breakfast in Eureka 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My business grew so slowly I was able to get grounded over
time,'' said Gordon. He recommends ``trusting your intuition,
keeping your passion and strict adherence to quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has learned to manage the old-fashioned way, by wearing
lots of different hats, said Michael Lazarus, managing director of
Weston Presidio Capital, one of the venture firms that invested in
Restoration. To make it as head of a public company, Lazarus adds,
``you need to be what I call a dysfunctional dictator _ someone who
has vision, fanatical discipline and focus and a feeling they can't
fail.''
</P>
<P>
   BancBoston Robertson Stephens managing director Chip Vedder
suggests that companies interested in going public should not let
the current market be their guide. In other words, don't try to
launch an Internet company simply because such companies have high
valuations and are currently Wall Street's darlings.
</P>
<P>
   To be successful, he says, companies need to spot a large and
growing market opportunity, have a leadership position in that
marketplace, have some barriers to entry like a technological or
marketing edge or strategic relationship and a management team able
to execute that strategy.

   LITTLE FALLS, N.J. _ Let the record show that a celebrated
grudge held for nearly 14 years was dropped here a few minutes
after 5 p.m. Tuesday when a contrite George Steinbrenner arrived at
Yogi Berra's doorstep and thanked the self-exiled Yankee great for
the opportunity to make this day necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' principal owner traveled from his home in Tampa,
Fla., to the museum named for Berra on the campus of Montclair
State University to apologize, finally, for firing Berra as the
team's manager 16 games into the 1985 season. The news of Berra's
dismissal was delivered by Clyde King, another member of
Steinbrenner's organization, and Berra vowed after never to again
set foot in Yankee Stadium as long as Steinbrenner owned the team.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening, Steinbrenner walked up to the front entrance
of the museum, where Berra awaited him with his hand outstretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Yogi,'' Steinbrenner said, cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're 10 minutes late,'' Berra quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The man known as the Boss and the Hall of Fame catcher then
ducked into a small office, accompanied by Berra's wife, Carmen.
According to Mrs. Berra, Steinbrenner took Berra's hand, looked him
in the eye and said, ``I know I made a mistake by not letting you
go personally. It's the worst mistake I ever made in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Berra replied, ``I made a lot of mistakes in baseball, too.''
Then he gave Steinbrenner a tour of his museum, which formally
opened last month, and coyly said he would strongly consider
returning to the Stadium sometime next season, possibly on opening
day or Old Timers Day, which is later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him what he needed to do,'' Berra said. ``He
apologized. We'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could get Yogi to come back,'' said Steinbrenner, warming
to the occasion, ``I'd bring him over with a rickshaw across the
George Washington Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming feeling was that Berra would now go back.
``Fourteen years, it was time,'' said Suzyn Waldman, the WFAN radio
host who is close to Steinbrenner and helped arrange the meeting
and a subsequent interview for a live show at the museum Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last summer that Steinbrenner buried another hatchet
with a long-absent member of the Yankee family. After reading an
emotional appeal by Jim Bouton's son in the New York Times,
Steinbrenner invited the banished former pitcher and author of
``Ball Four'' for Old Timers Day. Steinbrenner also sobbed on
national television as the Yankees celebrated their World Series
sweep of the San Diego Padres. This uncharacteristic display of
emotion from a man more know for his bombast coincided with reports
that Steinbrenner was about to sell the Yankees to Cablevision, a
deal that has since stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Berra said she believed Steinbrenner's visit had nothing
to do with business and everything to do with a clear conscience.
``With the year 2000 coming, everyone is thinking about the future,
about peace, about making things right,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, Steinbrenner admitted that the death of
Mickey Mantle in 1996 and the near-loss of Joe DiMaggio last month
made him feel a sense of urgency in making amends. ``There was a
missing piece,'' he said, to the recent record-setting, 125-victory
Yankees' season, and it was Berra. ``He's got to forgive me and
come back,'' he told Carmen Berra in a private moment, perhaps with
the thought that Berra return to help raise the team's championship
banner on opening day next spring, and make 1998 complete.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Berra, one of Berra's sons and a former Yankee himself,
said his father was initially reluctant when he learned that
Steinbrenner had expressed an eagerness to accept Ms. Waldman's
offer. For one thing, Dale Berra said, ``my dad never felt like he
wasn't a part of the Yankee family, and would never have wanted to
go back to the Stadium just for a standing ovation.''
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, appearing with Steinbrenner on live radio
after 14 years of refusing his second-hand invitations to return
had all the trappings of a news media circus, making their meeting
seem more on Steinbrenner's terms, while on Berra's turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You've got to do what you've got to do,' `` Dale
Berra said. ``But 14 years is long enough, the most you can get out
of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Berra, surprisingly, seemed to enjoy the public nature of event,
often tweaking Steinbrenner. He praised the Yankees' current
managerial staff and told Steinbrenner not to interfere or he
wouldn't show up for another 14 years. But mostly, he enjoyed
hosting Steinbrenner, ushering him around the museum. ``He's very
proud of this,'' Carmen Berra said.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping in front of a blowup of Berra throwing away the
catcher's mask in front of home plate in a World Series game
against the Brooklyn Dodgers, Berra explained to Steinbrenner the
art of catching a knuckle ball. By a old photo of legendary Yankees
DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig and Tommy Henrich, Steinbrenner told Berra how
Henrich's restaurant in Columbus, Ohio had been turned into the
first Wendy's franchise. Near a display for Larry Doby, another
Montclair resident and Hall of Famer who was the first
African-American to play in the American League, Steinbrenner told
Berra how much he admired Doby when he played in Cleveland,
Steinbrenner's home town.
</P>
<P>
   The more the anxiety waned, the more the stories flowed. On Ms.
Waldman's show, Berra's childhood friend from St. Louis, Joe
Garagiola, called in, as did the great Ted Williams, who has his
own museum in Hernando, Fla. Next month, Berra will be inducted
into the Williams museum's Hitters Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   As Steinbrenner was leaving, Berra asked him if he would attend
the ceremony. Steinbrenner said he would be honored. Though this
was the house that Berra built and he, at 74, is six years older
than Steinbrenner, he seemed like the wandering son returning to a
paternal embrace, when the two men hugged at the door, and said
goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, clutching a copy of Berra's latest book of
original ``Yogisms'' and a Berra Museum shirt, said, ``I'll talk to
you soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The door closed. Berra, who coined the expression ``It's not
over till it's over, turned back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourteen years,'' he said. ``It's over.''

 CHRON - IPO YEAR  
 INTERNET FIRMS TOPPED IPO LIST IN '98  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was another big year for initial public offerings but no
bonanza unless you happened to be _ or buy _ an Internet star.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, there were 379 IPOs last year and the average gain
was 20 percent, compared with 524 new issues in 1997 and an average
gain of 24.3 percent. As usual, the Northern California crop of
newly minted public companies did better.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, 41 companies went public in 1998 compared with 46 the
previous year. Buoyed by enthusiasm for about anything with ``e''
at the beginning of the name, the Northern California issues had an
average gain of 90 percent according to IPO Monitor of Calabasas
(Los Angeles County).
</P>
<P>
   The local and national winner was eBay. The San Jose online
auction company went public in September at $18 and closed the year
at $241.25 for a 1,240 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, the San Mateo online search-engine developer was the
next best-performing U.S. IPO. Since June, it soared more than 600
percent from $18 to $129.38. The third-ranking IPO was another
online auction outfit, uBid of Elk Grove, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 U.S. IPOs all were Internet-related, including
fifth-place Exodus Communications, a Santa Clara network management
company, and seventh-place VeriSign, a Mountain View specialist in
securing  &LR; secure online communications.
</P>
<P>
   The best-performing local IPO in the fourth quarter was San
Francisco's Xoom.com, which offers free services and sells products
online. It went public December 9 and zoomed from $14 to $33 in
only 16 trading days.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed last year, it helped to be high tech. But it wasn't
essential. Brisbane's Bebe Stores, which sells women's apparel at
88 of its own stores, was the 11th-best U.S. IPO, zipping from $11
to $35.38
</P>
<P>
   The top-performing IPOs and their average gains, however, don't
tell the whole story. If you missed the top eight deals but
invested an equal sum in all the others, you would have made
exactly nothing at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, investing in IPOs can be dangerous to your
wealth. Unless you catch a few top deals, you are likely to make
less money than if you had invested in stock market indexes like
the S&AMP;P 500, which gained 26 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Also keep in mind that gains are figured from the offering price
and that most individual investors don't get a chance to buy shares
at this pretrading price unless they are important clients of one
of the underwriting firms.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 25 local companies that went public gained value and 15
lost ground. The biggest losers were Aspec Technology, a Sunnyvale
chip design company that slumped from $13 to $2, and Symphonix
Devices, a San Jose maker of implantable hearing aids, which sank
from $12 to $4.12.
</P>
<P>
   Like the weather, 1998 was a hot and cold year for IPOs
nationally. It started off averaging 48 offerings per month in the
first half _ on pace to break the 1996 all-time record. Then, as
investors grew wary of smaller stocks and Asia's economic flu, the
IPO market went icy. There were only five new issues in September
and nine in November before the market began warming up again with
41 U.S. IPOs in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, 26 companies went public in the first
half but only 15 since July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hit hardest were companies backed by venture capital firms.
Across the country, only 77 of these companies went public last
year compared with 135 in 1997, according to VentureOne Corp. The
market for new issues, especially risky high-tech ventures backed
by venture capital firms and their institutional investors, is
``like the canary in the coal mine,'' said Chip Vedder, head of
corporate finance from BancBoston Robertson Stephens. ``It is the
first to expire when the air gets bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers and Robertson Stephens were
the leading venture capital investors, according to Venture
Economics. Each backed six companies that went public in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies hope to keep their sizzling streak alive this
year. Fourteen U.S. Internet companies have filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to issue initial or secondary
stock offerings, according to Securities Data Corp. Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Planned IPOs include the Prodigy Communications and iVillage, as
well as several online units of publicly traded companies.
Ziff-Davis plans to spin off its ZDNet subsidiary. Barnes &AMP; Noble
plans to launch its online bookselling arm, and Hayward's Data
Broadcasting Corp. expects to sell its Marketwatch.com online
financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Internet stocks have remained hot is that the
demand by individual investors far exceeds the slim supply of
shares. In eBay's case, the stock ended the year selling at nearly
200 times annualized revenues and more than 2,000 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   However, the supply of eBay stock could change dramatically as
``lock up'' provisions, which prevent executives and other insiders
from selling shares for defined periods after an IPO, are removed.
Only 15 percent of eBay's 40 million shares currently are held by
the public, but starting January 24, company insiders will be able
to sell much of their stock if they so choose.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks are not the only ones that are generating
interest. ``There's a strong backlog of deals including networking
and communications, multimedia, semiconductors and the life
sciences,'' Vedder said.
</P>
<P>
   About the only area where last year exceeded 1997 was in dollars
raised. Thanks to some blockbuster deals, U.S. companies raised
$33.4 billion in their IPOs last year, compared with $29.6 billion
in 1997. Conoco raised $4.4 billion in the largest offering,
followed by Infinity Broadcasting and Fox Entertainment, which
raised $2.8 billion each.

 &HT;    Speedy new Macs make colorful debut
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Steve Jobs made a fashion statement at Macworld
Expo on Tuesday, introducing four new colors of iMac computers.
</P>
<P>
   The bright colors make sure that Apple's computers are noticed
in a computer world where beige is as dominant on the outside of
computers as Intel Corp. processors and Microsoft Corp. software
are on the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, Apple's interim chief executive, also issued a challenge
of power and price to the Wintel crowd in unveiling a speedy Power
Macintosh for professionals. The PowerMac G3 starts at $1,599 and
tops out at $2,999, signaling Apple's retreat from premium pricing
for high-end computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new PowerMacs are aimed at professionals who require faster
processing and far more memory and storage than the
consumer-oriented iMac.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will jump on the colors, but the most important thing
today was the G3 pricing,'' said Tim Bajarin, president of Creative
Strategies Inc. in Campbell, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The speech before more than 4,000 Macintosh owners lacked the
blockbuster announcements of recent Macworlds. Nor did he address
Apple's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant news at this show is what was not talked
about,'' said Pieter Hartsook, a former Apple vice president. ``The
burning question from a year ago was `When is Apple going to go out
of business?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the iMac's success, powerful new processors, a string of
profitable quarters and a recovered stock price allowed Jobs to
concentrate on what's ahead.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Jobs' only reference to Apple's financial situation
came at the start of his talk when he said the company would
announce its fifth straight profitable quarter on Jan. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest reaction during his speech came when the new color
iMacs were rolled on stage at the Moscone Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The tangerine, strawberry, lime and grape colors plus the
computer's distinctive shape will make them instantly recognizable
as Macs in businesses, classrooms and homes. They also play into
Apple's $100 million ``Think Different'' advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even the slide introducing Jobs identified him as Apple's iCEO.
</P>
<P>
   And after spending most of the morning speech highlighting the
speed, memory and hard-drive storage of the new PowerMac, Jobs
joked that those features are now secondary considerations for
computer shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the most important question when you buy a computer
now is going to be, ``What is your favorite color?','' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the PowerMac, a mini-tower, bears a family resemblance to
the iMac because of its curved shape and translucent blue features.
It has handles for carrying, and one side swings open like an oven
door, providing convenient access to components.
</P>
<P>
   At the high end, the PowerMac will feature up to a 400-megahertz
G3 microprocessor from the PowerPC family and a 200-megahertz
level-two cache. Accessing level-two, or backside, cache at 200
megahertz provides high-speed access to frequently used data.
</P>
<P>
   The machines also come with 128 megabytes of memory and 9
gigabytes of hard drive storage, which can be expanded to three
drives totaling more than 100 gigabytes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering a choice of colors, Apple upgraded the
iMac to a 266-megahertz chip from 233 megahertz. The $1,199 price
tag is $100 lower than the original iMac, which Jobs said sold
800,000 units since its August introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they may have trouble competing with IBM-compatible PCs
running a 333-megahertz AMD processor, which will sell for about
$899 when they are introduced next month, Bajarin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price at the low end is still a bit pricey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs also had good news for game enthusiasts, who have had to
wait months in some cases for popular games to be released for the
Mac platform. A $49 program from Connectix called Virtual
Playstation allows G3 owners to play hundreds of games for Sony
Corp. Playstation.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the huge popularity of iMac, Apple clearly has
momentum starting 1999, Bajarin said. He noted that the company's
worldwide market share is approaching 6 percent, up from 4.2
percent 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   But he cautioned that Apple still faces formidable challenges in
an industry that is dominated by PCs running Pentium-class
processors and Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Offering one perspective on iMac's popularity, Bajarin said more
than 35 million Wintel machines were shipped worldwide in the third
quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still a pretty small player,'' he said.
</P>

 TO SHARE OR NOT TO SHARE
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - GROW   &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My company, which is based in Los Angeles, is considering
opening an office in San Francisco to serve our fast-growing Bay
Area customer base. We only need a small office and wonder if
shared office space is an available and a viable option?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &QL; 
 &LR; A: You're in luck. Several companies provide shared space by the
hour, day, week or month. Look under ``Office'' in the Yellow Pages
and you will find Alliance Business Centers, HQ Business Centers,
InterOffice and several other companies that specialize in serving
businesses that want the temporary use of a full-service office
without the cost or commitment of tying up the space for a long
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you only need a small office or conference room a few times
a month, pay-as-you-go might make sense,'' says Michael Evans,
director of real estate for E&AMP;Y Kenneth Leventhal in San Francisco.
Evans notes that sharing space is often the only way little
companies can get into first-class office buildings that typically
don't like to rent less than 2,000 square feet of floor space.
</P>
<P>
   HQ Business Centers, a pioneer in shared space, has about 200
offices in the United States, including 10 in Northern California,
from Sacramento to Silicon Valley. HQ has a floor in San
Francisco's Embarcadero Center, where offices rent for $20 an hour
or $140 a day. Conference rooms go for $30 an hour or $190 a day,
while suites rent for $700 to $3,300 monthly, depending on size and
view.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance has four locations in San Francisco and 250 offices
worldwide. Like HQ and others, it provides furnished offices,
personalized telephone answering service, fully equipped conference
rooms, receptionists and word-processor and graphic-design
services.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: A lot of big businesses and some small ones have art on the
walls and antiques in the halls. Can owners write these off as
business expenses?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: If what you buy to outfit your office can be described as
furnishings and furniture, you can generally deduct the cost as a
business expense, says Rich Gunn, tax consultant with Burr, Pilger
&AMP; Mayer, a San Francisco accounting firm. But he warns if you buy
it from an art gallery or antique store, then the Internal Revenue
Service considers it ``an appreciating asset,'' unlike other office
furnishings, which generally depreciate in value, and you are not
entitled to any deduction.
</P>
<P>
   That means if you have a Chagall lithograph or a 19th century
credenza in your office, you are out of luck. On the other hand, if
you have a framed velvet image of Elvis Presley on your wall, Gunn
says ``that is unlikely to be considered art and could earn you a
deduction.''
</P>
<P>
   There are special breaks for small businesses. If your company
purchases no more than $200,000 of fixed assets a year, including
fixtures and furnishings, the first $18,000 can be taken as a
dollar-for-dollar expense against taxable income. Note, however,
that this annual allowance cannot be used to create a loss or
increase a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of fixed assets above $18,000 a year can be depreciated
over time. See IRS federal tax form 4562 for the specific schedule.
For office furnishings, the ``double declining balance'' method is
generally favored to write off the cost over seven years, with the
greatest deductions coming in the early years.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy an antique hand-knotted rug and put it on the floor
where people walk on it, you might get away with calling it
carpeting and deducting the cost over time. ``It's a gray area,''
says Gunn. ``It depends on the function. If you put it on the wall,
then it becomes an artwork.''
</P>
<P>
   If you try to get a deduction for anything you describe as art
or an antique, that will likely raise a red flag with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I recently retired from a small business that had a defined
benefit plan and discovered that it had revised the formula by
which it calculated retirement benefits to my detriment. Neither I
nor other employees ever received any written or spoken
communication on this. Can they do this, and what are my rights in
this situation?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: A defined benefit plan is a type of retirement plan designed to
provide a stated monthly income at retirement age, typically 65, to
replace a portion of the salary that the employer no longer
provides. Companies need to tell participants how the plan works
and notify them of certain changes, such as if they cut the monthly
benefit, according to retirement-planning expert Stephen Dobrow,
president of Primark Benefits in Burlingame.
</P>
<P>
   But he says the employer doesn't have to define a whole lot.
``Changes such as interest rates and actuarial assumptions used to
calculate payments, can be made without notice,'' he says. Since
companies usually seek the advice of a pension consultant, actuary
or attorney to comply with the complicated rules governing
retirement plans, it is likely that the employer was within his
rights making changes.
</P>
<P>
   After reading the summary plan description that explains how
benefits are calculated, Dobrow suggests you might call the Pension
and Welfare Benefits Administration of the U.S. Department of Labor
for help. You can also pay a pension professional a few hundred
dollars to check the figures and whether you were properly
notified. If your benefits were illegally reduced, you may be able
to get them restored by filing a suit in federal court.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In all the talk at their annual meeting about the
U.S. economy and what keeps it so robust, the nation's economists
gave short shrift to one concern _ that the soaring stock market
might be a speculative bubble that could burst, damaging the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is neither a principal reason for the economy's
strength nor a big threat to the nearly eight-year-long expansion,
the economists said in their various sessions at the American
Economic Association's three-day meeting, which ended Tuesday, and
in interviews. The majority view was that high stock prices
probably reflect not a bubble but the economy's actual strength,
although no one said that categorically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a bubble?'' said N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist.
``If the people here really thought this was a bubble market about
to crash, that would have been a big topic of conversation at this
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   A bubble, if one exists, raises the odds that stock prices will
eventually plunge and extinguish the wealth of millions of
shareholders. They will respond by pulling back suddenly on their
spending, damaging the economy. The Asian economic crisis raised
concern that the market might be ignoring danger and thus in bubble
territory. The spectacular run-up in the share prices of some
high-technology companies also fed talk of a bubble market.
</P>
<P>
   But the bubble talk largely disappeared after the Federal
Reserve cut interest rates three times late last year. That action
convinced many on Wall Street _ and also many of the economists
gathered in Manhattan _ that the Fed stood ready to sustain the
expansion, and stock prices, by cutting rates again if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a sense now that if this is a bubble and it bursts,
the Fed will lower interest rates and everything will be fine,''
Mankiw said. ``Many economists have confidence in Alan Greenspan as
the Fed's chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of many economists, the stock market serves mainly
as a gauge of the real economy and a stimulus for spending. What
accounts much more for the strong economy, in this view, is the
happy combination since 1995 of four factors: robust job creation,
rising output, falling unemployment and minimal inflation. Usually
the first three produce a rise in the fourth, the inflation rate.
The Federal Reserve then raises interest rates to subdue inflation
by slowing the economy, and the expansion ends or becomes much less
vigorous.
</P>
<P>
   This time, inflation has not risen, as it so often did in the
past, particularly when the unemployment rate dropped below 5.5
percent. It is now 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the reasons? Considerable credit went to ``lucky shocks,''
as Alan Blinder of Princeton University phrased it _ falling oil
prices, for example, falling import prices, smaller-than-expected
increases in health care costs and ever sharper declines in
computer prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no reason to predict that these favorable
supply shocks will continue over the next year or two,'' said James
Stock of Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But structural changes might be more enduring, allowing perhaps
for a jobless rate of less than 5 percent without a rise in
inflation. The growing use of part-time and temporary workers may
help to explain the combination of low unemployment and minimal
upward pressure on labor costs and prices, Stock said. Greater
labor mobility may play a role, as well as job insecurity and the
aging of the baby boomers. Older workers are less inclined to leave
a job. Or so the reasoning went.
</P>
<P>
   Only Edmund Phelps of Columbia University argued that the rising
stock market played a leading role in driving the current
expansion. ``Rising share prices,'' he said, ``create the incentive
for enterprises to invest in more employees and more fixed capital.
The worth of workers has gone up,'' when measured as the rising
value of a company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   But have share prices gotten too inflated? ``I am an agnostic on
that issue,'' Phelps said. ``Maybe this is a time in which a big
error is being made. But I don't think so.''

$15 MILLION COLLEGE COMPLEX PROPOSED FOR UMASS-AMHERST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With strong support from the Cellucci administration,
the University of Massachusetts is proposing a $15 million building
complex to house a new academically exclusive college within
UMass-Amherst, administration and university officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The complex would give an identity, as well as distinct
residences, classrooms, and a student center to Commonwealth
College, which the state Board of Higher Education conceived as
part of a broad plan to enhance the prestige of a public university
long overlooked amid the proliferation of private schools in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board approved the concept of an elite liberal arts
college 18 months ago, the plans for an actual building will
establish tangible evidence of the state's commitment to academic
excellence at UMass. Officials believe the new complex will make
the state university more attractive to potential applicants, and
hold it up as something for the state's high school students to
aspire to.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, state higher education officials hope it will be a
breeding ground for Rhodes and Marshall Scholars _ honors never
bestowed on a UMass student, and ones that UMass President William
M. Bulger is eager to have distinguish his school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does more than send a message,'' Bulger said Tuesday.
``It provides an opportunity for people who are very serious about
the task of learning. Here, we say not only shall we recognize and
respect you for that, we'll provide an opportunity for you to
continue with your enthusiastic approach to the task of learning.
This says something about what this large public university sees as
important, that we think it's important enough that we want
everyone who is at this task to know that this is the place for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth College will open officially in September with
3,000 students. Administration and UMass officials say they hope to
have the building complex open within three years, by paying for it
with the state's anticipated large budget surplus, a move that
would drastically shorten the legislative and construction approval
process.
</P>
<P>
   The complex, slated for the Orchard Hill part of the Amherst
campus, would include a small library, faculty offices, meeting
rooms, and auditoriums, all in 48,000 square feet of new building
attached to a residence already designated as Commonwealth College
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   The college will embrace and expand the honors program that
already includes 1,800 students on the Amherst campus. By improving
the marketing of that program, state officials hope to stress that
the school is serious about more than basketball and halftime
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is excited and loves the fact that our marching band
becomes the best in the country,'' Bulger said. ``Why not create
that excitement about the original purpose of the university: the
education of the people. I think with the honors program, the place
itself becomes more recognized as a place where excellence is
pursued and held in highest esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Those admitted to Commonwealth College must have an average of
1300 on the SAT, and be in the top 10 percent of their high school
class, with at least a 3.5 grade point average. To earn a special
Commonwealth Honors diploma, they would be required to write a
thesis, perform community service or complete an international
study program, and get at least a B in 10 advanced classes as well
as 40 additional classes, and demonstrate proficiency in oral
communication and computer literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci administration officials said they had considered
including the proposal in the governor's budget request to the
Legislature. But in discussions with UMass officials this week,
they opted to include the $15 million in a proposal now in the
Senate Ways and Means Committee to spend the state's budget
surplus. That way, the money would come as soon as May or April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Cellucci would look forward to signing it, as long as
there was proper financing,'' spokesman Jason Kauppi said. ``It
really builds on what we're doing in the state's public elementary
and secondary schools in terms of raising standards and raising
quality. The Commonwealth College provides a first-class,
affordable honors college that we think can be an alternative to
the private colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Honors colleges at public universities in New Jersey, Florida,
and Maryland suggest the promise and the limitation of Commonwealth
College. While they indeed offer an excellent education at lower
cost, and attract students who would have attended better known
colleges, those honors colleges have not become as well known as
the private colleges, and have not significantly boosted the
reputation of the state systems.
</P>
<P>
   But UMass is already enjoying newfound prestige, thanks largely
to higher academic standards overall, a high-profile advertising
campaign, and a fund-raising drive that has broken all records and
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Several state colleges competed to get the honors college on
their campus, but Amherst was selected largely because of its
strong honors program. Still, when it was approved, Amherst
officials said that to significantly improve prestige they would
require the new buildings.

SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL EXPECTED TO BEGIN THURSDAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, announced on
Tuesday that he expected Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist to open
the impeachment trial of President Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he sought a conclusion ``that is fair and hopefully
quick'' but gave no details of how the trial would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Republican's reticence reflected the unsettled
situation in the Senate as leaders from both parties met in
hideaways all across the Capitol throughout the day, negotiating
ceaselessly to devise a bipartisan plan that would avert a lengthy
trial that could tie up the Senate for months.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties said one such proposal for an
expedited trial, drafted by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph
I. Lieberman, D-Conn., was foundering because of objections from
conservative Republicans, just a day before the 106th Congress
formally convenes.
</P>
<P>
   Showing the depth of the opposition, Sen. Larry E. Craig of
Idaho, a member of the Republican leadership team, said of the
plan, ``I think it's dead and finally, I hope it's dead because I
do not think one should short-circuit the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   But still hopeful, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
minority leader, said, ``Contrary to rumors of its demise, I think
that there's still a great deal of interest in pursuing some
framework along those lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle had their first of several meetings of the day
early in the morning and then traveled across the street to the
Supreme Court, where they met with Rehnquist for about a half hour
to plan for the first presidential impeachment trial in 130 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Daschle called the timing still ``tentative,'' he and
Lott said they expected Rehnquist to swear in senators as jurors on
Thursday. On that same day, House managers led by Rep. Henry J.
Hyde of Illinois _ who are expected to be reappointed by the new
Congress on Wednesday _ are to read on the Senate floor the two
articles of impeachment charging Clinton with perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways the day will be a holding action, buying time
for Senate leaders to keep working out the details of what comes
next as they strive to avoid the partisan rancor that overtook the
House, which approved two articles of impeachment last month on
near party-line votes.
</P>
<P>
   Senators huddled in all kinds of groups on Tuesday, some
bipartisan, some by party. Some senators consulted with Gorton and
Lieberman while others floated their own modifications of the plan.
One Democrat said that so many proposals were now flying around the
Senate that ``it's like dim sum right now. They're picking and
choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, Lott and Daschle had designated several bipartisan
groups of senators to keep in touch with one another and work out
specific issues. They included some of the most prominent members
of the Senate, among them two Democrats, Daniel Patrick Moynihan of
New York and Robert C. Byrdof West Virginia, and two Republicans,
Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who met with Lott several times
on Tuesday, said he still hoped to move on to actual trial
proceedings on Monday, as envisioned under the compromise plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an interest in starting this as soon as possible,''
Ms. Snowe said. Even conservatives said they wanted the trial to
end by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``How this all pieces together and what it looks like is very
much up in the air,'' said Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Making the situation more complicated, one official said, is the
schedule of Rehnquist. The chief justice told Daschle and Lott that
the court had oral arguments scheduled in the mornings next week
and that he would prefer to come to the Senate in the afternoons,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Joe Lockhart, the press secretary, said the
uncertainty left the president's lawyers ``in the position of
preparing for all eventualities. In general, we'd like to know
which direction we're going in, but we understand the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal drafted by Gorton and Lieberman was designed to
avoid a long Senate trial that showcased the details of Clinton's
affair with Monica S. Lewinsky. The plan was also propelled by the
fact that no one expected the Senate, which has 55 Republicans and
45 Democrats, to have the 67 votes necessary under the Constitution
to convict Clinton and remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   The plan called for an expedited trial of the president to begin
next Monday without witnesses. House managers, who will be the
prosecutors, and the White House would get one day each to present
their cases. On a third day the senators could question the two
sides by sending written notes to the front of the chamber. On
Thursday and Friday, the senators would be able to state their
views in open debate.
</P>
<P>
   Then the senators would take test votes on whether each of the
two articles of impeachment met the standard for the president to
be removed from office. If, as expected, 67 senators decided the
articles did not meet the standard, a simple majority vote would
allow the Senate to adjourn the trial and move toward censure.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is supported by most Democrats, and Lott, who
desperately wants the Republicans to put forward an agenda this
year, has been sounding out his rank-and-file for days.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of Republicans have complained that the
plan does not give the House managers enough time to make their
case. Some, in deference to House Republicans, want an actual vote
on the articles of impeachment, while others object to test votes
that allow the Senate to move forward with a full trial only if 67
senators agreed. Still others want to hear from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-seven sounds like we're looking for a deal, not our
duty,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who met separately on
Tuesday with Lieberman and with Gorton. ``We shouldn't be
artificially truncating this.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, said he
opposed the proposal's two-thirds vote to move ahead with a trial,
and said the plan did not afford either House managers or the White
House enough time to present their cases. ``I would hope it could
be done in a week or so on each side,'' Nickles said. ``That would
be plenty.'' He said he thought the two-thirds vote requirement
``would be dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators were looking at ways to address all these objections
but the trickiest question by far could be whether to allow any
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The House impeachment managers, meeting on Tuesday night to
prepare for the trial, insisted that they wanted a full trial with
witnesses, and they were drawing support from Senate conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an anomalous thing to have a trial without any
witnesses,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla. ``Now, exactly who
the witnesses are and how extensive the testimony is, those are
questions that still need to be decided.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Democrats were equally adamant that witnesses not be
called. ``Issue No. 1 is the witness issue,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass. ``We think that would really become a zoo and seriously
prolong the process, unnecessarily so.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said witnesses ``would accelerate the partisanship and
acrimony we saw on the House side.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats warned that if Republicans tried to craft a plan
for only a limited number of witnesses the White House would object
and insist on a full trial and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness genie isn't coming partially out of the bottle,''
said one Democratic strategist close to the White House. The
president's lawyers, he said, ``simply cannot afford to gamble and
let House prosecutors present only one side of the story. At this
point political considerations have to be put aside and legal
considerations emphasized.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally problematic was whether the Senate could agree on any
censure proposal if a trial was truncated. Some Republicans called
censure beyond the bounds of the Constitution and a violation of
the separation of powers. Some Democrats thought Clinton needed a
straight up-or-down vote on acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impeachment is the constitutional action available to the
Congress, not censure,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, in an appearance on C-Span on Tuesday night, also warned
against the conventional wisdom that the impeachment process will
end in censure. ``There's no sound and indisputable count as to
votes here,'' Byrd said, ``and votes may shift depending on things
that are unforeseen at the present.'' He also indicated that he was
undecided how he would vote on Clinton. ``I could go either way
based on the evidence as I've seen it or heard it and I've followed
it pretty closely.''

RED SOX SIGN PITCHER KIP GROSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It has become a Red Sox trend, in the reign of Dan
Duquette, to stockpile pitchers with bad arms. But with Tuesday's
signing of Kip Gross, the Sox have obtained their first pitcher who
was injured while searching for a sushi bar.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, who carved out a successful career pitching for the
Nippon Ham Fighters in Japan after failing to make much of an
impression with the Reds and Dodgers, was limited to just 36
innings last season by an elbow injury. But it was the way in which
he cracked his ribs the year before that places him in a category
all his own.
</P>
<P>
   Gross was bidding to lead the Japanese Pacific League in wins
for the third straight season until the night of Aug. 12, 1997,
when he said he was assaulted on the streets of Sendai, a seaport
in northeast Honshu. Gross told Japanese reporters that he and a
companion were looking for a sushi bar when they were accosted by a
young man who was drunk. ``I mean, he was slammed,'' Gross told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said he did not know what provoked the man, who was
speaking in Japanese, but he told the man, ``All right, dude,
whatever,'' according to the Daily Yomiuri, a Tokyo newspaper. The
next thing he knew, gross told the newspaper, he was surrounded by
10 of the man's companions, who pinned him against a parked car,
hitting and kicking him.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said he didn't notify police of the incident, but told the
team's interpreter and trainer. The team's manager reportedly did
not find out until two weeks later, when Gross, who was pitching in
pain, told reporters of the incident. Gross finished that season
with 13 wins after posting 17 and 16 wins the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he was just 3-4 in seven starts for the Ham
Fighters. But the 34-year-old righthander was given a big-league
contract by the Sox, indicating that they think he can stick as
either a fifth starter or long man out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox also are recycling lefthander Rheal Cormier, who has
not pitched in the big leagues for the last two seasons after
undergoing elbow surgery following his first start of 1997 for the
Montreal Expos. Cormier enjoyed modest success as a setup man and
spot starter for the Sox in 1995, when they won the AL East, but he
was traded the following January to the Expos in the deal that
brought Wilfredo Cordero.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians took a chance on Cormier, signing him last
winter, but he was able to make just three rehab starts in the
minor leagues last summer. Cormier underwent tendon-transplant
surgery, the same operation that lefthander Butch Henry had before
Duquette signed him. Henry experienced stiffness when he tried to
pitch out of the bullpen following his surgery; if Cormier has the
same problem, he's probably looking at starting the season in
Pawtucket.
</P>
<P>
   Cormier got a minor league contract but will be invited to the
big league camp.

NBA PLAYERS ARRIVE FOR HISTORIC VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some NBA players arrived here Tuesday amid the
Rubiconesque scenario that has enveloped their league, their
bosses, their colleagues, their fans, and their livelihood. Dee
Brown was one of them. He forked over $1,200 for a flight from
Orlando to attend Wednesday's union vote as a player representative
for the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many others joined Brown; the union said it was
expecting as many as 300 players, but that might be a stretch.
Whoever does show up Wednesday will vote not on the owners' latest
proposal per se, but, as commissioner David Stern put it, ``to give
a rousing vote of endorsement'' to the union and its executive
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member committee met Tuesday and reiterated its position
of a week ago _ namely, that the owners' proposal to end the
lockout is too punitive and should be rejected. If the players
don't make any concessions _ and they are disinclined to do so _
the NBA owners will convene Thursday morning and vote to end the
season that never was. Stern held out hope for an 11th-hour
settlement but also said the owners' vote would be final and firm.
</P>
<P>
   It also will be overwhelming, most likely 27-2, the same tally
from last March, when this mess began. In that vote, which resulted
in the reopening of the last Collective Bargaining Agreement,
Celtics owner Paul Gaston and Portland's Paul Allen (now wooing
Mike Holmgren for one of his other toys, the Seattle Seahawks) cast
the dissenting votes.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at the player meeting, scheduled for 1 p.m., likely
will fall well short of the 400-plus that union executive director
Billy Hunter wanted to see. There was confusion all day as to the
time and place, prompting the NBA to suggest that the union wanted
only favorable voices at the gathering. Players unable to get
information from the union were forced to call the NBA _ and many
did, the league said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the vote will be to endorse the negotiating
committee's stance, not, as the league had hoped, a vote on the
owners' proposal. Stern called the meeting a ``a pep rally'' and
repeated that the owners were serious about shutting down the
season.
</P>
<P>
   League attorney Jeffrey Mishkin said the union rally ``sounds to
us a lot more like a bargaining tactic than union democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Added player agent Steve Kauffman before boarding a plane for
New York, ``I'm totally confused.'' He said one-third of his 16
clients would attend.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mercer of the Celtics was uncertain late into the day
whether he would be present. He said he had to check first with his
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be good to get together with the players and decide
what we're going to do,'' Mercer said. ``If I do go, I'll be
looking to get educated. I've seen the proposals but I don't
understand everything. I want to know more.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was supportive of the union, Mercer said, ``I want
to stand behind it. But at the same time, I want to play. I just
love the game. It might be different for other guys, but me, I'm
ready to play and I want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Indiana Pacers planned to attend but wondered why
they had to spend the airfare to watch the season go up in smoke.
One report Tuesday had as many as 150 players calling for a secret
vote, while another had the entire Utah Jazz roster ready to accept
the owners' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Dan Wasserman said the association was not aware
of the 150 players asking for a secret vote. He said the vote will
be a ``public ballot,'' which basically means it will be a
revivalesque ratification of the union's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that there is more accountability with an open
vote,'' Wasserman said. The vote will not be binding.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting could prove to be a logistical nightmare in that it
is scheduled for the union's outside law firm. Hunter, who was
still calling players Tuesday, had been resistant to putting the
owners' offer up for a vote among the rank-and-file until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA, however, was taking nothing for granted. In a telex to
all teams, it urged general managers or coaches to call players and
remind them what is at stake and to encourage them to vote. Many
players expressed more disappointment at the late notice and
expensive airfare than at the owners' demand for cost certainty.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: EXPLAINING THE EURO, A VIRTUAL CURRENCY
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Also moving in `t' category) 
(dal) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first phone calls Alami Driss received Tuesday
morning was from someone asking how he could buy euros for a
planned trip to Europe. Responding as he had done to similar phone
calls for more than a month, Driss explained that the euro is not
available for purchase anywhere for three more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that by this Jan. 1, European currencies
just vanished,'' said Driss, senior vice president of People's
Foreign Exchange, a money exchange in midtown Manhattan. Meanwhile,
he is awaiting a supply of explanatory brochures about the euro to
give to walk-in customers, both as a service and in hopes of
forestalling a rash of similar phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although people come in here worried and confused,'' Driss
added, ``it doesn't take long to explain the situation to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 so-called Euro zone nations are Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. For now, at least, Britain,
Denmark and Sweden have opted out, while Greece did not meet the
economic requirements for membership.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors to American Express offices the past two days also
have the impression that the French franc, German mark, Italian
lira and the currencies of the other eight member countries are
extinct, according to company officials. ``So we have to tell them
that the euro is a virtual currency for the next three years,''
said Chris Levite, a spokeswoman for American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Not every potential traveler to Europe is confused about the
euro, which has been the official currency of the 11 participating
countries since midnight in Brussels on New Year's Eve. ``We got a
check for $10,000 about a month ago from a man in Long Island
wanting to buy the first printing of our euro-travelers' checks,''

   While euro notes and coins will not go on sale before Jan. 1,
2002, and will not formally replace local currencies before July 1,
2002, the euro exchange rate can be used for travelers' check
payments, credit card purchases and other noncash transactions.
While still too early to know how avidly Americans will take to
euro-travelers' checks, they are not likely to set any sales
records, mainly because for now they are readily accepted only in
Europe's bigger shops, restaurants and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at Thomas Cook currency exchanges have also been busy
explaining the euro to customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting two different sets of questions,'' said
John Telford, Thomas Cook's senior vice president for corporate
foreign exchange for the Americas. ``The consumer at our walk-up
branches is asking such basic questions as, `Can I take euros to
Europe and do I need to?' They also ask whether they should take
our euro-travelers' checks, so we explain the advantage of doing
so, but also tell them that when they cash them they'll get back
local currency. So another option is to take local currency to
begin with, although it's too early to know if there's an advantage
in taking one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Many establishments in the 11 countries already post prices in
euros as well as local currencies, and most are expected to do so
before long. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Corporate travelers usually have at least a passing familiarity
with the euro, but Telford said they wanted reassurance about how
to pay bills quoted in both euros and local currencies. They are
told they can pay in either euro-travelers' checks or with major
credit cards, whose purchases will be converted by the card's
issuing bank and billed in dollars or the card user's home
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Travel officials in the United States generally agree that in
the future the euro will benefit American travelers by allowing
them to pay just one commission for any or all 11 currencies, and
will save them money when they reconvert leftover currency at the
end of a trip.
</P>
<P>
   The ease of comparing hotel rates in different countries will
benefit leisure travelers, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers, as
well as corporations and associations looking to book meetings.
Travelers will also have a better idea of the costs, if not
necessarily the value, of restaurant meals, souvenirs, clothing and
any number of other purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Even smaller companies that do business in countries using the
euro can expect to save time and money on overhead by not having to
reconcile bills and receipts issued in many currencies.
</P>
<P>
   And corporate travel managers say they expect the simplicity
offered by a single currency to make it easier for big
corporations, especially multinationals, to negotiate preferable
rates with European airlines, hotels and rental cars _ or, at the
very least, to extract lower fares and rates from their current
suppliers by threatening to negotiate with their European rivals.

BUSINESS TRAVEL: EXPLAINING THE EURO, A VIRTUAL CURRENCY

   One of the first phone calls Alami Driss received Tuesday
morning was from someone asking how he could buy euros for a
planned trip to Europe. Responding as he had done to similar phone
calls for more than a month, Driss explained that the euro is not
available for purchase anywhere for three more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that by this Jan. 1, European currencies
just vanished,'' said Driss, senior vice president of People's
Foreign Exchange, a money exchange in midtown Manhattan. Meanwhile,
he is awaiting a supply of explanatory brochures about the euro to
give to walk-in customers, both as a service and in hopes of
forestalling a rash of similar phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although people come in here worried and confused,'' Driss
added, ``it doesn't take long to explain the situation to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11 so-called Euro zone nations are Austria, Belgium,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. For now, at least, Britain,
Denmark and Sweden have opted out, while Greece did not meet the
economic requirements for membership.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors to American Express offices the past two days also
have the impression that the French franc, German mark, Italian
lira and the currencies of the other eight member countries are
extinct, according to company officials. ``So we have to tell them
that the euro is a virtual currency for the next three years,''
said Chris Levite, a spokeswoman for American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Not every potential traveler to Europe is confused about the
euro, which has been the official currency of the 11 participating
countries since midnight in Brussels on New Year's Eve. ``We got a
check for $10,000 about a month ago from a man in Long Island
wanting to buy the first printing of our euro-travelers' checks,''
Ms. Levite said.
</P>
<P>
   While euro notes and coins will not go on sale before Jan. 1,
2002, and will not formally replace local currencies before July 1,
2002, the euro exchange rate can be used for travelers' check
payments, credit card purchases and other noncash transactions.

LOTT VOWS TRIAL WILL BE `PROPER AND HOPEFULLY QUICK' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott promised Tuesday
that the nation's first presidential impeachment trial in 130 years
would be ``proper and hopefully quick,'' but he offered few details
of the procedure President Clinton faces when his case goes before
the Senate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With a proposal for a truncated trial facing growing opposition
among conservative Republicans, Lott spent most of the day seeking
consensus on how the case against Clinton would proceed, how long
it might last and whether witnesses should be called.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, he and other Republican senators were pushing a
plan that would extend the trial into February with House
prosecutors and Clinton's defense team having generous time limits
and the ability to summon a minimum number of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, were hopeful of finding a bipartisan
approach to the historic trial, but remained against calling
witnesses who might have to testify about the lurid details of
Clinton's illicit affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Republicans and Democrats reach an agreement, Senate
Democratic leader Tom Daschle warned, Clinton's defense team and
his Republican prosecutors from the House ``would become
entrenched, and we could end up with a prolonged process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and Daschle met Tuesday morning, then walked across the
street from the Capitol to meet with Chief Justice William
Rehnquist to discuss protocol for the trial's opening session
Thursday. Later, Lott talked briefly with reporters about the
trial, which begins with Rehnquist taking the oath as presiding
officer, then administering the oath to the Senate's 100 members,
who will sit as jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a constitutional duty here. It is a very serious one.
It is one we must carry forward,'' Lott told reporters. ``At the
end of the day, I'm going to do my best to make sure we complete
our constitutional duties under the rules of the Senate and come to
a conclusion that is fair and hopefully quick also.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions on how to proceed with the impeachment trial _ only
the second of a president in U.S. history, and the first since
Andrew Johnson's trial in 1868 _ will be made during meetings over
the next two days, said Lott, who declined to respond to questions.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, the senior
Democrat in the Senate, said he is not locked into voting to acquit
the president. He is the only one of the 45 Senate Democrats to
indicate he might vote to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go either way based on the evidence as I've seen it or
heard it,'' Byrd said on C-SPAN. ``And I've followed it pretty
closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was impeached Dec. 19 when the House, voting largely
along party lines, passed two articles accusing Clinton of perjury
and obstruction of justice in his effort to cover up his
extramarital affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties have suggested a variety of ways to
keep Clinton's trial brief, but as of today, on the eve of their
convening as part of the 106th Congress, there were more questions
than answers about how the procedure would work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to grappling with conservative Republican senators
who want a full-blown trial, Lott and other Senate leaders are
faced with rancorous House Republicans, led by Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who insist on being allowed ample time
to present their case against Clinton. Hyde heads the team of 13
House managers deputized to prosecute the case against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   When the House convenes today, it must reappoint Hyde's team of
prosecutors and approve funding for the group, which is made up of
13 Republicans from the House Judiciary Committee. House Democrats,
who picked up five seats in the November elections, are expected to
challenge the funding proposal, mostly as a protest of what they
are calling an unfair and political use of the House's impeachment
power.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the president's lawyers continued planning
their defense, a task made more difficult by the uncertainty of how
the trial will be conducted once senators take their oaths as
jurors. Possibly the same day, House prosecutors, the trial
managers, will read the charges against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an understatement to say we'd like to know what the
process is,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``I think
we'd generally like to know which direction we're going in.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past 10 days, Lott has unsuccessfully pushed a
proposal crafted by Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn., calling for a sort of preliminary trial. It
would begin Monday, allow two days for opening presentations from
both the House-appointed prosecutors and the president's legal
team, then a day of questioning by the senators.
</P>
<P>
   Then senators would debate whether the charges against Clinton
warranted a full-blown trial, and if less than two-thirds of the
senators voted to proceed, the trial would end and the Senate could
take up a discussion of whether to censure the president. If
two-thirds vote to continue the trial, the Senate would move
forward by allowing House prosecutors and Clinton's lawyers to call
witnesses. Once all the evidence is heard, if two-thirds of the
Senate votes to convict Clinton, he is immediately removed from
office and Vice President Al Gore takes over the executive branch
of government.
</P>
<P>
   An abbreviated trial, without witnesses, has drawn opposition
from several Republicans senators, including Texas Sen. Phil Gramm.
Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison also opposes a truncated trial, but
she is not convinced that witnesses are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm predicted Tuesday that during the next few days the Senate
will abandon efforts to ``re-invent'' the impeachment process and
follow the precedent of 15 previous cases, most of which dealt with
federal judges accused of official wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have held trials, and we have rendered a verdict of
`guilty' or `not guilty' on each and every occasion,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., became the latest to
object to limiting the trial. Abraham said the House ``should be
given a timetable to make a reasonably full presentation of the
evidence _ certainly greater than just one day, as should the
president's defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said the Gorton-Lieberman proposal
``is dead, at least I'm hoping it's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, the No. 4 Senate GOP leader, said Lott late Tuesday
floated a ``hybrid'' plan that would entail giving the House
managers and Clinton's attorneys three to four days each to present
their case. In addition, each side would be allowed to present a
short list of witnesses they wish to call. Then there would be a
``holding period,'' Craig said, to discuss subpoenas, depositions,
and other procedural issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be much farther along by that time,'' Craig said. ``Are
we going to deny them (House managers) four, five or six witnesses?
I doubt that. I am not at all worried about a two-to-three-week
process that takes us to mid-February.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said late Tuesday that ``contrary to the rumors of its
demise, there is still a great deal of interest'' in the
Gorton-Lieberman proposal. ``My preference is that we not have
witnesses, only because we think it would accelerate the
partisanship and the acrimony that we saw in such high degree on
the House side,'' Daschle said.

   Carlton Fisk was home in Illinois Tuesday when he learned that
he had not been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first
year of eligibility. Fisk was named on 330 of 497 ballots cast,
which was 43 votes shy of the 75 percent required for induction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of hoping it could happen, but I'm not crushed,''
he said by phone. ``I'm disappointed. I don't know how that
translates into the next year. I heard Tony Perez did better last
year than he did this year because of all the strong new candidates
that were considered. I guess I'll just have to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I hung around, half-expecting the phone to ring. But I
sort of protected my emotions, knowing it was a nice big class and
everyone was deserving and knowing the quirks of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's agent, Boston-based Jack Sands, had told the former Red
Sox catcher to wait by the phone, just in case. Fisk found himself
listening to the radio while he looked at the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was listening to ESPN Radio,'' he said. ``I had gotten a
couple of calls from radio people in Chicago. Then the guy on the
radio came on and said that Nolan Ryan was elected with the
second-highest vote total ever and that George Brett got the
fifth-highest total. And then he said something like, `Oh yeah, and
Robin Yount got in, too.' They didn't mention my name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd that you'd have a group of guys that played four
different positions. I feel I was as good in my position as they
were in their position. You have to take into consideration the
people in your position.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisk played 24 seasons, 11 with the Red Sox, 13 with the White
Sox, and caught more games and hit more homers than any other
catcher in history.
</P>
<P>
   If he is elected to the Hall of Fame _ which he probably will be
next year _ which team logo will he put on his cap in Cooperstown?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have thought about that for quite a while,'' he said. ``I'll
probably reserve that decision until it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Bet Red Sox. Fisk's dad, Cecil Fisk, still lives in Vermont.

SUSPECT IN SUBWAY PUSHING DEATH SAYS HE TRIED ATTACK BEFORE
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man accused of pushing a woman to her death in
front of a subway train in Manhattan has told investigators that he
tried to push another woman in front a subway train in Brooklyn
less than a year ago, but that the woman fought him off, police
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Andrew Goldstein, 29, made the claim when he was
questioned about the death of Kendra Webdale, 32, who was killed
Sunday evening when she was pushed in front of an N train at the
station at 23rd Street and Broadway, according to three police
officials, who spoke in separate interviews on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they were not sure whether to believe
Goldstein's account of the Brooklyn attack, given his history of
mental illness, but added that police would seek evidence in an
effort to corroborate his story.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may not be the best source for this,'' one of the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But another police official said that most of Goldstein's
statements to police had been borne out so far. ``Basically,
everything he's told us has been on the money,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who has been charged with second-degree murder in the
death of Ms. Webdale, has spent the last decade in and out of
state, city and private hospitals, as well as halfway houses and
outpatient clinics, for treatment of mental illness, law
enforcement and health officials said. After he was arrested Sunday
night, police said, he confessed to pushing Ms. Webdale to her
death, and then spoke of trying to push a woman off a subway
platform in Brooklyn in May. The officials said that Goldstein
claimed he was thwarted when the woman resisted furiously and
punched him in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, the officials said, told the detectives that police
officers who were summoned to the station took him to a hospital
psychiatric ward instead of arresting him. That would be consistent
with normal procedure, according to the Police Department's Patrol
Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein went on to say that he was freed a couple of days
later when he was released from the ward, the officials said. Under
state law, people must be proved both mentally ill and a danger to
themselves or others to justify an involuntary commitment for
short-term hospitalizations or longer stays in an institution.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said that Goldstein told detectives that he
uses two kinds of medication, Haldol and Congentin, for his mental
illness. Officials would not comment on the specifics of
Goldstein's illness, but the two drugs are often used to treat
paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said it was unclear whether he had been taking the
medicine recently.
</P>
<P>
   John Olson, 20, who shared a basement apartment with Goldstein
in Howard Beach, Queens, said Monday that Goldstein was apparently
estranged from his parents, and that his father lived in Delaware
and his mother lived in New York. He said that Goldstein had
complained recently of quarreling with his mother over money.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's landlady, Sarita Gonzalez, said Tuesday that
Goldstein's father sent him $50 each month.
</P>
<P>
   Police would not say Tuesday whether they had managed to find
Goldstein's parents.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein's current status as a murder suspect stands in sad
contrast to his youth. In 1987, he graduated from the Bronx High
School of Science, which requires a good performance on a citywide
entrance exam for admittance. In the yearbook, Goldstein chose a
quote that said, ``Man's destiny, ultimately determined by fortune,
can be influenced but never controlled by man's wisdom and
intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The following fall he enrolled at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook. Two years later, in 1989, he was committed to
the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center, officials said, and was in and
out of the center three times until 1993. After that he stayed in a
halfway house, was counseled at outpatient clinics and was admitted
for short stays at several hospital psychiatric wards, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A SUNY official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
Goldstein tried to return to college several times during those
years. Over 10 years, the official said, Goldstein accumulated
about 30 credits _ the equivalent of 8 to 10 completed courses. He
last took a class at Stony Brook in the fall of 1997, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a transcript, Goldstein took precalculus, calculus,
psychology, biology, chemistry, social psychology and writing
during his first year at the university, and had a 3.29 grade-point
average.
</P>
<P>
   Olson said Tuesday that his roommate sometimes spoke wistfully
of trying to return to college. But in the end, he said, Goldstein
would always say that he had too much trouble concentrating and
remembering things.

NO AGREEMENT IN SIGHT ON IMPEACHMENT TRIAL PROCEEDINGS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's impeachment trial is scheduled
to open Thursday, and Republican senators said there is no deal on
ending it quickly or con ducting it without witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be done not only expeditiously, but fairly,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   And by evening, a bipartisan proposal for a speedy trial without
witnesses appeared virtually dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there are sufficient Republicans who would
support (the proposal) as it was originally discussed,'' said Sen.
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz. ``I think a lot of people really care how history
judges the Senate, and they really care that this be done right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will receive a formal impeachment report from the
House on Thursday morning. After that, Chief Justice William
Rehnquist, who will preside over the trial, will be sworn in. Then,
the senators will take their oath as jurors. Actual arguments or
testimony will proba bly not begin until next week.
</P>
<P>
   With the 106th Congress sched uled to convene today, Lott and
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota spent the day
in private meetings with Kyl and other key Republican senators as
they labored to develop ground rules for Clinton's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they met, fresh criticism surfaced among conservative Re
publicans of the bipartisan speedy-trial proposal, and the
likelihood grew of a longer trial that would include witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, after the meeting with Lott and about a dozen other GOP
senators, said the participants ex pressed a desire to defer to the
House's wishes to summon wit nesses. There was no mention of which
witnesses might be called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have protested that calling witnesses could lead to a
protracted trial and create gridlock in all three branches of the
govern ment.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, the House approved two articles of impeachment stem
ming from Clinton's efforts to conceal a sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern. Now, it is up to
House members to manage the impeach ment case _ the first in 130
years _ on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think we all (at the Lott meeting) understood is that
the House managers believe they need to call some witnesses,'' Kyl
said. ``Most people there wanted to give deference to the House.
After all, they have the burden of proving their case.''
</P>
<P>
   That would also mean allowing the White House to call its own
witnesses to make a case against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Left in limbo Tuesday was a plan by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash.,
and Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., for a one-day presentation of
evidence for the House, followed by a one-day rebuttal by the White
House and 20 minutes for comment for each senator.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there would have been a test vote to see whether
two-thirds of the Senate thought the evidence was impeachable, if
proven. If that failed, the next step would have been a vote to
adjourn the trial. Then, senators would have been free to pursue
censure of the president, although that was not part of Gorton's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday evening, Daschle was still clinging to the hope
that the speedy-trial proposal might have some life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the Gorton-Lieber man proposal is on the table.
And, contrary to rumors of its demise, I think there is still a
great deal of interest in pursuing some framework along those
lines,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic senators said time was running short. They warned
that Republicans faced a potential backlash from the public similar
to the one several years ago when a budget stalemate produced a
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The window for us to achieve a bipartisan agreement is not
going to be open for long,'' Lieberman said. ``I think we've really
got to try to do it by the end of this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Republicans, how ever, cautioned against taking an
easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is, of course, a natural desire to want a reasonable,
quiet, even silent way out,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``But to
use censure as a vehicle should not be the Senate's choice. It may
be attractive, it may be an immediate resolution, it may be good
political cover . . . but it is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart said the uncertainty
leaves Clinton's lawyers ``in the position of preparing for all
eventu alities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually not in a position to rule things in or rule
things out,'' Lockhart said. ``We're waiting for the Senate to make
a decision on how they plan to move forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have, as a matter of record, said we expect this process to
move forward in a way that's fair, biparti san and expeditious.'' &QL;

VENTURA COUNTY GROWERS HIT HARD BY 1998 WEATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID GREENBERG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Having lost $51 million in crops to El Nino
storms, farmers in neighboring Ventura County had nearly $75
million destroyed by December's cold snap, making 1998 one of the
worst years ever for the area's No. 1 industry.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers fought the Dec. 20-24 cold snap with wind machines and
irrigation, yet still reported $74.3 million in damage to oranges,
lemons and avocados. Coupled with El Nino-related damage --
including $31.2 million from a Feb. 23 storm -- the county's
agriculture industry suffered $125.3 million in losses last year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Ventura County saw such a devastating loss was
Dec. 21-22, 1990, when frost killed off $128 million of the citrus
and avocado crops being harvested by 700 local growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a big loss,'' said W. Earl McPhail, county
agricultural commissioner. ``This is definitely the worst freeze
we've had since 1990. We don't feel great about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month's freeze, which also destroyed some $600 million in
crops in the fertile San Joaquin Valley in Central California,
forced navel orange prices to jump from 69 cents a pound to as much
as $1.79 at local stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale avocados remain stable at about $40 per 25-pound box
as most of the harvesting now is occurring in the San Diego area,
which escaped the freeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ventura County is light-harvesting (now),'' said Ross Wileman,
vice president of Mission Produce in Oxnard, about 55 miles west of
Los Angeles. ``The summer is when the bulk of the picking is
accomplished. We would anticipate (prices) will be slightly
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hardest-hit areas, temperatures dropped below 28 degrees
for as long as 10 hours in some areas, killing:
</P>
<P>
   --20 percent of the county's lemon crop, resulting in $43.5
million in losses.
</P>
<P>
   --20 percent of the Valencia oranges, which are used to make
juice. The estimated loss is $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   --15 percent, or $9.2 million, of the avocados.
</P>
<P>
   --10 percent, or $600,000, of navel oranges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been much worse,'' McPhail said. ``There's still
a lot of good fruit out there. Compared to the San Joaquin Valley,
we came through this very well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ventura County, Fillmore-Piru Citrus and Limonera Co. shut
down their orange packinghouse operations after the freeze. As a
result, packers and haulers -- who also handle fruit from the San
Joaquin Valley -- are not expected to be called back to work for
two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Limonera is still packing lemons, while orange packing is
Fillmore-Piru Citrus' only operation.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen at those two plants could not been reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 4,000 people temporarily lost their jobs in the San
Joaquin Valley, where Fresno, Kern, Tulare and Madera counties lost
their entire crop of lemons and 90 percent of their oranges.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Wilson, in one of his last acts as governor last week,
declared the San Joaquin Valley a disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   McPhail said he will not ask the Ventura County Board of
Supervisors to make such a declaration, which is usually reserved
for crop losses of at least 40 percent.

 &HT;    Winter weather's wild ride
 &HT;    By Wendy Hundley and Kavita Kumar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It's going to be a bumpy ride over the next few
days for the Miami/Ohio Valley area as temperatures rise and fall,
and snow turns to rain and back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a roller coaster,'' said National Weather Service
Meteorologist Scott Hickman. ``It's very confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   The ride starts today as another weather system from the
Northern Plains dumps 1 to 3 inches of snow on the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures will rise to the lower 30s, with snowfall ending by
nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures fall to the mid-20s when another system ushers in
light snowfall late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will turn to rain Friday then turn back to snow late in the
day as temperatures fall again.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions sound perfect for more slick highways. But
Hickman says it depends on how fast the frigid air moves into the
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cold air moves in fast enough, we could have icy
roads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason road crews are rushing to replenish salt
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday we were in critical shape,'' said Washington Twp.
Public Works Director Bill Johnson. ``We had completed the township
and we only had 100 tons in the bin.'' Even a light snowfall will
require 150 tons to salt the streets, and road crews had already
spread more than 550 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the township got a shipment of salt Tuesday and
expects another shipment today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to be OK for the storm rolling in,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bellbrook Street Superintendent Dale Wilson is also stocking up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were starting to run low but we've already received 50 tons
and another 50 tons is on the way,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The nasty weather also may have caused two power failures in
Bellbrook that affected 300 residents for several hours Tuesday. In
the first case, a transformer failed; in the second, a section of
underground cable went bad. ``We think both are weather-related,''
said Scott Kelly, a Dayton Power and Light representative.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of snow, ice, and freezing cold has made it
rough for postal carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In Dayton, mail delivery was hampered Saturday by the Level 3
snow emergency restricting travel, according to Micheal Kennedy,
acting postmaster.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, 86 to 90 percent of residents and businesses received
their mail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The weather) just slows us down, but we are out there,''
Kennedy said. ``We are making every effort to get to every house.
People could help us by shoveling where they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Two carriers were injured by falls on icy steps and sidewalks
and one vehicle was in an accident, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By end of (Tuesday) everybody should have got mail,'' Kennedy
said. ``We should be back on normal operations by Thursday. We have
every available person out there delivering mail until 5
(o'clock).''
</P>
<P>
   People who have not received their mail can pick it up at their
local post office.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is contributing to depleted blood supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, with this bad weather, people do not want to leave
their homes (to donate blood),'' said Heidi Gordon, public
relations coordinator for the Community Blood Center. ``As a
result, we are extremely short.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, the Community Blood Center needed 340 units of
type O positive or negative blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do not have the collection to make up for this, we could
be in a situation to call for an appeal,'' Gordon said. ``We
reserve that for the very last means to get people in.''
</P>
<P>
   To encourage people to donate blood, the Community Blood Center
has extended its ``Holiday Hope'' T-shirt give-away until Saturday.
For more information, call (800) 388-GIVE (4483).
</P>
<P>
   Although the weather has caused hardships and inconveniences, it
has also also prompted acts of kindness and generosity.
</P>
<P>
   After a Dayton Daily News article Monday outlined the problems
of feeding the influx of homeless people, Meijer Inc. said Tuesday
it would donate $5,000 to The Other Place, a Dayton day shelter.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, individuals have been filling the need.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lady called and said 'I'm going to the store, what do you
need?''' said Tina Patterson, the shelter's executive director.
``She picked up nine gallons of milk for us. Another lady called
(Tuesday) and brought in three to four meatloafs. We've gotten
enough every day to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   The $5,000 in Meijer gift certificates will be used to buy food
and warm clothing for homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful. But $5,000 doesn't go far when you're feeding
so many people,'' Patterson said. ``People should call and ask what
we need. And we could really use a freezer to store extra food.''
</P>
<P>
   Many groups pitched in to help band members stranded at the
Dayton Mall over the weekend on their way back from the Outback
Bowl in Tampa. Their bus couldn't make it through to Monroe, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Cub Foods donated enough food to feed all 130 high-schoolers and
chaperones. The Miami Twp police department relayed about 30
students, about four or five at a time, to the hospital for
treatment for food poisoning they received during the trip.
Walgreen Co. paid the hospital bills. ``It was a nice, neighborhood
community effort,'' said Tina Colina, a spokeswoman with the Dayton
Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Defiance High School marching band will return
today from Los Angeles _ four days later than expected due to
weather-related flight cancellations _ after they performed Friday
in the Tournament of Roses Parade.
</P>
<P>
   The 250 band members and 100 chaperones and other school
personnel were scheduled to leave the West Coast on five flights
Saturday. One flight made it to Chicago and two to Dallas before
the weather stranded them for the night. Those students made it
back home by Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck for the two flights that never left L.A.
Rescheduled on four different flights leaving this morning, they
are expected to return later today.
</P>
<P>
   The unanticipated four extra days in L.A. meant unanticipated
expenses. According to Ian MacGregor, assistant superintendent of
Defiance City Schools, students without enough money could receive
the needed supplies from the band director. They also got some help
from folks in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people out there were just marvelous,'' MacGregor said.
``The California people gave them free meals, barbecues _ they even
went to a USC basketball game free. We would really like to thank
them for their generosity to help out the kids through this
period.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Ohio couple now living in Southern California sent over
pizzas. Party of Five star Jennifer Love Hewitt sent over Tuesday
night's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The strandees also spent time at Knott's Berry Farm amusement
park, the Santa Monica pier and the pool of their Manhattan Beach
hotel. The Tournament of Roses donated buses so the band could get
around town in the 80-degree weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of homesick kids, but it's good to be homesick
in California,'' band director Vince Polce said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines picked up the hotel and meal tab for the group
forced to stay in Dallas, but Polce expects the final bill to be
$30,000-$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   MacGregor said the school board and boosters club will deal with
the added expenses in the coming weeks.

line for thousands of Russians drawn here during Soviet times by
promises of high pay and patriotic appeals. The colonization of the

The relief, which calls for farmers who claim they were harmed by
discrimination to receive $50,000 tax-free and to be forgiven their
federal debt, is too little, they said, and it has come too late.

FOR DECOROUS DIJON, A SPLASH OF MIAMI FLAIR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 10) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIJON, France _ Miami is a long way from Dijon, further even in
mood than in miles: the one, loud and brash, bouncing with Latin
sounds and tropical colors; the other, sober and conservative amid
the damp clouds and stone buildings of medieval Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in 1991, when Dijon's political elders decided to
embark on the city's largest urban project in decades, they chose a
quintessentially Miami architecture firm to do the job. How come?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the selection of Arquitectonica, headed by the
husband-and-wife team of Bernardo Fort-Brescia and Laurinda Spear,
was the consequence of an earlier, perhaps more fundamental,
moment: the recognition by Dijon that it could modernize the city's
image by sponsoring some daring architecture. So Arquitectonica won
the international competition for the $200 million development by
proposing a striking visual symbol as well as a practical design.
</P>
<P>
   Dijon's ambition was of course hardly original. In the late
1980s, President Francois Mitterrand changed the profile of Paris
with I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre and a host of other
Grands Travaux. French cities, from Lille to Bordeaux, from
Strasbourg to Lyons, have also been calling on renowned architects
to construct new museums and other public buildings. But for Dijon,
this was radical stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Poujade, first elected mayor of Dijon in 1971, is not
still in office 28 years later because he spends money recklessly.
But in the paternalistic tradition of Gaullist politicians, he
likes to look after his electorate.
</P>
<P>
   And when the city's arts lovers began to lament that Dijon's
opera house, concert hall and theater were all inadequate for the
needs of a metropolis of 250,000 inhabitants, he promptly took
note. ``Soon even opposition parties were in favor of a new
auditorium,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the city's business promotion bureau decided
that the sprawling parking lots surrounding a hangarlike
60-year-old exhibition hall _ the site of Dijon's famed annual food
fair _ could be better used. And that led to the idea of creating a
new business district that embraced a new performing-arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Synergy became the buzz word: the arts center would give the
area the prestige to attract investors whose tax payments would
help finance the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Two contiguous plots of land were available on the edge of the
city. On the larger 37-acre site, the city wanted up-grading and
expansion of the existing exhibition hall and construction of a
conference hall, a 180-room hotel, eight office buildings and an
underground car park.
</P>
<P>
   Separated by a road, the smaller site would house the performing
arts center, but _ and this was crucial _ city planners insisted
that the two sites be linked. It was up to the architects
participating in the design competition to suggest how.
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks ago, the performing-arts center was inaugurated and
it became apparent why the competition jury picked Arquitectonica's
solution. With the center designed like a curving elongated
triangle, its 1,600-seat auditorium fills the smaller site, but its
long lobby stretches over the road so that the center's public
entrance is part of the main site. Such is the integrated effect
that it is now as if the road were an afterthought rather than the
defining feature of the design.
</P>
<P>
   The business district has still to be completed, but this
reflects the city's prudence rather than delays. Arquitectonica has
finished the 600-seat conference hall, which is open and operating,
while the exhibition hall has been expanded and an elegant new
entrance added. But aware of the vagaries of the real estate
market, the city decided to secure buyers for the office blocks
(italics)before(end italics) building them. Eventually, the main
components of the district will be linked by a glass-enclosed
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with completion of the performing arts center, Dijon now
has its desired architectural emblem. And there are signs that work
on the hotel and some office space may soon begin. Just as the
Georges Pompidou Center in Paris transformed the Marais, the
Clemenceau district of Dijon _ an undistinguished neighborhood of
1950s and 60s buildings between the historic center and the
railroad station _ has suddenly acquired a bit of class.
</P>
<P>
   For Fort-Brescia and Ms. Spear, who founded Arquitectonica in
1977 when they were still in their mid-20s, Dijon has proved an
interesting challenge. They first made their name in Miami with
brightly colored houses and high-rise condominiums along Brickell
Avenue. One of their buildings, the Atlantis, with a see-through
square at its heart, even became something of a symbol of Miami
when it was featured in ``Miami Vice.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, emerging among the most successful architects of the
post post-Modernist generation, the couple (they have six children)
have designed banks in Lima and Luxembourg, high rises in Shanghai
and Hong Kong, a science museum in Orange County, California, and
now the 57-floor Westin hotel going up in New York at the corner of
42nd Street and Eighth Avenue as part of the Times Square
redevelopment program. Not that Miami has been abandoned: with its
150-strong team of architects, Arquitectonica is also building the
21,000-seat Miami Arena and a new main terminal for Miami
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all this, until Dijon the firm had never designed an
auditorium. And here, as it happens, it was asked to conceive one
unlike any other existing in Europe today.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The tradition is for a city to build a concert hall (like Jean
Nouvel's new hall in Lucerne, Switzerland) or an opera house (like
the Bastille Opera in Paris) that can be used for ballet, or a
separate theater. But Dijon had neither the money nor the public to
justify several new buildings. It therefore asked for a single
auditorium that could be used for all the performing arts, one that
could adjust its acoustics and seating to fit every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Fort-Brescia and Ms. Spear _ they always work
together on designs _ were concerned with the art as well as the
science of the building. In Miami and elsewhere, they have become
famous for their use of bright colors. Here they did not set out to
shock: the center's exterior facades are covered with pale
chassagne stone as well as gray metallic panels and glass. A long
curving window in the entrance lobby and a picture window beside
the road enable passers-by to sense the excitement of the crowds
inside.
</P>
<P>
   One deft touch is an elliptical void in the bridgelike entrance
lobby that allows daylight _ or artificial light at night _ to
brighten the road below and avoid the impression of entering a
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the center, Arquitectonica has provided more warmth
through floors covered in polished granite and red marble, while
the walls of the auditorium shell are covered with two tones of
African wood (the ``shwoosh'' shape of the center is itself
frequently echoed in the decor). The feeling here is one of space,
with something resembling an atrium rising above the refreshments
bar. To move between floors, the public can choose between
elevators, escalators or a stylish elliptical spiral staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the auditorium itself, where Fort-Brescia said he was
looking for ``an arts and crafts feeling,'' the architects have
played with the two tones of wood to create an abstract design. But
theater boxes that descend on either side like terraces, from the
upper balcony to the orchestra seats, are their main innovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're known in the business as Weinberg plateaus,''
explained Fort-Brescia, showing a visitor around the auditorium.
``They create a resonance for acoustics as well as a sense of
intimacy. They create a room within a room.''
</P>
<P>
   For acoustical and scenographic expertise, Arquitectonica turned
to Artec Consultants Inc., the New York-based firm headed by
Russell Johnson, who has left his acoustical trademark on concert
halls in Vancouver, Dallas, Miami and Philadelphia, in Birmingham
in England and, most recently, in Lucerne.
</P>
<P>
   The main acoustical devices here are four large reflectors on
either side of the auditorium, each equipped with a curved,
gold-rubbed curtain that can be raised or lowered depending on the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the orchestra pit can be altered to fit either 60 or
120 musicians, but it can also be raised to extend the size of the
stage or lowered to make room for an additional 200 seats. The
stage itself has enough surrounding room to handle a full-scale
opera. But if an orchestra performs onstage, a semi-circle of
wooden acoustical barriers known as concert towers insures that the
music is not lost backstage.
</P>
<P>
   As always when Artec becomes involved in a project, its experts
will be making adjustments to the acoustics for several months to
come.
</P>
<P>
   More unusually, having handed over the performing arts center,
Fort-Brescia and Ms. Spear will also continue visiting Dijon as the
business district is completed. But the center itself has now moved
from project to reality and the new challenge facing its director,
Jean-Claude Wambst, is to make it work, to use his $7 million
annual budget to develop an artistic program that can draw the
crowds needed to fill the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, the size of the hall will define the program,'' he
explained, ``so for the first few months we will be trying
different types of events, a range of music and ballet. So far, the
public response has been good and the performers have praised the
acoustics.''
</P>
<P>
   Poujade is also happy because Dijon now has a cultural monument
that has won it attention around France. But the city has another
reason to be pleased with Arquitectonica. The cost estimate for the
performing arts center in 1991 was the equivalent of $60.9 million
and the final bill was $61.6 million. City officials more
interested in balanced budgets than operatic arias pronounced
themselves satisfied.

 &HT;    Second place will have to do for Ohio State
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ In the end, all John Cooper could do was try to
accept his team's No. 2 ranking gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' the Ohio State coach said. ``We would have liked
to play in (the national championship Fiesta Bowl) to be No. 1 but
No. 2 isn't all that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State, 11-1, and 24-14 winners over Texas A&AMP;M in the Sugar
Bowl, finished the season ranked second in both the Associated
Press media poll and the USA Today /ESPN coaches poll for the
second time in three seasons. The last time the Buckeyes finished
No. 2 was in 1996, when they lost to Michigan before winning the
Rose Bowl and finishing 11-1.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (13-0), who beat Florida State, 23-16, in the Fiesta
Bowl in Tempe, Ariz., Monday night, is the unanimous No. 1. Florida
State (11-2) is No. 3. Tennessee's victory over the Seminoles
dashed OSU's only hope for a share of a national championship.
Cooper had hoped if FSU won unimpressively in a sloppy game, AP
voters might be convinced to give OSU the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   But they never got the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper said he realized that even if Florida State won, a No. 1
ranking for OSU was a longshot at best; the loss to Michigan State
on Nov. 7 and the Buckeyes lackluster, scoreless second half vs.
Texas A&AMP;M ensured that. ``We've got to blame ourselves for the one
loss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   OSU senior safety Damon Moore said his main beef with the final
rankings is that OSU never got the chance to play Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee's (victory), that pretty much cleared up all the
discussion,'' of which team should be No. 1, Moore said. ``They
deserve it. The only thing I'm disappointed in is they had the
wrong once-beaten team in the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU co-captain Jerry Rudzinski said finishing No. 2 is harder to
swallow the second time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is tougher to deal with than 1996 because we had
the No. 1 ranking for the majority of this season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State was ranked No. 1 for 10 straight weeks and a favorite
to make it to Tempe this season before losing 28-24 to Michigan
State. The Buckeyes subsequent drop in the polls to No. 7 proved
too much to overcome under the new Bowl Championship Series system
and allowed Florida State to nudge them out of a spot in the Fiesta
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Buckeyes finished the season strong, defeating
nemesis Michigan (31-16) and winning their bowl game. It is the
first time since 1982 that OSU has beaten Michigan and won a bowl.
And it is the first time since 1968 that the Buckeyes have beaten
the Wolverines and won a New Year's Day bowl. That year, however,
OSU, 10-0, won the national championship _ which is what will make
the '68 team much more memorable than the Bucks of '98, Rudzinkski
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we were a great team . . . in years to come, no one
will remember the team ranked No. 2,'' Rudzinski said. ``They'll
just remember the national champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior wide receiver David Boston will hold a news conference at
10 a.m. today to announce his decision to stay for his senior
season or enter the NFL draft. Cooper wouldn't say Tuesday what
Boston's decision would be but when told indications seemed to
point toward him leaving, the coach said, ``You're probably
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, named the Sugar Bowl's Most Outstanding Player, holds
nine receiving records at Ohio State, including career touchdowns
(34) and receptions (191). After the Sugar Bowl, Boston said he
would speak to family, coaches and friends before deciding his
future football plans.
</P>
<P>
   College juniors have until Friday to declare themselves eligible
for the NFL draft. Cooper said he is not sure when OSU junior
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer will announce his decision.

SLAY SUSPECT'S MOTHER FOUND FROZEN TO DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The mother of one of two Wyoming men charged in the
killing of a gay college student froze to death after leaving a
bar, Wyoming police officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Cindy T. Dixon, 40, was last seen appearing to
stagger out of a bar in Laramie, Wyo., on Saturday night, said
Sheriff Jim Pond, of Albany County. Wearing a light jacket, she
stepped into a winter night when temperatures were near zero, but
the wind made it feel like 30 below
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after dawn on Sunday, her body was found on the side of
a rural road about eight miles north of town, said Julie Heggie,
the coroner, who said there were no signs of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dixon's death shed light on the troubled life of her
21-year-old son, Russell A. Henderson, 21, a defendant in a case
that gained world attention as a symbol of violence against
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me his parents were dead,'' said Maggie McKinney, who
lives in the trailer park where Henderson lived. Ms. McKinney, who
once worked at a Taco Bell with Henderson, added, ``I didn't even
know he had his parents in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has been charged with kidnapping and first-degree
murder in the death of Matthew Shepard, a 21-year-old college
freshman who was lured from a Laramie bar in October, beaten and
left to die tied to a fence outside of town.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Henderson pistol-whipped Shepard
in a pickup truck and then tied him to the fence. His trial is
scheduled to begin on March 22 in Laramie. A friend of Henderson,
Aaron J. McKinney, is to be tried separately on the same charges
beginning on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have pleaded not guilty. The prosecutor, Cal Rerucha,
announced last week that he would seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Chasity Pasley, Henderson's girlfriend, pleaded guilty to being
an accessory after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson never met his biological father and was adopted as an
infant by a stepfather, said his lawyer, Wyatt Skaggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was abused substantially by various boyfriends'' of his
mother, said Skaggs, a public defender who represented Mrs. Dixon
in several cases in the last decade. ``She had a longstanding
alcohol problem that began years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 10, Russell was removed from his mother's home and went
to live in Laramie with his maternal grandmother, a deeply
religious woman. Under her care, he apparently flourished,
attaining the honor roll in junior high school, excelling in
sports, joining the Future Farmers of America and becoming an Eagle
Scout.
</P>
<P>
   But at 17, he moved out of his grandmother's house and almost
immediately started having problems with the law. He was arrested
twice for drunken driving and once for fighting with a police
officer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Alcohol continued to rule at the house of his mother, a waitress
at a Hardees restaurant. Tuesday, her husband, Charles E. Dixon,
was under arrest in Laramie for violating a restraining order that
stemmed from two counts of battery against his wife.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, on Nov. 4, Dixon slapped his wife
when she refused to go to Wild Willie's Bar for a beer. In other
incidents, in 1996 and 1997, Dixon pleaded no contest to battery
charges in which he was accused of slamming his wife's head into
the dashboard of a car and kicking and shoving her into a
television set.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-page handwritten letter to a judge, Dixon spoke of the
couple's alcohol problems. ``We both say and do a lot of things we
don't mean when we drink,'' he wrote in September 1997, noting that
he had been sober for 17 days. ``We have caused many problems for
our families and ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, he expressed his love for Mrs. Dixon and a desire
for the two of them to seek ``counseling and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   But any reconciliation did not appear to be lasting. On Dec. 31,
after two and a half years of marriage, Dixon filed for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Mrs. Dixon appeared at the Buckhorn bar, alone
and too intoxicated to be served, said Michael Hopkins, the owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bartender that night said he thought she was too drunk to
be served when she came in,'' Hopkins said Tuesday. ``He told her
to go wait by the window until her ride arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, sheriff's deputies questioned Dixon and ``several
subjects'' according to a statement, which concluded, ``The death
of Mrs. Dixon is in no way related to the murder of Matthew
Shepard.''

 &HT;    Florida's No. 2 leader takes the oath
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Bundled in an overcoat against the chill,
asked by the judge if he was ready to become the number two man in
state government, Frank Timothy James Brogan managed Tuesday to
keep a straight face: ``Very cold and yet totally prepared, your
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, on the coldest inauguration in a century, Florida's
newest lieutenant governor was able to provide a measure of comic
relief _ just as he has done for some seven months as Jeb Bush's
running mate and part of the transition team.
</P>
<P>
   When Brogan first joined the ticket, he feigned outrage that he
hadn't been issued a campaign credit card. Last month, when a new
appointee's loud toddler spurred the advice, ``don't upstage the
governor,'' Brogan was quick to add: ``Trust me on this one, Ben.
I've tried.'' And Tuesday, as his boss sprinted ahead along the
inaugural parade route, Brogan stopped to shake seemingly every
hand along the road, shouting to spectators in balconies: ``Get
back to work!''
</P>
<P>
   For the Cincinnati native who moved to Martin County two decades
ago with his high school sweetheart-cum-bride and fellow
schoolteacher, Tuesday marked the latest milestone in a meteoric
political career that has seen him go from school superintendent to
state education commissioner to the governor's suite, all in a span
of four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone ever starts out thinking about something
like this,'' Brogan said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in his loftiest accomplishment so far comes the
toughest, most heart wrenching time in his 45 years: his wife of 22
years, Mary, last month suffered a relapse of the cancer that
through the campaign and election had been in remission for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Brogan, now undergoing radiation therapy, Tuesday remained
optimistic and spoke of her husband's accomplishment. ``I am so
proud,'' she said, tears coming to her eyes. ``I'm a believer that
if you have a dream, if you set a goal, you can make anything
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Already some Tallahassee insiders are beginning to speculate on
a Brogan governorship, possibly in just two years with a George W.
Bush presidency and a Jeb Bush Cabinet post. Brogan has
consistently waved away such talk, including speculation of a
Brogan candidacy in eight years, with the following: You know how
many lieutenant governors have been elected governor? None.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Brogan said he plans to commit himself to all the
promises he and Bush made during the campaign. ``Now, all of the
heavy lifting begins,'' he said.

 &HT;    Storm damage set at $5.2 million
 &HT;    By David Sedore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The storm that tore through Palm Beach
County on Saturday left behind about $5.2 million in flood and wind
damage, most of it at the Port of Palm Beach, county officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The damage total will be given to state Division of Emergency
Management officials, who will decide whether to apply for federal
disaster assistance.
</P>
<P>
   State and county officials cautioned that the damage reports
were incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have some numbers trickling in,'' said Palm Beach
County Public Safety Director Paul Milelli.
</P>
<P>
   By far, Riviera Beach was the hardest-hit community, with about
$3.7 million in damage. About $3 million of that was at the Port of
Palm Beach, evenly split between flood and wind damage.
</P>
<P>
   The port numbers illustrate some problems county officials
experienced in adding up a total. The $3 million figure the port
gave included $500,000 in damage to Tropical Shipping, which had
previously reported $1.5 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Milelli, however, said his office couldn't contact Tropical
Shipping officials Tuesday to confirm the company's total.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Loftus, a spokesman for the state Division of Emergency
Management, said damage in the rest of Florida totaled about
$500,000, of which $307,000 was in Osceola County near Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The county will forward its request for assistance to the
division, which makes a recommendation to the governor, who then
asks the federal government to make a disaster declaration.
</P>
<P>
   That would free up federal loans and assistance for businesses,
homeowners and government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident we can get (Small Business Administration)
low interest loans,'' Milelli said. ``We feel fairly confident we
can get individual support in form of loans and assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Riviera Beach $3,738,000
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach Gardens $386,000
</P>
<P>
   North Palm Beach $40,000
</P>
<P>
   Unincorporated $1,003,655
</P>
<P>
   County Total $5,167,655

TACTICS AT ISSUE AS U.S. CALLS LAST WITNESS IN MICROSOFT CASE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mass.) (fb) 
By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government called its last witness in the
Microsoft trial on Tuesday after presenting 110 pages of written
testimony that amount to a summation of _ and economic
justification for _ the Justice Department's sweeping antitrust
suit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the testimony by the witness, Franklin M. Fisher, an
economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was a
detailed review of major allegations in the government's case. But
he also sought to advance the case and strengthen the argument for
strong sanctions against Microsoft with his analysis of Microsoft's
pricing tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher asserts that Microsoft commits predatory pricing by
giving away its Internet Explorer browser. The doctrine of
predatory pricing _ defined as a monopolist selling goods below
cost _ has been generally rejected by courts in recent years on the
theory that it is difficult to prove both the practice and any
resulting harm to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher argued that Microsoft decided to give away its
browser software only to thwart the threat to its dominance posed
by its main rivals in Internet software, the Netscape
Communications Corp., developer of the Navigator Web browser, and
Sun Microsystems Inc., creator of the Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he added, the tricky matter of trying to determine if a
price is below some technical definition of its cost to produce
does not apply because ``Microsoft distributes its browser at a
zero price,'' though it has spent more than $100 million a year
since 1995 on browser development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classifying Microsoft's pricing as predatory and
anti-competitive,'' he stated, ``does not require reaching the
difficult questions that are usually faced in predatory pricing
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher also provided a pre-emptive rebuttal to an MIT colleague
and former student, Richard Schmalensee, who will testify next, as
Microsoft's expert witness on economics. In his own report to the
court, which has not been released, Schmalensee argues that the
price of Microsoft's industry-standard Windows operating system is
too low for Windows to be legally classified as a monopoly. The
comparatively low price of Windows _ less than 5 percent of the
total cost of an average personal computer _ has been cited by many
economists as inconsistent with the government's allegation of an
enduring monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher contends that such analysis means only that
Microsoft's management is taking the long view of monopoly. ``The
proper conclusion from Schmalensee's argument cannot be that
Microsoft lacks monopoly power,'' Fisher wrote in his testimony.
``If any conclusion can be drawn, it would be that Microsoft is not
maximizing its short-run profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's product pricing, Fisher testified, should be viewed
as part of a ``broader campaign to eliminate Netscape's browser and
Java as sources of potential competition to Microsoft's operating
system monopoly _ a campaign characterized by actions by which
Microsoft lost money in order to raise rivals' costs and exclude
them from the market.''
</P>
<P>
   In court on Tuesday, a Microsoft lawyer, Michael Lacovara,
opened his cross-examination of Fisher with more than an hour of
detailed challenges to the methods Fisher used to determine the
market shares of competing Web browsers. Lacovara also introduced
criticisms of Fisher by judges in previous cases in which he
appeared as an expert witness.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, an assertive, 64-year-old economist, has testified in
dozens of antitrust cases in the computer industry _ though he was
on the other side the last time, as the chief economic witness for
IBM Corp. in its marathon antitrust confrontation with the Justice
Department, a case the government dropped in 1982 after 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers say the company is being attacked by Fisher
for being much the kind of company IBM was when he was defending
it. ``Monopoly profits are earned through high prices and inferior
products,'' Fisher wrote in a 1983 book about the IBM case. ``The
notion that acts showing a pattern of lower prices and better
products are the behavior of a monopolist is a confusion of the
workings of competition with its opposite _ monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said in a statement that ``Professor Fisher's
testimony would give readers of his 1983 book whiplash.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Microsoft ended the cross-examination of
William H. Harris, the chief executive of Intuit Inc., which makes
the industry-leading personal finance software, Quicken. The
government also played excerpts from the taped deposition in which
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates was questioned last August about the
company's dealings with Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gates professed no knowledge of any of the interactions
with Intuit that are at issue in the case, the government
introduced e-mail messages in which employees had briefed him on
the negotiations in exhaustive detail.
</P>
<P>
   Shown one such message and asked if he had been informed of its
subject, Gates said: ``In the sense that one of the e-mails that
may have come into my mailbox might have related to that, I don't
doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the questioning of Harris had centered on Intuit's
interest in becoming an even larger player in Internet commerce.
Microsoft's lead trial lawyer, John Warden, asked him about America
Online's proposed purchase of Netscape, a deal that Microsoft
argues is proof of healthy competition in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't that change the entire landscape of the Internet
industry?'' Warden asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't believe so,'' Harris said. ``There's a great deal
of merger activity in this industry. Microsoft is rumored to be in
discussions for acquisitions. I don't think the AOL-Netscape deal
will be the last one we hear of.''

JETS COUNTING ON MARTIN TO KEEP HIS COOL AND DELIVER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bill Parcells' message to the Jets this week
is simple: one bad play can ruin a season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets play the Jacksonville Jaguars at the Meadowlands
on Sunday in a divisional playoff game _ the winner goes to the
American Conference championship, a mere four quarters from the
Super Bowl _ Curtis Martin will be a vital part of the Jet offense.
Martin said his heart ``will be racing five times faster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is speeded up,'' he said. ``Everything is mental.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Martin expects to be in control. He has to be. That's why
he was hired by Parcells for $36 million and two draft choices in
the off season.
</P>
<P>
   Martin says he will ``focus on every play, every little thing
every day in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Parcells says, `If you mess up, you're gone,' '' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Parcells hasn't told Martin his job's in jeopardy if he
commits a mental error? ``He's made threats,'' said Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, Martin has responded this season with
the second-highest rushing season in Jets history, 1,287 yards. He
carried a club-record 369 times and fumbled twice. That translates
to an unimposing 3.5 yards a carry _ the lowest average of his
four-season career. But Martin has also amassed another 365 yards
on 43 receptions. Only the Colts' Marshall Faulk and the Broncos'
Terrell Davis had more yardage from scrimmage in the American
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thrive on chaos,'' Martin said Tuesday as he reflected on
his reaction to pressure.
</P>
<P>
   There are times, despite the noise of the crowd and the grunting
of the players, when left guard Todd Burger can hear Martin talking
out loud and complaining _ about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, come on, now!'' Martin admonishes himself while he's
running with the football, and fails to take advantage of a hole,
or it suddenly closes because a teammate hasn't cleared the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's going crazy out there is when I'm calmest,'' Martin
said, ``no matter how critical the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago with the Patriots he helped send the Steelers to a
divisional playoff defeat with a 78-yard scoring run among three
touchdowns, churning out 166 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he was in pain for almost half the season following
a thigh injury suffered in Game 4 against Miami. But he never
complained. Martin has produced a 100-yard game eight times (with
the Jets winning seven).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is an odd fact to consider: The Jets have also won
the four games this season in which Martin turned in his poorest
performances _ 42 yards on 30 carries (at Kansas City), 54 yards in
21 carries (against Buffalo), 38 yards in 20 carries (at Buffalo),
and 37 yards in 17 carries (against Seattle). In each case, Martin
still got the ball time and time again despite not being able to do
much of anything. But the rest of the offense did.
</P>
<P>
   For the Jets have come up with a novel approach to winning even
when the running game isn't there. They continue to run the ball
anyway. Martin is such a potentially explosive performer that no
matter how badly he begins a game, defenses often stack up to stop
him.
</P>
<P>
   That has helped Vinny Testaverde establish one of the most
dangerous play-action offenses in pro football. A high percentage
of Jets' plays start out with Testaverde either pitching the ball
to Martin _ or faking the pitch. So even while Martin may be
piddling along at 3.5 yards a carry, defenses play him to run and
Testaverde winds up completing 60 percent of his passes.
</P>
<P>
   If Jacksonville succeeds in halting Martin on Sunday, as it did
the Patriots' Robert Edwards (17-28) last Sunday, it still will
contend with the Jets' insistence on carrying the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Martin realizes he is here to stay. He had lived all
season in a barely furnished apartment in Garden City, N.Y. He
bought a bed at Sleepy's, he has a radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television's over at the other place that I'm going to
furnish after the season's over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, he plans to stay.

RYAN'S PRESENCE CHANGED RANGERS' PLACE IN BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Baseball measures a player's greatness by
election to its Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers right-hander Nolan Ryan, who established
major-league records with his 5,714 strikeouts and seven no-hitters
during an illustrious 27-year career, joined that elite fraternity
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible members of the Baseball Writers Association of America
designated Ryan for enshrinement on 491 of 497 ballots. Ryan's
inclusion on 98.79 percent of those ballots represented the
second-highest percentage in the voting's history behind only the
98.84 percent received in 1992 by right-hander Tom Seaver.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan's greatness, though, cannot be measured simply in terms of
his distinguished accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, whom the Rangers signed Dec. 7, 1988, as a free agent,
spent his final five seasons with the Arlington franchise. Ryan
uplifted an organization that never before participated in the
postseason and provided it instant credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Nolan elevated us to a status that we didn't
have,'' Rangers president Tom Schieffer said. ``He was a superstar,
and people recognized him as a superstar. Then, he came here and
performed above superstar status to become a legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan realized four celebrated milestones during his stint with
the Rangers. Oakland's Rickey Henderson emerged as ``The Ryan
Express''' 5,000th strikeout victim Aug. 22, 1989, at Arlington
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   No-hitter No. 6 occurred June 11, 1990, against the Athletics in
Oakland, and Ryan recorded his 300th victory less than two months
later during the Rangers' 11-3 triumph July 31 against the Brewers
in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolan gave us a mystique and a presence that we just didn't
have before,'' Schieffer said. ``I think his contribution to the
franchise is literally immeasurable.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan recorded his seventh no-hitter against the Toronto Blue
Jays on May 1, 1991, at Arlington Stadium, and became the oldest
pitcher (44 years, three months and one day) to throw one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't play with him while we were young,'' former Rangers
right-hander Charlie Hough said. ``We were both in our 40s, but his
work program and just his desire to excel was very impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was probably a better pitcher when he was older. He
never quit learning. I think he was a more accomplished pitcher in
his late-30s and early-40s than when he was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer remembers Ryan conducting postgame interviews for 45
minutes while riding a stationary bicycle after his seventh
no-hitter and arriving at the stadium the next morning before 9
a.m. for his scheduled workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a person whose success never fazed him,'' Schieffer
said. ``He was always the same person no matter how great the
accomplishment. To me, that always spoke volumes about the kind of
character and not just the talent he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers catcher Jim Sundberg, who played his only season
with Ryan in 1989, recalled an incident from 1975 at Arlington
Stadium that demonstrated the hard-throwing right-hander's
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who pitched for the Angels from 1972-79, found himself
opposed on the mound by Rangers left-hander Clyde Wright. The
latter served as a teammate of Ryan's during the 1972 and '73
seasons with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, aware of Ryan's routine between innings from his stint
with the Angels, took advantage of this local knowledge. Wright
knew that Ryan almost always stepped off the mound and surveyed the
area surrounding it after throwing his final warm-up pitch before
beginning an inning.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that generosity then overwhelmed Wright, who
deposited a ``gift'' for Ryan on the infield grass in front of the
mound. Ryan located this ``gift'' _ a rubber snake _ before the
inning's first pitch and did not appear amused, Sundberg recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picks it up and fires it into our dugout, and it looked
like he was pretty mad about it,'' Sundberg said. ``That typified
Nolan, though. He was such a different person on the mound. He was
very intense and was kind of an intimidating force on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that incident kind of showed Clyde's playfulness and
Nolan's unwillingness to play. Nolan was all business once he got
to the mound. There was no play to anything that Nolan did once he
got on the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   The mound no longer serves as Ryan's pedestal.
</P>
<P>
   That remains reserved for the Hall of Fame.

NBA PLAYERS VOTE ON ENDORSING THEIR NEGOTIATORS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By MIKE WISE   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the most chaotic day of the six-month-old lockout,
the National Basketball Association players' union tried Tuesday to
arrange an almost impossible travel schedule for its 400-plus
members while trying to prevent the group from falling into
complete disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 250 players are expected to vote in New York on Wednesday
on whether to endorse their negotiating committee's recommendation
to reject the owners' latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   That decision could either seal the fate of the season or spur
last-minute negotiations with Commissioner David Stern and the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and his negotiating team have said that if no agreement is
reached by Thursday, they would recommend to the league's board of
governors that the season be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Some players arrived in New York on Tuesday night, unsure of how
the vote would be taken. The balloting will only be open to players
at the meeting and it will not be a ratification vote to approve
the owners' final offer. Instead, players will be asked whether
they support the union negotiating committee's recommendation to
reject that proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Repudiating the committee would be tantamount to acceptance of
the league's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put it to the test,'' said Patrick Ewing, the
union president, ``but we're going to make sure they stand by their
negotiating committee.''
</P>
<P>
   A final decision on the balloting rules won't be established
until Wednesday morning. On Tuesday night union officials appeared
to be leaning toward an open vote rather than a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Isiah Thomas, the former union president who has been openly
critical of Billy Hunter, the executive director of the union, and
its negotiating committee, was catching a flight to New York on
Tuesday night. Thomas said he had been contacted by 30 to 40
players Tuesday about taking a stronger role in the labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do whatever they want me to do,'' Thomas said. ``My
role will just to be to help some of the players really understand
the process and understand the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   League officials said they had heard reports that a number of
players had trouble contacting the union regarding the time and
place of the vote and that field representatives for the union had
called designated players and told them that the specific purpose
of the vote was to endorse the negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer, said, ``If
that's what's going on, then this so-called vote sounds more like a
bargaining tactic rather than a striking example of a union
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   A union official, speaking on condition of anonymity, responded:
``The NBA has openly solicited for a vote and now it's a bargaining
tactic? This is a simple case of, you better be careful of what you
ask for because you might just get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the movement for accepting the owners' offer continues to
grow, both sides privately were expecting the union to reaffirm its
solidarity before requesting a last round of bargaining with Stern
and the owners negotiating committee.
</P>
<P>
   League officials have said Thursday's deadline is firm to cancel
the season if no agreement is reached. Yet the pervading sentiment
among many union officials was that, in spite of the deadline
established by the league, a deal could be reached before the
weekend was over.
</P>
<P>
   But that scenario would only unfold if the union relented on its
desire to receive 57 percent of revenues in the last year of a
six-year agreement and give the owners their proposal on a new
rookie system. In exchange, the union would most likely want
several exceptions to the salary cap that deal with player
flexibility and free agency.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are moving to within striking distance on minimum
salaries and capping the high-end players, though they remain
nearly $3 million apart on the highest-salaried contracts.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of an 11th-hour settlement does not take into
account issues aside from economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're successful in ramming this deal down the throats of
the players, no one wins,'' said agent Keith Glass. ``Let's face
it, the damage has been done. The NBA is no longer fantastic.
Stern's attitude has alienated most of the players. Whether they
vote yes or not, that's not going to quell that animosity. We're
not the feel-good kind of league anymore. Those days are over.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both sides will have their full negotiating committees in town
by Wednesday night, and the league's board of governors has
scheduled a meeting for 11 a.m. Thursday. Stern and the deputy
commissioner, Russ Granik, have said they will recommend canceling
the rest of the season if no deal has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   If the union had a scheduling nightmare on its hands as it tried
to get as many of its 400-players into New York as possible, it was
also battling outside influence.
</P>
<P>
   Implying that he would assume an active role if the union's
negotiating committee recommendation was rejected, Thomas added,
``The players need to take control of their own union again and
remember that all the people who supposedly are making their
decisions were hired by them to work for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they can resolve this inside their union, without
having to go outside. However if they are willing to go outside, I
would be more than willing to help.''
</P>
<P>
   The union's negotiating committee met Tuesday afternoon and then
began telephoning as many players as they could with the intention
of swaying them toward coming to New York. But several agents
wondered whether a representative body of players would be voting.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kebu Stewart, a second-round pick of the
Philadelphia 76ers last season who made the league minimum salary,
was having a hard time finding a round trip ticket from Los Angeles
for less than $1,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he would vote for the deal, but he is an
example of somebody who hasn't gotten a paycheck in a long time,''
said Eric Rudolph, Stewart's agent. ``Right now, he's in
California. His voice won't be heard from because he can't come.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is expected to hold the vote Wednesday afternoon after
a series of slide presentations of both the union's and the
league's final offer. Stern has been pushing for a player vote, and
the union finally agreed to one after the owners' negotiating
committee voted 9-0 on Monday to reject the union's final offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gamble, but it's time to take the pulse of our guys,''
said one member of the union's negotiating committee, who requested
anonymity.

 &HT;    Frigid Georgia may see snow
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro Atlantans coped with winter and braced for
possible snow in the traditional way Tuesday: by buying milk, bread
and car batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Today's predicted low of 18 and high of 40, coupled with moist
air moving in from the northwest, may have set the stage for snow
to fall _ and stick _ in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northern Georgia counties will wake up to snow,'' was the word
from the National Weather Service Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, not everyone coped well with the single-digit
night temperatures of the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   A broken furnace left classrooms frigid in southeast Atlanta's
Tull Waters Elementary School until propane space heaters, burning
all night, made temperatures bearable.
</P>
<P>
   Dorm rooms at Morris Brown College were icy for two days until
furnace problems there could be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   A sea of baggage at Hartsfield International Airport serves as a
reminder of weekend storms in the Midwest that caused travelers to
be separated from their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 500 pieces between the Continental and United
carousels,'' said Ed McDuffie, who picked through the luggage with
a computer printout, trying to match bags with owners. A similar
pile waits at Delta's carousels.
</P>
<P>
   Also at Hartsfield on Tuesday were about 200 soldiers waiting to
be bused to Fort Gordon, Fort Jackson, Fort McClellan and Fort
Benning. Returning from holiday visits home, they were delayed
almost 36 hours by weather-related delays.
</P>
<P>
   Space heaters were the cause of fires in Cherokee County, said
Fire Chief Billy Moody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 66 percent more structural fires than usual for this
time of year, and an increase in calls about carbon monoxide alarms
going off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several automobile parts stores had a run on batteries Tuesday
as temperatures across the state struggled for the second day in a
row to top the freezing mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``What few times we get this type of cold, we get a lot of
people that didn't take the time to put in antifreeze or check
their batteries,'' said Kim Ward, owner of Auto Zone in Rome, where
Tuesday's low was 14 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Some Georgia farmers are suffering because their crops need
warmth now. Cattle growers, already plagued by hay shortages,
watched helplessly as their rye and oat crops, intended to serve as
winter grazing, began freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Peach growers, however, were glad to see the cold temperatures
because peaches require temperatures below 40 degrees in order to
set their fruit, Riddle said.

MISSING COUPLE'S LANDLORD HELD IN $1.3 MILLION FRAUD
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The landlord of a missing Manhattan couple laundered
$1.3 million to avoid state taxes and also carried out a
sophisticated scheme that involved assuming the identity of a man
who died in 1994, prosecutors said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The landlord, Robert Rodriguez, 57, was arraigned Tuesday on
charges of laundering business revenues through check-cashing
services in New Jersey. Prosecutors said he would be arraigned
Wednesday on charges that he created bank accounts in the name of
the dead man and racked up $7,000 in phone bills and credit card
purchases and never paid them. The U.S. attorney's office in
Manhattan is also investigating Rodriguez for possible federal tax
fraud, his lawyers disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, appearing drawn and tired, said nothing during his
arraignment Tuesday. Judge James Sullivan of Criminal Court in
Manhattan set his bail at $500,000 in cash and ordered him held
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, an immigrant from Cuba, came to the attention of the
authorities when he vanished for two weeks after the November 1997
disappearance of Michael Sullivan and Camden Sylvia, a couple who
were tenants in his building at 76 Pearl St., near the financial
district.
</P>
<P>
   After Rodriguez reappeared, police said he refused for more than
a year to cooperate with the investigation or allow a search of his
property.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, law enforcement officials searched Rodriguez's house
and his son's house, both in Orange County, N.Y., and the senior
Rodriguez's locksmith shop on the ground floor of the Pearl Street
building. But the authorities said Tuesday that those searches had
not immediately produced evidence linking Rodriguez to the couple's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, 54, an actor and an admission clerk at an art gallery,
and Ms. Sylvia, 37, who worked in a real-estate agency, had argued
with Rodriguez over a lack of heat in their apartment on Nov. 7,
1997, the day they disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau and Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the charges
against Rodriguez had arisen from the investigation into the
couple's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez's lawyers insisted Tuesday that he has been
cooperating with law enforcement officials and angrily criticized
the tactics being used against him. They said he was not guilty of
the tax and fraud charges, had nothing to do with the couple's
disappearance and was a victim of over-zealous law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The new charges demonstrated the breadth of the law enforcement
investigation into Rodriguez. Safir disclosed that police had flown
planes equipped with sensors that detect buried bodies over areas
in upstate New York as part of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The search for David King, a former business partner of
Rodriguez who disappeared in 1991, is also continuing, law
enforcement officials said. DNA tests on a body exhumed from a
potter's field last winter were inconclusive, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Rodriguez's scheme involving the dead man was
highly sophisticated. They said Rodriguez apparently did not know
and was not related to the man, Allen Rodriguez, a resident of
upstate New York who managed apartment buildings in Newburgh and
died of AIDS in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez somehow obtained the maiden name of the dead man's
mother and his place of birth, police said. They said that between
April 1996 and November 1998, he established and used an elaborate
system of accounts in the man's name. He opened a bank account at
Chemical Bank, deposited money into it and wrote checks from it,
according to prosecutors. They said he obtained postal money orders
under the man's name to pay bills, and set up cellular and business
telephone accounts and a cable television account.
</P>
<P>
   In the fraud case, Rodriguez was charged with scheming to
defraud, grand larceny, criminal impersonation, forgery and theft
of services. In the tax case, he was charged with failing to file
tax returns for one of his three businesses between 1995 and 1997
and filing a false return for the business in 1994. If convicted of
all the charges, he faces a maximum of 10 to 20 years in prison.

NAMATH LIKES JETS' CHANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (See also FBN-JETS) 
(bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Perhaps it's because Vinny Testaverde is a Jet
wearing the same style uniform Joe Namath did way back when, or
perhaps it's because Sunday's playoff game against Jacksonville is
only two days shy of the 30th anniversary of the most famous Super
Bowl of all.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever his reasoning, Namath said Tuesday that, yes, the
Jets could do it again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see teams get better and better down the stretch,'' said
Namath, the most valuable player of Super Bowl III as he considered
the Jets' six-game winning streak. ``But they still have to go out
and beat a strong Jacksonville team.''
</P>
<P>
   But does Testaverde have what it takes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I believe that,'' said Namath, who was on a conference
call reminiscing about the Super Bowl victory over the Baltimore
Colts which he had brashly predicted beforehand. ``I don't believe
there's a question there. Testaverde has the background, the
experiences of being down low to the ground, being so low, as low
as you can get at times. He's been up, high as a champion, a
Heisman winner. He's been through it. I really believe the
experiences he's had over the years have made him the quarterback
he is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Namath remains an unabashed Jet fan, and he still talks like a
member of the team. He tries not to be too high at this moment, one
of the franchise's few high points since Super Bowl III, which was
in January 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even started thinking Super Bowl,'' he explained.
``If you do beat Jacksonville, you've got to face another strong
team, probably the Broncos at Denver. I don't even want to think
ahead. But I've become a believer that anything can happen. I know
that when the Jets beat the Colts, all the underdogs out there
believed anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But then came the stretch of bad years.
</P>
<P>
   Namath's Super Bowl teammate Dave Herman, the right tackle,
recalled that period. The Jets had been champions for the 1968
season, and then captured the American Football League East
Division title in 1969, and not another division championship until
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the ability to maintain that loyalty and look to the day
it got better,'' said Herman. ``If I had to go back to 1968 and
look forward again, I would never have thought it would take the
team that long to get back to where it is today.''

AGGRESSIVE COMPETITOR BEYOND BRITISH MARKET
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BC-AIRTOUCH.) 
 (nk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Vodafone Group has grown to be Britain's leading mobile
phone company by employing an aggressive mixture of foreign
expansion and domestic price-cutting in a furiously competitive
market.
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures released this month showed that Vodafone signed
up a much-higher-than-expected net of 933,000 new customers in
Britain alone in the last three months of 1998, in part reflecting
a push before the holidays to lure new customers _ particularly to
its pay-as-you-go package, which does not require long contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Pay-as-you-go customers, who operate mobile phones using a
prepaid card bought at supermarkets and other retailers, accounted
for 755,000 of the new customers. This system operates amid an
intense price war in which Vodafone has consistently beaten
Cellnet, the No. 2 mobile phone operator. Cellnet added 658,000
users in the last quarter of 1998, 455,000 of them on pay-as-you-go
services. Orange and One to One are also rivals in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone was spun off from Racal Electronics in 1988 with a
market value of (PS)1.7 billion. Along with Cellnet, it dominated
the British mobile phone market, drawing heavy criticism from
customers about high prices. By last July, it had outperformed the
market fivefold and ranks among the most successful British
companies of the 1990s. It is one of the nation's top 10 companies
in market value, and its management style is generally described as
highly enthusiastic and assertive.
</P>
<P>
   The main criticism from investors is that Vodafone emphasizes
the gaining of customers in its home market rather than profit per
customer. Its results for the six-month period ending on Sept. 30,
reported in November, showed a 60 percent increase in annual pretax
profit, to (PS)476.9 million on sales of (PS)1.562 billion, a 34
percent increase compared with results in the period a year
earlier. But that surge did not disguise the fact that the increase
in profit in its home market was only 7 percent, to (PS)303 million
_ a figure that set back share prices in November. The company said
at the time that price battles cost it (PS)110 million and that a
further (PS)35 million had been spent on acquiring customers.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, said in November
that he expected ``total market penetration in all the markets in
which we operate to reach 50 percent by the end of 2003, a year
earlier than we projected last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's customers outside Britain are mainly in Northern and
Western Europe, notably Sweden, France, Germany and the
Netherlands. The European operations of Airtouch Communications,
the American company Vodafone is seeking to acquire, are mainly in
Southern Europe _ Spain, Italy and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone said on Monday that in the last quarter of 1998, it
acquired 862,000 net new customers outside its British market. That
brought its customer base to 4.87 million in Britain and 4.26
million outside Britain, for a total of 9.13 million.

TRIAL BY FIRE IS SET TO BEGIN FOR UNTESTED SPEAKER-TO-BE
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IMPEACH, IMPEACH-MANAGERS, IMPEACH-LEGAL) 
 (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the 17 days that he has known he will be
speaker, Rep. Dennis Hastert has hardly had time to move into his
new office. The cupboards are bare, the desktop empty and
glistening. But he has shipped in a few items, including a ceramic
puppy on a quilted pillow, that give a softer, friendlier feel to
an office that was dominated for the last four years by Newt
Gingrich's Tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   The new, more human-scale approach has given Hastert a head
start in soothing the rancor that has afflicted the House and that
intensified with the impeachment of President Clinton. But several
Republicans and analysts here say that Hastert, who was officially
nominated Tuesday by Republicans to be speaker and is to be elected
and sworn into office on Wednesday, faces a roiling political
landscape that will take more than good will to tame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big job, and I'm not coming into this deluded,''
Hastert, a former high school teacher and wrestling coach, said
Tuesday in a short news conference that sounded like a locker-room
pep talk, short on specifics and long on can-do spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Republican emphasized that he would meet Democrats
halfway and would use common sense when dealing with them. To get
beyond the sour feelings left by impeachment, Hastert said, ``We
need to make the effort, and I'm going to make that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The House ``has discharged its job on impeachment,'' he
insisted. ``We're going to have to pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said his priorities were to overhaul Social Security,
cut taxes, improve education and strengthen the military. Right
there, he starts out at odds with Democrats in the House and the
Clinton administration, who want to devote all of the federal
budget surplus to saving Social Security. Hastert believes that
some of the surplus can be used to cut taxes and increase military
spending.
</P>
<P>
   But given the political turmoil on Capitol Hill, the policy
differences with Democrats are almost the least of Hastert's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   He picks up the baton at a time when his own party has chewed up
his two predecessors, Gingrich and Bob Livingston, both of whom
started with more experience, higher profiles and a broader base
within the House.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he has only a slim, 11-vote majority, meaning that
on almost any issue, a small group of conservatives or moderates
can change the course of legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the longstanding tensions between conservatives and
moderates continue, but last month's impeachment proceedings have
poisoned the partisan atmosphere here even more. The standoff
between the parties is expected to worsen as the next presidential
campaign comes into focus and as Democrats step up efforts to
retake the House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   They will be led by Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, the minority
leader, whose ambitions _ he plans either to run for president or
work to elect enough Democrats to the House so that he can take
over as speaker _ can only cloud the field for Hastert.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment has also created new tensions between the House and
the Senate, whose failure to work together last year on tax cuts
and other budget matters left the Republicans with few policy
accomplishments at the end of the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   With the 106th Congress opening on Wednesday, the question that
many Republicans are asking, as one aide put it, is this: ``Will
Denny Hastert be able to speak for the House and be the voice of
authority?''
</P>
<P>
   As he seeks to unite his party and run the House, Hastert labors
under the widespread impression that he defers to Rep. Tom DeLay of
Texas, the third-ranking Republican in the House. Hastert, who was
DeLay's chief deputy whip, has been sharing an office and staff
with DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay belittled the notion that he controls Hastert. ``That talk
is nothing more than fabrication trying to split leadership,'' he
said. ``It has no relevance.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Denny has always been his own man, even when he was
my chief deputy whip. That's why I wanted him my chief deputy whip.
He's not a yes-man. He's not in my shadow. He was more or less an
equal. That's why I wanted him at the leadership table.''
</P>
<P>
   As DeLay's deputy and with no overt ambition of his own, Hastert
has had little opportunity to build his own base of support and no
need for the kind of outside political advisers Gingrich developed.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said they worried that Hastert, untested and
unknown in the national political arena, might be overwhelmed by
the job of speaker. But most appear eager, for now, to think he
represents a change for the good _ a ``breath of fresh air,'' as
Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate from Utica, N.Y., said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, a moderate Republican from Connecticut,
said, ``I get down on my knees and thank God that he's from north
of the Mason-Dixon line,'' a reference to the Southern cast to most
of the recent Republican leadership. ``He's a conservative but not
an ideologue.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.D. Hayworth, a conservative Republican from Arizona, said
that because of his low-key nature, Hastert would not be vulnerable
to being ``demonized'' by Democrats. ``He's demon-proof,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, a conservative Republican from California,
said that Hastert's job would be difficult but that he had the
right personality for it. ``He's a workhorse, not a show horse,''
Dreier said. ``He won't engage in hyperbole, and he won't be making
strident speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreier added that Hastert was his own man. ``No one is
controlling him,'' he said.

   AT&AMP;T is the nation's biggest communications company, but it has
lagged in offering the high-speed data links used by Internet
providers. C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman since 1997, is
trying to change that.
</P>
<P>
   So while the deal with At Home is marginal in immediate
financial value for AT&AMP;T _ worth up to $100 million, according to
analysts and to executives close to the deal _ it is a big leap
strategically. The executives said the deal's financial value could
increase if At Home exercised options to expand it in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a blue-chip Internet reference account for AT&AMP;T, which
has not been an especially visible player in making backbone
wholesale deals with new-age Internet companies,'' said Christopher
Mines, an analyst for Forrester Research, a consulting firm in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is also a big technical step forward for At Home. Using
the AT&AMP;T systems, At Home intends to become one of the first major
data communications companies to connect Internet routers directly
to fiber optic lines. That could give At Home an especially fast
and advanced network.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, At Home has mostly used systems provided by the
Sprint Corp. that incurred a cost to At Home for each unit of data
transmitted. Under the AT&AMP;T deal, however, At Home will essentially
own an entire communications pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably just bought themselves a 5 percent increase in
their operating margin,'' said Richard A. Bilotti, an analyst for
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He estimated that those margins now are
between 25 and 30 percent for At Home's residential business.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the deal, At Home asked
long-distance companies to submit bids for its business last June,
and other bidders were Sprint, Qwest, Level 3, Frontier, Williams
and IXC.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the bidders were on an equal technical footing when
it came to winning the At Home contract, and that is not just
because some of the new carriers have not yet completed their fiber
optic networks.
</P>
<P>
   At Home wants to connect Internet routers directly to a sort of
fiber optic transmission gear known as wave-division multiplexing,
or WDM, equipment. It is suited to systems that carry only data but
also to those that carry voice traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Some telecommunications equipment companies, primarily Northern
Telecom of Canada, tend to build into their WDM gear another sort
of fiber optic technology known as Sonet, which facilitates voice
traffic but costs more.
</P>
<P>
   At Home, which only transmits data, did not want to pay for the
use of Sonet, so carriers like Qwest, which uses a lot of Northern
Telecom equipment, found themselves at a disadvantage, according to
executives close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tele-Communications Inc., the big cable television company that
has agreed to be acquired by AT&AMP;T, is also the largest shareholder
in At Home. But Milo Medin, At Home's chief technical officer, said
that was not a factor in its choice of AT&AMP;T.

ADVERTISING : A MAN OF MORE THAN ONE HAT ENJOYS AN UNCONVENTIONAL
ARRANGEMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It has long been said that anyone who represents
himself or herself in court has a fool for a lawyer and a fool for
a client. But the verdict may be somewhat different in the case of
a marketing executive who has had himself for an agency and an
agency executive who has had himself for a client.
</P>
<P>
   That person is one and the same: William W. Tucker, managing
partner at the Tucker Partnership, a New York agency with estimated
billings of $40 million from such clients as Fordham University,
the General Electric Co. and the Quaker State Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker has also been wearing another hat, as vice president for
marketing at Quaker State. In that capacity, he has overseen his
agency's creation of advertising for the company, most recently an
unusually frank and edgy campaign featuring Denis Leary, the
acerbic comedian, as a plain-talking pitchman for what the
television and radio spots bill as the ``sensible technology'' of
the Quaker State motor oil brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so unconventional, it was hard to get my head
around,'' Tucker said in a recent telephone interview from Irving,
Texas, where Quaker State is based. ``Quaker State was saying: `We
will hire your agency. And your agency will lend us you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Agency guys like me have wondered for years what people inside
the marketing department do when they're not talking to us,'' he
added with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   The unconventional arrangement typifies the increasing
willingness of consumer marketers to experiment with nontraditional
methods to handle product advertising, particularly in categories
in which competition has been intensifying. In some instances,
marketers have turned to management consultants rather than Madison
Avenue for advice and strategy on building brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week, we see a story about consultants in advertising,''
Tucker said. ``This is a story of how an agency has gone inside and
become the client to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Quaker State's willingness to ``think out of the
box,'' he added, ``we have been the ultimate agency/consultants.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker previously held top posts at New York agencies such as
Scali, McCabe, Sloves, which handled Castrol motor oil, and Lowe
Tucker Metcalf. He consulted on projects for Quaker State that
included the introduction of motor oil packaged in clear bottles,
and then he was hired as vice president for marketing in early 1997
by Charlie Bechtel, president for Quaker State lubricants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed someone to pull together the marketing department,''
said Bechtel, who joined Tucker for the interview, ``and there was
chemistry with Bill because he was someone who had the same drive
and focus as I did.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tucker joined Quaker State, the Chicago office of Foote,
Cone &AMP; Belding, a unit of True North Communications, was handling
brand advertising, with billings estimated at $20 million. After
the agency resigned in September 1997, Tucker supervised a review
that was narrowed to two agencies in San Francisco: Goodby,
Silverstein &AMP; Partners, part of Omnicom Group, and Leagas Delaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill did a great job during the review process,'' Bechtel
said, ``but I was not comfortable with what I was seeing'' from the
finalists because ``I was looking for a straightforward message,
and what I saw was more like sitcom situations.'' Further
discussions led Bechtel to decide to award the account to Tucker's
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep church and state separate,'' Tucker said. ``I can step
back outside if need be, becoming a supplier rather than an
employer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and his agency then developed the Leary campaign, which
presents the comedian delivering his trademark mocking, rant-like
speeches. In one commercial, for instance, Leary declares: ``I
wouldn't lie to you. They're not paying me enough.'' In another, he
asserts: ``This isn't some fake promise like `Work hard and any
dream can come true.' Life's poked a few holes in that theory _
right, pal?''
</P>
<P>
   And in a radio spot, Leary, referring to Quaker State laboratory
tests, proclaims, ``If American kids had tested as good as this
stuff, you wouldn't be listening to me on a Japanese radio right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bechtel said Leary's provocative tone ``helps us break
through,'' adding that ``he plays very well with our consumer, men
18 to 34 who change their own oil, who recognize he comes off
tongue-in-cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is continuing as Quaker State changes ownership,
completing a $1 billion deal with the Pennzoil Co. under which
Pennzoil and Quaker State combined their manufacturing, marketing
and oil-change businesses under the banner of the Pennzoil-Quaker
State Co., which is based in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bechtel said he would ``help the new company through a
transition period,'' while Tucker said he would become a consultant
to Pennzoil-Quaker State.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, John Craig, vice president for marketing services at
Pennzoil-Quaker State, used glowing terms such as ``incredible'' to
describe the Leary campaign. The company will use consumer focus
groups ``to measure its effectiveness, how well it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Quaker State account, Craig said: ``At this point,
we're exploring our options. We have to determine if we will use a
full-service agency on Quaker State.'' GSD&AMP;M in Austin, Texas, also
owned by Omnicom, handles the Pennzoil motor oil account.
</P>
<P>
   Pennzoil-Quaker State has decided to sell the Pennzoil and
Quaker State brands separately, Craig said, because each ``has
developed its own brand strategies and marketing plans.''
Pennzoil's tactics are focused on ``being the motor oil for the
stop-and-go way you drive every day,'' he said, and Quaker State's
are focused on ``protection beyond the 3,000-mile oil change, which
allows you to go those extra couple miles.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems like a sound strategy, because consumers might balk
if asked to buy a product named Pennzoil State.

BUFFALO FRIENDS RECALL AN ALL-TOO-SHORT LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ The first blizzard of the season dumped on
Buffalo Monday night. And Tuesday morning, after people dug
themselves out of their homes, salted their walks and staggered
into work, the topic around the water cooler naturally turned to
Kendra Webdale, a hometown girl.
</P>
<P>
   She had gone to New York City to make it as a big-time writer,
to become, as they put it, ``somebody important.'' A few local
people before Kendra had made it big outside Buffalo: Wolf Blitzer,
Natalie Merchant, Vincent Gallo. But most never do. They take jobs
as secretaries or waitresses or clerks. Or they return home.
</P>
<P>
   But Kendra did not return with the stuffed pockets and
prestigious title she had hoped to find in New York City. She
returned in a coffin that was stranded in Buffalo because the
blizzard had blanketed all roads leading to her small hometown of
Fredonia, about 50 miles southwest of here.
</P>
<P>
   She had become the fourth murder victim in New York City this
year when shoved beneath the wheels of a Queens-bound subway train
on Sunday evening. The police have arrested Andrew Goldstein, a
29-year-old man with a long history of mental illness, who the
authorities said was seized on the 23d Street station platform in
Manhattan in an overcoat and bare feet, muttering, ``It was her
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 32. Her death is something that makes you appreciate a
small, placid pond, where you know your neighbors and everyone
seems to die of old age, said Dennis Gallagher, general manager of
Gallagher Printing, which publishes The Buffalo Rocket and Westside
Times, community newspapers where Ms. Webdale worked as a reporter
and photographer before she went to pursue journalism in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel the allure of New York,'' said Gallagher, 41. ``I
know people who have, and I'm glad I never did.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of Ms. Webdale's death, in its dark way, reminded
people here what is good about their city besides the chicken wings
and the professional football team. It is a city that not too long
ago was vacant downtown and had few jobs after the heavy industry
packed it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is not a bad town; in fact it's gotten much better,''
said David Gallagher, Dennis' father and publisher of the papers.
``But you always have to be looking over your shoulder or someone
does something like pushing you onto the tracks. She had a lot of
life ahead of her and should have enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Ms. Webdale loved Buffalo, the state's
second-largest city but in many ways a small town and poor sister
to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo is a sprawling, slow-moving town where life is
predictable, he said. There is little crime, no congestion. Buffalo
has little more than six miles of subway track, compared with New
York's more than 600 miles. Only one person has died on those
tracks since the line opened 15 years ago: a depressed man who, 10
years ago, laid himself across the rails. Another man was shot to
death on the Allen-Hospital platform about a decade ago. His
assailant was captured. And last summer, a man lost his toe,
according to the transit police.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Buffalo is a good place to live, the dead woman's
friends said. White-collar jobs are replacing those lost when the
steel mills shut down. The theater district is thriving. Young
people are imagining a future here once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Kendra,'' said Deborah Tully, 35, the office manager at
Gallagher Printing. ``New York is about fame and fortune, and I
don't want it. Look at what you get. It's so sad, but it's the
chance you take.''
</P>
<P>
   And then David Gallagher stood in his office and fingered a
picture of Ms. Webdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere,'' he said
wistfully. ``If you can live long enough, I suppose.''

N.J.'S CRIME RATE HITS 33-YEAR LOW; ALL MAJOR CATEGORIES DECLINE
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; TRENTON, N.J. _ Crime rates continued a steep decline in New
Jersey during the first half of 1998, dropping to the lowest levels
since the State Police began keeping figures in 1966, according to
a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, crime fell by 10 percent from January to June last
year, according to John Hagerty, a spokesman for the State Police.
This outpaced the 5 percent drop in crime nationwide and 8 percent
decline in the Northeast during the same period that the FBI
reported in December.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1966, crime fell for all seven of the
``index'' offenses that make up the overall crime rate _ murder,
rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny and theft _ as
well as for motor vehicle theft, Hagerty said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures, tallied on paper by local, county and state
law-enforcement officers each month and compiled twice a year by
the State Police, show that reports of violent crime fell by 12
percent during the first half of last year to the lowest levels
since 1979. Murders in the first half of 1998 dropped to 155,
slightly fewer than the 158 during the same period in 1997. Rape
declined by 14 percent, from 916 to 787, and aggravated assault
dropped by 13 percent, from 10,604 to 9,215.
</P>
<P>
   Nonviolent crime fell overall by 10 percent during the six-month
period: robberies decreased by 11 percent and larceny was down 8
percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud to say that in New Jersey we are winning the war
against crime,'' Gov. Christie &UR;  &LR; Whitman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She credited better policing and tougher sentencing laws enacted
under her administration like the ``no early release law,'' which
requires people convicted of violent crimes to serve at least 85
percent of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Crime experts have said the trend reflects a variety of factors,
including an aging of the baby boom generation, a sharp decline in
the crack cocaine wars of the 1980s, and a move toward community
policing.
</P>
<P>
   Four counties showed increases in some categories of crime. In
Hunterdon County, nonviolent offenses rose by 32 percent, from 685
to 903, driven by an increase in burglaries and car theft, said
County Prosecutor Stephen Rubin. He blamed population growth in the
once-rural county and crimes committed along the corridors of
Routes 202 and 78.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been spared these numbers in the past but I think that
unfortunately with the population as it is, and given our
geographical location, it doesn't surprise me that the numbers are
increasing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County reported an 8 percent increase; Somerset County
reported an increase of less than 1 percent, and in Cape May, crime
went up 7 percent.

DEHERE BACKING UNION, BUT DOUBTS PLAYERS WILL
</HEADLINE>
 (See also BKN-NBA-LABOR) 
(fb) 
By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Terry Dehere has heard David Stern's threats about
canceling the season and using replacement players. He has seen the
dour expression on the commissioner's face as he laments how the
agents have sold the players in the National Basketball Association
``a bill of goods.'' He has read Stern's prediction that the
careers of 20 percent of the league's players will be ruined.
</P>
<P>
   But Dehere said he thinks Stern is bluffing. He believes the NBA
leader is savvy enough to feign finality but smart enough to know
that throwing away an entire season will damage his league more
than the high but capped salaries the players have offered to
accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he will cancel the season,'' Dehere said
confidently in an interview on Tuesday. As a result, Dehere said,
he will likely choose to support the union's recommendation to
reject the owner's final proposal in Wednesday's vote and
essentially challenge Stern to back up his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the type of guy who pretty much will stay with the
union,'' Dehere said.
</P>
<P>
   That Dehere will not dispute the union's negotiating committee
is not surprising on the one hand because he is represented by Arn
Tellem, the agent who has been accused by the league of sabotaging
negotiations along with David Falk. But on the other hand, the
former Seton Hall star is the type of player who would benefit
greatly from accepting the owner's proposal if only to start
receiving paychecks again.
</P>
<P>
   A decent guard with career averages of 8 points and less than 3
assists, Dehere will never sign the kind of eight-figure deal the
sides are fighting over. While he made more than $1 million
annually in his first four seasons with the Los Angeles Clippers,
his stock has dropped, as he was paid only $500,000 last year. This
season, his last under contract with Sacramento, he was supposed to
make $575,000. At 27, he may have only a few years left to make as
much money as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Dehere, who starred at St. Anthony High School in Jersey City,
N.J., then went on to play at Seton Hall, said he would be all
right financially if the season were canceled because he has been
wise with his money and is single. But after talking with lots of
the league's lower-level players who either are married or have
only one or two years of experience, he doubts that the players
will vote for something they think will lead to a canceled season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of players just want to play now,'' Dehere said.
``They're tired of all of this. Plus, a lot of guys probably need
to pay bills and get back to work because they have families. So my
gut feeling is that the players will vote for the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the players who need the money the most might not
get to vote. Because the union has given them only two days notice,
some players say they cannot afford to fly to New York. Kebu
Stewart, a rookie last season with the Philadelphia 76ers, is
struggling on what he saved from his $242,000 salary and cannot pay
to fly from California. Stewart's agent, Eric Rudolph, said other
players are in the same situation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Dehere said he has no problem with the union's stance, he
hopes the players who do will get their chance to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, all the players will show because I'd hate to see a
vote go down in favor of the union and some players are sitting at
home and don't get a chance to vote and they have a family and they
really want to play,'' Dehere said.

 &HT;    State dangerously low on blood
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia's blood supply is so low that the American Red
Cross made the unusual request Tuesday to postpone elective
surgeries at Atlanta-area hospitals for the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a critical shortage,'' said Cammie Barnes, spokesperson
for the Red Cross' Southern regional office, which supplies blood
to hospitals throughout Georgia. ``We have about a half a day's
supply. Basically, as soon as we get the blood in, we are shipping
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   One Atlanta hospital already had been forced to cancel elective
surgeries prior to the Red Cross request.
</P>
<P>
   While blood donations throughout winter holidays and the summer
typically dip because people are not in their normal routine, the
supply has never dipped this low, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 22 years I've been here, we have never asked hospitals
to put off elective surgeries,'' said Dr. Alfred J. Grindon, Red
Cross medical director, though hospitals have voluntarily cut back
surgeries during past blood shortages. ``And blood is not available
to be shipped from elsewhere in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet Georgia's hospital needs, the Red Cross needs about 900
to 1,000 people to donate one pint of blood each weekday, and 250
pints on Saturdays and Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday, only 538 pints were collected statewide,
but Tuesday's donations were looking more promising, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Red Cross stationed collection sites throughout the
metro area's most popular malls during the holidays, donations
trickled in. That mall drive is being extended through Thursday
from noon to 7 p.m. daily.
</P>
<P>
   Mall blood drive sites are Akers Mill Square, south of Galleria
Mall; Perimeter Mall, lower level near JC Penney; Southlake Mall,
north main entrance; Northlake Mall, lower level outside Sears; and
Gwinnett Mall Corners, across from Gwinnett Place mall.

   Talk of a policy agenda abounds, but the chances of passing any
significant legislation were slim even before the first impeachment
of an elected president in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Senate paddling through unfamiliar impeachment
trial waters, the question is not whether Congress can push through
reform of Social Security _ a daunting task under ideal
circumstances _ or even tax cuts or a tobacco bill, but whether
Clinton can even proceed with his State of the Union message Jan.
19.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House insists that Clinton is hard at work on
his State of the Union speech, senators from both parties have said
it would be unseemly for him to present a policy address before a
joint session of Congress when his very claim to office is under a
cloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bipartisan conspiracy for the moment to pretend
everything is fine,'' said a top Senate GOP aide, adding that this
``false peace'' will break down the instant either side discovers
``that absolutely nothing can occur until we have disposed of'' the
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Come what may, incoming House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois
said Republicans will focus on tax cuts, education and reform of
Social Security and Medicare as well as increased military
spending, including building a missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats intend to push a number of initiatives left over from
last year, including a ``bill of rights'' for patients in health
maintenance organizations, a tobacco settlement, campaign finance
reform and a higher minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has unleashed a flurry of proposals in the past
few weeks, from a $1,000 tax credit for caregivers of the sick and
elderly to a six-year, $110 billion boost in defense spending that
was welcomed by Republicans. Clinton has made shoring up Social
Security's finances his top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be a sign of lowered expectations on both sides that
Democrats are now pushing for aid to livestock farmers and the
Senate Finance Committee chairman, Delaware Republican William
Roth, is throwing his weight behind a tax credit for the conversion
of poultry waste to energy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans control the House by just 12 votes, one of the
narrowest majorities ever. A faction of just six members can
torpedo legislation, making compromises between GOP moderates and
conservatives extremely difficult and leaving the House easily
splintered.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich was forced to step down, in part
because of the difficulty of leading such a fractious majority
under the tremendous tension of the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At each end of the Republican party we have people feeling
either ideologically or politically pressured to separate
themselves from their six-vote majority, and that creates a
terrible task'' for anyone trying to lead them, said Vic Fazio, a
just-retired top-ranking Democratic representative from Sacramento
with a good grasp of House politics.
</P>
<P>
   The disarray in the GOP will be a formidable hurdle for the new
speaker, an obscure congressman from Illinois known as an adept
compromiser but who remains untested. Hastert promised Tuesday to
unify his party and reach across the aisle to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever trust may have existed between Clinton and
congressional Republicans before the Lewinsky scandal has all but
evaporated. And House Democrats, within reach of regaining a
majority, have a powerful incentive not to cooperate in passing any
GOP legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats in the House feel not only unified but very
optimistic about taking the House back,'' Fazio said. They will be
pushing their own agenda, but they are unlikely to assist
Republicans with theirs. ``It will be very hard for Republicans to
move their agenda without some Democratic votes,'' Fazio added,
``and I don't think many Democrats are going to cross over.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for their part, hold enough power to thwart
Democratic initiatives. But they also need to enact something to
take to voters for the next election, and insist they will push
hard for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a tax-cut effort died last year and prospects look no better
now.
</P>
<P>
   GOP talk of a radical tax overhaul has disappeared, turning
instead to such marginal changes as eliminating the so-called
marriage penalty, cutting estate taxes and increasing health
insurance deductions for the self-employed. But even these would be
difficult to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Republicans and the administration face a strong
incentive to do something.
</P>
<P>
   One House GOP committee aide said Republicans, searching just as
desperately for accomplishments as Clinton, might go along with
what he called the administration's ``miniaturization'' agenda of
modest but popular proposals like the long-term health care tax
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be unrealistic to think huge, momentous
policy changes can be made in this environment,'' the aide said,
``but Clinton's gotten very far on his miniaturized agenda, another
$10 million for this or that hot-button issue, and we could come up
with a series of measures that are not so big as to be unworkably
controversial but not completely meaningless either.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enormous obstacles, some even think there may be a
willingness on both sides to tackle Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security reform, particularly the move led by
conservatives to partially privatize the system by allowing workers
to divert some of their payroll taxes to individual investment
accounts, is extremely controversial and deeply splits the parties.
</P>
<P>
   But while privatization was considered heresy among Democrats
only a short time ago, Clinton has indicated an openness to the
idea as a way to shore up the program without cutting benefits or
increasing taxes. The idea is also supported by several prominent
Democrats, including Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York
and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is one of those issues so overwhelmingly on
the minds of Americans that it might well break through,'' Fazio
said. ``It's something the president could do to leave an important
legacy, and also something Republicans would like to be able to
accomplish to put down a record.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Fazio added, ``I don't have a great deal of
optimism that this is going to be a particularly productive
session.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fifteen minutes of fame can make anyone anxious,
especially if the last go-round was, as the auctioneer's wife puts
it, ``nightmare time.'' Perhaps that is why there is more tension
than gaiety in the Upper East Side offices of Guernsey's auction
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't use your hands,'' Guernsey's owner, Arlan Ettinger, is
telling one of the assistants, who is about to place a
plastic-encased baseball _ pardon, Mark McGwire's 70th home run
baseball _ on a stand for a CBS cameraman, who is there to film the
baseball and only the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't you use your hands?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you need to?'' Ettinger says. ``Would you touch a
Picasso and risk messing it up?''
</P>
<P>
   This is said without irony. Things get serious when $1 million
or more is at stake and a million is what has already said to have
been offered for the McGwire ball, which Guernsey's will be
auctioning in a room at Madison Square Garden next Tuesday. (The
cost of the room, which Guernsey's is renting for three days, is
reported to be $5,000 a day.)
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Ettinger about to share his feelings about the folks who
spend thousands on baseballs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wrong of me to be judgmental,'' Ettinger says.
</P>
<P>
   Auctioneers are sometimes perceived as people with a talent for
making friends with really old rich people and/or really old people
with stuff. Ettinger, a middle-aged man who prefers not to go
public with his age (his 4-year-old daughter, Rosie, is applying to
nursery schools, Ettinger says, and he does not want to be known as
an old father) is known in the business for a different talent: He
began Guernsey's 22 years ago as a niche auction house, seeing
value in popular-culture items like quilts and wooden carousel
horses, which had been overlooked by the old-line auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Ettinger and his wife and former partner, Barbara Mintz, both of
whom had worked in advertising, were innovative sales people with a
sense of fun. Once, they held an auction on a Circle Line cruise.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, there was controversy. Last year, Guernsey's made
headlines by selling personal items that had once belonged to
President John F. Kennedy and his family, including diaries and two
pairs of the president's long underwear. Theodore Sorensen, a
confidant of the late president, said he considered it ``a little
tawdry.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still a sore point. Asked about Sorensen's comments,
Ettinger grows testy. He is ``insulted'' to be asked about
accusations of poor taste and he sees no point in discussing issues
that are ``long over.''
</P>
<P>
   Selling Kennedy's underwear?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice little bit of levity in an otherwise serious
sale,'' Ettinger says. ``I can't believe you'd ask me about such a
silly little thing. I've had a long career and done a lot of things
I'm proud of. I've given money to several charitable causes. Why
don't you ask me about what I did for the Special Olympics?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, however, when Ettinger was willing to discuss
the Kennedy auction _ the time he was vying for the McGwire
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every auction house in the world pitched us,'' said Michael
Barnes, a St. Louis agent who represents the man who caught the
McGwire ball. ``Our decision regarding Arlen was that he was
willing to commit the most in terms of publicity: renting Madison
Square Garden, using Trump Tower for the press conference, bringing
Donald Trump himself to the press conference. Most of the auction
houses by the end of the day offered the same financial terms.
Arlen came across as an individual who would sink his heart and
soul into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Details about the press coverage Ettinger hoped for, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed he would generate as much press as he did for the
Kennedy show.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things about Ettinger's career of which he
is proud: Guernsey's organized an auction on behalf of a retired
architectural sculptor who planned to give the proceeds to the
Roman Catholic Church, bringing in $1 million after another auction
house had estimated the value at $20,000. Guernsey's raises money
for animal shelters. Guernsey's has been given the archives of the
late astronomer Carl Sagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly know who he was?'' Ettinger asks.
</P>
<P>
   Ettinger is not so eager to discuss other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a funny question,'' Ettinger says, after being asked
what his father was like.
</P>
<P>
   He is willing to say that he was born in Joplin, Mo., and came
to New York at age 4, growing up in Manhattan and then on Long
Island. After graduating from New York University with a business
degree, Ettinger taught school in the Bronx. Later, he was an
advertising illustrator. Ettinger's father had been in advertising.
Ettinger did not find the field fulfilling.
</P>
<P>
   Ettinger was, however, fascinated by antiques. He had an eye for
a deal and was a good negotiator. After spotting an ad for a 1949
Rolls-Royce for $2,000 _ every cent Ettinger and Ms. Mintz could
spend on a car years ago _ and inspecting it in the pasture of an
upstate farmer, Ettinger agreed to buy the car on the condition
that the farmer deliver it to the city. If it could make the
100-mile drive, he would know the car was in good shape. Many years
later, the sale of the car provided the down payment on Ettinger's
country house. He has since had three.

SEASONS WITH RANGERS MADE LEGEND BIGGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan came for one year. He stayed for five.
</P>
<P>
   Those five seasons would forever change the way baseball is
perceived in this area.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the surprise yesterday wasn't that Ryan was elected to the
Baseball Hall of Fame with the second-largest percentage of ballots
cast in history. But rather, as Gov. George W. Bush himself joked,
that Ryan's 27 seasons of service and seven no-hitters somehow
prompted six writers not to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan got 491 of the 497 votes. Even by today's less fastidious
standards, the percentage is tantamount to election by acclamation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty,'' Ryan said with characteristic frankness, ``I
certainly didn't anticipate having a unanimous vote. I'm just
honored that I received as many votes as I did.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 51, and with a bank, a ranch in Alvin and several Advil
checks in his portfolio, Nolan certainly doesn't have to tell
anyone he told them so. But somehow, Ryan had his critics.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the National League for good in 1988, he had a
135-132 won-loss record, and some critics never could see beyond
that. In his final five seasons in Houston, Ryan was 54-58 and
branded by Astros management as, at best, a 12-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   For even less money than the free-agent Ryan wanted, they said,
the team would just sign ``two six-game winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the dusty archives of this newspaper sits a column
that, ahem, one of us wrote during that 1988 winter. In 22
well-intentioned inches, I tried to convince Rangers management
that signing the then-41-year-old Ryan was (wince) ``worth the
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought I was on to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Arlington with the idea of playing one _ and ended
up playing five,'' Ryan said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   In those five seasons, we watched Nolan Ryan grow from ``likely
Hall of Famer'' to legend. We watched him throw two no-hitters,
record his 5,000th strikeout and win his 300th game.
</P>
<P>
   We watched him defy the ravages of age and gravity. We watched
him lay to rest the critics who thought he was all speed and no
substance.
</P>
<P>
   The Nolan knockers always pointed to his won-loss record. But
here's a louder statistic:
</P>
<P>
   In his first three years with the Rangers, Ryan allowed
opponents batting averages of .187, .188 and .172. Even in the
alleged ``worst'' year that Nolan ever had, when he was 8-16 with
the Astros in 1987, opposing batters only hit .199.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers put in clear terms what Ryan was _ the toughest
pitcher to hit in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Over his 27-year career, opponents batted .204 against Nolan.
The second-best mark is .205 by the equally legendary Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   It seems inconceivable that Cooperstown would have ignored a man
with five no-hit games and 4,000 strikeouts, the totals that Ryan
arrived from Houston with. But Hall of Fame voting remains an
inexact science.
</P>
<P>
   A dwindling legion of writers still thinks that, because Ruth,
Cobb and Cy Young didn't get voted in unanimously, none of the
modern-day mortals should, either. Some Nolan knockers didn't like
the fact that Ryan never won a Cy Young Award (Juan Marichal and
Don Sutton didn't, either). Others used the fact that Ryan walked
more batters (2,795) than any pitcher in history.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said that it was only after he arrived in Arlington in
1989 and began mowing down American League hitters again that
people began talking to him about the Hall of Fame and causing him
to pause and think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really viewed myself in that light,'' he said. ``I'm
the type of person that I deal with today and I prepare for
tomorrow. I was never one to reflect on my career and things that
had happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When sportswriters and sportscasters started mentioning it to
me, about being a possible Hall of Famer, that's really when I
first thought that if I was fortunate enough, maybe I'd get the
opportunity to be honored in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he probably means that. Ryan says that his proudest
accomplishment isn't the no-hitters, but the fact that, at age 46,
he was still contributing, still pitching on his terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to help the governor look for those six writers,''
Ryan joked yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   But saying he told-them-so has never been Nolan Ryan's style.
</P>
<P>
   His time here was both intense and brief. Filled with memories
and grace. When Ryan put on a Rangers uniform, it became
fashionable to fill the ballpark again.
</P>
<P>
   He never got to pitch at the new park. But, in a sense, it will
always be The House That Nolan Built.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperstown was made for men like Nolan Ryan. Consider the
sentiments, if not the ballots, unanimous.

THE TIMES SQUARE MOB SCENE IS MOSTLY VISITORS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even in New York, where pedestrians know they are not
entitled to much personal space as they navigate the city's
sidewalks, Times Square stands out. Getting around the neighborhood
on foot has come to resemble a contact sport.
</P>
<P>
   But contact with whom? Who are all those people jockeying for
breathing room?
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, a Times Square business group has some
answers.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority (70 percent) of the people who flocked to the
once-seedy neighborhood last summer were visitors to the area, most
of them (68 percent) from outside the city, according to a survey
released on Tuesday by the Times Square Business Improvement
District. A substantial percentage were from beyond the borders of
New York, New Jersey or Connecticut (29 percent) or from foreign
countries (22 percent). Only 11 percent of the visitors lived in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan J. Sexton, the president of the Times Square group, said
that the youthfulness of the visitors was the report's most
startling finding. The majority (58 percent) were under 35, and the
largest single group (27 percent) was between 18 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that most people who visited the
neighborhood were white, single and relatively well off, and had
ventured to Times Square primarily to sightsee. But they _ and
people who work in the area _ said they spent more on the theater
than on any other activity in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was based on answers to questionnaires from 1,002
pedestrians who were 15 years or older and able to read English.
They were handed the questionnaires at 12 locations during a
two-week period beginning June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The survey cost $25,000, Sexton said, and was conducted for the
Times Square business group by Clark, Martire &AMP; Bartolomeo Inc., a
marketing and public opinion research company in Englewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for those who think that Times Square is crowded
enough, Sexton said that the survey had inspired him to increase
marketing efforts throughout the country.

SCHEDULE MAY FORCE TOP LAWYER OFF GOTTI TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the chief lawyers for John A. Gotti, the
accused Mafia leader, said Tuesday that he would probably not be
able to represent Gotti at a racketeering trial set to begin next
month because of a scheduling conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Gerald Shargel, said he might discontinue
representing Gotti because he was the lead lawyer in a death
penalty trial that began Monday in Brooklyn and was expected to
last three months. Shargel said that Gotti was eager for his trial
to start and was opposed to a delay until March or April, when
Shargel would be available.
</P>
<P>
   A formal decision on changes in Gotti's defense team, Shargel
said, will be announced at a hearing Friday in U.S. District Court
in White Plains, N.Y., where the trial will be held.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti's other main trial lawyer, Bruce Cutler, is remaining in
the case, along with Sarita Kedia, a lawyer from Shargel's office
who has worked on pretrial motions, and Charles Ogletree, a Harvard
University Law School professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference is to have the whole defense team,'' Cutler
said. ``But our client wants the trial to go now and we will
certainly be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gotti's lawyers said he had rejected a plea deal with
prosecutors that would have sent him to prison for six and a half
to eight years and brought a $1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler and Shargel, both well known for defending people charged
with organized crime offenses, have represented Gotti since he was
arrested and indicted with 22 other men last January. He is accused
in the federal indictment of heading a Gambino crime family unit
that engaged in labor racketeering, illegal gambling, loan sharking
and the extortion of $100,000 from the former owners of Scores, a
Manhattan strip club.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain that Gotti, 34, who is sometimes called
Junior, was appointed the acting boss of the Gambino family by his
father, John J. Gotti, 58, who is serving a term of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Shargel's scheduling conflict comes from representing Gurmeet
Singh Dhinsa, an owner of a chain of gas stations. Dhinsa, 36, is
accused of ordering two murders, evading taxes and running a
criminal enterprise that rigged gas pumps to cheat drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Dhinsa's trial was to begin in October in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn. But it was delayed more than three
months by pretrial legal battles. Gotti's trial is tentatively set
to begin Feb. 2.

N.J. HIGH COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS OVER GAYS IN BOY SCOUTING
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ For the Boy Scouts of America, the basic
scouting tenet of living a ``morally straight'' and clean life does
not leave room for open homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   But for James Dale, a gay former Eagle Scout and assistant
scoutmaster, those are vague principles that do not address sexual
orientation and do not justify his removal from the organization in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   These contentions formed the core of the arguments proposed
Tuesday by lawyers for Dale and the Boy Scouts before the New
Jersey Supreme Court in a debate about whether his removal was
discriminatory or whether New Jersey's law against discrimination
even applied to a private organization like the Boy Scouts. An
appeals court ruled in Dale's favor last March.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the Scouts, George Davidson, called the doctrine
of clean living and purity of thought a core expression of belief
protected by the First Amendment and said Dale's expulsion was
constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   Dale's lawyer, Evan Wolfson, of the Lambda Legal Defense and
Education Fund, which argues for the civil rights of gay men,
lesbians and victims of AIDS, countered that the principle was
vague and did not explain the relevance of sexual orientation to
scouting. Thus, he argued, the Scouts' use of the ``morally
straight'' credo as ground for removal was discriminatory and
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Dale's case is being closely watched by gay rights' advocates
across the country. Earlier this year California's Supreme Court,
in a similar case, held that the Scouts were a private
organization, not bound by California's civil rights law, and were
free to ban gays. But in Dale's case, a divided three-judge appeals
court ruled the opposite way, saying the Scouts were a public
accommodation, similar to a hotel or restaurant, and that Dale's
removal from the group violated his civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Dale, now 28 and an employee at Poz, a magazine for people who
are HIV-positive, listened quietly in the crowded spectator gallery
Tuesday. Before the hearing, he said he was devastated by his
removal eight years ago and eager to belong to ``any troop that
wants me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with who I am and what I stand for,'' he said. ``If
anything, I'm fighting for the principles of scouting.'' By that,
he said, he meant being honest, taking a leadership role, and
fighting for one's beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, his 11-year scouting career was exemplary. He
earned 30 merit badges, achieved scouting's highest rank, and
served as an assistant scoutmaster for Troop 73 in Matawan. After
entering Rutgers University in the late 1980s, he took a leadership
role with the Lesbian/Gay Alliance. After a local newspaper ran an
article about his position, the Boy Scouts sent him a letter,
telling him that he had been removed from the organization.

<P>
   In Tuesday's two-hour hearing, some justices seemed troubled
with some of the arguments made by Davidson, the Scouts' lawyer,
and the lack of specific discussion of sexuality in the Scouting
Oath or the Scout Law.
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes into Davidson's presentation, Justice Daniel
O'Hern interrupted and asked whether the Scouts had a ``message on
sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson replied that the Scouts ``have a message on `morally
straight.''' He said that meant living with purity, virtue and
cleanliness in thought and action. ``These have obvious dimensions
of sexual morality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Justice Stewart Pollock said that during a
weekend browse of the Internet, he found no references to
homosexuality in the Scouts' charter, bylaws or handbook. He asked
Davidson whether a scout could be ``morally straight'' and
``clean'' and be a homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conduct is immoral,'' Davidson replied.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Justice Gary Stein, asked whether the
organization would remove gay scouts who do not publicly reveal or
discuss their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never really been tested,'' Davidson said. Stein
pressed the question and Davidson said that only scouts who had
publicly expressed their sexual orientation would face eviction. He
said the Scouts were troubled by open homosexuals who might extol
their lifestyle to younger, impressionable scouts. The
organization, he said, ``is not asking people about orientation or
looking under people's beds.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice James Coleman then asked if the Scouts had ever evicted
a scoutmaster who had lived with an unmarried woman. Davidson said
it had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Justice Alan Handler asked if acceptance of a gay
person who remained silent about his sexuality meant the Scouts
would ``tolerate'' an abstinent homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's replied only that the question was ``interesting.''

ABOUT NEW YORK: NEIGHBORHOOD IS THE SOURCE OF REAL CAPITAL
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Saturdays, the checkout line at the Elmhurst
branch of the Queens Public Library looks like a rush-hour token
booth crowd. Nearby every seat is taken at the tables, where Asian
and Latino readers pass the time. A few people browse through the
racks of compact disks in Korean, Spanish and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new books displayed by the entrance was Michael
Walsh's ``As Time Goes By: A Novel of Casablanca.'' Makes sense,
since this neighborhood _ where there are more new arrivals
browsing through the shelves than on them _ has a mix of
nationalities that would rival Rick's Cafe Americain. Since 1960,
Elmhurst and Corona have undergone such a transformation from being
nearly all-white to being Latino, Asian, white and black, that some
demographers call them the world's most ethnically diverse
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes by'' is a fitting sentiment for Roger Sanjek, an
anthropologist who spent 13 years in Elmhurst and Corona, studying
their ethnic makeover and the lessons they have for the rest of the
country where immigration will have similar effects. In his book
``The Future of Us All'' (Cornell University Press, 1998), Sanjek
says that residents of these communities bridged ethnic divides to
work for neighborhood improvement through community boards,
neighborhood groups and business associations. In doing so, they
reaffirmed his belief that nurturing a neighborhood's social and
economic life is more vital to the city's future than giving
billions of dollars in tax and real estate breaks to huge companies
that hold city officials hostage with threats to move out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are making changes in a daily and ongoing way,''
Sanjek, a professor of anthropology at Queens College, said on a
recent walk through Elmhurst and Corona. ``They meet each other in
day-to-day problem-solving situations, they go to school, they go
to the library. In this city the power of the neighborhood, in
schools and on shopping strips, is enormous and has staying power.
Yet the city's policies seem to work against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the recent deal to keep the New York Stock Exchange
from becoming the Jersey City Stock Exchange. (There ought to be a
law: If they leave town, they should leave the name, too.) City and
state officials ponied up $900 million in cash, tax breaks and
subsidies to seal the deal, which has the governments buying an
entire city block, where they will build a new trading complex.
Supporters of the deal said the new digs would give the
currently-cramped exchange plenty of room in which to stay
competitive and preserve lower Manhattan as the world's financial
capital.
</P>
<P>
   That depends on your perspective, which, if it happens to be
from Queens, might make you wonder. Cramped space? Just take a
stroll through the bustling shopping strips in Elmhurst and Corona,
where shopkeepers and customers would like to see an end to their
subsidizing local government by way of constant parking and
sanitation fines. Staying competitive? Tell that to the mom-and-pop
merchants _ of all nationalities _ who banded together to defeat
city-sponsored zoning changes that would have allowed megastores in
their neighborhoods. That's why Sanjek dismisses ``Capital of the
World'' justifications for big-bucks corporate retention deals as
taking money that could be better used in neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Capital of the world' ideology is harmful if we're talking
about the economic future of the city,'' he said, ``because the
transfer of technology has made it possible to be anywhere to do
business that used to be in lower Manhattan alone. We are bribing
people to stay, but the result is seen in library cuts, schools
that are not built, parks that are not maintained and a neighbohood
that becomes a place that nobody wants to live in.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, just looking at the Elmhurst library and seeing how
people came from all over to this swath of Queens, the title of
``Capital of the World'' might be right for this neighborhood.
Sanjek's field work at civic meetings, community rallies and
everyday interactions in schools and stores proved to him that at
their best, residents of Elmhurst and Corona have a sense of the
world that makes them as cosmopolitan as any high-society
globe-trotter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live in a neighborhood where their neighbor is Chinese or
Dominican and deal with each other as individuals,'' he said.
``They see other people as more than just bearers of exotic
cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   They see them as neighbors. It's a fundamental thing that
applies as time goes by.

REDUCTION IN N.J. CAR INSURANCE RATES SET FOR MARCH
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JENNIFER PRESTON   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ The Whitman administration has scheduled the
long-awaited 15 percent reduction in auto insurance rates for March
22, but almost half of the state's drivers will not get the full
savings and some will instead face higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say only 52 percent of the state's
drivers will see a 15 percent reduction or more in their auto
insurance bills when they renew their policies this year. The
savings will be smaller or nonexistent for about 36 percent of the
state's drivers, including motorists with good driving records. And
rates will rise for 12 percent of the state's drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the disparity in rates is that the state last
fall allowed insurance companies to create a new pricing system
that raises premiums for drivers who fall into certain categories,
such as older people and owners of inexpensive cars, regardless of
their driving records.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitman administration approved the new approach, known as a
tiered system, after ending the insurance companies' practice of
imposing surcharges on drivers who received speeding tickets or who
were involved in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   While the old surcharge resulted in higher rates for about 15
percent of the state's drivers, the new tiered system is expected
to increase premiums for up to 48 percent of the state's drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly half of the state's drivers won't even realize a rate
reduction, thanks to the Republican-tiered rating system that
allows good drivers to be grouped together with drivers who have as
many as six points,'' said the Assembly minority leader, Joseph V.
Doria Jr., a Democrat from Hudson County. ``New Jersey motorists
still haven't found what they're looking for: the significant car
insurance relief that was promised to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the 52 percent of the state's drivers whose auto
insurance bills are expected to drop, the Whitman administration is
trying to deliver the savings more quickly. While the new rates go
into effect March 22, as the administration announced this week,
drivers would normally not be eligible for them until their
policies expire. So, the state has ordered insurance companies to
allow people to renew or request new policies with the lower rates
beginning April 21.
</P>
<P>
   John K. Tiene, executive director of the New Jersey Insurance
News Service, an industry trade group, said that some insurance
companies were worried about processing a flood of requests for
policy renewals in April. ``We want to see this work,'' he said.
``But we have to be realistic in implementing this major
restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman said on Tuesday that she was confident
that the insurance companies would be able to handle the requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard this kind of thing from the insurance industry
before _ that whatever we do to give the premium holders, the
policy holders, a break is going to cause the system to collapse,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She pushed for a plan to lower rates after she nearly lost the
1997 governor's race to her Democratic opponent, James E.
McGreevey, who focused on voter anger over paying the highest auto
insurance premiums in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   She and state lawmakers devised a plan last year that was
supposed to reduce rates by 15 percent for most drivers with good
records. The reduction was to be financed by changes in the
insurance system, primarily restrictions on frivolous lawsuits,
that were expected to cut $700 million in costs.
</P>
<P>
   But although the plan's promise was a 15 percent reduction in
rates, Whitman administration officials acknowledge that some
drivers may find that the new system does not work to their
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Jaynee LaVecchia, the state insurance commissioner, said that
consumers should first ask their insurer about the overall cost of
their new policies and shop around for the most competitive rates
if they learn their rates are not declining by 15 percent or more.
Both state officials and industry officials say that rates will
vary by thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new tiered system, insurance companies can impose
higher rates for reasons that do not have anything to do with a
driver's record.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one insurance company has announced that it will
impose higher rates for owners of inexpensive cars like Ford
Escorts and Honda Civics. Several insurance companies have
announced that they will not offer their lowest rates to anyone 65
years or older. Other insurance companies said that they will
impose higher rates on drivers who do not park their car in a
driveway or in a garage.

N.Y. GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE TO FOCUS ON FIGHTING CRIME
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In a State of the State Message freighted with
anti-crime proposals, Gov. George E. Pataki will call on Wednesday
for abolishing parole for all felons and for requiring that all
felons' DNA fingerprints be logged into state computers, aides to
the governor said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans are likely to meet with stiff resistance from the
Democrats who control the Assembly, and the DNA proposal is
especially likely to run afoul of liberals in the State
Legislature. Last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his police
commissioner, Howard Safir, proposed taking and cataloguing DNA
samples from all criminals. The proposal drew vehement objections
from civil liberties groups.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki has proved adept at browbeating Democrats into
accepting his criminal justice bills by calling his adversaries
soft on crime, a tactic his aides said Tuesday that he would
readily resort to again.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting crime was a central theme of Pataki's re-election
campaign last year, as it no doubt will be if he runs for national
office in 2000. He has tried hard to wrest from Giuliani, a
potential Republican rival for national office, some of the credit
for New York City's astonishing drop in crime. In his first four
years, the governor restored the death penalty, secured longer
sentences for violent crimes and sharply curtailed parole. Experts
doubt that those changes have had much effect on the crime rate,
however.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, aides said, the governor will also renew his
calls for tougher sentences for juvenile offenders and for those
who commit sexual assaults. They said he would also ask for changes
in the state's porous campaign finance laws, but they refused to
give any specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's parole proposal would build on what he has called one
of his signal achievements, the elimination of parole for violent
criminals. The Legislature approved that bill, known as Jenna's
Law, last July, after Democrats, who had resisted it for three
years, saw it used against them in their re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's parole proposal would end New York's longstanding
practice of sentencing criminals to a range of time in prison, and
replace it with one of setting specific sentences. For instance,
instead of imposing a sentence of one to three years, leaving it up
to the State Parole Board when, after a year had been served, an
inmate would be released, a judge could hand down a term of two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Similar changes have been made during the last 25 years by the
federal government and at least a dozen states. The shift would
mean the eventual elimination of the Parole Board.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Pataki, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
the proposal was not intended to produce longer prison sentences,
though it might do so in some cases. ``The principle is, let's take
the guesswork out of this,'' one aide said. ``Let's make it so that
the judge decides when people get out, not the parole board, and
the judge's sentence means what it says.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor would leave judges with broad discretion in setting
sentences, skirting the most criticized feature of the federal law,
a point system that leaves judges little room to exercise their
judgment. As with the changes adopted last year for violent felons,
inmates would still be able to reduce their sentences by as much as
one-seventh through good behavior, and they would still be subject
to supervision after release.
</P>
<P>
   Several Assembly Democrats, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, reacted warily to the parole plan, saying they would
oppose it if it meant longer prison terms or unduly restricted
judicial discretion. The law, passed last year, took away from
judges the option of probation rather than prison for some violent
crimes; critics said that would eventually mean longer terms.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, declined
to comment on the issue until the Governor released detailed
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gangi, executive director of the Correctional Association
of New York, a liberal group that studies prison issues, said it
was inevitable that if lawmakers abolished parole, they would do so
in a way that lengthened sentences.
</P>
<P>
   He contended that eliminating discretionary parole would also
eliminate an incentive for inmates to behave well and be
rehabilitated. ``This is one-size-fits-all justice, and we don't
think it works,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state already collects DNA information _ usually from a
saliva sample _ from people convicted of sex crimes and some other
violent crimes, about 8 percent of all people convicted of
felonies. Just as fingerprints left at a crime scene can be put
into a computer database and matched with those of known criminals,
a strand of hair or a speck of skin at a crime scene can be used to
catch people whose DNA samples are entered into a database.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's plan is to make the collection of DNA samples mandatory
for all criminals. ``We know that the people we catch for low-level
crimes very often have committed, or will commit, more serious
crimes,'' an aide to the Governor said. ``This is the obvious way
to track them. DNA is going to be the fingerprinting of the 21st
century.''

NARROW HOSE SAID TO BE SUSPECT IN DEATHS OF 3 FIREFIGHTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By KEVIN FLYNN   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Firefighters struggling to rescue fallen colleagues
in a Brooklyn apartment building last month may have contributed to
the three deaths that occurred by using a fire hose considered too
narrow for use in high-rise blazes, said firefighters and city
officials close to a Fire Department investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Three firefighters from Ladder Company 170 were killed when a
fireball engulfed them on Dec. 18 as they sought to rescue a woman
from her top-floor apartment in a 10-story New York City Housing
Authority residence for the elderly. Three other firefighters, from
Engine Company 290, were seriously burned as they desperately tried
to reach the dying men, using the water stream from their hose line
to battle back the approaching flames.
</P>
<P>
   But while fire officials described its effort as heroic, the
engine company has come under scrutiny by fire officials because
the hose line it used was smaller than required by Fire Department
regulations for use in high-rise fires of this type, the officials
close to the investigation said, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Department officials have acknowledged that the company
used a hose 1.75 inches in diameter, instead of the
2.5-inch-diameter hose that is specified in department regulations.
The larger hose is supposed to be used because it can discharge as
much as 50 percent more water, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen has ordered an internal
review to determine why the company used the smaller hose,
officials said. Deputy Fire Commissioner Michael Regan, a
department spokesman, refused to speculate on whether a larger
hose, with its greater volume of water, might have saved lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner has appointed a group of senior chiefs to
look into this and many other issues, and that process is still
ongoing,'' said Regan, declining further comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Uniformed Firefighters Association rejected
any notion that the size of the hose used in the Brooklyn fire
played any role in the deaths last month. ``That premise is
wrong,'' said the union spokesman, Thomas Butler. He declined
further comment, citing the investigation. Members of Engine
Company 290 did not respond to a telephone call to the firehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn fire caused the worst loss of life in New York City
firefighter ranks in four years. It was already under scrutiny
because the building's hallway sprinkler had been turned it off,
probably years earlier. That, along with a fire last month in a
Manhattan high-rise that left four people dead, has prompted the
Giuliani administration and the City Council to consider
legislation that would require sprinkler systems in at least some
residential buildings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fire officials said the internal investigation into the
department's operations at the Brooklyn fire was being led by the
chief of operations, Peter Ganci. They declined comment on whether
any firefighters would be disciplined for their actions. A
spokesman for the Department of Investigation, which is directing
an investigation of the fire in conjunction with fire officials and
the Brooklyn District Attorney's office, also declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Several firefighting experts said Tuesday that engine companies
have sometimes used a smaller hose because they believed that a
lighter, more flexible line gave them greater agility against a
quick-moving blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Corbett, an assistant professor of fire science at John
Jay College, said that while he was not familiar with the specific
fire conditions at the Brooklyn blaze, the wider hose is usually
preferable to fight apartment building fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``To attack a fire in a high-rise structure, two-and-a-half-inch
lines are typically used, because they are better at knocking down
fires because of the punch they pack,'' he said. ``The
inch-and-three-quarter is more suited for smaller fires, such as
those in single-family homes.''
</P>
<P>
   A 2.5-inch-diameter hose can spray as much as 300 gallons of
water per minute when operating with about 100 pounds of water
pressure per square inch on their nozzles, said John Cochran, a
fire management specialist with the U.S. Fire Administration. A
1.75-inch-diameter line produces 150 to 200 gallons a minute under
the same pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fire Department advocates using the narrower hose at
many fires, it requires the use of the larger hose in high-rises
for which the water source is a standpipe system, a pipe network
typically in the stairwells. The standpipes keep water at the
ready, so firefighters do not have to waste time dragging hoses
attached to street hydrants up flight after flight of stairs in
buildings taller than 75 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial line from a standpipe system must be
two-and-a-half-inch hose,'' the department's official procedure
manual states. ``The use of two-and-a-half-inch hose for the
initial line at standpipe operations is required due to the large
volumes of water it can deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Engine Company 290 was one of four fire companies to arrive
almost simultaneously at the 4:54 a.m. blaze in the Brooklyn
housing complex, fire officials have said. The members of Ladder
Company 170 raced upstairs first to rescue any tenants who had not
already fled, but they were trapped when a fireball swept down the
10th-floor hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Just behind them came Engine Company 257, which was supposed to
put the first water on the fire. But that engine company could not
connect its hose to a standpipe in the 10th-floor stairwell,
because insulation materials used to protect the pipe from freezing
became tangled in the threads of the standpipe, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Engine Company 290 hooked up on the floor below,
using three 50-foot lengths of hose, the last length being the
narrower line with a diameter of 1.75 inches, officials said. But
the water from that hose was not sufficient to force back the fire
and, despite repeated attempts, the company had trouble making it
down the hallway to reach the fallen firefighters, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A breach in department regulations governing hose sizes was
partly to blame for the 1996 death of a firefighter during a Queens
apartment house fire, a Fire Department investigation later
concluded.

EDITORIAL: AVOIDING A LENGTHY TRIAL  
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 6:
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial start of President Clinton's impeachment trial
has been set. Chief Justice William Rehnquist will swear in the
senators as jurors Thursday morning. But the substantive questions
as to how the trial will be conducted are still undecided. The
reason is that some influential Republicans are blocking the plan
of their majority leader, Trent Lott, to move the Senate with
appropriate speed toward a censure verdict that conforms with the
public will, the evidence against Clinton and the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's sensible plan for a one-week trial without witnesses
leading to an expedited procedural vote has been blocked by
opposition from within his own caucus. Insisting on a rigidity that
the Constitution does not require, conservative Republicans are
calling for a prolonged trial with witnesses whose testimony they
know will not lead to conviction. Some more moderate Republicans,
including Sen. Arlen Specter, have also lined up against Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Specter has complicated Lott's work by hyping this as ``the
trial of all time.'' It is not that. It is, more properly, an
important political and constitutional proceeding that ought to
result in a stern condemnation of Clinton for lying under oath and
failing in his duty as guardian of the law. Lott knows how to get
to that goal, but hard-liners have put him and moderate Republicans
in a box. If they appear to be soft on Clinton or to slight House
Republicans, they could face right-wing opposition in their next
re-election primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Lott will meet with his caucus Wednesday morning, and on Tuesday
he looked like a man who was feeling the threat of rebellion. But
he is not powerless by any means. The 45 Democrats and a sizable
number of Republican moderates will not vote for removal. Figuring
out a way to enable that majority to adjourn the trial after two or
three weeks and then pass censure adds up to the biggest challenge
faced by any recent majority leader. Lott wants to avoid tying up
the Senate and the nation in a trial that lasts for months. If he
succeeds, he will have made a remarkable transition from the
partisanship of his early career to the statesmanship required by
these messy days.
</P>
<P>
   Senators sympathetic to Lott's goal need to help him cope with
the difficult assignment of disciplining this irresponsible
president in a way that does not harm the country more than it
harms Clinton. The problem of how to run an impeachment trial is
bigger than Bill Clinton. The senators need to be bigger than
Clinton has been, too. So far Lott, the minority leader, Tom
Daschle, and their pro-censure allies have measured up. All Lott's
supporters must be tough and steady on Wednesday as the Senate
moves beyond the ceremonial details of the trial to planning its
schedule and rules.

BOXING NOTES: AGITATED TYSON LAYS OUT HIS PLAN TO FIGHT BOTHA; A
BUSY SHOWTIME SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ariz., Nev.)  (fb) 
By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Tyson didn't sound as if he was in a mood for chatting
Tuesday afternoon during a telephone conference call from his
training site in Scottsdale, Ariz. With two weeks to go before his
heavyweight bout against Francois Botha, the former International
Boxing Federation champion, Tyson sounded irritated.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't sound too good for Botha. The bout will be held
at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on Jan. 16 and will be shown on
pay-per-view by Showtime Event Television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in great shape, and I'm expecting to do well,'' Tyson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was curt in most of his answers to reporters. He talked
about Jerry Quarry, the former heavyweight boxer who died this
week, and later went on a diatribe about not being politically
correct and how other boxers, like Mitch Green and Michael Dokes,
can commit crimes and not get extensive jail sentences.
</P>
<P>
   It was the most animated he became during the 30-minute
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Tyson's first bout since he regained his boxing
license from the Nevada State Athletic Commission on Oct. 19.
Tyson's license had been revoked because he was disqualified for
biting Evander Holyfield's ears during their heavyweight
championship bout on June 28, 1997. It will be his longest layoff
since he served three and a half years in prison on a rape
conviction in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   As for Botha, Tyson said he was working on a few new things for
the bout, but expected to do the same things that he has done in
the past. His new trainer, Tommy Brooks, said they were trying to
eliminate the mistakes that Tyson made in his back-to-back losses
to Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get Mike to fight like he did when he won the
title as a 20-year-old,'' said Brooks, who was Holyfield's
co-trainer during those two bouts against Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said he has retained his explosiveness and will use that
against Botha. Botha said he expected Tyson to come right after
him, and Tyson said Botha was right.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was asked what he expected Botha to do when he came after
him from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Die,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   A BUSY SHOWTIME SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   Showtime is adding to its boxing telecasts for the first quarter
of 1999 with what could be some compelling matches. They will kick
off on Feb. 6 with a middleweight show from Washington that
features bouts with all three of the reigning world champions in
the division. Bernard Hopkins, the International Boxing Federation
champion, will defend his title in a rematch against Robert Allen.
Their first bout ended in controversy when Hopkins was tossed from
the ring by the referee, injured his ankle and could not continue.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Holmes will fight Hacine Cherifi of France, the World
Boxing Council champion, in a rematch. Cherifi upset Holmes to win
the title last summer. And William Joppy, the World Boxing
Association champion, will face the No. 1 contender Darren Obah.
</P>
<P>
   On March 27, Sharmba Mitchell, the WBA junior welterweight
champion, and Frankie Liles, the WBA supermiddleweight champion,
will defend their titles on a doubleheader card. On April 17,
Johnny Tapia, the WBA bantamweight champion, and Ricardo Lopez, the
WBC and WBA strawweight champion, will headline a card. And on May
22, Tim Austin, the IBF bantamweight champion, will defend his
title.

EDITORIAL: THE NBA MISFIRES
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Seven months ago, as Michael Jordan nailed down the Chicago
Bulls' sixth championship of the decade, the National Basketball
Association appeared to be on top of the world. Attendance was
strong, top players were recognizable around the globe and the
league's management was viewed as the best in professional sports.
The NBA had never missed a game due to labor problems. Now the
league seems bent on self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   As the players gather in New York Wednesday to consider a
management contract offer, there is a real risk that the NBA will
be the first league to lose an entire season to a labor dispute. So
far, the players have suffered more than the owners from this
lockout, but that could change. While the players have lost about
$500 million in salaries, the main source of team revenue _
television money _ is still coming in. If a season is salvaged, the
league will keep most of that money. But if it is not, the
broadcasters will be repaid in future seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The interest of fans is for a deal to be reached, with terms
that allow teams in smaller markets to be competitive. The league's
offer would enable most players to get substantial raises, but
would prevent some of the best players from getting paid as much as
they might. The league hopes, and some players fear, that it would
enable the owners to control their tendency to bid up player
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The acrimonious talks have brought agreement on some novel
principles, most notably a cap on individual salaries. While the
NBA has long had a cap on team salaries, there were so many
loopholes that salaries have skyrocketed. The contract proposals
also call for a sliding minimum wage scale. A veteran marginal
player who earned less than $300,000 last year would have to get at
least $1 million, or not play at all, while young marginal players
could be signed for much less. Some older players are likely to
lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Much may depend on how Wednesday's vote is taken. Some players
might defy their union leadership on a secret ballot, but not in a
show of hands. Just how secure the union leadership is may become
clear when the voting procedures are announced.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the vote, the owners and players must recognize that
cancellation of the season and continued stalemate will alienate
fans and threaten the survival of the league. Unless the two sides
want to destroy one of the most popular and successful enterprises
created in American sports, they will step back from confrontation
and settle this dispute with dispatch.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Jan. 6:
</P>
<P>
   When the White House endorses the idea of a visit to Havana by
the Baltimore Orioles it is clear the ground is starting to shift
in U.S. relations with Cuba. After four decades in which Washington
successively tried to remove Fidel Castro by invasion,
assassination plots and rigid economic isolation, signs are
multiplying that the long American siege of Cuba is starting to
wind down.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for this welcome change. With the end of
the Cold War, Cuba no longer serves as a base for potential Russian
military operations against the United States. American business
leaders have become increasingly interested in the profit potential
of Cuba as it moves toward the post-Castro era. Conservatives have
taken up the plea made by Pope John Paul II to ease the American
economic embargo for humanitarian reasons. Finally, generational
changes in the Cuban-American community have increased the
influence of those interested in easing the privations of ordinary
Cubans, rather than worsening them in hopes of sparking a popular
revolt.
</P>
<P>
   The pity is that the Clinton administration has been hesitant
about seizing this opportunity. The steps it has proposed,
including the visit by the Orioles and a return engagement in
America by the Cuban national baseball team, fall well short of the
change in direction that is now politically sustainable in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic and cultural exchanges, more charter flights, direct
mail service and broader permission for Americans to send food and
money to Cuban families are fine. But the White House rejected
appeals from prominent Republicans to form a bipartisan national
commission on Cuba policy that might have proposed phasing out the
embargo and moving toward normal diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   America should be doing all it can to break down the cultural
and intellectual isolation of Cuban society through increased
tourism, business and cultural and sports contacts. It should be
defending human rights by strengthening its diplomatic presence in
Havana. Clinton must go beyond useful tinkering with an outdated
policy. He must lead the way to a more promising approach based on
deeper American engagement, not continued isolation.

EDITORIAL: ARIZONA'S WOMEN AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Five women were sworn in to the top elected offices in Arizona
this week by another Arizonan, Sandra Day O'Connor, the first
female justice on the United States Supreme Court. Jane Dee Hull is
the governor, Betsey Bayless is secretary of state, Janet
Napolitano the attorney general, Carol Springer treasurer, and Lisa
Graham Keegan the superintendent of public instruction. Such a
sweep has not happened anywhere else, but it is not so surprising
in a state with a long history of women as government leaders.
Indeed, four of these women have had years of service in state and
local elected offices. Only Ms. Napolitano is new to elective
politics, and she ran on her experience as the U.S. attorney for
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   These officials are probably right when they say they did not
win because of their gender. Voters judged them on their records
and accomplishments. But the state's political culture from its
earliest days has made it more possible for women to seek and win
offices held in other states exclusively by men. The Arizona
Territory was sparsely populated in the late 1890s, and women had
important roles founding communities and institutions of civil
society. In 1912, the year it became a state, Arizona was among the
first nine states to grant women the vote, eight years before
ratification of the 19th Amendment. Today about a third of Arizona
state legislators are women, higher than the national average of 22
percent. In 1972 Ms. O'Connor was elected majority leader of the
Arizona State Senate, the first woman to hold such a position in
any state.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists say the lack of barriers for women may be
linked to the state's newness, open political system and a certain
gender-blind libertarian bent among the populace. In New York only
20 percent of the state legislators are women. Still, another
female lieutenant governor, Mary O. Donohue, has just been sworn in
there. She was picked from political obscurity by Gov. George
Pataki to replace his last female running mate. In some other
places, women now run the show.

AS UCONN EXPANDS, STATE'S SMALLER SCHOOLS FEEL SQUEEZED
</HEADLINE>
 (ATTN: Ill.) 
 (dal) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ At the main campus of the University of
Connecticut here, a building boom is under way that would be the
envy of most university presidents.
</P>
<P>
   UConn has built or will soon complete a $13 million fine arts
center, a $56 million chemistry building, a $40 million library
renovation and a $43 million residential complex. It is spending
millions more for new satellite campuses in Stamford and Groton,
and aims to upgrade three other branches to offer a variety of
four-year degrees.
</P>
<P>
   But across Connecticut, some educators are viewing UConn's
expansion with more fear than envy. They say the growth, financed
with $1 billion provided by the  &UR; s &LR; tate Legislature, could threaten
small private liberal arts colleges and the Connecticut State
University system (the former state teachers colleges), which have
long provided the state with institutional diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Lujan, the chief academic officer of the state university
system, said he was concerned about competition from the expanded
UConn satellites, and had registered a protest, which he expected
to be taken up by the State Department of Higher Education at its
next meeting on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the private colleges, Anthony J. Cernera, president
of Sacred Heart University in Fairfield and chairman of the
16-member Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, said the
expansive plans of UConn, especially the upgrading of branches in
Waterbury, Torrington and West Hartford, ``duplicate what already
exists'' and ``don't make a whole lot of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip E. Austin, UConn's president, answered, ``We are not
trying to compete unfairly with anyone, but are responding to
demographic changes in the state and following what the elected
leadership and the business leadership have asked of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle being played out in Connecticut is mirrored in many
states, said Edward R. Hines, a senior associate of the Center for
Higher Education at Illinois State University, who conducts an
annual survey of state higher-education officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see more and more of a gap _ more stratification _
between, on the one hand, flagship institutions, and on the other
hand the old regional former teachers colleges,'' he said. ``All
across the country, there's going to be intensive competition for
students and for a share of the state budget pie.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as three or four years ago, according to surveys,
UConn students gave high marks to the university's academic
programs but were put off by the ``dilapidation'' of the campus.
Responding to these complaints, and news that Connecticut had
become a leader among states that shipped college-bound students
out of state, a coalition of university administrators and
influential state legislators came up with a proposal, called UConn
2000, to rebuild the state's system of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor, John G. Rowland, who had come into
office pledging to go slow on state borrowing, hesitated at first.
But the plan gained momentum thanks to the much heralded success of
UConn's basketball teams. In 1995, the university's men's and
women's basketball squads were both ranked No. 1 in the nation, as
they are again this year, and Husky fever gripped the state. UConn
applications soared, and when the athletes appeared before the
state legislators, it was the latter who asked for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   That, plus an understanding of the symbiotic relationship
between higher education and economic development, finally loosened
the purse strings in Hartford, and the remaking of UConn began to
take shape.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff came last fall when UConn's admissions office
reported a 17 percent increase in freshman enrollment, to 3,225 in
1998-99 from 2,760 in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   Cries of pain from private and state university institutions
have been muted because, at least so far, the supply of college-age
students _ swollen by the children of baby boomers _ has been large
enough to insure plenty of applicants to go around.
</P>
<P>
   The only private college in the state that lost enrollment this
year was Wesleyan University in Middletown, where admissions dipped
1.19 percent _ and that was a deliberate effort to cap the incoming
freshman class in the interest of improving the faculty-student
ratio. Almost all private institutions in the state have seen their
enrollment grow by at least 5 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some expect to be forced to accept less-qualified students in
the future and, accordingly, are developing survival strategies
like ``niche marketing'' _ offering specialized academic programs
that will draw students with specific career objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Bridgeport, a small private institution that
since 1992 has been affiliated with the Unification Church headed
by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon, practices this strategy with
considerable success. As far back as the 1960s, the university
swelled its enrollment by recruiting foreign students, chiefly from
India and Japan. That practice established a path for many Asian
students, and today fully 40 percent of the student body comes from
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But even the parade of foreign students has not been enough to
satisfy the university's needs. ``The expansion of UConn forced us
to do more aggressive niche marketing,'' said Donna Marino, a
spokeswoman for the university.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the University of Bridgeport has recently
developed a number of academic specialties in the health sciences,
including a school of dental hygiene and a college of chiropractic
medicine, both of which have drawn well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year,'' Ms. Marino said, ``we started the College of
Naturopathic Medicine, a four-year program which trains physicians
in natural remedies. It's doing nicely because there are only three
other such schools in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strategies may work for some small colleges, but could
undermine the tradition of the small liberal arts college that
turns out broadly educated students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Niche marketing is a little frightening,'' said Barbara-Jan
Wilson, dean of admissions at Wesleyan. ``I don't think
18-year-olds really know what they want to do with their lives.
These niche programs may help students to get their first job, but
leave them unprepared for a second or third.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of New Haven, another small private school, is
also engaged in niche marketing _ offering career-focused programs
in sports management, forensic science, and music and sound
recording _ but the school's main strategy this year is to reach
beyond the borders of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we feel the pressure from UConn, and we expect it to be
even stronger in four or five years,'' said Patrick Quinn, dean of
admissions at the University of New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we have just decided to recruit on Long Island,
throughout New England and elsewhere,'' he added. ``About 70
percent of our students are from Connecticut, but we expect
competition from UConn to bring that down to 60 percent in a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Quinn said the university will have nine
recruiters this year, only two of whom will work Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   In-state tuition, room and board at UConn come to about $10,875
a year while the state universities charge an average of $9,000.
But even with that price advantage, the state university
institutions fear the UConn juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   It is not merely competition from the flagship campus in Storrs
that worries them, but the UConn satellites in Stamford, Groton,
Hartford, Waterbury and Torrington.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1981, four of the five satellites have had the authority
to grant only one four-year bachelor's degree created for adult
students. (Stamford has had more latitude.) Today, however,
Stamford and the Avery Point branch in Groton occupy new,
multimillion-dollar campuses, and UConn is pressing the State
Department of Higher Education to adopt proposals that would remake
the satellites as mini-UConns, squeezing the state university
system.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the state university leaders are preparing to
fight. Eastern Connecticut State University in Willimantic is
striving to carve a niche for itself as a small public liberal arts
college. Western Connecticut State University at Danbury hopes to
benefit from its location in a population center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't count us out,'' said Bill Cibes, chancellor of the CSU
system and a former member of the  &UR; s &LR; tate Legislature. ``We got a
lot less from the state than UConn, but we never said we wouldn't
keep asking.''

HACKETT'S FIRST YEAR: GOOD, BAD, PROMISING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Moments after losing to Texas Christian in the Sun
Bowl, USC coach Paul Hackett walked into a room full of reporters,
saw an empty chair where he was supposed to sit and said, ``Is this
the electric chair?''
</P>
<P>
   The joke reflected USC's disappointment at losing its bowl game,
but in reality, there was probably something fitting about not
winning the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With a victory, USC would have gone 9-4 _ only the second
Trojans team in the 1990s to earn nine victories _ and probably
would have created a false sense of satisfaction within the
football program.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's 8-5 record turned out to be identical to John
Robinson's first season in 1993. And like the '93 season, this one
has to be considered as progress from the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   But it also shows there is plenty of work ahead, something no
one understands better than Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the inconsistency of 1998 we'll remember the most,
because we were young and inexperienced,'' Hackett said. ``If we
had won the bowl, nine wins would have been a dramatic
accomplishment. I don't think we were that good. Nine wins is a
huge year.''
</P>
<P>
   Before looking ahead, it's important to remember what Hackett
accomplished in his first season _ good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening contest against Purdue, he had the Trojans in
better shape than they ever were under Robinson. He also brought
levels of organization and enthusiasm that helped make his first
season relatively successful.
</P>
<P>
   USC always practiced hard and played hard, something athletic
director Mike Garrett probably felt didn't happen in the previous
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's decision to play true freshman quarterback Carson
Palmer from the opening game also demonstrated he was willing to
take some chances, as long as the risk didn't seem too great.
</P>
<P>
   It was the ``risk'' factor that probably also caused the most
consternation. Hackett's decision to go with a field goal instead
of a touchdown from the 1-yard line probably cost USC a victory
over Cal. And a couple of weeks later, he kicked another field goal
on fourth down inside the 10-yard line when trailing Oregon 17-10.
The Trojans lost 17-13.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett's by-the-book approach didn't seem to work in those two
games, and it's doubtful he would make similar decisions next
season. A first-year coach should be given some breaks, however, so
maybe those shouldn't be viewed as disastrous decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Another area Hackett could improve next season is treating the
senior players as more vital members of the team. It did little for
team morale this season when seniors like wide receiver Mike
Bastianelli, who was indispensable as a sophomore and junior, were
placed on the shelf and forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, as linebacker Chris Claiborne was turning pro and
wide receiver R. Jay Soward was coming back, Hackett was totally
absorbed into how to improve next season, especially as recruiting
hits its final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 25 scholarships and I want to use all of them,''
Hackett said. ``This is the most critical time since I've been at
USC. We didn't do as well as we wanted this season, let's face it.
Now we've had a year to work. The fourth quarter is here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans need offensive linemen, wide receivers, a tailback
and some linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recruiting, it's receivers and offensive line,'' Hackett
said. ``The offensive line is the biggest issue we need to address.
Trying to project what we need to do this spring and recruit to
improve a substantial amount. The linebacking also becomes a little
more acute than before.''
</P>
<P>
   USC's offensive line was woeful on many occasions, but the
simple fact is freshmen lineman rarely help immediately. So the
Trojans need to hope the five starters who return next season will
dramatically improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we will have a clear cut idea of their strengths and
weaknesses, we can address what it takes to get better,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the defense, it loses three starters in the secondary,
not to mention Claiborne.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be tough. Compared to this year, we're going
to be young,'' Hackett said. ``That's totally opposite of what we
were this year (on defense).''
</P>
<P>
   These alibis don't figure to soothe USC fans who will want nine
victories or more next season. They really want to know how long it
will be before the Trojans can expect to return to the elite
stratosphere occupied by Tennessee and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would need a couple, two or three years before we knock
heads on a consistent basis with them,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Hackett had a sharp response for UCLA coach Bob Toledo's
comment Monday that ``it's not like we got embarrassed by a 6-5
team or anything,'' regarding the Bruins' Rose Bowl loss. Asked
about the remark, Hackett said, ``You know what's interesting about
Bob? He keeps looking over here. I'm not looking over there.'' ...
USC has still not decided whether to move linebacker David Gibson
to safety next season or leave him at his current position.

ENGINEERING SCHOOL NAMES ITS FOUNDING PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (ATTN: Iowa, Mass.) 
 (dal) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation's newest engineering school, which will admit its
first class in fall 2001, has announced that its founding president
will be Richard K. Miller, the engineering college dean at the
University of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The college, the F.W. Olin College of Engineering in Needham,
Mass., is being built adjacent to Babson College, the business
institution. It will charge little or no tuition because of its
healthy founding endowment, and it will take a new approach to
engineering education, combining the standard science and math
courses with entrepreneurship, marketing and product research. The
colleges plan to share support services and certain facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the state of engineering education, the F.W.
Olin Foundation financed the new school with $300 million. The
foundation _ not related to the John S. Olin Foundation, which
supports conservative causes _ was established in 1938 by Franklin
W. Olin, who died in 1951 after having made a fortune in the 1930s
with a diversified industrial company that makes chemicals,
munitions, sporting goods and metals.
</P>
<P>
   At Iowa, Miller conceived the nation's first technological
entrepreneurship certificate program for engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an exceptional privilege and challenge to help Olin
College achieve its vision of preparing the next generation of
gifted engineers for leadership in the new global economy,'' Miller
said.
</P>
<P>
   The college plans to have an initial enrollment of 50 to 100
students and to grow to some 600 students by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement regarding the founding president was made by
Lawrence W. Milas, president of the F.W. Olin Foundation, who said
Miller ``has a very special commitment to integrating
entrepreneurship into technological studies as a major component of
the Olin College program.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's own background combines business with theory. His
specialties include earthquake engineering and spacecraft
structural design. With a Ph.D. from the California Institute of
Technology, he has taught civil, mechanical, environmental and
aerospace engineering at the University of Southern California and
the University of California and has been a consultant to the
Aerospace Corp., the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, Hughes Aircraft Co. and Astro
Aerospace Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the combined approach of theory and practice
improved learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undergraduate engineers will have their eyes opened to the
economic potential of their work,'' he said. ``When students see
the importance of their work in the broad sense, it increases their
excitement and motivation.''

BIOGRAPHERS TAKE TO THE FIRST LADY 
IN TOKYO, THE HIGH NOTE OF MUSICIANS' TOUR
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JAMES BARRON  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is anyone writing any biographies of President
Clinton? Maybe, but the potential biographee who has would-be
authors using words like fascinating and remarkable _ and warming
up their word processors _ is Hillary Rodham Clinton. In the next
year or so, there could be more biographies about her than about
him.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Sheehy, the cartographer of personal milestones in best
seller after best seller, said she was interested in writing a book
about Mrs. Clinton. Her agent, Lynn Nesbit, sounded more definite.
Asked whether Sheehy was working on a biography of Mrs. Clinton,
Nesbit gave a one-word answer, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Nesbit need not circulate a proposal when the time comes to find
a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote a 15,000-word article,'' Ms. Sheehy said. ``It's
better than any proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, in the February issue of Vanity Fair magazine, will
reach newsstands in New York on Wednesday or Thursday, Sheehy said.
``It won't even get to Washington until next week,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheehy said she doubted that Mrs. Clinton would run for the
Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't want to be in Washington,'' Sheehy said. ``It's
been a horrible place for her, and she doesn't like to answer
questions. I'm betting she likes being wooed, but in the end she'll
write a book and find her own platform.''
</P>
<P>
   But living in New York is a possibility, Sheehy said. ``Whether
or not they persuade her to run, she might very well move to New
York, as Jackie Kennedy did after her husband's demise. Or Eleanor
Roosevelt, who only found her own voice after she stopped caring
about her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to biographies.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Bernstein, who was half of the team at The Washington Post
that unraveled the Watergate story in the 1970s, has signed a
contract with Alfred A. Knopf for a book about Mrs. Clinton's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's infinitely interesting,'' he said after using the word
remarkable to describe her twice in less than 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said that he did not know when his book would come out
_ ``I want to be thorough,'' he said. ``I don't want to rush it.''
_ or how long it would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to write books more than 500 pages at the most
because I don't think people read them,'' he said. ``The pope book
ran 525 and was actually longer than I wanted.'' (``The pope
book,'' titled ``His Holiness: John Paul II and the Hidden History
of Our Time'' and written with Marco Politi, was published by
Doubleday in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   Knopf would not say how much it had paid for the book on Mrs.
Clinton; neither would Bernstein. Knopf seems to be betting that
Mrs. Clinton will be at least as popular overseas as she is in this
country, if not more so: It also acquired the foreign rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the High Note of Musicians' Tour &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Carney, the principal bass player for the New York Pops,
and his wife, Joyce Hammann, a substitute violinist, hailed a taxi
in Manhattan on Dec. 28.
</P>
<P>
   In the cab, they found a black quilted handbag. They looked
inside for identification. All they saw were Japanese travelers'
checks and a Japanese address book.
</P>
<P>
   ``No problem,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   For they were on the way to Kennedy International Airport to fly
to Tokyo for a six-day, five-concert tour.
</P>
<P>
   With help from a translator they knew only as Micky and from
another violinist in the orchestra, Katsuko Esaki, they made a
series of calls that led them to the owner of the handbag, Kazumi
Karaki, 34. She told Carney and Hammann that she had been in New
York at Christmastime and had taken the cab to Grand Central
Terminal. She soon realized that she had left the bag in the cab
and went back to the taxi stand at the terminal, hoping the driver
had not picked up another fare.
</P>
<P>
   Carney and Hammann handed the handbag back on Tuesday, before
they left Tokyo.

ROBERT KIRBY, 80, FORMER CHIEF   WHO HELPED SAVE WESTINGHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Iowa) 
 (dal) 
 BY LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert E. Kirby, a former chief executive of Westinghouse
Electric Corp. who masterminded a turnaround of the company in the
1970s, died Dec. 31 at Naples Community Hospital in Naples, Fla. He
was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby, who retired from the company in 1983, suffered several
strokes, a Westinghouse spokesman said. Since 1993, Kirby had also
suffered from Guillain-Barre syndrome, the nerve disorder.
</P>
<P>
   When Kirby became chief executive and chairman of Westinghouse
in 1975, it was the 36th-largest corporation and the largest
supplier of nuclear power plants in the nation. But the company,
based in Pittsburgh, was in an earnings slump, was burdened by
several money-losing operations it had acquired the previous
decade, had poor internal financial controls and had little in the
way of strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   With the company's future in doubt, Kirby orchestrated a
sweeping reorganization that included shedding some acquisitions,
strengthening internal control systems and returning the company to
its core electrical and industrial businesses. As a result, the
company's profits increased to $223 million in 1977 from $28
million in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   By 1981, the company's turnaround was completed, and
Westinghouse reported earnings of $403 million and began buying new
assets rather than shedding old ones. One main acquisition was the
$646-million purchase of Teleprompter, then one of the nation's
largest cable television operations. That deal doubled the size of
Westinghouse and positioned it for its later decision to become a
communications company.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby's nine-year tenure in the top position at Westinghouse was
also marked by difficulties in the company's uranium supply
contract business, which led to several legal entanglements that
Kirby took charge of negotiating. With uranium prices falling in
1975, the company argued that it was not obligated to fulfill
uranium supply contracts that would have cost it more than $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   A flurry of lawsuits by Westinghouse customers were settled a
few years later at a price to Westinghouse of about $600 million,
substantially below what it would have cost the company to fulfill
the contracts. Later, the company also settled suits it had filed
against what it called a cartel of uranium producers.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby was born in Ames, Iowa, on Nov. 8, 1918, and grew up in
State College, Pa., where his father was a professor of plant
pathology at Pennsylvania State University. Kirby and his father
assisted in the first filming of Penn State football games at
Beaver Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from
Penn State in 1939, Kirby took a job with the West Virginia Pulp
and Paper Co. in Tyrone, Pa., and within a year became assistant
superintendent of the mill. In 1943, he joined the Navy's highly
secret radar corps. He was sent to study electrical engineering at
Princeton University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
Bell Labs and was discharged in 1946 with the rank of lieutenant
after serving as an electronics officer.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Westinghouse in 1946 in its industrial electronics
division in Baltimore and left in 1954 to get an MBA from Harvard
Business School. He returned to Westinghouse in 1956 and rose
through the ranks from an electronics general manager to vice
president for engineering in 1963. In 1966, he became an executive
vice president, only one of two for the company, and in 1969 he was
named president of the Industry and Defense Co., the largest
operating division at Westinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, long after Kirby's retirement, Westinghouse acquired
the CBS Corp. and took the CBS name in 1997. After leaving
Westinghouse, Kirby moved to Pelican Bay, a retirement village near
Naples that had been developed by Westinghouse two decades earlier.
Kirby had pushed for development of the resort as a way to reduce
the company's reliance on cyclical manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Kirby's wife of 52 years, Barbara Anne, died in 1994. He is
survived by a daughter, Linda Mewshaw of London, and two grandsons.

JOSE VELA ZANETTI DIES AT 85; PAINTER OF MURAL AT THE U.N.
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Jose Vela Zanetti, a Spanish artist who in the
1950s created the imposing mural ``Mankind's Struggle for a Lasting
Peace'' at United Nations headquarters in New York, died on Jan. 4
in a hospital in Burgos in northern Spain. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Vela Zanetti won an international competition to create
a mural on the theme of peace for the U.N. headquarters. At the
time, he was in exile in the Dominican Republic after the Spanish
Civil War. Spain, under the Franco regime, was not admitted to the
United Nations until 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The mural, 64 feet long by 9{ feet tall, depicts the ravages of
war and concentration camps and shows people working together to
rebuild the shattered globe. It was painted in tones dominated by
blues and reddish browns and was inaugurated in 1953 in the hallway
outside the U.N. Security Council chambers.
</P>
<P>
   The mural was restored last year. On Dec. 15, in a rededication
ceremony with the mural as a backdrop, Secretary-General Kofi Annan
lauded Vela Zanetti's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Another major work, painted in the Dominican Republic, hung from
1959 to 1968 in the assembly hall of the International Labor
Office, a U.N. agency in Geneva. The untitled painting, measuring
14 feet by 12 feet, pictured broad-backed workers engaged in
industry, construction and agriculture. It remains in the labor
office's collection.
</P>
<P>
   Vela Zanetti was born in Milagros in Burgos province on May 27,
1913, but his family soon moved to the northern provincial capital
of Leon, where he began artistic training.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, he won a public scholarship to study art in Florence,
but the Spanish Civil War interrupted his education. His father,
director of a provincial slaughterhouse, was executed by forces
loyal to Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Vela Zanetti went into exile at the end of the war in 1939,
settling in the Dominican Republic where he painted more than 100
murals. He later won a Guggenheim scholarship for Hispanic artists
and lived in New York in the 1950s. He also worked in Colombia,
Mexico and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Spain in 1960, well before Franco's death, and
went to live in the house in Milagros where he had been born. He
turned to paintings in his later years; his subjects included
pastoral scenes, Castilian landscapes and religious works.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Vela Zanetti Foundation opened in Leon, exhibiting
50 of his paintings and a mural.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Esperanza de la Cuevas; a daughter,
Maria, and a son, Jose.  &QL;

IN SPITE OF PROBLEMS, BRUINS COME OUT AHEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Good season or bad? It depends on distance. The
further away you get, the more successful it becomes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, UCLA's season appears disappointing and somewhat
embarrassing. The losses to Miami and Wisconsin, the Fiesta Bowl
failure and the Rose Bowl breakdowns made for a deflating finish
despite the 10-2 record and No.8 ranking. The Bruins aren't even
the best team in the Pacific-10; Arizona is.
</P>
<P>
   Their words were even worse than their play. After Miami, the
offense ripped the defense and several players questioned the
severity of Brendon Ayanbadejo's injury. After Wisconsin, receiver
Freddie Mitchell and offensive tackle Kris Farris questioned their
teammates' heart. Farris also blamed ``the right side'' of the
offensive line for the final sack. A few feet away, quarterback
Cade McNown blamed freshman tailback DeShaun Foster for an
interception that was clearly McNown's fault.
</P>
<P>
   From any angle, it was an ugly end _ one that left coach Bob
Toledo in damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to make those comments,'' he said, referring to
the outbursts by Mitchell and Farris.
</P>
<P>
   But rewind three months, and the season changes shape. On Sept.
1, the Bruins would have jumped at 10 wins and a Rose Bowl
appearance. They were replacing seven starters on defense and
installing a new system. Offensively, they did not know who would
replace tailback Skip Hicks, right tackle Chad Overhauser or
receiver Jim McElroy. On Sept. 1, this space predicted UCLA would
win eight games and play in the Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? The tailback rotation worked as designed, Danny
Farmer emerged as an All-Conference receiver, McNown was superb and
the offense was so good it masked the defensive shortcomings. It
also set the defense up for a mighty fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our offense was a national championship-caliber offense,''
said embattled defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti. ``Our defense
was young and inexperienced. All year, the kids felt the pressure
of, `Could they live up to the offense?' ''
</P>
<P>
   They did, at least in the most important conference games of the
season. Aliotti's gang was at its best against Arizona and its most
opportunistic against Oregon. After those riveting October wins,
the Bruins seemingly were on the fast track to the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But rewind three years, to Jan. 4, 1996, the day Toledo was
hired, and a different perspective emerges. Back then, Toledo
thought it would take five years to rebuild the program, implement
his system and recruit the players to execute it. The
strength-and-conditioning program was in shambles, the defense was
small and slow, and the offense was too conservative to attract
fans and elite recruits.
</P>
<P>
   The upperclass talent had evaporated. UCLA went 5-6 in Toledo's
first season; the following April, no Bruins were picked in the NFL
Draft for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: UCLA's 10-win team of 1987 had 17 draft picks
among its junior and senior classes. The 1997 team won 10 games and
the Cotton Bowl with six draftable upperclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   In basketball, one player can turn a team around in one season.
But football rebuilding takes time, and UCLA's greatest weakness,
the defensive line, is the most difficult problem to solve.
</P>
<P>
   After years of using converted linebackers and second-rate
recruits on the line, the Bruins finally have a slew of big,
talented linemen on the roster. They were too young in '98, but in
the coming years _ when Toledo's highly rated recruits mature _ the
Bruins should win games 21-10.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, UCLA will struggle with a new quarterback and just
three senior starters (receiver Danny Farmer, fullback Durell Price
and cornerback Jason Bell). But in 2000, watch out. The quarterback
and young offensive linemen will have experience. Foster, Jermaine
Lewis, Brian Poli-Dixon and Freddie Mitchell will be upperclassmen.
And the prized defensive recruits will have a clue.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, this season was a pleasant surprise for Toledo
and his staff. The Rose Bowl berth came earlier than they
anticipated, and their rebuilding project is two years ahead of
schedule.

IONA FLATTENS MASSACHUSETTS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AMHERST _ The motto ``Refuse To Lose'' no longer applies to
University of Massachusetts men's basketball. It ceased making
sense over the past two seasons, when the Minutemen fell from the
perch reserved for the nation's elite programs. Yet they had
maintained the competitive drive and fighting spirit that helped
give rise to the rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After a 77-58 loss to visiting Iona Tuesday night, the lowly
Minutemen seem suited for another motto: Relight the Fuse.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times for a team many thought would be the
school's best since the 1996 Final Four squad, one that was ranked
in both the Associated Press and CNN/USA Today preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Tusday night, continuing a trend that has hampered it all
season, UMass (4-7) shot poorly, played sporadic defense, and
struggled to maintain intensity and focus when its problems
mounted.
</P>
<P>
   Iona (6-7), meanwhile, submitted one of its best efforts of the
season. The smaller Gaels outscored UMass in the paint, 65-27,
outrebounded the Minutemen, 46-32, and led by as many as 24 points
_ 67-43 with six minutes left. UMass trailed at halftime, 33-28,
then collapsed in the second half, playing lifeless basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one point in the second half where I thought we were
ready to get back in it,'' said UMass reserve center Kitwana Rhymer
(4 points, 4 blocks), whose rejection of Nakiea Miller led to a
3-pointer by Monty Mack (team-high 16 points) that cut the Iona
lead to 39-35 with 17:08 left.
</P>
<P>
   Then Fordham stepped up its play, outscoring UMass, 28-8, over
the next 11:08. The game was essentially over at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great win for us,'' said Iona first-year coach Jeff
Ruland, a former NBA player with the Washington Bullets and
Philadelphia 76ers. ``We're a pretty good defensive team when we
come to play. When we don't, bad things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Iona, which lost to Syracuse in the first round of the NCAA
tournament last year, was expected to be much better than its 6-7
mark would indicate, and Ruland said Tuesday night's win could
signal a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he empathized with UMass and particularly
center Lari Ketner, who scored just 4 points before fouling out _
the second consecutive game in which the Minutemen's leading scorer
last season has failed to score in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lari's searching right now, and I have a lot of sympathy for
him because I was a big man in college,'' said Ruland. ``Two of the
reasons I left my final year was one, I signed with an agent and I
didn't have any choice, but two, I was very tired of facing double-
and triple-teams and zones.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketner left with 7:40 remaining after defending Iona center
Kashif Hameed, who led the Gaels with 27 points on 10-for-17
shooting and had 7 rebounds. Upon reaching the bench, Ketner buried
his head in a towel and wept while being consoled by coach Bruiser
Flint and associate coach Geoff Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pains me to watch the kid,'' said Flint. ``He's the first
big player I ever got and I wanted him to have some fun. He has a
chance to fulfill a dream. Watching him out there, I wish I could
trade places with him.''
</P>
<P>
   At some points in the second half, there were smatterings of
boos from the crowd of 5,579, but after the final buzzer, many fans
stood and applauded as the team filed out.
</P>
<P>
   Flint, who thanked the fans for their support, remains
confident, though he conceded that this is a bigger hill to climb
than the 6-9 start of two years ago, after which a furious run led
to an NCAA berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without struggle, there is no progress,'' said Flint.

2 CHEMOTHERAPY OVERDOSES LEAD TO REVIEW OF NURSES
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds: SUBS lede to CORRECT number of nurses to 18, sted 16, and
clarify that the board has started disciplinary proceedings, NOT
issued charges; clarifies the board's accusations in new 3rd graf;
other editing changes throughout.) 
(ATTN: Mass.) (bl) 
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an action that reopens the question of how much
responsibility nurses have to question doctors' orders, a
Massachusetts licensing board said Tuesday that it had started
disciplinary proceedings against 18 nurses in the chemotherapy
overdoses of two women in 1994 at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Registration in Nursing said the patients, who died
after the overdoses, were given a four-day dosage of intravenous
chemotherapy on each of four days. One nurse hung the infusion bag
and connected it to the patient. Nurses in following shifts
monitored the flow.
</P>
<P>
   The board said the nurses should have recognized that they were
administering and monitoring quadruple dosages and should have
asked a supervising doctor to confirm the level of medication.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the patients, who were involved in an experimental
treatment for breast cancer, helped create a new international
effort in identifying and correcting errors in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Betsy Lehman, a 39-year-old health columnist for
The Boston Globe, died shortly after the overdose in November 1994.
The other, Maureen Bateman, 53, a North Andover teacher, suffered
severe heart damage from the overdose and died in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For 16 of the nurses, the punishments could range from
reprimands to license revocations. Two other nurses have agreed to
have their licenses placed on probation for one year, the Board of
Registration in Nursing said.
</P>
<P>
   Dana-Farber's president, Dr. David G. Nathan, vigorously
defended the nurses, saying they had been exonerated by three
groups that investigated the incidents: the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health, the Joint Commission on Accreditation
of Healthcare Organizations and Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses went through all the appropriate steps and followed
the standards of practice, Nathan said in an interview. He
attributed the error to a misreading of an ambiguous protocol, the
scientific blueprint that doctors and nurses follow in conducting
experiments that a hospital's ethics committee have approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nurses got bamboozled by a difficult-to-read protocol and
they should not be attacked in this way,'' Nathan said. ``We think
the nurses did their job in each case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan said his institute had taken responsibility for the
deaths and had since adopted a wide range of corrective actions.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe reported the board's action in Tuesday's
editions. Nathan said late Tuesday that his hospital had not had a
chance to talk to the board.
</P>
<P>
   The board's executive director, Theresa Bonanno, said that the
professional standard of care extended beyond a hospital's
guidelines. Massachusetts law states that ``each individual
licensed to practice nursing in the commonwealth shall be directly
accountable for safety of nursing care he delivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno said that when she was a practicing nurse she understood
that when a doctor's order seemed unclear, the physician should be
contacted for clarification.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not new,'' Bonanno said. ``That's not written _ that I
know of _ in any institution. It's a professional standard of care
that is expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Reardon, a lawyer representing the 18 nurses, said they
``are highly trained, extremely competent individuals'' who ``feel
terrible about what happened.'' Reardon and Nathan said that most
of the nurses still worked at Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   David Schildmeier, director of communications for the
Massachusetts Nurses Association, agreed with Nathan that the
systems in place, not the nurses, were responsible for the errors.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Foer, a spokeswoman for the American Nurses Association in
Washington, said the Massachusetts board's action ``sends an
alarm'' and renews attention to the problem of errors in
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Had Dana-Farber's nursing leadership position been filled at the
time, Foer said, ``this incident may not have happened.''
Dana-Farber has since corrected the problem, Foer said.
</P>
<P>
   Foer said many health care facilities had slashed positions of
nursing leadership, and often cut their most experienced nurses, so
``there is no one there to ask for guidance on an order.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand new nurses may be the only nurses on the floor,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine
disciplined Dr. James Foran, who wrote the incorrect order. Foran,
who is now doing cancer research at St. Bartholomew's Hospital in
London, signed a consent agreement acknowledging that he had been
guilty of negligence, misconduct and malpractice. The board
suspended Foran's right to practice medicine in Massachusetts for
three years, retroactive to October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses have 21 days to respond to the charges. The board may
then conduct a formal disciplinary hearing on the charges.
