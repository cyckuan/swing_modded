<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Roy Lassiter tied a club record with four
goals as D.C. United routed Joe Public of Trinidad and Tobago 8-0
Tuesday night in the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions Cup.
	   Ben Olsen and A.J. Wood added two goals each as United set
franchise records for most goals and victory margin.
	   United, the Major League Soccer champion in 1996 and '97,
advanced to a Friday semifinal against the winner of Wednesday's
game between Firpo of El Salvador and Leon of Mexico.
	   In the second game of Tuesday night's doubleheader, Deportivo
Saprissa of Costa Rica beat defending champion Cruz Azul of Mexico
5-3 on penalty kicks following a scoreless tie.
	   Saprissa keeper Erick Lonnis, who had just two saves, was able
to stop Luis Alfonso Sosa in the second round of penalty kicks.
	   All five Saprissa shooters scored against Cruz Azul keeper
Adrian Chavez with Jeaustin Campos clinching the victory in the
fifth round.
	   Cruz Azul did have a golden chance to score in the 36th minute
when Francisco Palencia dribbled away Lonnis. His shot on the open
net, however, was blocked by hustling Saprissa defender Victor
Cordero.
	   Deportivo Saprissa plays the winner Wednesday's quarterfinal
between Deportivo Alajeulense of Costa Rica and Toluca of Mexico.
	   The annual CONCACAF Champions Cup features the top teams from
last season in the top leagues of North and Central America and the
Caribbean.
	   Lassiter, who leads the MLS with 16 goals in 24 games, scored
two goals for D.C. United in each half, connecting in the 22nd,
29th, 67th and 72nd minutes.
	   Olsen, who joined United after his junior season at Virginia,
had goals in the 13th and 44th minutes and added two assists.
	   Wood, another Virginia product, scored in the 75th and 92nd
minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute.
	   Backup United goalkeeper Tom Presthus made seven saves.

Serena Williams rushes to first-round victory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with late match &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ With her higher-ranked sister
sidelined by an injury, 16-year old Serena Williams wasted little
time in her first-round match at the dlrs 450,000 Acura Classic
women's tennis tournament.
	   Williams needed only 38 minutes Tuesday night to crush Larisa
Neiland of Latvia 6-0, 6-0 at the Manhattan Country Club.
	   Displaying total domination, Williams lost only 19 points of the
68 points played. She polished off the win with her fourth ace of
the night.
	   ``I didn't think tonight's match would be easy,'' said Williams,
playing in her first tournament since Wimbledon. ``I just wanted to
stay focused. I was always bageling people in the juniors, but
never in the pros. It feels good.''
	   Serena's older sister, Venus Williams, pulled out of the doubles
on Monday because of tendinitis in her left knee which had been
bothering her in the last two weeks. Venus Williams was not
scheduled to play singles here.
	   Earlier in the day, Wimbledon finalist Nathalie Tauziat led
three Frenchwomen into the second round.
	   Playing a patient game and waiting for her opponent's mistakes,
Tauziat defeated Chanda Rubin 6-4, 7-5.
	   Seventh-seeded Sandrine Testud ousted Italy's Adriana
Serra-Zanetti 6-3, 7-5 and Alexandra Fusai eliminated 17-year-old
Alexandra Stevenson 6-3, 6-3.
	   Tauziat needed 87 minutes to down Rubin and won 83 percent of
her first service points, including six aces. Rubin dumped numerous
forehands into the net and double-faulted six times.
	   ``I don't think I played so well today.,'' Tauziat said. ``She
made some unforced errors. She can put the ball out or in and so
you just have to always concentrate. It was hot and humid and
sometimes I didn't read her so good.''
	   In another match involving a seeded player, No. 8 Natasha
Zvereva, a quarterfinalist here last year, defeated Anne Kremer of
Luxembourg 7-5, 6-2. Iva Majoli, the 1997 French Open champion,
fought back to beat Rita Grande of Italy 1-6, 6-2, 6-4.

Yankees 7, Twins 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Wells pitched a four-hitter to become only
the second pitcher this century to shut out a team in his first
start against them after a perfect game, and the New York Yankees
beat the Minnesota Twins 7-0 Tuesday night.
	   Wells, who pitched the perfect game at Yankee Stadium on May 17,
matched the feat accomplished by Philadelphia's Jim Bunning against
the New York Mets in 1964.
	   Paul O'Neill homered and Jorge Posada drove in three runs as the
Yankees (86-29) moved 57 games above .500 for the first time since
1939. New York, which has won six straight, has held leads in 40
consecutive games, tying the major league record set by the '32
Yankees.
	   Eric Milton (6-9), traded by New York as part of the Chuck
Knoblauch deal, was the loser.
 &UR; Rangers 2, Indians 1
	   In Cleveland, Esteban Loaiza (1-2), acquired from Pittsburgh on
July 17, allowed one run and seven hits in 7 1-3 inning to get his
first victory for Texas.
	   Juan Gonzalez, who leads the majors with 119 RBIs, missed his
second straight game and eighth in 13 games with a stiff neck. Mike
Simms, his replacement in the lineup, hit his 12th homer.
	   John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 32nd save. Steve Karsay
(0-2) gave up both runs and seven hits in 6 2-3 innings as
Cleveland dropped to 27-28 since June 9.
 &UR; Angels 5, Tigers 4
	   In Detroit, left fielder Luis Gonzalez's error allowed Jim
Edmonds to score the go-ahead run in the 11th as Detroit lost its
11th straight, matching its season high.
	   Edmonds, who had a two-run homer in the seventh, started the
11th with a double off Sean Runyan (1-4).
	   Pinch-hitter Craig Shipley hit a fly down the left-field line
and Gonzalez, after a long run, got the ball in his glove but
dropped it as Edmonds came home for a 4-3 lead.
	   Mike Fetters (2-6), making his first appearance for the Angels
since Oakland traded him Monday, got the win.
 &UR; Devil Rays 2, Orioles 1
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Bobby Smith singled home the winning
run off Armando Benitez (4-3) with two outs in the ninth.
	   Baltimore, trying to overtake Boston and Anaheim in the AL
wild-card race, lost for only the seventh time in 30 games since
the All-Star break. The Orioles, eight games behind the Red Sox at
the start of the night, had won six of seven coming in.
	   Jim Mecir (5-2) got the win, working out of a first-and-second
jam with one out in the eighth by striking out Cal Ripken and
retiring B.J. Surhoff on a groundball.
 &UR; Blue Jays 7, Mariners 4
	   In Toronto, Jose Canseco's two-run double keyed a six-run rally
in seventh, snapping Seattle's four-game winning streak.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. failed to homer for the 10th straight game,
going 1-for-4 with two strikeouts. Griffey, who leads the AL with
41 homers, hasn't connected in 46 at-bats _ his longest drought of
the season.
	   Chris Carpenter (7-6) won and Paul Quantrill pitched 1 2-3
innings for his third save. Jeff Fassero (10-8) was the loser.
 &UR; Athletics 6, White Sox 4
	   In Chicago, Bip Roberts had three hits, including a two-run
double. Ben Grieve also drove in two runs as the Athletics ended a
three-game losing streak. Oakland had lost 17 of its last 24 games.
	   Tom Candiotti (8-14) won his third straight start, allowing six
hits in 7 2-3 innings, and Bill Taylor got the final out for his
24th save. John Snyder (3-1) gave up six runs and eight hits in six
innings.
 &UR; Red Sox 7, Royals 4
	   In Boston, Nomar Garciaparra tied the score with a solo homer in
the sixth, then hit a three-run shot in the 10th that raised his
season total to 24.
	   It was Boston's seventh consecutive victory over the Royals, who
have lost five straight overall.
	   Tom Gordon (6-3) allowed one run and three hits in 2 1-3
innings. Jeff Montgomery (1-4) took the loss.

Ruddock beats Marin by TKO
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Former heavyweight contender Donovan ``Razor''
Ruddock stopped Rodolfo Marin after seven rounds of a scheduled
10-round fight Tuesday night.
	   Ruddock was in control most of the way in the bout at Miccosukee
Indian Gaming.
	   Ruddock's punches eventually caused Marin's left eye to close
and referee Armando Garcia stopped the bout after the seventh
round.
	   The victory was Ruddock's third straight since resuming his
comeback in April after a 2 1/2-year layoff.
	   ``I needed the work. He was a quality fighter,'' said Ruddock,
who is 31-5-1 with 23 knockouts. ``With each fight, I'm becoming a
better conditioned fighter.''
	   Ruddock, originally from Jamaica and now living in Plantation,
Florida, dominated the early rounds as he connected frequently with
straight lefts and right follows to the head.
	   In the third, Ruddock landed repeatedly with lead rights to the
head, causing the swelling on Marin's left eye.
	   Marin (21-5), from Puerto Rico, had one of his best rounds in
the fourth as he countered with rights to the head.
	   By the sixth, Marin took repeated combinations to the head and
appeared finished. Late in the round, Ruddock nearly finished
Marin, whose left eye was almost shut, with a three-punch
combination to the head along the ropes.
	   After the bout, Ruddock had his left hand in an ice bucket but
didn't believe his hand was seriously damaged.
	   ``Because of the adrenaline during the fight, I didn't feel
anything,'' Ruddock said. ``Now it's a little sore but I think I'll
be OK.''
	   Ruddock weighed 248 pounds (112 kilos), Marin 224 pounds (102
kilos).

	   PURCHASE, New York (AP) _ Top-seeded Jimmy Connors, hampered by
a tender left foot, narrowly defeated Australian John Fitzgerald
6-4, 7-6 (7-3) in the rain-delayed first round of the Citibank
Champions senior tennis tournament at Manhattanville College.
	   Connors, the four-time defending champion of this event, kept
Fitzgerald at bay Tuesday with his classic deep groundstrokes and
advanced to the quarterfinals where he will meet the winner of
Wednesday's match between Eddie Dibbs and John Lloyd.
	   Because of the rain delay, Tuesday's second match, between Jose
Luis Clerc and Mansour Bahrami, was postponed until Thursday
afternoon.
	   John McEnroe, the No. 2 seed in the 16-man, dlrs 200,000
tournament, plays Shlomo Glickstein of Israel in their opening

Former wartime Filipino sex slaves slam Japanese newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A group of Filipino women who were
forced into sexual slavery for Japan's army during World War II
denounced a Japanese newspaper Wednesday for questioning whether
the wartime atrocities actually occurred.
	   ``We are frustrated over the fact that until today there are
still sectors in Japanese society ... which still continue to
peddle the myth that the Japanese army did not commit any atrocity
during the last world war,'' said Nelia Sancho, a spokeswoman for
the group, Lila Pilipina.
	   In an editorial Tuesday, the conservative Yomiuri Shimbun
condemned a report by a U.N. committee on Japan's wartime sexual
enslavement of Asian women, saying there was no proof the women
were forced into prostitution.
	   Lila Pilipina replied that the testimonies of hundreds of former
sex slaves from the Philippines, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, China,
Malaysia and the Netherlands are ``the most undeniable proof'' of
the wartime atrocity.
	   ``The burden of proof does not lie with the women but with the
Japanese government,'' it said in a statement.
	   The Yomiuri, Japan's best-selling newspaper, said it was
unreasonable to single out Japan ``as the source of all evil'' when
other nations also committed war crimes.
	   It said the United States had set up ``Recreation and Amusement
Facilities'' that were prostitution centers for Allied forces
during its occupation of Japan after World War II.
	   The Lila Pilipina group said that did not justify Japan's
wartime actions.
	   ``The fact that other nations may be getting off the hook is not
an argument that Japan should be allowed to go scot-free as well,''
it said.
	   Ms. Sancho said the Yomiuri is promoting a ``negative
environment'' that encourages the Japanese government to ignore its
responsibility. But she said former sex slaves are ``not totally
disheartened because Japanese society is divided and there are some
segments who believe it has done wrong.''
	   Of 169 Filipino women documented to have been forced into sexual
slavery, 46 have sued Japan demanding compensation and an official
apology.
	   They are now awaiting a verdict in Tokyo District Court.
	   The U.N. report, by its Subcommittee on Prevention of
Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, is the latest by
several international groups that have investigated sexual
atrocities by Japanese troops during the war.
	   In 1994, the International Commission of Jurists concluded that
sexual slavery by Japanese forces was a war crime and that Japan's
government should assume legal and moral responsibility.
	   A similar report was issued by the U.N. Special Rapporteur on
Violence Against Women in 1996.
	   Last year, a committee of experts of the International Labor
Organization said the practice of using ``comfort women,'' the term
used in Japan to refer to the sex slaves, was a case of forced
labor and Japan was legally liable.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Jeff Kent hit a pair of two-run homers and
Barry Bonds added three RBIs as the San Francisco Giants broke a
five-game losing streak with an 8-7 win over the Chicago Cubs.
	   Sammy Sosa, tied with Mark McGwire for the major league lead
with 46, was homerless Tuesday, going 1-for-2 with two walks and a
hit by a pitch.
	   The Giants, who wasted a 5-0 lead, trailed by a run in the
seventh before Bonds tied the game with an RBI single and Kent
connected off Terry Adams (7-7) for his 19th homer.
	   Jose Mesa (3-2) got the win despite walking in the go-ahead run
for the third time in eight games. Robb Nen pitched the ninth for
his 30th save.
 &UR; Marlins 8, Dodgers 6
	   In Los Angeles, Jesus Sanchez (6-6) scattered five hits in 6 1-3
shutout innings and Todd Dunwoody homered and drove in three runs
as Florida Marlins built an 8-0 lead.
	   Florida, which has the worst record in the majors at 43-76, had
17 hits, the most off Los Angeles this season. The Dodgers, who
scored five runs in the ninth, lost for the fifth time in seven
games.
	   Darren Dreifort (6-11) allowed five runs and 11 hits in five
innings, striking out eight.
 &UR; Mets 8, Cardinals 3
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire moved back into sole possession of
the home run lead, becoming the first NL player to hit 47 before
September as the St. Louis Cardinals lost to the New York Mets.
	   Entering the game, McGwire had not put a ball in play for 13
plate appearances _ seven walks and six strikeouts _ since hitting
No. 46 on Saturday.
	   But McGwire doubled in the first inning and then hit a 464-foot
(141-meter) drive off Bobby Jones in the fourth. The solo homer to
left-center field ricocheted off a sign adjacent to the scoreboard.
	   McGwire had been tied for the major league lead with Sammy Sosa
of the Chicago Cubs, who connected twice Monday night.
	   Hack Wilson entered September with 46 homers in 1930, finishing
with 56 homers and a record 190 RBIs. Roger Maris hit 51 homers
before September in his record 61-homer season in 1961.
	   Edgardo Alfonzo had four hits as the Mets moved one-half game
ahead of the Cubs for the NL wild-card spot.
	   Jones (9-8) gave up homers to Fernando Tatis and pinch-hitter
Tom Lampkin in a three-batter stretch in the seventh. But Jones
helped himself with a two-run double.
	   Jones entered the season a .134 career hitter, but the double
that highlighted a four-run second against Kent Mercker (8-9) was
his eighth hit in a span of 20 at-bats.
 &UR; Astros 6, Brewers 5, 10 innings
	   In Houston, Bill Spiers tied the score with a ninth-inning
single and pinch-hitter Tony Eusebio drove in the winning run in
the 10th as the Houston Astros rallied past the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   Houston, which has won five straight, is 20-12 since the
All-Star game and improved to 39-18 at home this season. It was the
20th time the Astros have won in their last at-bat and their 35th
come-from-behind win. They have won seven of 45 games in which they
trailed after eight innings.
	   Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou had tied the score at 4 by homering
on consecutive pitches by Bronswell Patrick in the sixth. Alou has
32 homers, including four in his last five games.
	   Then in the 10th, Richard Hidalgo singled off Eric Plunk (0-1),
advanced on Mike Matheny's passed ball, took third on Ricky
Gutierrez's flyout and scored on Eusebio's line single to left.
	   Mike Magnante (4-5) pitched a scoreless 10th.
 &UR; Rockies 15, Expos 6
	   In Denver, Mike Lansing, Vinny Castilla and Todd Helton each
drove in four runs and the Colorado Rockies defeated the Montreal
Expos.
	   Dante Bichette went 4-for-4 and raised his batting average to
.347, three points behind NL leader John Olerud of the New York
Mets. Bichette is 16-for-27 in his last six games.
	   Lansing hit a three-run homer in a five-run first inning as the
Rockies won for the eighth time in 10 home games.
	   John Thomson (7-8), backed by a 19-hit attack, won his second
straight start. He was hit in the right knee by Vladimir Guerrero's
liner in the ninth inning, and left the game with a bruise.
	   Jim Powell (1-2) lasted four innings, allowing seven runs and
seven hits in his third major league start.
 &UR; Pirates 7, Reds 0
	   In Cincinnati, Francisco Cordova pitched a six-hitter for his
second shutout and Kevin Young and Jason Kendall homered as the
Pittsburgh Pirates beat the Cincinnati Reds.
	   Cordova (10-10) had more control problems _ he walked four,
pushing his total to 19 in the last 37 1-3 innings _ but allowed
only three runners to reach second. He struck out six.
	   Brett Tomko (10-8) gave up only five hits and no walks over five
innings, but wound up allowing four runs as Pittsburgh followed the
formula of getting runners on, moving them over and getting them
in.
 &UR; Padres 3, Braves 1
	   In San Diego, Joey Hamilton (10-9) allowed one run and six hits
in seven innings to win his fifth straight decision, improving to
2-7 against Atlanta.
	   The Padres are 2-3 against the Braves this year, with four games
to go in the season series. The Braves lead the Padres by two games
in the race for home-field advantage should they meet in the NL
championship series.
	   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth for his major league-leading
39th save. Denny Neagle (11-10) lost for the first time in nine
career appearances in San Diego, including three starts. He allowed
three runs _ two earned _ and six hits in seven innings.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 7, Phillies 3
	   In Phoenix, Tony Batista hit two home runs and Jay Bell had a
homer and an RBI double as Andy Benes (10-11) won at home for the
first time in six starts since May 17, allowing three runs and
eight hits in 6 2-3 innings.
	   Mark Portugal (6-3) lasted 5 1-3 innings and was tagged for five
runs and 10 hits _ five in a four-run sixth inning. The Phillies
lost for the 11th time in 13 games.

Bangkok orders company to fix revealing bus shelter seats
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration
has ordered a company to reinstall hundreds of bus shelter seats so
that women don't have to sit in revealing postures, The Nation
newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   Pearl and Dean Siam was told to raise the seats in the 350 bus
shelters it constructed because they are too low for women to sit
in modest postures, the paper said.

Eight protesters injured outside Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Unidentified assailants threw bottles
at 80 people protesting outside the Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok
early Wednesday morning, injuring eight of them.
	   The group was protesting the continued military rule and human
rights abuses in neighboring Myanmar, also known as Burma, and the
injured included five exiles from Myanmar and three Thai students.
	   In two separate incidents, at 1 a.m. and 4 a.m., groups of men
riding in a truck and on motorcycles drove past and threw bottles
at the protesters as they slept outside the embassy. The assailants
were chased by two Thai policemen guarding the protesters, but they
escaped.
	   The eight who were injured were taken to Chulalongkorn Hospital.
The extent of their injuries was not immediately known.
	   Shattered glass littered the pavement as police interviewed the
protesters about the incident later Wednesday morning.
	   ``We believe it was Thais who were the attackers, but they were
paid by the Burmese because the Thai have no motivation to do
this,'' claimed Gaw Win, a Myanmar exile.
	   ``I will instruct local police to increase security for the
protesters,'' police officer Sawek Wattankit said after questioning
the protesters.
	   ``As long as their protest is peaceful, then we as police and as
Thais, support their movement,'' he said.
	   Myanmar's Embassy in Bangkok is the largest one that the country
operates.
	   Jane's Defense Weekly recently reported that the embassy had
installed advanced electronic surveillance equipment to spy on
activists, journalists and government officials in Bangkok.

Moody's downgrades credit rating for troubled Japanese bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In another blow to a struggling bank, Moody's
Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded its credit ratings for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   LTCB was reported in June to be on the verge of collapse after
Moody's downgraded its debt and its shares on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange became almost worthless overnight.
	   Debt-plagued LTCB later announced it was in talks to merge with
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. _ a move that was widely assumed to
have been coordinated as a virtual bailout for LTCB.
	   LTCB officials also have said, however, that their bank is in no
danger of failing.
	   In Wednesday's downgrade, Moody's lowered LTCB's long-term
deposit rating to just above speculative, or junk bond status. Its
senior debt rating fell to speculative grade.
	   Meanwhile, LTCB's short-term deposit rating was confirmed at
Prime-3, the lowest level of investment grade, Moody's said.
	   The latest rating actions conclude a review that began on May
27, 1998, Moody's said.
	   LTCB's rating outlook remains negative because of uncertainty
regarding the confirmation of the pending merger with Sumitomo
Trust, Moody's said.
	   ``The downgrade reflects Moody's view that the bank's core
wholesale banking business has been under significant pressure
because of its declining debenture refinancing capabilities in the
last few months,'' Moody's said.
	   In trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, LTCB shares were up 3
yen to 41 yen in midafternoon trading Wednesday.
	   Share prices below 100 yen are traditionally seen as a warning
sign of a company's imminent demise.

Howard urges Japan to do more; plays down latest market turmoil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John Howard
on Tuesday urged Japan to do more to tackle its deep-seated
economic problems with its economy, but said the latest volatility
on global financial markets was no reason to be ``overly
pessimistic.''
	   ``More needs to be done in Japan. The new Japanese government
does need to tackle some of the more deep-seated structural
problems of the Japanese economy,'' Howard said in a radio
interview.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi has been in power for less
than a fortnight and is under intense pressure to take measures to
boost the economy, which is in recession.
	   But Howard played down the effect of the latest market
volatility.
	   ``There's been some volatility on the financial markets for some
time now ... I wouldn't be overly pessimistic about it,'' he said.
	   ``What's happening in Asia is obviously of medium and long term
significance, but thus far Australia's held up pretty well.''
	   The Australian share market fell hard in early trading
Wednesday, matching the 1.3 percent fall of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average overnight.
	   The Australian market had recovered noticeably by midday, as
Asian markets opened stronger than expected, specifically Hong Kong
and Japan, given the weakness of the yen and other regional
economic concerns. At 0300 GMT, the All Ordinaries Index of
Australian shares was at 2548.8, down 12.3 points from Tuesday's
close but up from an intraday low of 2526.3.
	   Howard said the Australian government's tight fiscal policy has
helped protect the economy from the Asian economic crisis.
	   ``We have in fact done even better in protecting ourselves than
we thought because we've got the budget back into surplus a year
ahead of schedule,'' he said.
	   The administration on Monday reported a U.S. dlrs 708 million
(Australian dollars 1.2 billion) underlying budget surplus,
excluding one-off items such as revenue from asset sales, in
1997-98. That improved from a deficit of U.S. dlrs 2.9 billion
(Australian dollars 4.9 billion) in 1996-97.
	   In May, the government forecast an underlying deficit of U.S.
dlrs 684 million (Australian dollars 1.16) billion for 1997-98.
	   ``That has resulted in lower interest rates and lower inflation
and a more positive view around the world about the Australian
economy,'' Howard said.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers, nearing the bottom of a mountain
of twisted steel and concrete chunks of the embassy bombing in
Nairobi, Wednesday found the mangled body of a woman whose tapping
had inspired their work.
	   Rose Wanjiku was found dead at about 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) when
weary workers finally peeled back the last layers of wreckage that
had trapped her, witnesses said.
	   No one has been brought out alive since Saturday, the day after
terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, the Tanzanian
capital, killed at least 244 people and injured some 5,000.
	   Investigators suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in
the attacks, but no link has been found to any particular group, a
senior U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the U.S. FBI arrested 14
people: six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali and a Turk. Tanzania's
ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi, said some of
those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack that killed 10
Africans. He said they had been turned over to the FBI for
interrogation.
	   Meanwhile, a dozen FBI agents raked Laibon Road outside the
wrecked embassy in Dar es Salaam, searching debris for evidence.
The FBI said more than 175 agents are either in or heading to the
two nations.
	   In Nairobi, where at least 234 died, FBI agents used cotton
balls to swab fences, walls and metal fragments at the bomb site to
capture traces of explosives. They worked behind a shroud of black
fabric, not far from a spot Israeli rescuers said might still hold
survivors.
	   They had been heard nothing since Monday from a spot they
believed held Wanjiku, who last spoke to Kenyan Red Cross workers
on Sunday. On Monday rescuers heard tapping, raising the hopes of
Wanjiku's husband.
	   ``I'm hoping that she's still alive,'' Lawrence Irungu said at
the bomb site before her body was found. ``That's my prayers. ... I
will stay here until I see the end of the operation.''
	   Rescue workers expected to reach the bottom of the twisted pile
late Wednesday or early Thursday.
	   ``We're hoping that there are still a couple of void areas that
may be big enough for a person to survive in,'' said Jim Chinn,
spokesman for an American rescue team.
	   ``However, the further we go down, the more doubtful that it's
starting to look. We're getting to a point now where the debris is
more compact,'' he said.
	   Boy Scouts interrupted a jamboree to sweep up debris, while Red
Cross volunteers gathered eyeglasses, pens, torn ID papers and
other personal items, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   In a rare show of solidarity, President Daniel arap Moi and
leaders of four opposition parties visited the bomb site and
appealed to Kenyans to remain united.
	   The remains of a vehicle smashed against the embassy's back wall
and believed to have carried the bomb, was shrouded beneath a
red-and-white plastic sheet
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British Army in
Kenya, who was working at the bomb site, said nobody knows if the
vehicle actually carried the bomb. He believes the bomb was
professionally made.
	   ``My opinion is that it was definitely a commercial explosive.
This wasn't a homemade device,'' said Jones, a demolition expert
who has investigated Irish Republican Army bombings in Northern
Ireland.
	   The bomb left a 4-meter-diameter (13-foot-diameter) crater
behind the embassy, Jones said. The Kenyan Television Network on
Tuesday night quoted a source as saying an engine block had been
found in the crater.
	   A Kenyan guard at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi told the East
African Standard that he witnessed the attack.
	   Joash Okindo was quoted as saying he and his colleagues, armed
only with short wooden clubs, stopped five men in a truck at a
barrier to the embassy's front parking lot and forced them to turn
into the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles, shooting a guard and then hurling a grenade into
the compound. At least one Marine returned fire and moments later
the truck exploded, Okindo told the paper.
	   Okindo ``resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington. His legs and left arm were almost
severed, according to the paper.
	   In Washington, the United States announced it has suspended
operations at about half a dozen embassies because of increased
threats of terrorism. It named U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia
and Yemen as among the threatened targets.
	   Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said Tuesday that some
embassies also would have to be relocated to guard against
terrorist attacks. The embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which
sustained massive damages in bombings last Friday, also will have
to be rebuilt.

South Korean Roman Catholic priests visit North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Nine Roman Catholic priests from South
Korea have arrived in North Korea to participate in a joint mass to
celebrate Korean Independence Day this weekend, North Korea's
official news agency said Wednesday.
	   The delegation, which arrived late Tuesday for a one-week visit,
was ``warmly greeted'' by North Korean officials, the North's
Korean Central News Agency said.
	   The delegation was headed by the Revs. Moon Kyu-hyun and Park
Seung-won, co-chairmen of the (South) Korean Catholic Priests'
Council for Justice, an outspoken human rights group.
	   A Council spokesman in Seoul said that the priests will attend a
mass to be held at Changchung church in Pyongyang on Saturday, the
53rd anniversary of Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule
in 1945.
	   Changchung church, built in the late 1980s, is the only Catholic
church in North Korea, a hard-line communist country.
	   The nine priests were among 13 South Korean Christian leaders
invited by North Korea for participation in a series of
Independence Day celebrations.
	   The 13 left Seoul on Monday to enter North Korea by way of
Beijing. North Korea's embassy in Beijing, however, issued entry
visas only for the nine Catholic priests.
	   It was not immediately known why the North refused to issue
entry visas for the other four Christian leaders, all from the
National Council of Churches.
	   The four NCC ministers were on their way back to Seoul
Wednesday, NCC officials said.
	   The Korean peninsula was a colony of Japan from 1910 to 1945.
Soon after the liberation, it was divided into communist North
Korea and capitalist South Korea. The two Koreas fought a bloody,
three-year war in the early 1950s.

Singapore bourse hits new 10-year intra-day lows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's rattled stock market succumbed to
another day of selling pressure on Wednesday, dropping through a
psychologically important support level and plumbing fresh
intra-day 10-year lows.
	   The overnight plunge on Wall Street added to regional jitters
propelling Singapore's benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index
below the 1,000-point level, dealers said.
	   It was down 2.2 percent to 985.82 during mid-morning trading,
its lowest intra-day level in 10 years, but recouped some of its
losses to end the morning session at 992.43, 1.5 percent off the
Tuesday close of 1007.93 points.
	   ``All the markets are volatile now,'' said a dealer at a local
brokerage.
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1.3
percent, or 112 points, to close Tuesday at 8462.85. It was the New
York Stock Exchange's second major fall in a week.
	   Wild volatility in regional currencies has also continued to
unnerve investors, according to traders in Singapore.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 145.61 Japanese yen earlier Wednesday
morning, two yen below the eight-year high of 147.61 on Tuesday.
	   Fearing government action to prop up the yen, currency traders
dumped dollars after comments from Japanese Finance Ministry
officials hinted at yen-buying intervention.
	   On the Singapore stock market, blue chips and banking stocks led
losing issues, as retail and institutional investors bailed out,
according to market analysts.
	   Dealers said they expect the Singapore index to slide lower
toward the 800-850 support level by the end of the year.
	   The Singapore dollar was stronger Wednesday, in line with the
rallying yen. It stood at about 1.75 against the greenback, down
from about 1.76 late in Asia the previous day.

Thai prime minister orders probe into cable television monopoly
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has
ordered the Consumer Protection Board to investigate Thailand's
sole cable television operator to see if its monopoly violates the
constitution, The Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
	   United Broadcasting Corporation became the lone cable provider
when International Broadcasting Corporation and United Television
Corporation merged two months ago.
	   Chuan is also considering purging management of the Mass
Communications Organization of Thailand for approving the merger,
The Nation reported.
	   Article 87 of Thailand's constitution says the government is
responsible for promoting free trade and preventing direct and
indirect monopolization.
	   ``Customers now have no choice,'' Yongyuth Tiyapairat, chairman
of the Consumer Protection Board, was quoted as saying by The
Nation.
	   UBC's slogan is ``You've Got to Watch It.''
	   The company is owned by Thaksin Shinawatra, a billionaire who
recently formed a political party to challenge Chuan's Democrat
Party, and Dhanin Chearavanont, chairman of Charoen Pokphand, an
agro-industrial conglomerate which reportedly contributed heavily
to the New Aspiration Party of ex-Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh.
	   UBC, the newly merged company, has been flooded with complaint
calls since it began operations. Consumers are angry over what they
consider unfair pricing and surcharges to receive sports channels
that show English Premier League soccer.

Wall Street plunge no shock to depressed Asian markets

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo markets are on a week-long losing streak.
Hong Kong is at a 5-year low. In Singapore, stocks haven't been so
cheap in a decade _ and are still heading south.
	   The overnight plunge on Wall Street sank in slowly at Asia's
enfeebled stock exchanges Wednesday morning, further depressing
some markets and cementing fears there's no end in sight for the
region's downward spiral.
	   At the Tokyo Stock Exchange, on its longest roll of losing days
in two years, the tailspin in New York on Wednesday was only the
latest in a steady stream of dark market news.
	   With prices already low and many dealers away for ``O-bon,'' or
Festival for the Dead, summer holidays, the reaction was muted. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 56.29 points, or 0.37
percent, to 15,350.70 as of midday. The index has closed lower for
the past seven straight trading days.
	   ``It doesn't seem panicky ... just this sort of ongoing
depression,'' said Paul Migliorato, senior manager of institutional
sales at Jardine Fleming Securities. ``No one is near the window
ledges.''
	   Still, some were jittery after Tuesday's drop in New York. Just
a week after surrendering 299 points in its third worst point loss
ever, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 258 points before
recovering somewhat and finishing 112 points lower at 8,462.85.
	   At a large electronic billboard listing stock prices near Tokyo
Station, a handful of concerned investors crowded around during
lunch break to monitor the action.
	   ``I am worried and the atmosphere is grim,'' said Seiji Kon, 51.
``If the economy in the United States gets bad, Japan's economy
will get even worse.''
	   Though the New York drop was a jolt after years of a bull market
on Wall Street, it was nothing compared to the daily mayhem that
Asian markets have suffered since the region's economy nose-dived
last year.
	   In Hong Kong, the mood is dark. The market's benchmark Hang Seng
Index is down a crushing 21 percent in the past three weeks,
including a 3.6 percent decline Tuesday to a five-year low of
6779.95 points.
	   The reaction in Hong Kong to Wall Street on Wednesday was
subdued, however, with no sense of urgency. The Hang Seng finished
its morning session up slightly on mostly technical buying.
	   But the quiet ``doesn't necessarily mean that the worst is over,
or that investors should be rushing back into the market,'' said
James Osborn, sales director of ING Barings Securities.
	   Singapore reacted quickly to the turmoil. The Straits Times
Industrials Index benchmark opened below the 1,000-point level
Wednesday, at one point hitting a fresh 10-year low of 995.60.
	   Chia Yew Boon, head of research at Santander Investment
Securities Singapore, said the sell-off in New York and further
depression in Asia could set off a string of market reactions.
	   ``What happens in Asia spooks the U.S. market, which then goes
down, and that in turn spooks the Asian markets the following
day,'' he said, predicting another round of selling in New York.
	   Indeed, the downturn in the U.S. market is rooted in the
financial crisis in Asia and in particular the mounting problems in
Japan, where the world's second-largest economy is in deep
recession, its worst since World War II.
	   A Japanese recovery is seen as vital to ending an Asian fiscal
crisis, but that is growing increasingly remote. Japan's new
government is promising quick action, but opposition parties are
threatening to block key financial legislation.
	   The inaction is cause for worry in the region.
	   ``More needs to be done in Japan. The new Japanese government
does need to tackle some of the more deep-seated structural
problems of the Japanese economy,'' Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said in a radio interview Wednesday.
	   Howard spoke as the Australian share market fell hard in early
trading Wednesday, matching the fall in New York. The Australian
market rebounded later in the day.
	   Fears are building that Japan could be headed for a severe bout
of instability comparable to the collapses of several major
financial institutions last November.
	   The trouble has taken its toll on the yen, which hit an
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar Tuesday at 147.61 yen. The
currency rebounded somewhat on Wednesday to 146.16 yen to the
dollar.
	   A slump in the United States would come at a bad time for Asia,
robbing the region of its biggest market just when it's most
needed.
	   ``A plunge in the U.S. market muddies the waters for Japan and
Asia,'' said salesman Takayoshi Tobari in Tokyo, adding that
slumping exports ``would be really bad for Japan.''

Japanese opposition parties reach basic agreement on alternative to
</HEADLINE>
bridge bank &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Three opposition parties reached a tentative
agreement Wednesday on banking bills that they hope to submit in
Parliament as an alternative to the ruling party's ``bridge bank''
plan to clean up bad loans dragging down the banking system.
	   The main opposition Democratic Party, the Peace and Reform Party
and the Liberal Party jointly drafted the proposals, but they won't
be submitted unless the three groups formally decide to call for
early elections.
	   That depends on whether another opposition party, the Komei,
forms an alliance with the governing Liberal Democratic Party or
whether it backs opposition calls to dissolve Parliament. The Peace
and Reform Party is allied with the Komei.
	   The pillar of the ruling party's bank legislation is the
creation of a government-run ``bridge bank'' that would take over
insolvent banks and keep them running for up to five years while
bad loans and remaining assets are sold. The plan would be funded
by up to 11 trillion yen (dlrs 76 billion) in public funds.
	   The bill is designed to prevent a bank collapse from hurting its
healthy customers by allowing its government-appointed managers to
continue making loans to sound borrowers.
	   Opposition parties have criticized the plan, saying that the use
of public funds to take over the assets of shaky banks would be too
lenient on bank managers who allowed bad loans to accumulate in the
first place.
	   The opposition parties' alternative proposal would limit the use
of public funds in mopping up the bad loan mess. It would also call
for abandoning a governing party scheme in which public funds would
be used to buy preferred stock from banks to strengthen their
capital bases.
	   In addition, the parties want the government either to purchase
all the shares of failed banks and place them under state control
or to appoint an official to liquidate them.
	   Japanese financial institutions are suffocating under problem
loans estimated at more than 80 trillion yen (dlrs 556 billion),
mostly left over from the collapse of Japan's real estate market in
the early 1990s.

FBI collects traces of explosives as survivor search nears end

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers, nearing the bottom of a mountain
of twisted steel and concrete chunks of the embassy bombing in
Nairobi, Wednesday found the mangled body of a woman whose tapping
had inspired their work.
	   Rose Wanjiku was found dead at about 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) when
weary workers finally peeled back the last layers of wreckage that
had trapped her, said Israeli Col. Udi Benuri, who was overseeing
the rescue.
	   No one has been brought out alive since Saturday, the day after
terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed at
least 250 people and injured some 5,000.
	   Investigators suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in
the attacks, but no link has been found to any particular group, a
senior U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the U.S. FBI arrested 14
people: six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali and a Turk. Tanzania's
ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi, said some of
those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack that killed 10
Africans. He said they had been turned over to the FBI for
interrogation.
	   Meanwhile, a dozen FBI agents raked Laibon Road outside the
wrecked embassy in Dar es Salaam, searching debris for evidence.
The FBI said more than 175 agents are either in or heading to the
two nations.
	   In Nairobi, where at least 240 died, FBI agents used cotton
balls to swab fences, walls and metal fragments at the bomb site to
capture traces of explosives. They worked behind a shroud of black
fabric, not far from a spot Israeli rescuers said might still hold
survivors.
	   They had been heard nothing since Monday from a spot they
believed held Wanjiku, who last spoke to Kenyan Red Cross workers
on Sunday. On Monday rescuers heard tapping, raising the hopes of
Wanjiku's husband.
	   ``I'm hoping that she's still alive,'' Lawrence Irungu said at
the bomb site before her body was found. ``That's my prayers. ... I
will stay here until I see the end of the operation.''
	   Reaching Wanjuki was extremely difficult because of the weight
of material blocking her, and the risk of shifting material,
Israel's Benuri said.
	   ``If we saw her before we would have sent a doctor to help her,
but we couldn't do it, he said.

Cambodian singing monk to be defrocked after stabbing student
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A Buddhist monk will be defrocked
and possibly charged with assault for stabbing a young student who
complained about his loud singing, police said Wednesday.
	   The 22-year-old monk, Kong Bun Chhoeun, was told to lower his
voice when he was singing a popular Cambodian song along with the
radio at the Pochentong Pagoda, in southern Phnom Penh, a district
police official said.
	   The student, Chhum Ratana, 30, who also lived in the pagoda,
said the noise was disturbing his studies.
	   Following a brief fist fight, the monk stabbed the student with
a knife, cutting him on the right arm. A furious Chhum Ratana
demanded _ but did not receive _ 100,000 riel (dlrs 26) in
compensation.
	   ``The monk violated the Buddhist discipline and then committed a
crime,'' said the police officer, Mom Sovat, noting that monks are
restricted to chanting Buddhist scripts and forbidden from singing
popular songs.
	   ``We are waiting for him to be defrocked and if he refuses to
pay the student compensation, we'll take him to court,'' the
officer said.

Yangtze floods prompt call for public order amid looting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese authorities have issued new calls to
enforce order in areas stricken by China's worst flooding in 44
years, warning that looters and thieves preying on relief supplies
would be severely punished.
	   Cities in central Hubei and Jiangxi provinces were calm but on
alert after a flood crest, the fourth this year, surged down the
Yangtze River on Tuesday, further taxing levees sodden by more than
a month of flooding.
	   Orders by the Communist Party to ensure stability reinforce
indications that authorities are struggling to prevent anarchy in
areas that have been inundated for weeks.
	   Police and militia have stepped up patrols around railheads and
storehouses of relief supplies to protect the large accumulation of
goods brought in to aid the flood effort, the official Legal Daily
announced Wednesday.
	   Looting of houses and public buildings abandoned during the
floods waters must also be closely guarded against, it said.
	   ``Punish severely those deserving punishment, don't go lightly.
Secure order in disaster areas,'' the paper said, quoting a
circular issued by the party Tuesday.
	   Previous directives warned police to guard against food riots or
fights over distribution of relief supplies, and deputized
civilians have been organized into safety patrols. State media have
reported several arrests for livestock stealing and burglary in
flooded areas.
	   Several Communist Party officials have also been punished for
dereliction of flood prevention duties.
	   More than 2,000 persons have died and millions have been made
homeless in the worst flooding since 1954, brought on by unusually
heavy seasonal rains.
	   In the northeast, the Nenjiang River in Inner Mongolia and
Heilongjiang province breached a dike on Tuesday, stranding 2,300
people, the paper said. Another 15,000 have been stranded by a
breach in the Hulin River in the same area.
	   The Yangtze in many areas has exceeded historical high levels
and is forecast to remain swollen for several more weeks.
Torrential rains upriver in Sichuan province could trigger yet
another flood crest, the official newspaper China Daily reported.
	   Flash floods have killed 34 people and injured 69 in Sichuan
over the past 10 days, the paper reported.
	   Water levels fell slightly Wednesday in the industrial center of
Wuhan.
	   In Huamei county, across the river from the city of Jiujiang in
eastern Jiangxi province, homes and factories were flooded up to
the first floor level in a 300-meter (990-foot) swath between the
river and a major dike that has held.
	   Thousands of residents were flooded out of their homes in
Jiujiang on Friday when a dike burst, and large parts of the city
of 500,000 remained under water.
	   Dysentery and infections from polluted water are rife among
refugees, but Chinese authorities have been well prepared to
prevent outbreaks of disease, according to Red Cross teams who have
travelled in flood-stricken areas.
	   Some outbreaks have been reported, but were quickly controlled,
the Health Ministry's official newspaper, Health Daily, reported.
It did not name the types of disease discovered. Millions of flood
victims are living in makeshift shelters amid brutally hot and
humid weather.
	   Flooding has been blamed in part on a weather pattern that has
created conditions eerily similar to 1954, when 30,000 died in
floods along the Yangtze, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted
meteorologist Chao Jiping saying.

U.S. navy sailor killed, another seriously injured aboard ship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Navy serviceman was killed and another
seriously injured after they were hit by scalding steam from a
ruptured pipe aboard a destroyer, the U.S. military said Wednesday.
	   Electronic warfare technician 3rd class Christopher Eric Wise,
of Moundsville, West Virginia, was pronounced dead at the Navy
Hospital in Okinawa where he was taken after the accident, the Navy
said in a press release.
	   The accident occurred in a bathing area aboard the USS Cushing
Tuesday afternoon at port in Okinawa, the release said.
	   The other sailor, whose name was not released, was also taken to
the same hospital for treatment for first- and second-degree burns,
the Navy said. The sailor was ``in serious but stable condition,''
it said.
	   The cause of the accident was under investigation, the Navy
said.
	   The Cushing, stationed at the U.S. Naval base at Yokosuka, just
southwest of Tokyo, was in Okinawa for routine training at the time
of the accident, the Navy said. Okinawa is about 1,600 kilometers
(1,000 miles), southwest of Tokyo.
	   There are currently about 47,000 U.S. military personnel
stationed in Japan under mutual security arrangements between Japan
and the United States.

Report: Israel discounted warning of Kenya bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel advised U.S. officials to treat with
skepticism a warning by an intelligence source that the American
Embassy in Kenya might be the target of a bombing attack, the daily
Haaretz reported Wednesday.
	   The warning came shortly before synchronized bombing attacks
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, the
report said. More than 200 people were killed and nearly 5,000
injured in the attacks.
	   According to Haaretz, at an internal briefing following the
attack, an Israeli security official said that prior to the
bombing, the Americans had asked Israeli intelligence for an
assessment of the source's credibility. Israel said that based on
its experience, the man's information should be treated with
skepticism.
	   The report gave no other details about the intelligence source's
identity, or Israel's previous dealings with him.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinksy
would not comment directly about the report.
	   ``It is not our habit to comment on security matters of this
kind, irrespective of whether (the allegations) are correct or
not,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Israel and the U.S. routinely exchange intelligence reports as
part of their counter-terrorism efforts.

Tehran's former mayor has filed appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Lawyers for the former mayor of Tehran, who
was sentenced to five years in jail last month for corruption, have
filed an appeal, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Wednesday.
	   The appeal was submitted Tuesday by Bahman Keshavarz, lawyer of
of the deposed mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, the agency reported.
Keshavarz said he hoped the appeals petition would soon be reviewed
``by an appeals court and the result will be what was long expected
_ his acquittal,'' the agency said.
	   Last month, Karbaschi was found guilty of embezzlement during
his eight years as Tehran's mayor. He was fined 1 billion rials
(dlrs 330,000), ordered to pay 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) to
the city and banned from holding any government job for 20 years.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted making mistakes, but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohamamad Khatami,
had been a target of the president's hard-line political rivals and
many Iranians say the trial was a political settling of scores.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Defying Myanmar's military regime,
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Wednesday left her home to
meet members of her party outside the capital, even though she has
been barred from previous attempts to do so.
	   Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, was headed
for Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, said
officials in her party, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   They said they believed she had been stopped en route again by
the authorities, though they could not confirm where.

Dollar falls in Tokyo, Japanese stock prices decline slightly

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar retreated against the yen Wednesday
amid speculation monetary authorities might intervene to buoy the
embattled Japanese currency. Tokyo stocks fell slightly.
	   The dollar bought 145.96 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 1.45
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York
rate of 147.35 yen.
	   Profit-taking triggered by nervousness over the possibility of
yen-buying intervention eroded the dollar's gains against the
Japanese currency on Tuesday when it soared to an eight-year high
of 147.61 yen.
	   ``There is strong caution against possible intervention,'' said
Takuma Kurosawa, chief foreign exchange manager at Mitsubishi Trust
&AMP; Banking.
	   The Japanese Finance Minister's vice minister for international
affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, suggested Japan was prepared to bolster
the sagging yen.
	   ``If it is necessary, we will intervene,'' Sakakibara told Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   Still, some players discounted the likelihood of large-scale yen
purchases by the Bank of Japan.
	   Despite the yen's modest recovery Wednesday in Tokyo, traders
said the currency remains vulnerable to selling pressure amid
continued instability in Asian markets.
	   Meanwhile, Japanese stocks posted a slight decline on lingering
worry over the recent drop in neighboring Asian markets and a
plunge overnight in U.S. stocks traded on Wall Street, trader said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average fell 28.02 points, or 0.18 percent, to close at
15,378.97, marking an eighth straight day of losses. On Tuesday,
the Nikkei lost 219.43 points, or 1.40 percent.
	   ``The market can't find any bullish factors that would prompt
buying, except a reversal of the excessively weak yen seen earlier
today,'' said Takeshi Kubota, a general manager at Meiko Securities
Co.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 112.00 points _ or 1.3
percent _ to close Tuesday at 8,462.85 points.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section, declined 6.88 points, or 0.58 percent, to finish at
1,180.00. The TOPIX ended down 20.21 points, or 1.67 percent, the
day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.175 percent from Tuesday's 1.180 percent, driving
its price up to 111.94 yen compared to 111.92 yen the previous day.

Synchronized diving adds new twist to national championships
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to CORRECT spelling of Kissimmee in 5th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The view is frightening enough from a 10-meter
tower when diving alone. Imagine what it's like to plunge into the
water below with a partner just inches away, matching your every
move.
	   Welcome to the burgeoning sport of synchronized diving, which
was featured Tuesday on the opening day of the 1998 National Diving
Championships.
	   ``The 10-meter tower is like Russian roulette as it is,'' said
Chris Mantilla of Boca Raton, Florida. ``Synchro is like Russian
roulette with two bullets in the chamber.''
	   Synchronized diving, recognized since 1995 and quickly becoming
popular with the fans, involves pairs taking off side by side from
either the 10-meter platform or from parallel 3-meter springboards.
They are judged on their individual technical skills and the
ability to coordinate their movements and enter the water together.
	   ``It's more of a distraction,'' said Bryan Gillooly of
Kissimmee, Florida, Mantilla's partner in the 3-meter event. ``When
you're doing 3 1/2 flips and someone is a couple of inches away
doing the same thing, it's hard not to see them. You really have to
focus on what you're doing.''
	   Synchronized diving is now recognized in most major
international events, including the world championships and the
recent Goodwill Games in New York. However, it hasn't been added to
the Olympic program.
	   ``Our eyes are set on individual goals,'' admitted Mantilla, who
will compete in all three individual and both synchronized events
in the national championships. ``They are more important to us
right now.''
	   ``We do most of our training alone,'' added Gillooly, the
defending national champion on the 1-meter springboard. ``We just
do synchro at the big meets.''
	   Gillooly and Mantilla were lured into synchronized competition
by their coach, Randy Ableman, who believes it is destined to
become a major force in the sport with wider exposure.
	   ``There's definitely a greater chance of smacking into
something,'' Mantilla said, grinning. ``Maybe that's why the crowds
like it so much.''
	   Todd Smith, executive director of U.S. Diving, said research has
shown synchronized diving is viewed by fans as more dangerous,
dramatic, artistic and entertaining than individual events.
	   ``Synchronized diving is the next aquatics events to probably be
approved for Olympic competition,'' Smith said. ``Hopefully, it'll
be in the Games at least by 2004, and at that point synchronized
diving will really take off.''
	   The national championships, which last until Sunday, are being
held at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center, site of the Olympics two
years ago. The roofed, open-air facility held 14,600 during the
Games but has been downsized to 2,100 seats.
	   In this non-Olympic year, more than 125 divers were competing
for spots on U.S. national teams that compete in major
international events such as the World Cup.

Exiled Chinese dissident's wife to request passport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The wife of exiled Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe
is planning to apply for a passport to visit her husband in the
United States, a human rights group said Wednesday.
	   Su Jiang, who remained behind in the southern city of Guangzhou
after her husband fled into exile in 1996, hopes to be reunited
with Wang in his adopted home, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said.
	   It was unclear if Su would be granted a passport. In May, the
police prevented her from travelling to the nearby Portuguese
colony of Macau to join her husband, who was attending a gathering
of dissidents there.
	   After Wang left China, the government said his case should be
classified as ``illegal emigration.'' Wang's subsequent
announcement that he wanted to join the Nationalist Party of
Taiwan, historic rivals of China's Communist Party, further angered
Beijing.
	   The 46-year-old former factory worker launched his career as an
activist when he wrote ``dazibao,'' or anti-government wall
posters, in 1974.
	   In 1981, he was sentenced to 14 years in prison for what the
government called ``counter-revolutionary'' activities, but was
released two years early in 1993. He was jailed off and on after
that for his democracy campaigning.
	   Wang escaped China via Hong Kong and was allowed into the United
States under a temporary ``public interest'' parole issued for
humanitarian purposes.

Report: Israel discounted warning of Kenya bombing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel advised U.S. officials to treat with
skepticism a warning by an intelligence source that the American
Embassy in Kenya might be the target of a bombing attack, the daily
Haaretz reported Wednesday.
	   The warning came shortly before synchronized bombing attacks
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday, the
report said. More than 200 people were killed and nearly 5,000
injured in the attacks.
	   According to Haaretz, at an internal briefing following the
attack, an Israeli security official said that prior to the
bombing, the Americans had asked Israeli intelligence for an
assessment of the source's credibility. Israel said that based on
its experience, the man's information should be treated with
skepticism.
	   The report gave no other details about the intelligence source's
identity, or Israel's previous dealings with him.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinksy
would not comment directly about the report.
	   ``It is not our habit to comment on security matters of this
kind, irrespective of whether (the allegations) are correct or
not,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Israel and the U.S. routinely exchange intelligence reports as
part of their counter-terrorism efforts.
	   Investigators suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in
the attacks and were looking at a large number of people with known
terrorist connections and sympathies, but so far no claim of
responsibility has been confirmed.

YANGON: confirm where.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Suu Kyi's last attempt to meet party members outside Yangon was
ended forcibly by authorities July 29 after a six-day standoff in
which she slept in her car and lived off supplies of food and
water.
	   Eventually, authorities seized her car and drove it back to her
residence in the capital, where she recovered from dehydration.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is largely
confined to her home and has little political maneuvering room. But
she has recently stepped up challenges to the government.
	   In addition to repeated efforts to go to the countryside, she
has given the military an Aug. 21 deadline to seat the parliament
elected in a 1990 general election.
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma,
since 1962, allowed the election to go forward but refused to honor
the result when Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory.
	   On Saturday, Myanmar marked the 10th anniversary of a nationwide
uprising against military rule. It was eventually crushed by
bullets and bayonets. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   Myanmar's own people, who fear a repeat of the bloodshed, were
calm on the anniversary. A day later, however, 18 foreign democracy
activists were arrested after handing out leaflets urging people to
remember the uprising.

Fresh rains kill three people, send thousands fleeing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains flooded streams and
triggered landslides in central South Korea Wednesday, killing at
least three people and forcing thousands of farmers to flee their
homes.
	   The downpour submerged 4,500 homes in Poun and Sangju counties,
150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Seoul, the Home Ministry
said.
	   At least 15,000 people, mostly farmers, were evacuated to higher
ground. Thousands more were being urged to abandon their homes
along the Nakdong River, which rose dangerously high, the ministry
said.
	   Up to 35 centimeters (14 inches) of rain fell in central South
Korea early Wednesday. Roads were washed away and telephone poles
downed, cutting off small villages, police said.
	   Kim So-rae, 85, was killed when flood water engulfed her home
early Wednesday. A 67-year-old woman was found dead after her home
collapsed under a landslide. In the same village, a man drowned in
floodwaters.
	   At least five people were reported missing.
	   Floods and landslides in the Seoul metropolitan area and central
South Korea last week left 171 people dead and 46 missing. A week
earlier, flash floods raging down mountain valleys at the southern
tip of the Korean Peninsula killed 67 campers and left 29 missing.
	   More than 136,000 people have been driven from their homes by
the on-again, off-again rains, and property damage is estimated at
up to dlrs 2 billion.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military court on Wednesday
sentenced two police lieutenants implicated in the shooting deaths
of four student protesters to 4 and 10 months in prison.
	   The May 12 shootings at Trisakti University in the capital,
Jakarta, sparked several days of deadly rioting that led to the
resignation of former President Suharto amid the worst economic
crisis in decades.
	   The two anti-riot officers were the first of 18 policemen to
face courts-martial over the deaths as the military responds to
demands for accountability and democracy under Suharto's successor,
President B.J. Habibie.
	   The court sentenced First Lt. Agus Tri Heryanto to 10 months in
prison and 2nd Lt. Pariyo to 4 months. They were found guilty of
disobeying orders and flouting proper procedures according to
military law.
	   The two were not charged with actually shooting the four
protesters.
	   However, prosecutors said they contributed to the deaths by
being undisciplined and unable to control their troops during a
student rally at the university against Suharto.
	   Prosecutors said the two had contravened orders from senior
officers when they ordered their men to fire warning shots above
protesters' heads and to clash with students.
	   This led to chaos at the university's campus that resulted in
the killings by other security personnel.
	   ``The action of the two policemen gave the impression of
arrogance. They disobeyed military law,'' said trial judge Col.
Sudi Suradji.
	   However, defense lawyer Bambang Widjoyanto said the two officers
would appeal.
	   ``The trial does not provide any proof of who shot the
students,'' Bambang told reporters.
	   The four dead students have been hailed by pro-democracy
activists, and even Habibie, as heroes of reform.
	   When the two officers' trial started last month, hundreds of
angry students protested outside the court.
	   In contrast, only about 50 students were on hand to hear the
verdicts and sentences.
	   Several students complained that the court had been too lenient.
	   ``I am not satisfied because it is a very light sentence,'' said
one student, El Maida.

YANGON: the uprising.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   On Wednesday, Suu Kyi may have been stopped at the same
roadblock as on her previous journey, 32 kilometers (19 miles) west
of the capital, party officials said.
	   She was taking the same route and was again accompanied by Hla
Pe, a 75-year-old member of her party's central executive
committee, as well as one or two drivers.
	   In apparent preparation for another standoff, she was traveling
in a friend's van instead of the previous sedan. The van would
allow more comfort for an extended stay and be able to carry more
food and water.
	   It was the fourth time in two months that Suu Kyi has tried to
make a journey outside the capital. The military has allowed her to
travel outside Yangon only once since her release from six years of
formal house arrest in July 1995, to visit a Buddhist monk.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's lakeside compound, refusing journalists
entry and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   It had also installed guards inside her compound, but they were
withdrawn earlier this week on her demand. The government added
security checkpoints on nearby roads and was searching cars that
left her home.
	   The party complained that the new measures amounted to a form of
house arrest. The government responded that Suu Kyi had received
300 visitors in a few days and noted that ``she will always be
provided with all necessary security and protection.''
	   ``There is no government restriction on her movement as long as
security conditions permit,'' the government said in a statement.
	   Suu Kyi's last journey drew international interest. The
government said it had supplied her with adequate supplies of
water, but party officials denied it.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the United
States would hold the government directly responsible for Suu Kyi's
health and welfare.

Myanmar pro-democracy leader on road in new challenge

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Defying Myanmar's military regime,
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi left her home Wednesday to
meet members of her party outside the capital, even though she has
been barred from previous attempts to do so.
	   Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, was headed
for Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, said party
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   They believed that authorities again had stopped her en route.
They could not confirm where, but thought it might have been the
same roadblock as in a previous six-day standoff, 32 kilometers (19
miles) west of the capital.
	   That standoff, in which she slept in her car and lived off
supplies of food and water, was ended forcibly July 29. Authorities
seized her car and drove it back to her home in the capital, where
she recovered from dehydration.
	   On Wednesday, Suu Kyi was again accompanied by Hla Pe, a
75-year-old member of her party's central executive committee, as
well as one or two drivers.
	   In apparent preparation for another standoff, she was traveling
in a friend's van instead of the previous sedan. The van would
allow more comfort for an extended stay and be able to carry more
food and water.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is largely
confined to her home and has little political maneuvering room. But
she has recently stepped up challenges to the government.
	   The foray Wednesday was her fourth attempt in two months to
drive outside Yangon. More importantly, she has given the military
an Aug. 21 deadline to seat the parliament elected in a 1990
general election.
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma,
since 1962, allowed the election to go forward but refused to honor
the result when Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory.
	   The military has allowed Suu Kyi to travel outside Yangon only
once since releasing her from six years of formal house arrest in
July 1995, to visit a Buddhist monk.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's lakeside compound, refusing journalists
entry and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Guards installed at inside her compound were withdrawn Friday on
her demand. The government has added security checkpoints on nearby
roads and searched cars leaving her home.
	   The party complained that the new measures amounted to a form of
house arrest. The government responded Tuesday that Suu Kyi had
received 300 visitors in a few days and noted that ``she will
always be provided with all necessary security and protection.''
	   ``There is no government restriction on her movement as long as
security conditions permit,'' the government said in a statement.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after Suu Kyi's
last standoff that the United States would hold the government
directly responsible for her welfare.
	   On Saturday, Myanmar marked the 10th anniversary of a nationwide
uprising against military rule. It was eventually crushed by
troops. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   Myanmar's own people were calm on the anniversary. A day later,
however, 18 foreign democracy activists were arrested after handing
out leaflets urging people to remember the uprising. They were
still being held Wednesday.

Scuffles erupt as Iranians try to enter Pakistan Embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Riot police surrounded the Pakistani Embassy
in Tehran on Wednesday after scores of angry protesters tried to
force their way into the compound to demand the release of Iranians
allegedly captured in Afghanistan.
	   Iran claims that 11 of its diplomats, a correspondent of the
state-run Islamic Republic News Agency, and 32 Iranian drivers were
captured by the hard-line Taliban militia in northern Afghanistan.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because Islamabad is widely believed to back the group that
blazed into the opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif on
Saturday.
	   Police in full riot gear arrived at the embassy in Tehran after
scuffles erupted between the Pakistani guards and protesters trying
to force their way in.
	   A glass door at the embassy entrance was smashed when an IRNA
reporter who forced his way in to speak to the ambassador was
pushed into it.
	   ``I was demanding to talk to the ambassador when the embassy
guards pulled me in. They beat me and pushed me into the glass
door,'' said the reporter, Abolfazl Shakeri. His clothes were torn,
but he was not injured.
	   The protesters, who numbered about 150, included families of the
Iranian drivers and IRNA employees.
	   They dispersed soon after the police surrounded the four-story
white marble building in a residential neighborhood near the city
center.
	   On Tuesday, the Pakistani Embassy issued a statement saying it
could not be responsible for events in northern Afghanistan but had
used all possible influence to ensure the safety of any Iranians.
	   The Taliban, who now control virtually all of Afghanistan, say
they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats, but claim to be
holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the Taliban's enemies.

Rail link between Russia and China complete
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Traffic began to roll Wednesday over a new link
joining the Trans-Siberian and Chinese railroads in Russia's Far
East, a news report said.
	   The 22-kilometer (13 mile) connection between Russia's Makhalino
and China's Hunchun stations will handle 500,000 tons of cargo in
each of the next two years, and will reach the capacity of 3
million tons by 2002, according to rail officials.
	   The two countries began building the link in 1993 as part of a
drive to boost trade between China's northern provinces and
Russia's east, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Trains along the new route will also handle passenger trips,
officials say.
	   Russia and China have traded heavily since the Soviet Union
collapsed. Leaders in Russia's Far East say commerce with China is
crucial to the region's development.

Olympic Committee urged to give up drug-testing of athletes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. Olympic Committee has been urged by
an advisory panel to turn over the testing of athletes for drugs to
an outside group.
	   The 39-member panel concluded that it is a conflict for the USOC
to conduct drug testing of the same athletes the organization
supports financially, The Washington Post reported Wednesday.
	   The panel said it did not lack confidence in the Olympic
Committee's ability, but was concerned about credibility in the
program.
	   ``It's very difficult in the international arena to have a high
degree of credibility when you're running your own program,''
Baaron Pittenger, chairman of the USOC's anti-doping committee,
told The Post.
	   Dick Schultz, the USOC's executive director, welcomed the
recommendation that an independent body administer the drug tests,
but questioned who.
	   ``It makes a lot of sense, but we have to take a closer look ...
This is something that would be a major change in our protocol,''
Schultz said.
	   Pittenger said the Olympic Committee could become a paying
client of an outside-operated drug-control agency, an approach
similar to the one taken by the Canadian Olympic Committee to test
its athletes.
	   The advisory panel included doctors, athletes and drug-test
administrators and met in late June. It is scheduled to submit a
report to the USOC's anti-doping committee in September. Any change
in the program would have to be approved by the USOC's executive
committee and board of directors.

U.S., South Korea plan joint military exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The United States and South Korea will
launch a two-week joint military exercise next week to boost
preparedness against possible North Korean attacks, military
officials of the two countries said Wednesday.
	   The annual Ulchi Focus Lens exercise, starting Monday, will be
the two allies' first joint military exercise this year.
	   About 13,000 U.S. soldiers, some of them based outside Korea,
will join in the exercise, which largely involves computer
simulations, with some troop movements.
	   South Korea is putting 57,000 troops, an unspecified number of
army reservists and government officials handling national security
affairs into the exercise, Seoul's Defense Ministry said.
	   During the exercise, South Korean government officials and army
headquarters officers of the two allies based in Seoul will be
ordered to man their posts around the clock in simulated war
conditions.
	   The exercise also will include mock air raids and chemical
weapons attacks on the capital, during which all streets will be
cleared, with pedestrians ordered to take refuge in underground
shelters.
	   Some 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed here under a mutual
defense treaty, and the armed forces of the two countries hold
several joint exercises each year. North Korea routinely protests
such exercises, calling them preparations for war against it.
	   The two Koreas are still technically at war, since no peace
treaty was signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

Moody's downgrades credit rating for troubled Japanese bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing LTCB share price, graf 10; bank comments,
grafs 12-14 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In another blow to a struggling bank, Moody's
Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded its credit ratings for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   LTCB was reported in June to be on the verge of collapse after
Moody's downgraded its debt, and its shares on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange became almost worthless overnight.
	   Debt-plagued LTCB later announced it was in talks to merge with
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. _ a move widely assumed to have been
coordinated as a virtual bailout for LTCB.
	   LTCB officials also have said, however, that their bank is in no
danger of failing.
	   In Wednesday's downgrade, Moody's lowered LTCB's long-term
deposit rating to just above speculative, or junk bond status. Its
senior debt rating fell to speculative grade.
	   Meanwhile, LTCB's short-term deposit rating was confirmed at
Prime-3, the lowest level of investment grade, Moody's said.
	   The latest rating actions conclude a review that began on May
27, Moody's said.
	   LTCB's rating outlook remains negative because of uncertainty
regarding the confirmation of the pending merger with Sumitomo
Trust, Moody's said.
	   ``The downgrade reflects Moody's view that the bank's core
wholesale banking business has been under significant pressure
because of its declining debenture refinancing capabilities in the
last few months,'' Moody's said.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, LTCB shares closed at 42 yen (29
cents) Wednesday, up 4 yen (2 cents) from Tuesday.
	   Share prices below 100 yen ordinarily are seen as a warning sign
of a company's imminent demise.
	   In a statement, LTCB called the downgrade ``gravely
regrettable.''
	   The bank blamed various speculation about the future of its
merger and business alliance plans for the recent fall in its share
prices.
	   LTCB said it hopes that credit ratings will be raised if the
merger goes ahead on schedule, improving its revenue and financial
situation.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers, at the bottom of a mountain of
twisted steel and concrete chunks of the embassy bombing in
Nairobi, Wednesday found the body of a woman whose tapping had
inspired their work.
	   Rose Wanjiku, who had only recently died, was found at 3 a.m.
(0000 GMT) when weary soldiers finally peeled back the last layers
of wreckage that had trapped her near an elevator, said Israeli
Col. Udi Benuri, rescue spokesman.
	   Five days after the explosion Friday, Benuri declared the search
for survivors over at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT).
	   No one had been brought out alive since Saturday, the day after
terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, killed
more than 250 people and injured some 5,000.
	   All that remained of the four-story Ufundi Cooperative building,
which bore the brunt of the explosion aimed at the American mission
next door, was churned up dirt littered with tattered clothes,
stained papers, shattered glass and tangled wire.
	   Worn out by their ordeal, exhausted Kenyan, Israeli and French
soldiers sprawled on the ground, some of them sleeping.
	   Investigators suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in
the attacks, but no link has been found to any particular group, a
senior U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the U.S. FBI arrested 14
people: six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali and a Turk. Tanzania's
ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi, said some of
those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack that killed 10
Africans. He said they had been turned over to the FBI for
interrogation.
	   Meanwhile, a dozen FBI agents raked Laibon Road outside the
wrecked embassy in Dar es Salaam, searching debris for evidence.
The FBI said more than 175 agents are either in or heading to the
two nations.
	   In Nairobi, where at least 240 died, FBI agents used cotton
balls to swab fences, walls and metal fragments at the bomb site to
capture traces of explosives. They worked behind a shroud of black
fabric, not far from a spot Israeli rescuers said might still hold
survivors.
	   They had been heard nothing since Monday from a spot they
believed held Wanjiku, who last spoke to Kenyan Red Cross workers
on Sunday. On Monday rescuers heard tapping, raising the hopes of
Wanjiku's husband.
	   ``I'm hoping that she's still alive,'' Lawrence Irungu said at
the bomb site before her body was found. ``That's my prayers. ... I
will stay here until I see the end of the operation.''
	   Israel's Benuri said Wanjiku had died less than 24 hours before
she was reached. Unlike most of the other bodies hauled out
Wednesday, hers was neither decomposed nor mangled.
	   Reaching Wanjuki was extremely difficult because of the weight
of material blocking her, and the risk of shifting material, Benuri
said.
	   ``If we saw her before we would have sent a doctor to help her,
but we couldn't do it, he said.
	   Boy Scouts interrupted a jamboree to sweep up debris, while Red
Cross volunteers gathered eyeglasses, pens, torn ID papers and
other personal items that will be used to identify dozens of
bodies, said Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   In a rare show of solidarity, President Daniel arap Moi and
leaders of four opposition parties visited the bomb site Tuesday
and appealed to Kenyans to remain united.
	   The remains of a vehicle smashed against the embassy's back wall
and believed to have carried the bomb, was shrouded beneath a
red-and-white plastic sheet
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British Army in
Kenya, who was working at the bomb site, said nobody knows if the
vehicle actually carried the bomb. He believes the bomb was
professionally made.
	   ``My opinion is that it was definitely a commercial explosive.
This wasn't a homemade device,'' said Jones, a demolition expert
who has investigated Irish Republican Army bombings in Northern
Ireland.
	   The bomb left a 4-meter-diameter (13-foot-diameter) crater
behind the embassy, Jones said. The Kenyan Television Network on
Tuesday night quoted a source as saying an engine block had been
found in the crater.
	   A Kenyan guard at the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi told the East
African Standard that he witnessed the attack.
	   Joash Okindo was quoted as saying he and his colleagues, armed
only with short wooden clubs, stopped five men in a truck at a
barrier to the embassy's front parking lot and forced them to turn
into the rear parking lot.
	   The attackers jumped from the truck and opened fire with
automatic rifles, shooting a guard and then hurling a grenade into
the compound. At least one Marine returned fire and moments later
the truck exploded, Okindo told the paper.
	   Okindo ``resisted heroically,'' U.S. State Department spokesman
James Foley said in Washington. His legs and left arm were almost
severed, according to the paper.
	   In Washington, the United States announced it has suspended
operations at about half a dozen embassies because of increased
threats of terrorism. It named U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia
and Yemen as among the threatened targets.
	   Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said Tuesday that some
embassies also would have to be relocated to guard against
terrorist attacks. The embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which
sustained massive damages in bombings last Friday, also will have
to be rebuilt.

Wall Street plunge no shock to depressed Asian markets

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo markets are on a weeklong losing streak. Hong
Kong is at a five-year low. In Singapore, stocks haven't been so
cheap in a decade _ and are still heading south.
	   The overnight plunge on Wall Street sank in slowly at Asia's
enfeebled stock exchanges Wednesday morning, further depressing
some markets and cementing fears that there's no end in sight for
the region's downward spiral.
	   At the Tokyo Stock Exchange, on its longest roll of losing days
in two years, the tailspin in New York Tuesday was only the latest
in a steady stream of dark market news.
	   With prices already low and many dealers away for ``O-bon,'' or
Festival for the Dead, summer holidays, the reaction was muted. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 28.02 points, or 0.18
percent, closing at 15,378.97 in its eighth straight day of losses.
	   ``It doesn't seem panicky ... just this sort of ongoing
depression,'' said Paul Migliorato, senior manager of institutional
sales at Jardine Fleming Securities. ``No one is near the window
ledges.''
	   Still, some were jittery after Tuesday's drop in New York. Just
a week after surrendering 299 points in its third worst point loss
ever, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 258 points before
recovering somewhat and finishing 112 points lower at 8,462.85.
	   At a large electronic billboard listing stock prices near Tokyo
Station, a handful of concerned investors crowded around during
lunch break to monitor the action.
	   ``I am worried and the atmosphere is grim,'' said Seiji Kon, 51.
``If the economy in the United States gets bad, Japan's economy
will get even worse.''
	   Though the New York drop was a jolt after years of a bull market
on Wall Street, it was nothing compared to the daily mayhem that
Asian markets have suffered since the region's economy nose-dived
last year.
	   In Hong Kong, the mood is dark. The market's benchmark Hang Seng
Index is down a crushing 21 percent in the past three weeks,
including a 3.6 percent decline Tuesday to a five-year low of
6,779.95 points.
	   The reaction in Hong Kong to Wall Street on Wednesday was
subdued, however, with no sense of urgency. The Hang Seng finished
its morning session up slightly on mostly technical buying.
	   But the quiet ``doesn't necessarily mean that the worst is over,
or that investors should be rushing back into the market,'' said
James Osborn, sales director of ING Barings Securities.
	   Singapore reacted quickly to the turmoil. The Straits Times
Industrials Index benchmark opened below the 1,000-point level
Wednesday, at one point hitting a fresh 10-year low of 995.60.
	   Chia Yew Boon, head of research at Santander Investment
Securities Singapore, said the sell-off in New York and further
depression in Asia could set off a string of market reactions.
	   ``What happens in Asia spooks the U.S. market, which then goes
down, and that in turn spooks the Asian markets the following
day,'' he said, predicting another round of selling in New York.
	   Indeed, the downturn in the U.S. market is rooted in the
financial crisis in Asia and in particular the mounting problems in
Japan, where the world's second-largest economy is in deep
recession, its worst since World War II.
	   A Japanese recovery is seen as vital to ending an Asian fiscal
crisis, but that is growing increasingly remote. Japan's new
government is promising quick action, but opposition parties are
threatening to block key financial legislation.
	   The inaction is cause for worry in the region.
	   ``More needs to be done in Japan. The new Japanese government
does need to tackle some of the more deep-seated structural
problems of the Japanese economy,'' Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said in a radio interview Wednesday.
	   Howard spoke as the Australian share market fell hard in early
trading Wednesday, matching the fall in New York. The Australian
market rebounded later in the day.
	   Fears are building that Japan could be headed for a severe bout
of instability comparable to the collapses of several major
financial institutions last November.
	   The trouble has taken its toll on the yen, which hit an
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar Tuesday at 147.61 yen. The
currency rebounded somewhat on Wednesday to 145.96 yen to the
dollar.
	   A slump in the United States would come at a bad time for Asia,
robbing the region of its biggest market just when it's most
needed.
	   ``A plunge in the U.S. market muddies the waters for Japan and
Asia,'' said salesman Takayoshi Tobari in Tokyo, adding that
slumping exports ``would be really bad for Japan.''

Rebel commander says 60,000 fighters closing in on Kinshasa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RETRANSMITS to fix coding; new to some points, UPDATES with
more comments from rebel commander in grafs 13-14, rebel political
leader in last graf &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) - A Congolese rebel commander said his 60,000
troops were closing in on Kinshasa in a revolt to topple embattled
President Laurent Kabila.
	   ``Our strategy is that our friends are everywhere. It's a war
that concerns everyone,'' said commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane in
the eastern city of Goma on Tuesday. ``We don't want an atrocious
war. We want to end this soon.''
	   Meanwhile, Kabila's government boasted it was retaking territory
lost earlier to the rebels and had deployed new forces to the east
and west of the capital, Kinshasa.
	   The rebellion erupted last week when Congo announced it was
expelling Rwandan officers and soldiers who had trained and managed
Kabila's new army. The Rwandans had also helped Kabila overthrow
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year.
	   The expulsion of the Rwandans spurred ethnic Tutsis, who also
joined Kabila in a fragile alliance against Mobutu, to revolt
against their former ally in Congo. Kabila has accused Rwanda and
Uganda of supplying tanks and troops to the Tutsi rebels, an
accusation both countries have denied.
	   Kabila's relations with the two neighbors have been gradually
deteriorating, particularly because of his failure to control
Congo's vast eastern border region.
	   Rwanda has been frustrated by Kabila's failure to stop
cross-border Hutu rebel attacks on its territory.
	   On Tuesday, Ondekane said rebel troops had cut an oil pipeline
in western Congo that supplies the capital, Kinshasa. He also said
troops had reached the outskirts of the major Congo River port of
Matadi, 278 kilometers (173 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   The reported advances came amid government claims that its
forces had made inroads in both the far west and east.
	   Officials said government troops had retaken the city of Bukavu,
south of Goma, and its airport while other loyalists were fighting
for the western town of Boma, officials in Kinshasa said.
	   Ondekane denied Bukavu had been retaken by government forces.
	   He said rebel aircraft were supporting forces on the ground at
Kitona airbase just outside the Atlantic seaside town of Muanda and
in the north central town of Kisangani, 830 kilometers (520 miles)
northeast of Kinshasa on the Congo River.
	   ``I've taken in soldiers who had not been paid for eight months.
I clothed them, I armed them, and they are heading toward
Kinshasa,'' Ondekane said without elaborating.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain independent
confirmation of the claims from either side.
	   Ondekane, who served under Mobutu until he was toppled by
Kabila's rebels in May 1997, said most of the mutinous soldiers
were from his 16,130-strong 10th Congolese brigade.
	   On top of that, he commanded another 15,000 troops of the 222nd
brigade from Bukavu who have also pledged loyalty to the new
leaders. The rest of the rebel force is made up of the Mai-Mai
fighters, members of Congo's eastern tribes who apparently felt let
down by Kabila.
	   In contrast to November 1996, when fighting for Goma between
Mobutu's forces and the rebels was heavy and looting widespread,
shops in the sprawling town Tuesday were well-stocked and banks
open.
	   Life under the new military administration appeared to be near
normal. Residents said no shots had been fired and the change of
power had been peaceful.
	   Ondekane said the rebels represent a cross-section of Congo's
estimated 47 million people, including ethnic groups in Equatoria,
Katanga and Kasai regions.
	   In their villa-turned-army headquarters on the shore of Lake
Kivu, rebel commanders identified themselves as former officers in
the Congolese military who were fed up with Kabila's misuse of
power, corruption and mismanagement.
	   ``This is not a foreign revolution, this is a Congolese
affair,'' said Deo Balezi, a Goma activist of the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo. ``We are fighting
against Kabila's nepotism, corruption, tribalism and
dictatorship.''
	   Using the same name as the movement that toppled Mobutu, Balezi
said Kabila had changed nothing, and instead of providing
leadership he had made the same mistakes as Mobutu.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An Australian man was among 14
foreigners arrested in Tanzania in connection with the U.S. Embassy
bombing in Dar es Salaam, Australian officials said Wednesday.
	   The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed that a
46-year-old Somali-born Australian, whose passport was issued in
Sydney, had been detained by Tanzanian authorities, a spokesman
said.
	   ``An Australian who (was) just getting ready to begin an
assignment in Tanzania with the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees has been picked up in a widespread sweep of foreigners by
Tanzanian authorities in the aftermath of the bombing,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``They've been checking identities and papers and he was caught
up in that.''
	   An officer of Australia's high commission in Nairobi was
traveling to Dar es Salaam to seek access to the man and ``to
clarify the circumstances in which he was detained,'' the spokesman
said.
	   The man's name has not been released, but he had just arrived in
Tanzania with his wife and five children when he was arrested, the
spokesman said.
	   The Tanzanian embassy bombing killed 10 people and injured 70,
while a simultaneous bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya killed at
least 224 people and injured 5,000.

Hanson must repudiate racist letter written under her party's
</HEADLINE>
banner, government says &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Right-wing legislator Pauline Hanson
should immediately repudiate views contained in a letter to a
Bangkok newspaper by a claimed member of her party that are racist
and damaging to Australia, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said
Wednesday.
	   The letter, printed in the Bangkok Post last Friday, was signed
``a Hanson man,'' who claimed to be a member of Hanson's populist
One Nation party.
	   The letter seeks to explain One Nation's ``anti-immigration''
policies to all Asian countries, saying most Asians originate from
lower socio-economic classes and do not fit into Australian
society, creating suburbs that are ``typically dirty (and)
flourishing in crime.''
	   It complains about ``excessive'' numbers of Japanese and Korean
tourists to Australia, accuses Asian athletes of being either drug
cheats or ``insignificant in their abilities,'' and blames a gloomy
economic outlook on Australia's trade links with Asia.
	   ``To put it bluntly, we do not want your trade, money, and,
certainly, not your people,'' the letter says.
	   Downer called a news conference Wednesday to repudiate the
letter, which he condemned as disgraceful, ``very racist'' and
damaging to Australia's image.
	   ``Mrs. Hanson has got to get out and immediately repudiate these
sorts of views,'' Downer said. ``(She) and her cabal ... have got
to dissociate themselves from this appalling and abusive letter
sent by somebody who describes himself as a member of the One
Nation party.''
	   Downer said he had written to the Bangkok Post repudiating the
One Nation letter and called for his letter to be published.
	   Hanson claims Australia is in danger of being ``swamped'' by
Asians. Her party's policy would drastically cut the number of
immigrants to Australia. She also advocates protectionist
economics, and an end to special welfare benefits for Australia's
Aborigines.
	   Hanson denies she is a racist.
	   One Nation won more than 23 percent of the vote in Queensland
state elections in June, giving it 11 seats in that state's
parliament. The party scores double figures in national public
opinion polls.
	   Hanson is the only One Nation member in the national parliament,
which earlier this year voted overwhelmingly in favor of a motion
abhorring all forms of racism.
	   One Nation is regarded as a major threat to the junior partner
in Howard's ruling coalition at the looming national elections,
expected this year.
	   David Ettridge, One Nation's national director, said the party
would not be writing to the Bangkok Post to repudiate the views in
the letter, as there was no proof it had been written by a party
member.
	   ``It could just as easily be a member of (Downer and Prime
Minister John Howard's) Liberal Party,'' Ettridge said in a
television interview.
	   He said the party did not condone the views expressed in the
letter. ``They are not our views,'' he said.

Iraq will stick to stand despite Annan's appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday the lifting of
sanctions is the only way to defuse its current dispute with the
United Nations over weapons inspections.
	   The statement came in the influential newspaper Babil run by
President Saddam Hussein's son Odai, which is often used to express
the government's views.
	   It was the first Iraqi response to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's dispatch of a special envoy to Baghdad with a message
asking Iraqi leaders to cooperate in a comprehensive review of
weapons inspections and sanctions.
	   The front-page editorial in Babil said Iraq appreciates Annan's
goodwill in seeking a solution. But the paper added that Iraq
``also hopes that he will understand that the situation no longer
bears more partial compromises and settlements.''
	   Babil said Baghdad would welcome special envoy Prakash Shah but
that he will find ``on both public and official levels a
determination by Iraq to obtain all its legitimate rights, firstly
the immediate implementation of paragraph 22 of (U.N.) resolution
687.''
	   The paragraph calls for the lifting of trade sanctions on Iraq
once it completes the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Iraq has been under sanctions which bar air travel and most
sales of oil, its economic mainstay, since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that the sanctions will not
be lifted until inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction, as called for in U.N. resolutions.
	   Babil said Iraq will also insist ``on the closure of the various
weapons files related to disarmament. This the least Iraq can
accept before embarking on a new agreement or settlement.''
	   Annan proposed the review of weapons inspections on Monday after
Iraq last week declared it would no longer cooperate with U.N.
inspectors investigating potential arms caches in the country.
	   He urged the government to show ``common sense'' and renew
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors disarming it under the
1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms. He promised in return that the
United Nations would treat Iraqis with fairness.
	   Shah is scheduled to arrive in Iraq Thursday.

UBS drops planned private banking joint venture with Japanese bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ The United Bank of Switzerland said
Wednesday it won't realize its planned joint venture in the private
banking sector with troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   ``We've started private banking operations within our own UBS
structures in Japan on July 1,'' said UBS spokesman Jens Woehler.
``UBS has been active in Japan for over 30 years, we've got the
necessary infrastructure and know our customers and services there
well.''
	   UBS said Monday its investment bank and asset management joint
ventures with LTCB would be continued as planned for the time
being. But it said the names of the ventures would be changed,
deleting references to LTCB.
	   The investment bank joint venture with LTCB will be called
Warburg Dillon Read, instead of LTCB Warburg. Likewise, the asset
management joint venture was renamed UBS Brinson Asset Management,
instead of LTCB UBS Brinson.
	   ``Even in the private banking sector, our cooperation with LTCB
remains a very close one, as LTCB employees work in this field on
UBS' behalf,'' Woehler noted.
	   LTCB was reported in June to be on the verge of collapse after
Moody's Investors Services downgraded its debt and its shares
became almost worthless overnight.
	   LTCB later announced it was in talks to merge with Sumitomo
Trust Bank _ a move widely assumed to have been coordinated as a
virtual bailout for LTCB. LTCB officials have said, however, their
bank is in no danger of failing.
	   Woehler said UBS was closely watching the merger talks. ``Until
we know what the outcome of these negotiations will be, it's too
early to say anything,'' Woehler concluded.

Japanese stocks down slightly, dollar drops in Tokyo

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks declined for the eighth consecutive
session Wednesday as investors worried about Wall Street's woes and
possible delays in efforts to shore up Japan's shaky banking
system. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 28.02 points,
or 0.18 percent, closing at 15,378.97. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had
sunk 219.43 points, or 1.40 percent.
	   Investors remain worried about dim prospects for a rapid
economic recovery and the threat posed by invigorated opposition
parties to the government's proposed rescue package for the
financial system, traders said.
	   ``The market can't find any bullish factors that would prompt
buying, except a reversal of the excessively weak yen seen earlier
today,'' said Takeshi Kubota, a general manager at Meiko Securities
Co.
	   A 1.3 percent slide overnight by the Dow Jones industrial
average, which ended down 112.00 points at 8,462.85, also
contributed to the decline on the Tokyo Stock Exchange Wednesday.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section declined 6.88 points, or 0.58 percent, closing at
1,180.00. It had fallen 20.21 points, or 1.67 percent, the previous
day.
	   An estimated 426 million shares changed hands on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, down from 460 million Tuesday.
Declines exceeded advances 723 to 380, with 169 issues closing
unchanged.
	   Sakura Bank Ltd. stock fell 2.83 percent to 275 yen (dlrs 1.88)
after Mita Industrial Co., a big borrower that effectively went
bankrupt earlier this week, was found to have routinely falsified
its earnings reports.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar bought 145.92 yen in late trading, down
1.49 yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New
York rate of 147.35 yen. It ranged between 145.40 yen and 147.43
yen in Wednesday's trading.
	   The dollar, which had soared to an eight-year high of 147.61 yen
Tuesday, was brought down by profit-taking triggered by nervousness
over the possibility that the central bank might intervene to
support the yen.
	   ``There is strong caution against possible intervention'' by
monetary authorities, said Takuma Kurosawa, chief foreign exchange
manager at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking.
	   The Finance Ministry's vice minister for international affairs,
Eisuke Sakakibara, suggested Japan was prepared to bolster the
sagging yen.
	   ``If it is necessary, we will intervene,'' Sakakibara told Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   Still, some players discounted the likelihood of large-scale yen
purchases by the Bank of Japan.
	   Despite the yen's modest recovery Wednesday, traders said the
currency remains vulnerable to selling pressure amid continued
instability in Asian markets.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 1.185 percent from Tuesday's 1.180 percent, driving
its price down to 111.87 yen from 111.92 yen.

Myanmar pro-democracy leader on road in new challenge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with officials confirming new standoff, 2nd graf, no
tolerance for inciting unrest, 9th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Defying Myanmar's military regime,
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi left her home Wednesday to
meet members of her political party outside the capital, even
though she has been stopped in previous attempts to do so.
	   Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, was headed
for Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, when she
was stopped at the same roadblock where she had been held up for
six days last month, government and party sources confirmed.
	   Authorities ended the previous standoff, 32 kilometers (19
miles) west of the capital, on July 29 when they seized her car,
forcibly restrained her and drove it back to her home against her
will. She spent several days recovering from a high fever and
dehydration.
	   She had taken food and water with her, but supplies eventually
ran out. Authorities refused to let her buy fresh supplies and
prevented her party members and doctors from giving her food and
water, party members have said.
	   On Wednesday, Suu Kyi was again accompanied by Hla Pe, a
75-year-old member of her party's central executive committee, as
well as one or two drivers.
	   In apparent preparation for another standoff, she was traveling
in a friend's van instead of the sedan she had used on previous
trips. The van would allow more comfort for an extended stay and be
able to carry more food and water.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is largely
confined to her home and has little political maneuvering room. But
she has recently stepped up challenges to the government.
	   The foray Wednesday was her fourth attempt in two months to
drive outside Yangon. More importantly, she has given the military
an Aug. 21 deadline to seat the parliament elected in a 1990
general election.
	   Official newspapers said earlier Wednesday that Suu Kyi's
attempts to ``create instability and to incite the people'' would
``not be tolerated.''
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar, also known as Burma,
since 1962, allowed the election to go forward but refused to honor
the result when Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory.
	   The military has allowed Suu Kyi to travel outside Yangon only
once since releasing her from six years of formal house arrest in
July 1995, to visit a Buddhist monk.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's lakeside compound, refusing journalists
entry and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Government security personnel installed inside her compound were
withdrawn Friday on her demand. The government has added security
checkpoints on nearby roads and has searched cars leaving her home.
	   The party complained that the new measures amounted to a form of
house arrest. The government responded Tuesday that Suu Kyi had
received 300 visitors in a few days and noted that ``she will
always be provided with all necessary security and protection.
	   ``There is no government restriction on her movement as long as
security conditions permit,'' the government said in a statement.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after Suu Kyi's
last standoff that the United States would hold the government
directly responsible for her welfare.
	   On Saturday, Myanmar marked the 10th anniversary of a nationwide
uprising against military rule. It was eventually crushed by
troops. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   Myanmar's own people were calm on the anniversary. A day later,
however, 18 foreign democracy activists were arrested after handing
out leaflets urging people to remember the uprising. They were
still being held Wednesday.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains flooded streams and
triggered landslides in central South Korea Wednesday, killing at
least five people and forcing thousands of farmers to flee their
homes.
	   The downpour submerged 5,000 homes in Poun, Sangju and three
other counties, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Seoul,
the Home Ministry said.
	   At least 18,000 people, mostly farmers, were evacuated to higher
ground. Thousands more were being urged to abandon their homes
along the Nakdong River, which rose dangerously high, the ministry
said.
	   With dams discharging water from swollen reservoirs and weather
forecasters expecting more rain, a flood warning was issued along
the other major rivers cutting through central South Korea.
	   Up to 38 centimeters (15 inches) of rain fell in central South
Korea Wednesday. Roads were washed away and telephone poles downed,
cutting off small villages, police said.
	   Kim So-rae, 85, was killed when flood water engulfed her home
early Wednesday. A 67-year-old woman was found dead after her home
collapsed under a landslide.
	   At least three other people were killed in landslides or
floodwaters in nearby towns, police said. Six were reported
missing.
	   Floods and landslides in the Seoul metropolitan area and central
South Korea have killed 186 people, including 13 South Korean and
U.S. soldiers, and left 48 missing since last week. A week earlier,
flash floods raging down mountain valleys at the southern tip of
the Korean Peninsula killed 67 campers and left 29 missing.
	   More than 136,000 people have been driven from their homes by
the on-again, off-again rains, and property damage is estimated at
up to dlrs 2 billion.

Tajikistan appeals for help as turmoil from Afghanistan approaches
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Tajik government said the fighting in
neighboring Afghanistan was approaching its border, and appealed to
the warring sides and to the United Nations to act urgently to stop
the conflict, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The Tajik government also appealed to Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and other leaders of former Soviet republics to help
strengthen the southern borders of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   A government statement said that the turmoil in Afghanistan has
in some areas reached the Tajik border, and Tajikistan's security
is under ``direct threat,'' Interfax reported.
	   Afghanistan's fundamentalist Taliban forces have been advancing
in the country's north and recently captured the opposition
stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   However, the Taliban have said they are only seeking to take
full control of Afghanistan and have no designs on their neighbors.
Still, a Taliban takeover of northern Afghanistan could send
refugees and weapons streaming into the former Soviet republics of
Central Asia.
	   Afghanistan borders three former Soviet republics: Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.
	   Earlier this week, Russia said it was ready to fortify the
borders of the former Soviet republics, and to send additional
border troops to Tajikistan in the situation gets worse.
	   Russia has 25,000 Russian troops in Tajikistan, which are
already helping government forces fortify the border, and similar
steps are expected in the two other republics.

NATO allies finetune military options for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: lead expected around 1300GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies met Wednesday to
finetune options for military action designed to get Serb forces to
halt their crackdown against secessionists in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   The ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations debated plans that
essentially involve three options: a preventive deployment of
troops along the borders of Kosovo in neighboring Albania and
Macedonia; a graduated air campaign against targets in Yugoslavia;
and a deployment of peacekeeping troops into Yugoslavia.
	   These plans have been taking shape very slowly in the past two
months because of the immense political implications of the NATO
alliance intervening in a Balkan conflict and an internal Yugoslav
dispute, at that.
	   An American official said the NATO envoys were considering in
detail the issue of limited air options, not just in Kosovo but
across the Yugoslav Republic.
	   Allied planes would avoid civilian targets and focus on
``offensive'' Serb military targets.
	   The United States and Britain have been at odds over how fast
the allies should deploy planes if and when they agree to use air
power to the fighting in Kosovo between Serb forces and the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia. The United Nations has estimated the fighting has made
some 240,000 people into refugees.
	   Complicating the search for a diplomatic solution is the fact
that Kosovo Albanians are divided between those loyal to pacifist
ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova, and those who support the
militants.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   In recent months, the NATO allies have been hesitating over a
military intervention.
	   In mid-June, an allied military intervention seemed an imminent
possibility as warplanes from 13 of the 16 NATO nations roared over
Albania and Macedonia in four hours of heavy-duty sabre-rattling.
	   And despite an intensification of diplomatic efforts have been
stepped up, though they don't appear any nearer to a solution than
last month.

Refugees still on run as Kosovo fighting flares up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of ethnic Albanians remain
on the run in Kosovo, international aid officials warned Wednesday,
as Serb forces battled with rebels for control of a region near the
Albanian border.
	   Europe's worst refugee crisis since the Bosnian war showed no
signs of easing.
	   Tens of thousands of people in Kosovo have been displaced in the
past two weeks alone, Amanda Williamson, spokeswoman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said in Geneva.
	   She said thousands of people in Kosovo may still be living in
the woods or hills after being forced from their homes by recent
clashes.
	   The ICRC has delivered more than 100 tons of aid to various
places in the last few days, but Williams warned that international
aid might not be enough.
	   ``We have a big crisis on our hands,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, Serb sources in Kosovo reported that heavy fighting
in the Decani area, close to the border with Albania, continued
overnight. The most intense clashes were said to be around the
village of Glodjane, a Kosovo Liberation Army stronghold.
	   Serbia's independent B-92 radio reported that several thousand
KLA fighters were putting up strong resistance to police attacks on
the village. The radio said there are fears of many dead and
wounded.
	   There were no immediate reports from the Albanian side
Wednesday.On Tuesday, Albanian sources reported that the Yugoslav
army was sending reinforcements to the area.
	   Despite the latest fighting, there were signs that the rebel
army, which is fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia and
Yugoslavia, was willing to enter negotiations with the government.
	   Veton Surroi, a top Albanian politician, said ethnic Albanians
would form a coalition government in the next few days and the KLA
will be represented in it. Signs of rebel willingness to negotiate
have followed a string of losses to the Serb forces in the past
several weeks.
	   Williamson said that over the weekend, a Red Cross team
evacuated to Kosovska Mitrovica some 55 Albanians sheltering on a
dried-up river bed in woods in the north of the central Drenica
area. They included ill women, children and elderly people.
	   She said the ICRC believes there could be thousands more in the
same sort of predicament in the area, while tens of thousands have
left their homes either for neighboring towns or villages or up
into the mountains.
	   The latest figures from the U.N. refugee agency published
Tuesday put the total figure of those displaced by the fighting at
around 240,000.
	   World leaders are still deliberating on what to do to halt the
fighting if they can't bring the warring sides to a negotiating
table soon. In Brussels on Wednesday, NATO allies were fine-tuning
options for military action aimed at getting Serb forces to halt
their offensive against secessionists in the southern Serbian
province, populated mostly by ethnic Albanians.
	   At the United Nations on Tuesday, the Security Council
reiterated calls for a cease-fire. Three members _ Britain, France
and Slovenia _ pushed for action against Yugoslavia, and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the Yugoslavs'
``scorched-earth policy.''
	   But the council's statement broke no new ground, although it did
single out Slobodan Milosevic's regime as using ``excessive
force.''
	   In a report to the council, Annan said international agencies
had failed to make good on promises to monitor an arms embargo on
Kosovo.

Scandal renews debate: Are French wineries over-regulated?
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ When the scandal broke, it seemed to
shake the very foundations of the ornate Bordeaux chateaus nestled
in the world's richest vineyards.
	   Did or didn't the Chateau Giscours use water, lactic and tartric
acid, and wood chips to fix its 1995 vintage? Did it mix grades of
wine?
	   All are cardinal sins here.
	   The Bordeaux wine association, worried the media attention would
hurt the reputation of all Bordeaux wines, quickly announced that
it wanted authorities to get to the bottom of the allegations.
	   That was in the spring, and the probe continues. But dealers say
prices and sales remain strong, and Giscours seems to have
weathered the scandal that some say stemmed from provincial
jealousy and sabotage.
	   Whatever the scandal's origin, the allegations renewed talk of
whether the French wine industry's strict rules are putting
vintners at a disadvantage in the multibillion-dollar world market.
	   Industry officials say the rules should be maintained for
premium wines, but could be loosened for table wines. After all,
some of what Giscours allegedly did _ like adding wood chips _
would be perfectly legal in California.
	   ``It's relaunched a debate,'' said Georges Dutruc-Rousset, head
of the Paris-based International Office of Vines and Wine,
representing 45 countries.
	   Practices such as adding wood chips or tartric and lactic acid
will have to be looked at, he said. ``The more you have corrective
practices, the more you'll have wine at a lower price.''
	   But where to draw the line?
	   At the Interprofessional Council of Bordeaux Wine _ the trade
association _ President Philippe Casteja defends the rules on
premium wines.
	   ``It gives the consumer a well-defined product,'' he said. ``The
rules can be changed,'' he said, but ``do we not want regional
authenticity and taste? It's not the same thing if you add
raspberry syrup.''
	   In the meantime, France is losing out in non-premium wines to
lower-priced competitors in Australia, South Africa, Chile, and the
United States. Wine consumption is falling in the 15-nation
European Union, the world's biggest producer, adding further
pressure to export.
	   In July, EU agriculture ministers began to revamp wine
regulations, a process expected to take about a year.
	   Other French producers have been accused of cutting corners.
	   France's General Directorate for Consumption and Repression of
Fraud reports that out of 7,000 spot checks last year, they found
731 infractions ranging from production to labeling problems.
	   Chateau Giscours says independent analyses show it didn't add
ingredients. Investigators refuse to comment.
	   The chateau says former employees probably mixed grades of 1995
wine, reinforcing a lower-grade Sirene with higher-grade Haut-Medoc
grapes. Giscours offered to buy back all the bottles still on sale
from the 4,000 gallons in question.
	   A Giscours spokesman said the scandal broke while the new owner,
billionaire Dutch businessman Eric Albada Jelgersma, was investing
millions of dollars to boost his flagging winery.
	   ``We never worked so hard,'' spokesman Theodore Mostermans said
in a rich, oak-paneled room at the Giscours office, where he's
spent weeks fielding calls from quizzical buyers from around the
world. ``We had the impression of being sabotaged.''
	   It's anyone's guess who tipped off inspectors and prompted the
probe.
	   Among the possibilities, say insiders: fired employees or
jealous competitors.
	   ``Some say it's sabotage and blackmail,'' Casteja said. ``For
the moment, there's no proof.''

Fewer Germans expect change in Bonn after election
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The likelihood of a grand coalition
between the Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and the
opposition Social Democrats is growing as the opposition's lead in
polls diminishes, pollsters said Tuesday.
	   Fewer German voters expect that Sept. 27 elections will bring a
change of government, according to the latest polls, a position
supported by a drop in support for Social Democratic candidate
Gerhard Schroeder.
	   In July, the number of German voters who expect the Social
Democrats to win the election sunk to less than half, 46 percent,
from nearly two-thirds in June, according to the Allensbach
Institute published in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. The poll
has a margin of error of 2.5 percent.
	   The poll also showed the Social Democrats' candidate Gerhard
Schroeder's popularity has slipped from 33 percent a month ago to
38 percent.
	   With the opposition's lead slipping, a grand coalition is
becoming more likely, elections watchers said. However, they said
the evening out is not unexpected as the election nears.
	   They cited the vacation effect: ``While abroad, people could
draw comparisons with other countries, and often they come to the
position that things are not so bad at home,'' said Dieter Roth, an
election researcher told the Stuttgarter Nachtrichten daily.
	   ``Schroeder was in a dream starting position,'' Roth said.
Though his numbers are dropping, the Social Democratic candidate
``still has a very good lead'' over Kohl.

Airport authorities confiscate 721 bottles of banned Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian customs officials confiscated
bottles of the impotence drug Viagra worth about 1 million Egyptian
pounds (dlrs 294,000) from an Egyptian-American, airport officials
said Wednesday.
	   The officials, who did not identify the man, said he was trying
to smuggle 721 bottles of Viagra, which is banned in Egypt, and 391
bottles of other drugs. They added that he arrived in Egypt on
Tuesday from Turkey.
	   The man, a pharmacist, claimed he did know Viagra was banned in
Egypt, said the officials who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity. They said a report was being prepared for the Health
Ministry to determine what should be done with the man.
	   Egypt imposed a ban on Viagra in May, saying it wanted to
conduct its own tests on the drug despite its approved use in the
United States where it is manufactured.
	   Health inspectors and police have been raiding pharmacies and
confiscating the drug, which continues to appear and is sold on the
streets and in clinics for about 60 pounds (dlrs 17.50) per pill.
The drug costs dlrs 10 per pill in the United States.

Hong Kong shares end slightly higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong share prices gained Wednesday as
investors took encouragement from easing interest rates and Japan's
reassurance about the stability of its currency.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index climbed 79.53 points, or 1.2
percent, closing at 6,859.48. It had plunged 3.6 percent Tuesday,
closing at a five-year low of 6,779.95 points, largely because of
panic about the sharp fall of the Japanese yen.
	   Turnover Wednesday reached 5.55 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 711.5 million), up from Tuesday's 5.02 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 643.59 million).
	   Lower interbank interest rates drove up the market, said Alyssa
Ng, an analyst at Pacific Challenge Securities Ltd.
	   Hong Kong interbank rates eased following confirmation that the
Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the territory's quasi-central bank,
sold U.S. dollars to buy Hong Kong dollars.
	   The volatile overnight Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate was
quoted at 7 percent, down from 8 percent late Tuesday. The
benchmark three-month rate was at 11.5 percent, down from 12.25
percent previously.
	   Donald Tsang, the territory's financial secretary, also
reiterated that officials would stand by the Hong Kong dollar's
longstanding link with the U.S. dollar.
	   ``We are confident in maintaining the currency peg,'' he told
reporters. ``We have the skill and the strategy to handle'' any
speculative attacks.
	   Analysts said the firmer yen also pulled up stock prices in Hong
Kong.
	   The yen strengthened to 145.92 to the U.S. dollar in late
trading in Asia, compared to 147.42 earlier, following comments by
Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister for international affairs,
that Japan will intervene in the markets to prop up the yen if
necessary.
	   Among gainers were British banking giant HSBC Holding, up 2.00
Hong Kong dollars to 157.00; conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa, up
0.10 to 33.00, and Hong Kong and China Gas, up 0.60 to 8.45.
	   But most property shares continued to slide, with Cheung Kong
Holdings shedding 0.50 to 29.90, Sun Hung Kai Properties falling
0.40 to 22.50, and Henderson Land losing 0.20 to 20.55.

Stephens wants harsher drugs penalties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Veteran Australian road cyclist Neil
Stephens wants harsher penalties for drug use in his sport, but
fears the Tour de France scandals will fail to galvanize sufficient
action.
	   Stephens spent a night in police custody and was strip-searched
after he and the other nine members of the French-Spanish Festina
team were thrown out of the Tour.
	   Their expulsion, and the police questioning over allegations
against team management of drugs smuggling, were the start of a
string of drug scandals that broke during the Tour.
	   The riders threatened to quit in the last week of the three-week
race and Stephens said it was time to radically change the sport's
attack on the drugs problem.
	   ``A lot of things have come to light _ it's a very good
opportunity for the powers that be, such as the UCI (cycling's
world body) and the cycling associations to get in and really
analyze what has been going on,'' Stephens said Wednesday from his
home in Spain.
	   ``It seems at the moment that the disciplinary action being
taken is only a token gesture. Hopefully, if you could get the
drugs companies involved, they could put a marker on the molecules
of the illegal drugs, so they'd be very easy to detect in a test.
	   ``Another idea is to really punish the teams themselves _ if one
guy goes over the limit for a blood health test, ban the full team
for the two weeks rather than just the rider. That would be pretty
drastic.''
	   The police who interrogated Stephens said they had documented
proof he had been given synthetic EPO, which helps increase a
rider's red blood cell count.
	   Stephens, a long-time advocate of drug-free cycling, insists he
never took a banned substance knowingly.
	   ``Certainly, from now on, I'm going to want to know a lot more
about what I'm being given,'' he said.
	   Stephens has not raced since his expulsion from the Tour and
used the break as a chance to have a lump removed from his shin. It
was found to be benign and he is back training.
	   He was picked Tuesday for next month's Commonwealth Games in
Kuala Lumpur after he convinced Festina management to let him go
for a few days so he could travel to Malaysia.
	   Stephens, 34, is still undecided whether this will be his last
year as a pro rider, but said his mood had been boosted enormously
since the Tour drugs scandal.
	   ``As time goes by, I'm a lot more positive about the sport _
some of the support I've received from people here (in Spain) and
from Australia has been unbelievable,'' he said. (djp)

Myanmar says foreign detainees not cooperating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The detention of 18 foreign democracy
activists is being prolonged because they have failed to cooperate
with authorities, the military regime said Wednesday.
	   The 18 were apprehended in downtown Yangon and at the airport
Sunday after distributing leaflets urging people to remember a
failed 1988 uprising against military rule and not to give up hope.
	   The government has accused the six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippine citizens and an
Australian of breaking the law and trying to incite unrest.
	   The government so far has not decided whether they will be
charged with any crime or tried. Deportation still remains an
option, officials said.
	   A government spokesman, in a faxed statement to The Associated
Press in Bangkok, Thailand, said he believed some of the detainees
were still being questioned, four days after their arrest.
	   ``Because of their lack of cooperation, the process has been
unnecessarily prolonged,'' said the spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   Myanmar state television Tuesday showed still photos of two
groups of detainees, smiling as they enjoyed a meal. One group was
identified as Thais, and the people in the other were unidentified.
	   The news reader said they were being ``treated well on
humanitarian grounds.''
	   Visits to the detainees were allowed Tuesday by diplomats of
their embassies. U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said
in Washington that all six Americans were in good health.
	   ``They had no complaint about their treatment and appeared to
have been treated humanely,'' Foley said.
	   In Manila, Philippine President Joseph Estrada urged Myanmar to
free the two Filipinos and ensure their safety.
	   U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, who chairs the House International
Operations and Human Rights subcommittee, said he planned to fly to
Southeast Asia Wednesday to seek the release of the detainees.
	   Smith is the congressman for the New Jersey district home to one
of the detainees, 19-year-old Michele Keegan.
	   Smith spoke to Myanmar's ambassador in Washington and said he
expects to speak to the detainees, government officials and
opposition leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The Myanmar government spokesman hinted Wednesday that Smith
might not be granted a visa.
	   It was ``quite unfortunate'' that Myanmar had suspended issuing
visas to U.S. officials after Washington barred members of
Myanmar's government from visiting the United States, the spokesman
said.
	   ``The congressman has been assured that the Myanmar government
will exercise utmost restraint in dealing with the misguided
individuals,'' the spokesman said.
	   The U.S. ban was proclaimed by President Bill Clinton to
sanction Myanmar for increasing pressure on the pro-democracy
movement led by Suu Kyi.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan told the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Thailand on Tuesday that he would push for
the release of the detainees through the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.
	   ``We will try our best to protect our nationals as much as we
can,'' Surin said. ``But we will stop at the border and let the
Myanmar authorities do their job first.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Riot police surrounded the Pakistani Embassy
in Tehran on Wednesday after scores of angry protesters tried to
force their way into the compound to demand the release of Iranians
allegedly captured in Afghanistan.
	   Iran claims that 11 of its diplomats, a correspondent of the
state-run Islamic Republic News Agency, and 32 Iranian truck
drivers were captured by the hard-line Taliban militia in northern
Afghanistan.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because Islamabad is widely believed to back the group that
blazed into the opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif on
Saturday.
	   Police in full riot gear arrived at the embassy in Tehran after
scuffles erupted between the Pakistani guards and protesters trying
to force their way in.
	   A glass door at the embassy entrance was smashed when an IRNA
reporter who forced his way in to speak to the ambassador was
pushed into it.
	   ``I was demanding to talk to the ambassador when the embassy
guards pulled me in. They beat me and pushed me into the glass
door,'' said the reporter, Abolfazl Shakeri. His clothes were torn,
but he was not injured.
	   The protesters, who numbered about 150, included families of the
Iranian drivers and IRNA employees.
	   They dispersed soon after the police surrounded the four-story
white marble building in a residential neighborhood near the city
center.
	   On Tuesday, the Pakistani Embassy issued a statement saying it
could not be responsible for events in northern Afghanistan but had
used all possible influence to ensure the safety of any Iranians.
	   The Taliban, who now control virtually all of Afghanistan, say
they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats, but claim to be
holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the Taliban's enemies.
	   Iran is widely believed to have supplied arms to the
anti-Taliban alliance in Afghanistan. Newspaper reports have quoted
Iranians officials as saying the captured truck drivers worked for
an international company transporting food to Mazar-e-Sharif. The
reports did not name the company.

Taliban claims another victory in north
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan-Aid Agencies, Iran-Pakistan-Afghanistan &QL; 
 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban claimed another in a
string of victories in the north Wednesday, advancing toward their
goal of putting all of Afghanistan under their rigid version of
Islamic law.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said Pul-e-Kumri, about 175
kilometers (100 miles) north of Kabul, fell with little resistance
and the opposition retreated south toward the central province of
Bamiyan, one of its last remaining strongholds. He had few details,
and his claim could not be independently confirmed.
	   Anti-Taliban coalition member Syed Jaffer Naderi had his
headquarters at Pul-e-Kumri. If Muttayn's report is confirmed, it
would be the fourth strategic town or city to fall to the Taliban
in the last week and a half. A major prize came Saturday, when
Taliban troops captured Mazar-e-Sharif, the biggest city in the
north.
	   Muttayn said Taliban troops were continuing their march north
after taking Pul-e-Kumri.
	   Rejecting calls for peace talks, the Taliban Foreign Ministry
vowed last week to pursue a military solution to Afghanistan's
civil war and establish ``100 percent Islamic law.''
	   The Taliban, whose name means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in
southern Afghanistan in 1994 and surprised many with the speed at
which they have captured most of the country, including the
capital, Kabul. Under their strict interpretation of Islamic law,
girls are barred from school, most women are confined to their
homes, and music, movies and television are banned.
	   The Taliban have pledged to bring peace to a country that has
been in conflict since a series of military and communist coups in
the 1960s.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Taliban advances
posed ``a real threat'' to the coalition of former Soviet
republics, the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia is ready
to fortify the southern borders of former Soviet republics in
Central Asia to guard against any spillover of the turmoil in
Afghanistan, the ministry said.
	   Afghanistan borders three former Soviet republics: Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Tajik officials have said that in some
areas the Taliban have advanced to within 20 to 40 kilometers (12
to 25 miles) of the Tajik border.
	   Russia fears the entrenchment of a radical Islamic state in
Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and weapons into the
former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
	   Meanwhile, Afghanistan's ambassador to Moscow, Abdul Waha
Assefi, who represents the anti-Taliban alliance, said Afghanistan
was ``virtually occupied by Pakistan.'' He called for international
pressure on Pakistan to stop helping the Taliban.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the
fundamentalist movement, but both Pakistan and the Taliban have
denied such accusations. The Taliban have also said their campaign
is no threat to neighboring countries.
	   On Wednesday, Iranian police surrounded the Pakistani Embassy in
Tehran after scores of protesters tried to force their way into the
compound to demand the release of Iranians allegedly captured in
Afghanistan.
	   Iran, which is suspected of supporting the anti-Taliban
coalition, claims that 11 of its diplomats, a correspondent of the
state-run Islamic Republic News Agency and 32 Iranian drivers were
captured by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because of its alleged support for the Taliban.
	   Pakistan has said that it could not be responsible for events in
northern Afghanistan but that it had used all possible influence to
ensure the safety of any Iranians.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
although they claim to be holding some 30 Iranians suspected of
arming the Taliban's enemies.

	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ Six Air Force guards gently
loaded the flag-draped coffin of one American killed in the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi onto a military aircraft Wednesday
for the final leg of the journey home.
	   The body of Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds was

at the request of her family.
	   The remaining 10 bodies of American victims flown to Germany
this week will be accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to Andrews Air Base in Maryland following a military

	   Seven wounded Americans also were set to depart Ramstein Air
Base for Andrews on Wednesday.
	   Six will be taken to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington for treatment, and the seventh to the burn center at
Brooks Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.
	   Albright was scheduled to meet with the remaining wounded, one
American and 11 Kenyans, at the U.S. military hospital in nearby
Landstuhl immediately after arriving Wednesday afternoon.
	   A 12th Kenyan was being treated at the University Medical Center
in Homburg.

Spanish police arrest more than 600 would-be immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police in a Spanish enclave in North Africa
arrested more than 600 would-be immigrants, including 92 clinging
to truck axles or hiding among amusement park rides being shipped
to Europe, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Authorities made the arrests during a 10-day street carnival
that ended Monday night in the Ceuta enclave.
	   A total of 92 people were caught hiding inside or underneath
trucks that were to be being ferried across the Strait of Gibraltar
back to mainland Spain after the fair.
	   Some tried to conceal themselves among disassembled amusement
park rides like Ferris wheels and merry-go-rounds, said Roberto
Franca, an interior ministry spokesman in Ceuta.
	   Overall, police and Civil Guard officers arrested 642 people who
had entered the enclave illegally since the carnival began Aug. 1,
authorities said.
	   The fair is a yearly event that honors Ceuta's patron saint, the
Virgin of Africa. It draws crowds from neighboring Morocco, many of
whom just want to enjoy the carnival. But Spanish police say others
use the fair as a stepping stone to try to sneak across the strait
into Europe.
	   The Interior Ministry says that since January, Spanish police
have caught more than 7,000 would-be immigrants from North Africa.
	   Fleeing poverty at home, most make the hazardous crossing in
packed, makeshift single-motor boats. Each year many are believed
to drown.
	   Last Thursday, the Interior Minister reported 38 Moroccans
drowned a month ago just off the coast of another Spanish enclave
in North Africa, Melilla, raising the year's death toll to 69.

Russian markets rises a day after falling

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's stock exchange opened higher Wednesday
morning in light trading, but the rise was mostly seen as a
correction from a market tumble the day before, news reports said.
	   The Russian Trading System Index rose 4.7 percent in early
trading to 115.1 points, up from 109.9 points at the Tuesday close.
	   The rise followed a 9 percent plummet Tuesday that shadowed
stock market tumbles across Asia and in the United States.
	   Russia's has been in a free fall this year and is down about 70
percent in 1998 as the country's weak economy continues to
struggle.
	   The Russian market has been affected by the turmoil in Asia, and
often moves in the same direction as the Asian markets. With Asian
markets still jittery and little changed in Russia's economy,
traders said Wednesday's upturn did not mean a rally was on the
way.
	   Foreign investors still worry that Russia's government will not
be able to pay off its massive debts and may not withstand another
run on the market.
	   In response to Tuesday's plunge and continued fears about the
shaky markets, Russian officials again denied the possibility of a
ruble devaluation Wednesday.
	   The Finance Ministry has enough money to service its debt and
reserves at the Central Bank are ample at dlrs 17.5 billion, said
deputy head of the presidential administration Alexander Livshits,
according to Interfax.
	   ``We are not expecting a collapse,'' he said.
	   But Livshits acknowledged he was not expecting any major
improvements either. ``The situation may slightly deteriorate or
stay a yesterday's level,'' he said.
	   The ruble was up marginally at 6.29 to the U.S. dollar by
midday, compared to 6.30 on Tuesday.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A military court on Wednesday
convicted two police lieutenants implicated in the shooting deaths
of four student protesters, and sentenced them to 4 and 10 months
in prison.
	   The May 12 shootings at Trisakti University in the capital,
Jakarta, sparked several days of deadly rioting that led to the
resignation of former President Suharto amid the worst economic
crisis in decades.
	   The two anti-riot officers were the first of 18 policemen to
face courts-martial over the deaths as the military responds to
demands for accountability and democracy under Suharto's successor,
President B.J. Habibie. Police are part of the armed forces in
Indonesia.
	   Wednesday's verdicts were handed down as Indonesia's military
was grappling with a wide range of allegations of human rights
abuses, including the kidnapping and torture of anti-government
activists during the Suharto era.
	   The court sentenced First Lt. Agus Tri Heryanto to 10 months in
prison and 2nd Lt. Pariyo to 4 months. They were found guilty of
disobeying orders and flouting proper procedures.
	   The two were not charged with actually shooting the four
protesters.
	   However, prosecutors said they contributed to the deaths by
being undisciplined and unable to control their troops during a
student rally at the university against Suharto.
	   A military official said the trials of the other 16 police would
likely uncover who fired the bullets that killed the students.
	   ``We'll continue the investigation to find out who really shot
the students,'' said Maj. Gen. Abdul Wahab Mokodongan, a researcher
at a military think tank. Military law, he said, had required that
higher-ranking officers be tried first.
	   Prosecutors said the two convicted officials had contravened
orders from senior officers when they ordered their men to fire
warning shots above protesters' heads and to clash with students.
	   This led to chaos at the university's campus that resulted in
the killings by other security personnel.
	   ``The action of the two policemen gave the impression of
arrogance. They disobeyed military law,'' said trial judge Col.
Sudi Suradji.
	   The judge said the student protest had been peaceful until the
two defendants ordered their men to fire into the air and to push
demonstrators back with plastic shields.
	   Defense lawyer Bambang Widjoyanto said the two officers would
appeal.
	   ``The trial does not provide any proof of who shot the
students,'' Bambang told reporters.
	   The four dead students have been hailed by pro-democracy
activists, and even Habibie, as heroes of reform.
	   When the two officers' trial started last month, hundreds of
angry students protested outside the court.
	   In contrast, only about 20 were inside and 100 were outside to
hear the verdicts and sentences.
	   Most wore blue jackets signifying that they study at Trisakti
University.
	   Some clapped when they heard that the two had been found guilty,
but groaned in disappointment seconds later when the sentences were
announced.
	   Several complained that the court had been too lenient.
	   ``I am not satisfied because it is a very light sentence,'' said
one student, El Maida.

Wall Street plunge no shock to depressed Asian markets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock figures in Hong Kong in 11th graf
and Singapore in 13th graf &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo markets are on a weeklong losing streak. Hong
Kong hovers at a five-year low. In Singapore, stocks haven't been
so cheap in a decade _ and are still heading south.
	   The overnight plunge on Wall Street sank in slowly at Asia's
enfeebled stock exchanges Wednesday morning, further depressing
some markets and cementing fears that there's no end in sight for
the region's downward spiral.
	   At the Tokyo Stock Exchange, on its longest roll of losing days
in two years, the tailspin in New York Tuesday was only the latest
in a steady stream of dark market news.
	   With prices already low and many dealers away for ``O-bon,'' or
Festival for the Dead, summer holidays, the reaction was muted. The
benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 28.02 points, or 0.18
percent, closing at 15,378.97 in its eighth straight day of losses.
	   ``It doesn't seem panicky ... just this sort of ongoing
depression,'' said Paul Migliorato, senior manager of institutional
sales at Jardine Fleming Securities. ``No one is near the window
ledges.''
	   Still, some were jittery after Tuesday's drop in New York. Just
a week after surrendering 299 points in its third worst point loss
ever, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 258 points before
recovering somewhat and finishing 112 points lower at 8,462.85.
	   At a large electronic billboard listing stock prices near Tokyo
Station, a handful of concerned investors crowded around during
lunch break to monitor the action.
	   ``I am worried and the atmosphere is grim,'' said Seiji Kon, 51.
``If the economy in the United States gets bad, Japan's economy
will get even worse.''
	   Though the New York drop was a jolt after years of a bull market
on Wall Street, it was nothing compared to the daily mayhem that
Asian markets have suffered since the region's economy nose-dived
last year.
	   In Hong Kong, the mood is dark. The market's benchmark Hang Seng
Index has fallen a crushing 21 percent in the past three weeks,
including a 3.6 percent decline Tuesday to a five-year low of
6,779.95 points.
	   The reaction in Hong Kong to Wall Street on Wednesday was
subdued, however, with no sense of urgency. The Hang Seng gained
79.53 points, or 1.2 percent, closing at 6859.48.
	   But the quiet ``doesn't necessarily mean that the worst is over,
or that investors should be rushing back into the market,'' James
Osborn, sales director of ING Barings Securities, said at midday.
	   Singapore reacted quickly to the turmoil. The Straits Times
Industrials Index benchmark opened below the 1,000-point level
Wednesday, at one point hitting a fresh 10-year low of 995.60
before closing at 995.77.
	   Chia Yew Boon, head of research at Santander Investment
Securities Singapore, said the sell-off in New York and further
depression in Asia could set off a string of market reactions.
	   ``What happens in Asia spooks the U.S. market, which then goes
down, and that in turn spooks the Asian markets the following
day,'' he said, predicting another round of selling in New York.
	   Indeed, the downturn in the U.S. market is rooted in the
financial crisis in Asia and in particular the mounting problems in
Japan, where the world's second-largest economy is in deep
recession, its worst since World War II.
	   A Japanese recovery is seen as vital to ending an Asian fiscal
crisis, but that is growing increasingly remote. Japan's new
government is promising quick action, but opposition parties are
threatening to block key financial legislation.
	   The inaction is cause for worry in the region.
	   ``More needs to be done in Japan. The new Japanese government
does need to tackle some of the more deep-seated structural
problems of the Japanese economy,'' Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said in a radio interview Wednesday.
	   Howard spoke as the Australian share market fell hard in early
trading Wednesday, matching the fall in New York. The Australian
market rebounded later in the day.
	   Fears are building that Japan could be headed for a severe bout
of instability comparable to the collapses of several major
financial institutions last November.
	   The trouble has taken its toll on the yen, which hit an
eight-year low against the U.S. dollar Tuesday at 147.61 yen. The
currency rebounded somewhat on Wednesday to 145.96 yen to the
dollar.
	   A slump in the United States would come at a bad time for Asia,
robbing the region of its biggest market just when it's most
needed.
	   ``A plunge in the U.S. market muddies the waters for Japan and
Asia,'' said salesman Takayoshi Tobari in Tokyo, adding that
slumping exports ``would be really bad for Japan.''

Iraq will stick to stand despite Annan's appeal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq said Wednesday the lifting of
sanctions is the only way to defuse its current dispute with the
United Nations over weapons inspections.
	   The statement came in the influential newspaper Babil run by
President Saddam Hussein's son, Odai. The newspaper is often used
to express the government's views.
	   It was the first Iraqi response to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's dispatch of a special envoy to Baghdad with a message
asking Iraqi leaders to cooperate in a comprehensive review of
weapons inspections and sanctions.
	   The front-page editorial in Babil said Iraq appreciates Annan's
goodwill in seeking a solution. But the paper added that Iraq
``also hopes that he will understand that the situation no longer
bears more partial compromises and settlements.''
	   Babil said Baghdad would welcome special envoy Prakash Shah, an
Indian, but that he will find ``on both public and official levels
a determination by Iraq to obtain all its legitimate rights,
firstly the immediate implementation of paragraph 22 of (U.N.)
resolution 687.''
	   The paragraph calls for the lifting of trade sanctions on Iraq
once it completes the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Iraq has been under sanctions which bar air travel and most
sales of oil, its economic mainstay, since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   The U.N. Security Council has said that the sanctions will not
be lifted until inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its
weapons of mass destruction, as called for in U.N. resolutions.
	   Babil said Iraq will also insist ``on the closure of the various
weapons files related to disarmament. This the least Iraq can
accept before embarking on a new agreement or settlement.''
	   Annan proposed the review of weapons inspections on Monday after
Iraq last week declared it would no longer cooperate with U.N.
inspectors investigating potential arms caches in the country.
	   He urged the government to show ``common sense'' and renew
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors disarming it under the
1991 Gulf War cease-fire terms. He promised in return that the
United Nations would treat Iraqis with fairness.
	   Shah was scheduled to arrive in Iraq Thursday.

15 dead as bus plunges down ravine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ At least 15 people were killed and
20 injured when a bus packed with passengers plunged down a ravine
in Montenegro Wednesday.
	   The accident occurred on the main Belgrade-Podgorica road when
the bus hit a rock on the edge of the road and slid down a 30-meter
deep ravine in the Moraca River Canyon.
	   Yugoslav army helicopters were engaged in transporting the
wounded to to a hospital in Podgorica from the accident site some
15 kilometers (9 miles) north of the Montenegrin capital.
	   A public appeal for blood was launched by the health
authorities.
	   The narrow and often slippery stretch of road that winds down
the Moraca River Canyon where the accident occurred is infamous for
tragic accidents.
	   A TV footage showed rescuers trying to pull people out of the
bus wreckage that turned into a bundle of metal.

Shanghai police block campaign to end labor camps: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with police blocking Shanghai petition drive &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Police in Shanghai have blocked democracy
activists' attempts to circulate a petition demanding the closure
of China's labor camp prisons, a human rights group said Wednesday.
	   Veteran activists Zhou Jianhe and Han Lifa were briefly detained
Tuesday by police who told them to drop plans to collect signatures
on the petition, said the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China. Police warned them they would ``have
only themselves to blame'' if they continued to circulate the
petition, the Hong Kong-based center said.
	   Zhou and Han were among nine people who applied Aug. 5 for
police permission, as required by law, to collect signatures at two
downtown plazas. Police turned down a first request, and the men
had planned to file a second application, the center said.
	   Police guards have since been posted outside the men's homes and
plainclothes officers trail them wherever they go, it said.
	   Chinese law permits police to sentence prisoners, without trial,
to up to three years in a labor camp, a system known as ``laogai,''
or reform through labor. The punishment is often given to democracy
activists to avoid potentially troublesome trials.
	   Meanwhile, the human rights group said the wife of exiled
Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe plans to apply for a passport to visit
her husband in the United States.
	   Su Jiang, who remained behind in the southern city of Guangzhou
after her husband fled into exile in 1996, hopes to be reunited
with Wang, the group said.
	   It was unclear whether Su would be granted a passport. In May,
police prevented her from traveling to the nearby Portuguese colony
of Macau to join her husband, who was attending a gathering of
dissidents there.
	   After Wang left China, the government said his case should be
classified as ``illegal emigration.'' Wang's subsequent
announcement that he wanted to join the Nationalist Party of
Taiwan, historic rivals of China's Communist Party, further angered
Beijing.
	   Wang, a former factory worker, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison in 1981 for what the government called
``counterrevolutionary'' activities. After his early release in
1993, he was jailed off and on for democracy campaigning.

Hopkins pledges a million pounds for Welsh mountain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Welsh actor Sir Anthony Hopkins, more famous as
Hannibal ``The Cannibal'' Lecter than as a nature lover, has
pledged a million pounds (dlrs 1.63 million) to help save 4,000
acres (1,620 hectares) of Mount Snowdon, Wales' highest mountain.
	   ``Snowdonia is one of the most beautiful places in the world and
Snowdon is the jewel that lies at its heart,'' Hopkins said
Wednesday. ``It must be cherished and protected.''
	   A farmer last month put his estate near the 3,560-foot
(1,085-meter) peak up for sale. The National Trust, a charity that
protects much of Britain's natural and historic heritage, has 93
more days to find the rest of the 3 million pound (dlrs 4.9
million) price tag before the land is put on the market.
	   ``The National Trust is dedicated to the preservation of this
land and its natural heritage,'' said Hopkins, who won an Academy
Award for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in ``Silence of the
Lambs.'' ``I know this and have seen it firsthand. I am very
pleased that I am able to offer this support.''
	   Hopkins, who was born in Port Talbot, Wales, is chairman of the
trust's Snowdonia Appeal, which raises money for protection of the
land it already owns there.

Scuffles erupt as Iranians try to enter Pakistan Embassy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Riot police surrounded the Pakistani Embassy
in Tehran on Wednesday after scores of protesters tried to force
their way into the compound to demand the release of Iranians
allegedly captured in Afghanistan.
	   Iran claims that 11 of its diplomats, a correspondent of the
state-run Islamic Republic News Agency and 32 Iranian truck drivers
were captured by the hard-line Taliban militia in northern
Afghanistan.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because Islamabad is widely believed to back the Taliban,
which is battling a northern-based opposition alliance to impose
its strict version of Islamic rule on the entire country.
	   Taliban leaders, now controlling most of Afghanistan, including
Kabul, have barred most women from work and girls from school,
banned music and ordered all men to wear beards.
	   Police in full riot gear arrived at the embassy in Tehran after
scuffles erupted between the Pakistani guards and protesters trying
to force their way in.
	   A glass door at the embassy entrance was smashed when an IRNA
reporter who forced his way in to speak to the ambassador was
pushed into it. He was not injured.
	   The protesters, who numbered about 150, included families of the
missing Iranian drivers and IRNA employees.
	   They dispersed soon after the police surrounded the four-story
white marble building in a residential neighborhood near the city
center.
	   The Pakistani Embassy issued a statement Tuesday saying it could
not be responsible for events in northern Afghanistan but had used
all possible influence to ensure the safety of any Iranians.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but claim to be holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming the
Taliban's enemies.
	   Iran is widely believed to have supplied arms to the
anti-Taliban alliance in Afghanistan. Newspaper reports have quoted
Iranians officials as saying the captured truck drivers worked for
an international company transporting food to the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif, which was captured by the Taliban on Saturday. The
reports did not name the company.

ABB announces management shake-up to boost business growth
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swedish-Swiss electrical engineering
group Asea Brown Boveri Wednesday announced changes in its group
management structure aimed at boosting business growth areas.
	   ABB's Industrial and Building Systems segment will be divided
into three new segments, namely Automation; Oil, Gas and
Petrochemicals; and Products and Contracting, the company said.
	   The firm's power transmission and distribution unit will be
split in two separate parts, power transmission and power
distribution.
	   ABB's other two segments, power generation and financial
services, remain unchanged, according to an ABB press release.
	   The changes become effective on Sept. 1 and shouldn't affect the
group's performance outlook, ABB said.
	   Simultaneously, ABB's regional organizations, primarily Europe,
the Americas and Asia, will be dissolved. The firm says they have
fulfilled their mission to coordinate ABB's expansion in their
respective areas.
	   ABB manufactures products ranging from trains to power equipment
and develops and supplies oil refineries, composite petrochemical
plants and offshore installations worldwide.

Myanmar pro-democracy leader on road in new challenge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with claims of more members of parliament detained,
grafs 3-4, 13-14; trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Defying Myanmar's military regime,
pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi left her home Wednesday to
meet members of her political party outside the capital, even
though she has been stopped in previous attempts to do so.
	   Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, was headed
for Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, when she
was stopped at the same roadblock where she had been held up for
six days last month, government and party sources confirmed.
	   Meanwhile, a Myanmar exile opposition group claimed Wednesday
that four would-be members of parliament from her party were
detained for defying the military's orders restricting their
movements.
	   The All Burma Students' Democratic Front said the number of such
detentions since mid-June now totaled 83. The report could not
immediately be confirmed.
	   Authorities ended Suu Kyi's previous standoff, 32 kilometers (19
miles) west of the capital, on July 29 when they seized her car,
forcibly restrained her and drove it back to her home against her
will. She spent several days recovering from a high fever and
dehydration.
	   She had taken food and water with her, but supplies eventually
ran out. Authorities refused to let her buy fresh supplies and
prevented her party members and doctors from giving her food and
water, party members have said.
	   On Wednesday, Suu Kyi was again accompanied by Hla Pe, a
75-year-old member of her party's central executive committee, as
well as one or two drivers.
	   In apparent preparation for another standoff, she was traveling
in a friend's van instead of the sedan she had used on previous
trips. The van would allow more comfort for an extended stay and be
able to carry more food and water.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is largely
confined to her home and has little political maneuvering room. But
she has recently stepped up challenges to the government.
	   The foray Wednesday was her fourth attempt in two months to
drive outside Yangon. More importantly, she has given the military
an Aug. 21 deadline to seat the parliament elected in a 1990
general election.
	   Official newspapers said earlier Wednesday that Suu Kyi's
attempts to ``create instability and to incite the people'' would
``not be tolerated.''
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar _ also known as Burma _
since 1962, allowed the election to go forward but refused to honor
the result when Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory.
	   The league's elected members have faced fierce repression, with
nearly 200 dead, imprisoned or in exile. In addition to the latest
alleged detentions, the All Burma Students' Democratic Front said
two other members had been intimidated into resigning from
parliament.
	   Last month, the government denied it had detained any lawmakers,
saying they had only been ``temporarily prevented'' from leaving
their hometowns to prevent them from agitating among students.
	   The military has allowed Suu Kyi to travel outside Yangon only
once since releasing her from six years of formal house arrest in
July 1995, to visit a Buddhist monk.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's lakeside compound, refusing journalists
entry and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Government security personnel installed inside her compound were
withdrawn Friday on her demand. The government has added security
checkpoints on nearby roads and has searched cars leaving her home.
	   The party complained that the new measures amounted to a form of
house arrest. The government responded Tuesday that Suu Kyi had
received 300 visitors in a few days and noted that ``she will
always be provided with all necessary security and protection.
	   ``There is no government restriction on her movement as long as
security conditions permit,'' the government said in a statement.
	   On Saturday, Myanmar marked the 10th anniversary of a nationwide
uprising against military rule. It was eventually crushed by
troops. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   Myanmar's own people were calm on the anniversary. A day later,
however, 18 foreign democracy activists were arrested after handing
out leaflets urging people to remember the uprising. They were
still being held Wednesday.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Police have arrested four young men accused
of stealing automatic cash dispensers in Madrid, authorities said
Wednesday.
	   The men, aged from 20 to 23, were picked up Tuesday after making
off with 19 such machines over the course of a year.
	   They netted more than 54 million pesetas (360,000 dollars) by
dismantling the dispensers, which they had hauled away from

Moody's downgrades credit rating for troubled Japanese bank
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with UBS pulling out of planned joint
venture with LTCB; TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In another blow to a struggling bank, Moody's
Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded its credit ratings for
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.
	   LTCB was reported in June to be on the verge of collapse after
Moody's downgraded its debt, and its shares on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange became almost worthless overnight.
	   Debt-plagued LTCB later announced it was in talks to merge with
Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. _ a move widely assumed to have been
coordinated as a virtual bailout for LTCB.
	   LTCB officials also have said, however, that their bank is in no
danger of failing.
	   In Wednesday's downgrade, Moody's lowered LTCB's long-term
deposit rating to just above speculative, or junk bond status. Its
senior debt rating fell to speculative grade.
	   Meanwhile, LTCB's short-term deposit rating was confirmed at
Prime-3, the lowest level of investment grade, Moody's said.
	   The latest rating actions conclude a review that began on May
27, Moody's said.
	   LTCB's rating outlook remains negative because of uncertainty
regarding the confirmation of the pending merger with Sumitomo
Trust, Moody's said.
	   ``The downgrade reflects Moody's view that the bank's core
wholesale banking business has been under significant pressure,''
Moody's said.
	   In further bad news for the bank, the United Bank of Switzerland
said Wednesday it will not go ahead with a planned joint venture in
the private banking sector with LTCB.
	   ``We've started private banking operations within our own UBS
structures in Japan on July 1,'' said UBS spokesman Jens Woehler in
Zurich, Switzerland. ``UBS has been active in Japan for over 30
years. We've got the necessary infrastructure and know our
customers and services there well.''
	   UBS said Monday its investment bank and asset management joint
ventures with LTCB would be continued as planned for the time
being. But it said the names of the ventures would be changed,
deleting references to LTCB.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, LTCB shares closed at 42 yen (29
cents) Wednesday, up 4 yen (2 cents) from Tuesday. Share prices
below 100 yen ordinarily are seen as a warning sign of a company's
imminent demise.
	   In a statement, LTCB called the Moody's downgrade ``gravely
regrettable.''

Refugees still on run while Kosovo fighting flares up

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Thousands of ethnic Albanians remain
on the run in Kosovo province, international aid officials said
Wednesday, while Serb forces battled with rebels for control of a
region near the Albanian border.
	   NATO allies, meanwhile, met to fine-tune options for potential
military intervention in Kosovo, a province in southern Serbia.
	   Europe's worst refugee crisis since the Bosnian war showed no
signs of easing. Tens of thousands of people in Kosovo have been
displaced in the past two weeks alone, Amanda Williamson,
spokeswoman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, said
in Geneva.
	   She said thousands of people may still be living in the woods or
hills after being forced from their homes by recent clashes.
	   The Red Cross has delivered more than 100 tons of aid to various
places around Kosovo in recent days, but Williams warned that
international aid might not be enough.
	   ``We have a big crisis on our hands,'' she said.
	   The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting Serb forces for
independence for Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent
of the population. About 240,000 people have been displaced in five
months of fighting, according to U.N. estimates released Tuesday.
	   Serb sources in Kosovo reported that heavy fighting continued
early Wednesday in the Decani area, close to the border with
Albania. The most intense clashes were said to be around the
village of Glodjane, a KLA stronghold.
	   Serbia's independent B-92 radio reported that several thousand
KLA fighters were putting up strong resistance to police attacks on
the village. Many were feared dead and injured.
	   There were no immediate reports from the ethnic Albanian side
Wednesday. On Tuesday, Albanian sources reported that the Yugoslav
army was sending reinforcements to the area.
	   Serbia and Montenegro are the two remaining republics in
Yugoslavia.
	   Despite the latest fighting, the rebel army showed signs that it
was willing to enter negotiations with the government. The
militants have suffered a string of losses to Serb forces in the
past several weeks.
	   Veton Surroi, a top Albanian politician, said ethnic Albanians
would form a coalition government in the next few days and the KLA
would be represented in it.
	   Williamson said a Red Cross team evacuated some 55 Albanians,
including ill children and elderly people, who had been sheltering
on a dried-up river bed in the central Drenica area.
	   World leaders are still deliberating on what to do to halt the
fighting if they can't bring the warring sides to a negotiating
table soon. In Brussels Wednesday, NATO allies were debating
options for military action, including a possible air campaign
against targets in Yugoslavia or deployment of troops along the
border.
	   At the United Nations on Tuesday, the Security Council
reiterated calls for a cease-fire. Three members _ Britain, France
and Slovenia _ pushed for action against Yugoslavia, and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned Yugoslavia's
``scorched-earth policy.''

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) - With both rebel and government sides
claiming battlefield gains in Congo, a peace envoy from neighboring
Zambia arrived in the capital to open a new diplomatic front to
find a settlement to the conflict.
	   Zambian minister Eric Siluwamba began an investigation Wednesday
into allegations by Congo's President Laurent Kabila that Rwanda,
with the help of Uganda, is behind a growing Tutsi revolt.
	   A rebel commander in the eastern city of Goma said his 60,000
troops were closing in on Kinshasa with the ultimate aim of ending
Kabila's 14-month regime.
	   The government countered saying it was retaking ground lost to
the rebels in the early days of the 10-day uprising, which quickly
swept through the eastern Kivu region and parts of a corner of far
western Congo on the Atlantic coastline.
	   Siluwamba said he would try to open bilateral talks between
Congo and Rwanda in order to help find a resolution to the
fighting.
	   ``We are trying to open high level talks,'' Siluwamba said on
state-controlled radio in Kinshasa.
	   The Zambian envoy arrived in Congo on Tuesday and held brief
talks with Kabila, the radio said.
	   The peace effort follows weekend meetings in Victoria Falls,
Zimbabwe, where a commission was established by some of Congo's
neighbors to investigate Kabila's charges against Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Those two countries to Congo's east and northeast both
repeatedly deny involvement in the Tutsi uprising, which closely
resembles Kabila's own rebel movement that in May 1997 toppled the
reign of longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Kabila's relations with the two neighbors had been gradually
deteriorating, particularly because of his failure to control
Congo's vast eastern border region.
	   Rwanda has been frustrated by Kabila's failure to stop
cross-border Hutu rebel attacks on its territory.
	   During Kabila's rebel war in 1996-97, Rwanda also denied
involvement, although it is widely believed it played an
instrumental role in helping Kabila.
	   Many of the troops that fought for Kabila last year have
defected and joined the new rebel movement.
	   ``Our strategy is that our friends are everywhere. It's a war
that concerns everyone,'' said commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane in
Goma on Tuesday. ``We don't want an atrocious war. We want to end
this soon.''
	   On Tuesday, Ondekane said rebel troops had cut an oil pipeline
in western Congo that supplies the capital, Kinshasa. He also said
troops had reached the outskirts of the major Congo River port of
Matadi, 278 kilometers (173 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   The reported advances came amid government claims that its
forces had made inroads in both the far west and east.
	   Officials said government troops had retaken the city of Bukavu,
south of Goma, and its airport while other loyalists were fighting
for the western town of Boma, officials in Kinshasa said.
	   Ondekane denied Bukavu had been retaken by government forces.
	   He said rebel aircraft were supporting forces on the ground at
Kitona air base just outside the Atlantic seaside town of Muanda
and in the north central town of Kisangani, 830 kilometers (520
miles) northeast of Kinshasa on the Congo River.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain independent
confirmation of the claims from either side.
	   Ondekane, who served under Mobutu until he was toppled by
Kabila's rebels in May 1997, said most of the mutinous soldiers
were from his 10th Congolese brigade.
	   In contrast to November 1996, when fighting for Goma between
Mobutu's forces and Kabila's rebels was heavy and looting
widespread, shops in the sprawling town Tuesday were well-stocked
and banks open.
	   Life under the new rebel military administration appeared to be
near normal. Residents said no shots had been fired and the change
of power had been peaceful.

U.S. Embassy leases gas station to ward off threats

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy hastily paid off
and shut down a nextdoor gas station Wednesday to prevent any
attempts by terrorists to use it as a bombing base.
	   The embassy had been negotiating for some time to take over the
Shell station, said embassy spokesman James Warren.
	   ``The interest in negotiations has increased dramatically over
the past few days,'' he said, adding the lease agreement was
finalized Wednesday.
	   Most operations at the embassy closed Monday, after the State
Department ordered half a dozen missions to suspend operations
because of increased threats of terrorism.
	   It named U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen as
particularly threatened targets.
	   Heightened precautions have been taken at U.S. embassies
worldwide, particularly those without sufficient barriers against
roadside terrorist threats, following car-bomb explosions at U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania Friday.
	   The bombings killed at least 250 people and injured more than
5,000.
	   While more than 120 police officers, many of them in plain
clothes, circled the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, gas station
attendants pumped gasoline out of the underground tanks into a
parked tanker. The unleaded gasoline was being stored for use by
embassy vehicles, said a contractor.
	   He said some 18,800 liters (5,000 gallons) had to be drained
from the tanks.
	   ``We're going to get all we can out tonight,'' said John Harvey,
the embassy facility manager.
	   Conical road blocks had been placed to close off the station
just outside the high embassy walls fortified by razor-tipped
barbed wire fencing atop them.
	   The State Department said Tuesday night it had received
information of threats to U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and
Yemen.
	   ``This could include attacks on buildings,'' the department said
in a statement.
	   Several police officers from a Malaysian combat unit, once used
against communist guerrillas, were posted outside the U.S. Embassy
on Wednesday in addition to the local police.
	   No group has been identified by the FBI or Kenyan and Tanzanian
investigators as responsible for Friday's bombings.
	   The embassy spokesman in Kuala Lumpur said there had been no
threats from Malaysians.
	   ``Our concerns are with an outside group that may come into
Malaysia. We're not worried about Malaysians. These threats are
coming from outside the country,'' said Warren.
	   The embassy was gripped by panic last year after death threats
to Americans in Malaysia during a time when Malaysian leaders were
blaming U.S. currency speculators for the Asian crisis and some
U.S. lawmakers were demanding Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
resignation over alleged anti-Jewish remarks.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP)_ Police have arrested four young men accused
of stealing automatic cash dispensers in Madrid, authorities said
Wednesday.
	   The men, aged from 20 to 23, were picked up Tuesday after making
off with 19 such machines over the course of a year.
	   They netted more than 54 million pesetas (360,000 dollars) by
dismantling the dispensers, which they had hauled away from
shopping centers, train stations and industrial parks.

Dustin Hoffman discovers a young Roman to star in his film
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ On the day Italians traditionally wish upon falling
stars, a 19-year-old Roman was granted a wish she hadn't even
dreamed of: a chance to star in Dustin Hoffman's new film.
	   The American actor, who had just landed his yacht Illusion on
the tiny island of Stromboli, north of Sicily, reportedly saw the
woman at a nearby bar and exclaimed, ``I have seen my Renata.''
	   According to witness accounts published in Italian dailies
Wednesday, the 60-year-old actor invited the teen-ager, described
as a tall, thin brunette, to the table where he was sitting with
his wife and two of his children. Through a translator, Hoffman
reportedly asked Anna, who is a student in Rome and speaks no
English, whether she would be interested in playing the leading
role in a movie based on Ernest Hemmingway's 1950 novel, ``Across
the River and into the Trees.''
	   Anna, who has no acting experience, told reporters she was
thrilled by the offer and would send her photos and resume to
Hoffman's studio as he had instructed her. In accord with Italy's
new privacy laws, the newspapers did not give her last name.
	   The film marks the directing debut for Hoffman, an Academy Award
winner best-known for his role in the 1982 movie ``Tootsie.''
	   On the Aug. 10 celebration of San Lorenzo, Italians usually go
to romantic, secluded areas to wish upon falling stars _ an
opportunity provided by the yearly Perseid meteor shower.

Malaysian asks for moratorium on protests during Commonwealth
</HEADLINE>
Games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Home Ministry asked
volunteer groups and private organizations Wednesday not to stage
protests and demonstrations during next month's Commonwealth Games.
	   Protests during the 10-day event, with athletes from 70
countries, would tarnish Malaysia's image, Deputy Home Minister
Tajol Rosli Ghazali was quoted as saying by Bernama news agency.
	   Police would be extra vigilant and ready to take all necessary
action to ensure that the games went off smoothly, he said.
	   ``The government wishes to appeal to the people not to create
any problem during the games, and the police will be firm in
discharging their duties,'' he said.
	   The minister was speaking after a briefing on police
preparations for the games by Inspector-General of Police Abdul
Rahim Noor.
	   Malaysia has allocated an extra 19.3 million ringgit (dlrs 4.6
million) to the police for the additional security measures needed
during the games, the official said.
	   More than 6,000 athletes and officials are expected for the
games, which begin Sept. 11. Almost an equal number of police
personnel will be deployed, Tajol Rosli said.

Ukraine's 1998 grain harvest to drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine will collect less grain this year
than in 1997, an Agriculture Ministry official said Wednesday.
	   The country's grain harvest is expected to total 32 million tons
(35.2 million short tons), down from last year's 35.7 million tons
(39.3 million short tons), Deputy Agriculture Minister Yuri Lupenko
said.
	   He blamed the drop on heavy rainstorms that in recent months
have swept over most of Ukraine, which used to be the largest grain
producer in the former Soviet Union.
	   The lower harvest is not likely to affect the country's domestic
consumption, since it needs only about a third of the grain it
produces annually.

Taliban allow foreign aid groups to resume operations in Kabul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Foreign aid groups can resume
operations in the war-ravaged Afghan capital of Kabul while they
talk with Taliban rulers about whether to move to dilapidated
dormitories, according to an agreement announced Wednesday.
	   ``It is a breakthrough,'' said Bronek Szynalski, acting
coordinator of U.N. humanitarian projects in Afghanistan. Szynalski
conducted negotiations with Taliban officials in Kabul this week.
	   Taliban officials had no immediate comment.
	   Taliban officials expelled about 200 aid workers from 38
independent humanitarian agencies on July 20 when they refused to
move their homes and offices to dormitories on a university campus
heavily damaged in Afghanistan's long civil war. Aid workers said
the dormitories were unsafe and uninhabitable.
	   Szynalski said Wednesday that the agreement would allow aid
groups could return to Kabul and operate from their old offices.
Meantime, a seven-member committee with members representing the
Taliban, the United Nations and aid groups would try to compromise
on the relocation issue.
	   ``I am sure we will reach a mutually acceptable agreement in the
next couple of weeks,'' said Charles MacFadden of Acbar, the
coordinating body for aid groups in Afghanistan. It was not clear
when aid workers, most of whom went to neighboring Pakistan after
being expelled, would begin returning.
	   The aid groups carried out or supplemented U.N. humanitarian
programs including providing food, health care and safe water. Only
the United Nations and the Red Cross were not affected by the
relocation order.
	   The dormitory dispute capped a long period of friction between
aid groups and Taliban leaders, who now control most of
Afghanistan.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and
confining most women to their homes. International aid groups say
Taliban rules hamper their efforts to provide education and other
services to all, while the Taliban accuse the groups of flouting
the country's laws and traditions.

Opposition party accuses Iraq of executing 62 detainees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Iraq has executed 62 political prisoners who
had been detained since a failed uprising after the 1991 Gulf War,
an exiled opposition party said Wednesday.
	   They were executed in Abu Ghraib prison, west of Baghdad, in
late June, said a statement from the London-based Center for Human
Rights of the Iraqi Communist Party.
	   The bodies were not handed over to their families but to
security authorities in Abu Ghraib district who ``proceeded to bury
them in mass graves,'' the statement said.
	   The group gave the names of the executed prisoners, saying they
were the latest victims of a series of executions that began last
year.
	   ``This new wave (of executions), which reached a peak on June
28, targeted detainees who had been accused of participating in the
popular uprising of March 1991.''
	   The prisoners were from the Iraqi provinces of Taamim, Basra,
Karbala, Misan, Babel, Dhi-Qar, Qadisiyah, Najaf and Muthana, the
group said.
	   It was not possible to obtain comment from the Iraqi government
as it rarely responds to such accusations.
	   In April, the U.N. human rights commissioner responsible for
Iraq, former Dutch Foreign Minister Max van der Stoel, said as many
as 1,500 people may have been executed in Iraqi prisons and
elsewhere last year.
	   Interviewed on CNN earlier this year, Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz refused to respond directly to a question about
such executions.
	   Many of last year's executions were said to have taken place in
Abu Ghraib prison.
	   The Iraqi Communist Party, in its statement on the executions,
called on the United Nations and human rights organizations to
exert greater pressure on Iraq to stop the killings.
	   ``We appeal in particular to the U.N. Security Council and U.N.
Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Annan personally who, up to now, have
not apparently been moved by the horrific mass killings occurring
for nearly nine months in the prisons of a U.N. member state,'' the
statement said.

Singapore bourse closes at 10-year low
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with market closing figures; RECASTS throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's rattled stock market succumbed to
another day of selling pressure Wednesday, drifting below a
psychologically important support level to close at a 10-year low.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Industrials Index closed at 995.77,
down 12.16 points, or 1.2 percent, from Tuesday's close of
1,007.93. The key index had not closed below 1,000 points since
Dec. 7, 1988.
	   The index now has plummeted 35 percent since the start of the
year, when it stood at 1,529.84.
	   Dealers said they expect the Singapore index to slide toward the
800-point level by the end of 1998.
	   ``People are losing faith,'' an institutional sales trader at a
Japanese broking house told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The overnight drop on Wall Street added to regional jitters and
local factors pushing down Singapore shares.
	   On Wall Street Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost
1.3 percent, or 112 points, closing at 8,462.85. It was the New
York Stock Exchange's second major fall in a week.
	   Wild volatility in regional currencies has also continued to
unnerve investors, traders in Singapore said.
	   Apprehension that China might devalue its currency contributed
to the poor sentiment, they added. The likelihood of disappointing
corporate results had also depressed the market, they said.
	   Blue chips and banking stocks led losing issues, as retail and
institutional investors bailed out, analysts said.
	   But the Singapore dollar was stronger Wednesday, in line with
the rallying yen. In late afternoon trading, it stood at 1.745
against the U.S. dollar, up from 1.760 late in Asia the previous
day.

 &UR; Tehran's former mayor has filed appeal

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Lawyers for the former mayor of Tehran, who
was sentenced to five years in jail last month for corruption, have
filed an appeal, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported
Wednesday.
	   The appeal was submitted Tuesday by Bahman Keshavarz, lawyer of
of the deposed mayor, Gholamhossein Karbaschi, the agency reported.
Keshavarz said he hoped the appeals petition would soon be reviewed
``by an appeals court and the result will be what was long expected
_ his acquittal,'' the agency said.
	   Last month, Karbaschi was found guilty of embezzlement during
his eight years as Tehran's mayor. He was fined 1 billion rials
(dlrs 330,000), ordered to pay 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) to
the city and banned from holding any government job for 20 years.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted making mistakes, but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
had been a target of the president's hard-line political rivals and
many Iranians say the trial was a political settling of scores.

	   SINGAPORE _ The Strait Times Industrials Index fell to a 10-year

Cosmonauts, experts complete preparations for new manned mission

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Cosmonauts aboard the Mir decoupled a cargo ship
from the space station on Wednesday to prepare the site for docking
with a manned Soyuz ship that is scheduled to arrive in three days.
	   Meanwhile, at the Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet
republic of Kazakstan, space experts were completing preparations
for the Soyuz launch, set for Thursday.
	   The Soyuz will carry a three-man crew, including politician and
former presidential advisor Yuri Baturin, flight commander Sergei
Avdeyev and engineer Gennady Padalka.
	   Baturin told reporters at Baikonur that he would like to serve
on the international space station after the Mir is retired, but
said he would be patient. The first, American-led crew is expected
to board the station in July 1999.
	   ``Young guys have now joined the group of Russian cosmonauts,''
the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Baturin as saying. ``Let them fly
first, and then maybe I will try.''
	   After traveling through space for two days, the Soyuz will
approach Mir on Saturday. But docking plans are threatened by
possible problems with the station's docking system, known as Kurs,
which has malfunctioned in recent days.
	   A test two days ago showed that the system was not responding to
commands. However, it appeared to be operational again on Tuesday,
said Mission Control spokeswoman Irina Manshilina.
	   After detaching the Progress cargo ship from the station on
Wednesday, the Mir's cosmonauts were to try re-docking it again to
test the Kurs system, she said.
	   If Kurs fails, Soyuz flight commander Avdeyev can dock his ship
manually, but the procedure is more complicated and space officials
usually try to avoid it.
	   The Progress is expected to orbit the Mir until after August 25,
when the current crew leaves on a Soyuz ship, vacating the spot for
docking the Progress again.
	   The new crew is to stay on the Mir until February. However,
Avdeyev, the flight commander, may remain on the orbiter until next
June, when the Mir is to be closed down and lowered to Earth.
	   A French and a Slovak astronaut are also expected to visit the
Mir before it is abandoned.

Catholic bishop reportedly ends 6-year exile for fathering son
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Former Catholic Bishop Eamonn Casey, who
left Ireland six years ago after admitting he'd fathered a child,
has reportedly ended his missionary work in South America and
arrived in England.
	   Irish media reported that Casey, 71, arrived Tuesday at London's
Heathrow airport from Ecuador, where he had had worked among nuns
at a mission for the poor.
	   The former bishop of Galway, western Ireland, left the country
in 1992 after an American woman went public with news of their 1973
affair.
	   Annie Murphy protested that he wasn't paying sufficient support
for Peter, now 23, who had rarely seen his father. The Connecticut
woman wrote a florid account of their romance called ``Forbidden
Fruit.''
	   Much of the public was even more outraged that Casey had
improperly used collection-plate donations to cover his
surreptitious child-support payments.
	   Casey was last photographed in Ireland in 1994, when he returned
briefly to attend a relative's funeral _ and drew criticism from
church authorities for wearing his bishop's vestments. He has since
made a few more visits, but kept away from public events.

Fourteen injured in train collision
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A passenger train collided with a
freight train Wednesday morning in central Finland, casuign minor
injuries to 14 people, the state VR railway said.
	   ed with a cargo train carrying peroxide Wednesday morning in
Suonenjoki, central Finland, the finnish railways, VR reported.
	   ``The engines were stacked up on each other at the site,'' said
Jukka Koponen, chief of rescue services in Suonenjoki, about 275
kilometers (170 miles) northeast of Helsinki.
	   According to Koponen, the passenger train had been accelerating
out of a station at low speed when the engineer noticed the cargo
train on the oncoming track.
	   Both trains remained on their tracks after the collision. There
were no immediate reports as to the cause of the accident, said
Koponen.
	   Some peroxide leaked from the cargo train, but VR said the leak
was under control and posed no danger to the environment.
	   In March, 10 people were killed and 39 injured when a passenger
derailed in the city of Jyvaskyla.

NATO allies finetune military options for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies met Wednesday to
finetune options for military action designed to get Serb forces to
halt their crackdown against secessionists in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo.
	   The ambassadors of the 16 NATO nations debated plans that
essentially involve three options: a preventive deployment of
troops along the borders of Kosovo in neighboring Albania and
Macedonia; a graduated air campaign against targets in Yugoslavia;
and a deployment of peacekeeping troops into Yugoslavia.
	   These plans have been taking shape very slowly in the past two
months because of the immense political implications of the NATO
alliance intervening in a Balkan conflict and an internal Yugoslav
dispute, at that.
	   An American official said the NATO envoys were considering in
detail the issue of limited air options, not just in Kosovo but
across the Yugoslav Republic.
	   Allied planes would avoid civilian targets and focus on
``offensive'' Serb military targets.
	   The United States and Britain have been at odds over how fast
the allies should deploy planes if they agree to use air power.
	   In mid-June, an allied military intervention seemed an imminent
possibility as warplanes from 13 of the 16 NATO nations roared over
Albania and Macedonia in four hours of heavy-duty sabre-rattling.

Spanish police arrest more than 600 would-be immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Police in a Spanish enclave in North Africa
arrested more than 600 would-be immigrants, including 92 clinging
to truck axles or hiding among amusement park rides being shipped
to Europe, authorities said Wednesday.
	   Authorities made the arrests during a 10-day street carnival
that ended Monday night in the Ceuta enclave.
	   A total of 92 people were caught hiding inside or underneath
trucks that were to be ferried across the Strait of Gibraltar back
to mainland Spain.
	   Some tried to conceal themselves among disassembled amusement
park rides, said Roberto Franca, an interior ministry spokesman in
Ceuta.
	   Overall, police and Civil Guard officers arrested 642 people who
had entered the enclave illegally since the carnival began Aug. 1,
authorities said.
	   The fair is a yearly event that honors Ceuta's patron saint, the
Virgin of Africa. It draws crowds from neighboring Morocco, many of
whom just want to enjoy the carnival. But Spanish police say others
use the fair as a stepping stone to try to sneak across the strait
into Europe.
	   The Interior Ministry says that since January, Spanish police
have caught more than 7,000 would-be immigrants from North Africa.
	   Fleeing poverty at home, most make the hazardous crossing in
packed, makeshift single-motor boats. Each year many are believed
to drown.
	   Last Thursday, the Interior Minister reported 38 Moroccans
drowned a month ago just off the coast of another Spanish enclave
in North Africa, Melilla, raising the year's death toll to 69.

Brush fire forces out 350 tourists on island of Elba; arson

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Firefighters managed Wednesday to extinguish a brush
fire that had threatened a resort on Italy's island of Elba,
forcing the evacuation of about 350 tourists.
	   The fire burned about 800 hectares (2,000 acres) since breaking
out Monday night. Flames approached a coastal resort on Tuesday
night, leading authorities to evacuate the guests to a school in a
nearby city.
	   The tourists were allowed to return Wednesday, Italy's AGI news
agency reported.
	   Witnesses told authorities they had seen someone in a car toss a
benzene-soaked rag into the brush, Italian dailies said.
Authorities suspected the fire may have been set by local people
angry that land had been set aside for a national park on the
island, off Tuscany in western Italy.
	   Other fires burned hundreds of acres in the regions of Abruzzo,
Umbria, Emilia Romagnia and the island of Sardinia.

Moderate earthquakes rock northwestern Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with another earthquake, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.6
rocked parts of northwestern Japan Wednesday, the strongest among a
series of tremors over six days, the Central Meteorological Agency
said.
	   No injuries or damage were reported in any of the tremors.
	   The strongest quake, at 3:13 p.m. (0613 GMT), was very shallow
underground in Nagano prefecture (state), 210 kilometers (130
miles) northwest of Tokyo, the agency said.
	   The agency said there was no fear of tsunami, the huge ocean
waves caused by undersea earthquakes or volcanic activity.
	   ``The latest quake was bigger than the earlier ones,'' said
Azumi village official Toshimitsu Kawakami. ``The entire building
was shaking.''
	   Village officials met Wednesday to discuss procedures for
evacuation in case of increased danger.
	   Between last Friday and Wednesday afternoon, a total of 1,470
earthquakes, most too small to be felt by humans, had been
registered in the area, the agency said. Many were about 10
kilometers (6 miles) underground in central Nagano prefecture.
	   They included a quake with a magnitude of 4.1 at 9:40 a.m. (0040
GMT) Wednesday.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

Heavyweight Shannon Briggs, three companions jailed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ World-ranked heavyweight boxer Shannon Briggs
and three companions were arrested on battery charges and at least
four people sustained minor injuries after a fight in the French
Quarter.
	   The incident followed an argument among Briggs, 27, and his
friends and three couples leaving the House of Blues about 3 a.m.
Tuesday, police said.
	   Briggs, 6-foot-4 (1.93 meters) and 225 pounds (100 kilos), was
booked on four counts of simple battery for fighting.
	   Briggs, an American, is ranked 13th in the current World Boxing
Council ratings and is probably best known for a victory over
George Foreman in November 1997.
	   Police also arrested the men with Briggs.
	   Michael Brant, 31, also of the United States, was booked for
aggravated battery for allegedly hitting a man with a baseball bat.
American Leonard Byam, 32, was booked for aggravated battery for
allegedly hitting another man in the leg with the same bat. David
Rousse, 24, also of the United States, was booked for simple
battery.
	   In addition to battery, Rousse and Brant were booked for
possession of marijuana. Police said two small bags of the drug
were found on the floor of the patrol car after they were driven to
jail.
	   All four of the men were released later Tuesday on their own
recognizance.
	   One of the injured women, a 23-year-old New Orleans resident,
said she and her husband were leaving the House of Blues with two
other couples when a utility vehicle with four men inside pulled up
at the curb.

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban movement has
captured an Afghan city just across the border from Uzbekistan, and
Uzbek border troops have been put on alert to guard against a
possible spillover of violence, a government official said
Wednesday.
	   The Taliban have captured Hayratan, a city on the Afghan side of
a the Amudarya River, which marks the border with Uzbekistan, said
an Uzbek Defense Ministry official, who asked not to be identified
by name.
	   All Uzbek border troops along the 147-kilometer (90-mile)
stretch of the border with Afghanistan have been put on high alert,
said the Defense Ministry official.
	   Russia has said it was ready to fortify the borders of the
former Soviet republics to prevent Afghanistan's turmoil from
spreading elsewhere in Central Asia.
	   ``The situation in Afghanistan is very complicated; the threat
to the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) borders has
grown,'' Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Wednesday in
Moscow.
	   ``We are constantly and closely following the developments in
Afghanistan, and naturally are taking appropriate steps to
strengthen our troops,'' Sergeyev said.
	   Russia has for years had 25,000 Russian troops in Tajikistan,
where they help support the government and guard the country's
border with Afghanistan.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin said military experts and soldiers from Pakistan were
aiding the Taliban, Interfax reported.
	   ``Massive military assistance from the outside encourages the
Taliban, fueling a dangerous armed conflict,'' Nesterushkin was
quoted as saying.
	   In Tajikistan, the government said the fighting was approaching
its border, and appealed to the warring sides and to the United
Nations to act urgently to stop the conflict.
	   A government statement said that the turmoil in Afghanistan has
in some areas reached the Tajik border, and Tajikistan's security
is under ``direct threat,'' Interfax reported.
	   Afghanistan's fundamentalist Taliban forces have been advancing
in the country's north and recently captured several key cities,
including the opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   However, the Taliban have said they are only seeking to take
full control of Afghanistan and have no designs on their neighbors.
Still, a Taliban takeover of northern Afghanistan could send
refugees and weapons streaming into the former Soviet republics of
Central Asia.
	   Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov said his country will not
be able to avoid Afghanistan's influence if the Taliban wins, the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported.
	   ``No matter how much we calm ourselves down, the situation on
the border will have a negative effect on the general atmosphere,''
Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov was quoted as saying by
ITAR-Tass.

One killed, nine wounded in grenade explosion in southern Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A drunken row among beer lovers in southern
Ukraine ended with a grenade blast that killed one person and
injured 9 others, newspapers said Wednesday.
	   Two intoxicated brothers, who stopped to get more drink at a
beer kiosk in the city of Mykolayiv, started a fight with another
beer lover, the daily newspaper Dyen said.
	   In the midst of a fight, which occurred Monday night, one of the
brothers threw a grenade to the opponent's feet.
	   The blast killed the 25-year-old man, identified only as Mykola,
and injured five women and four men who were nearby, the daily
Fakty reported.
	   The brothers tried to escape, but the one who allegedly threw
the grenade was shot and wounded by a nearby witness carrying a
licensed pistol. Police soon detained the second brother.
	   The brothers' names were not disclosed. Police said both of them
were married and had never been arrested before.
	   Investigators have yet to determine how the brothers obtained
the RG-42 grenade, according to Fakty.

China sentences four Taiwanese businessmen accused of spying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Beijing court on Wednesday convicted four
Taiwanese businessmen of spying in a case that threatened to set
back tentative efforts to resume talks between China and Taiwan.
	   One of the men, Kou Jianming, was sentenced to four years in
prison, while the other three were not punished, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   The court's apparent leniency for what can be a capital crime in
China could reflect a desire by Chinese authorities not to let the
case derail plans for Chinese and Taiwanese negotiators to meet
later this year.
	   Taiwanese newspapers have speculated that China was likely to
repatriate the men to Taiwan to minimize disruption to efforts to
renew dialogue between the two sides that has been suspended since
1995. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has been pushing
for talks on reunification.
	   The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate Court ruled that the four men
worked for Taiwan's military intelligence bureau under the cover of
a civic organization set up to promote exchanges between China and
Taiwan, Xinhua said.
	   They ``illegally entered the mainland and engaged in political,
economic and military espionage between June of 1993 and March of
1998,'' it said.
	   Taiwan's intelligence agencies and the men's families have
strongly denied that the men were spies.
	   Kou was secretary-general of the organization described by the
court as a front for espionage. Chen Shaoyu, Han Yueting and Zhou
Changming _ all members of Kou's organization _ were not sentenced
because of their ``meritorious performance,'' Xinhua said without
elaborating.
	   The four were detained earlier this year while in China on what
their families said were business trips. China announced their
arrests on May 28, claiming the men confessed to spying for Taiwan.
	   Taiwanese have grown increasingly anxious about their safety in
China, where many have business dealings. Concerns rose again this
month when a Taiwanese politician was kidnapped and killed in
northeastern China.

Arafat calls for U.S. to get tough with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Wednesday said the United States should take a tougher line
against Israel in the stalled Middle East peace process.
	   A U.S. proposal that Israel withdraw troops from an additional
13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian guarantees
to combat terror has been accepted by Arafat, but Israel has yet to
agree.
	   On a state visit to South Africa, Arafat said he hoped President
Nelson Mandela would use his good relationship with U.S. President
Bill Clinton to promote the Palestinian cause.
	   Asked by reporters what he wanted Mandela to tell Clinton,
Arafat replied: ``To be tough with those who are refusing a
peaceful initiative.''
	   Arafat was visiting Robben Island, site of a former jail just
off the coast at Cape Town, where Mandela spent 18 years as a
prisoner of the apartheid government.
	   Guided by Ahmed Kathrada, who was jailed alongside Mandela for
fighting white rule, Arafat toured the tiny island prison which has
now been converted into a tourist attraction and nature reserve.
	   Arafat posed for photographers through the bars of Mandela's
tiny, sparse cell and sat in the prison courtyard of the maximum
security ``B Section'' where he listened as Kathrada recounted his
experiences of jail life.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A passenger train collided with a
freight train Wednesday morning in central Finland, causing minor
injuries to 14 people, the state VR railway said.
	   ``The engines were stacked up on each other at the site,'' said
Jukka Koponen, chief of rescue services in Suonenjoki, about 275
kilometers (170 miles) northeast of Helsinki.
	   According to Koponen, the passenger train had been accelerating
out of a station at low speed when the engineer noticed the cargo
train on the oncoming track.
	   Both trains remained on their tracks after the collision. There
were no immediate reports as to the cause of the accident, said
Koponen.
	   Some peroxide leaked from the cargo train, but VR said the leak
was under control and posed no danger to the environment.
	   In March, 10 people were killed and 39 injured when a passenger
derailed in the city of Jyvaskyla.

Six relatives of militants killed in India's northeast
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By WASBIR HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Masked gunmen killed six relatives of
separatist guerrilla leaders in India's remote northeast, police
said Wednesday.
	   Police said they suspect the attacks were carried out to avenge
the killing this week of Tapan Dutta, a former commander of the
United Liberation Front of Assam who surrendered seven years ago
and became a businessman in Gauhati, the largest city in Assam.
	   The victims, slain in three separate incidents, were all related
to current leaders of ULFA, which has been fighting since 1979 for
Assam's independence, claiming India strips the region of its
resources without investing in its development.
	   In a separate attack, another rebel group shot and killed five
people belonging to the minority Bengali community in a northern
district Tuesday, said Jotindra Lahkar, a top district official.
	   Twelve Bengalis were wounded when at least 15 armed Bodo
guerrillas attacked Subhash Palli village, 70 kilometers (45 miles)
north of Gauhati, Lahkar said.
	   Bodo rebels have been fighting since 1986 to carve out an
autonomous homeland from Assam, which would give tribal authorities
more control over their land. More than 1,000 people have been
killed in the insurgency.
	   Early Wednesday, unidentified gunmen raided a village in
northern Assam and killed four family members of Mithinga Daimary,
the ULFA publicity chief. The dead included Daimary's mother, two
sisters and a brother, police said.
	   On Tuesday night, a brother of Arabina Rajkhowa, another ULFA
leader, was shot dead in Dibrugarh, a tea township 550 kilometers
(345 miles) east of Gauhati.
	   A few hours later, H.K. Mishra, brother of another ULFA
commander, was kidnapped and shot, police said.
	   The killings came as ULFA claimed responsibility for sabotaging
an oil depot of the state-owned Indian Oil Corp. on Tuesday. It has
stepped up terrorist activity as a protest against India's 51st
independence anniversary, which falls on Saturday.

Myanmar says foreign detainees not cooperating
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. Embassy seeking prompt release of Americans,
7th graf &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Myanmar-Suu Kyi &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The detention of 18 foreign democracy
activists is being prolonged because they have failed to cooperate
with authorities, the military regime said Wednesday.
	   The 18 were apprehended in downtown Yangon and at the airport
Sunday after distributing leaflets urging people to remember a
failed 1988 uprising against military rule and not to give up hope.
	   The government has accused the six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippine citizens and an
Australian of breaking the law and trying to incite unrest.
	   The government so far has not decided whether they will be
charged with any crime or tried. Deportation still remains an
option, officials said.
	   A government spokesman, in a faxed statement to The Associated
Press in Bangkok, Thailand, said he believed some of the detainees
were still being questioned, four days after their arrest.
	   ``Because of their lack of cooperation, the process has been
unnecessarily prolonged,'' said the spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The U.S. Embassy made official representations Wednesday for the
early release of the detainees, an embassy spokeswoman said.
	   Myanmar state television Tuesday showed still photos of two
groups of detainees, smiling as they enjoyed a meal. One group was
identified as Thais, and the people in the other were unidentified.
	   The news reader said they were being ``treated well on
humanitarian grounds.''
	   Visits to the detainees were allowed Tuesday by diplomats of
their embassies. U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said
in Washington that all six Americans were in good health.
	   ``They had no complaint about their treatment and appeared to
have been treated humanely,'' Foley said.
	   In Manila, Philippine President Joseph Estrada urged Myanmar to
free the two Filipinos and ensure their safety.
	   U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, who chairs the House International
Operations and Human Rights subcommittee, said he planned to fly to
Southeast Asia Wednesday to seek the release of the detainees.
	   Smith is the congressman for the New Jersey district home to one
of the detainees, 19-year-old Michele Keegan.
	   Smith spoke to Myanmar's ambassador in Washington and said he
expects to speak to the detainees, government officials and
opposition leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The Myanmar government spokesman hinted Wednesday that Smith
might not be granted a visa.
	   It was ``quite unfortunate'' that Myanmar had suspended issuing
visas to U.S. officials after Washington barred members of
Myanmar's government from visiting the United States, the spokesman
said.
	   ``The congressman has been assured that the Myanmar government
will exercise utmost restraint in dealing with the misguided
individuals,'' the spokesman said.
	   The U.S. ban was proclaimed by President Bill Clinton to
sanction Myanmar for increasing pressure on the pro-democracy
movement led by Suu Kyi.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan told the Foreign
Correspondents Club of Thailand on Tuesday that he would push for
the release of the detainees through the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations.
	   ``We will try our best to protect our nationals as much as we
can,'' Surin said. ``But we will stop at the border and let the
Myanmar authorities do their job first.''

Government to close investigation against science fiction writer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DILIP GANGULY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ The government will close its
investigation of Arthur C. Clarke unless a British tabloid hands
over evidence to support its allegation that the science fiction
writer was a pedophile, a government official said Wednesday.
	   Police sought the tape recording of an interview conducted by
the Sunday Mirror on which it based its allegation that Clarke had
sex with children, but the paper had not responded to repeated
requests, said C. R. de Silva, the government additional
solicitor-general .
	   ``We have approached Interpol. Our embassy in London did its
best. In short, we did everything, but the tape has not come,'' de
Silva said.
	   ``Our investigations in Sri Lanka have not found any evidence
against him,'' de Silva said. ``Keeping this in view, and the
situation that we are unable to get the tape, we will have no
option but to close the case.''
	   Clarke's office said his lawyers were discussing with government
officials how to close the file. He has denied the allegations
against him.
	   The Sunday Mirror published its story in February, a few days
before the 80-year-old writer was to be knighted by Prince Charles
who was visiting Sri Lanka. The ceremony was postponed at Sir
Arthur's request.
	   Police questioned the author and three of the four men quoted by
the British tabloid as having claimed to have had sex or discussed
sex with him.
	   Sri Lanka asked Interpol in April to get the interview tape from
the tabloid. A reminder was sent a month later. The Sri Lankan
embassy in London also tried to get the tape.

Russian pilot killed, seven injured in cargo plane crash in Angola
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A cargo plane crashed while trying to
land in eastern Angola, killing its Russian pilot and injuring
seven other people, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported
Wednesday.
	   The crash occurred Tuesday at Saurimo airport about 500 miles
(800 kilometers) east of the capital Luanda, Lusa said.
	   Survivors said the Russian-made Antonov-12 plane, belonging to
an unidentified Angolan company and carrying 14 tons of unspecified
cargo, dipped suddenly as it approached the runway, Lusa reported.
	   The pilot, identified as Victor Nikolevitch, lost control of the
aircraft when a tyre in the landing gear burst, the agency said.
	   No further details were immediately available.

	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ Six Air Force guards gently
loaded the flag-draped coffin of one American killed in the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi onto a military aircraft Wednesday
for the final leg of the journey home.
	   The body of Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds was
being flown to her native Florida via Andrews Air Base in Maryland
at the request of her family.
	   The remaining 10 bodies of American victims flown to Germany
this week will be accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to Andrews following a military ceremony early Thursday.
	   Seven wounded Americans also departed Ramstein Air Base for
Andrews on Wednesday.
	   Six will be taken to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington for treatment, and the seventh to the burn center at
Brooks Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.
	   Albright was scheduled to meet with the remaining wounded, one
American and 11 Kenyans, at the U.S. military hospital in nearby
Landstuhl immediately after arriving Wednesday evening.
	   A 12th Kenyan was being treated at the University Medical Center
in Homburg.

Mideast, African embassies tighten security after bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Embassy Bombings
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. diplomats who worked in outlying
buildings were moved into the fortified embassy compound in Cairo.
New checkpoints appeared around the American Embassy in Kuwait. At
least two U.S. diplomatic missions _ in Uganda and Sudan _
temporarily closed down.
	   The heightened security _ including some steps not made public _
followed last Friday's twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and a State Department
warning Tuesday that others were at risk.
	   Diplomats in several countries said that ambassadors in the
Middle East and Africa had held special staff meetings to review
security procedures, not at U.S. embassy buildings but also at
their residences.
	   In most cases, embassy officials declined to discuss specifics
of upgraded security activities _ for security reasons.
	   ``We don't think it's appropriate to disclose any security
arrangements, whether we have or have not taken them,'' said Bill
Blaine, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain.
	   Still, the Bahrain embassy updated its phone-in ``hot line''
service for Americans, urging them to stay vigilant in the wake of
the East African bombings.
	   On Tuesday, the State Department issued a statement in
Washington saying it had ``received information that there may be a
threat to U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen.''
	   It gave no reason for the warning, but said the threatened
actions ``could include attacks on buildings.''
	   The response in Egypt was ``to temporarily relocate some staff
from peripheral U.S. government facilities,'' a statement from the
embassy said.
	   Embassy spokesman David Ballard said this involved diplomats and
Egyptian employees who worked with the U.S. Agency for
International Development at a building several blocks away from
the U.S. Embassy.
	   Most were moved into the embassy compound, which is surrounded
by a high stone wall and guarded by U.S. Marines and Egyptian
security forces.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday paid
off and shut down a gas station adjacent to the embassy to prevent
it from being used by a would-be attacker.
	   In Kuwait, the embassy closed to the public on Sunday while
diplomats reviewed security procedures, said spokesman Claud Young.
	   Since then, new checkpoints jointly manned by Kuwaiti and
American security officers have around the embassy, which stands
alone on a large lot surrounded by a high wall and concrete
barriers.
	   Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy said Tuesday that
about half a dozen embassies had suspended operations after the
attacks in Kenya and Tanzania, but he declined to name them.
	   They appeared to include those in Sudan and Uganda.
	   In the Sudanese capital Khartoum, the gates of the U.S. Embassy
were chained and locked after the bombings, and no one has answered
telephone calls to embassy numbers this week. But uniformed
Sudanese police still stand watch outside.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Sudan in January 1996,
when Washington said it couldn't guarantee their security. They
periodically return to provide consular and other services.
	   The embassy in Kampala, Uganda, also has been closed since
Monday, and traffic was blocked from an adjacent road to ensure the
embassy's security, police said.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Swaziland was evacuated for several hours
Tuesday after a phoned bomb threat. Sniffer dogs searched the
embassy and a nearby building housing embassy offices and found
nothing, an American spokeswoman said.
	   As would be expected, security was especially tight in Tanzania
and Kenya.
	   At the temporary U.S. Embassy headquarters in a Nairobi suburb,
armed guards used mirrors and sniffer dogs to search all all cars
seeking to enter the compound.

Cambodian king offers to play conciliator: Sam Rainsy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk has offered to
help stave off a political crisis in Cambodia by serving as a
conciliator in informal talks between rival parties, opposition
politician Sam Rainsy said Wednesday.
	   ``The king offered to play a conciliatory role if asked to do so
by two or three of the major parties,'' Sam Rainsy said after a
two-hour meeting with Sihanouk at his residence in the northwestern
town of Siem Reap.
	   The king's proposal, which could not be independently confirmed,
comes as the country faces a political deadlock just two weeks
after holding parliamentary elections.
	   Co-Premier Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a
slight majority in the 122-seat National Assembly, but not the
two-thirds majority needed to form a government.
	   The two opposition parties have alleged rampant fraud in voting
and ballot-counting and have threatened to boycott the new National
Assembly session if their complaints are not properly investigated.
	   Meanwhile, Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the
Sam Rainsy Party _ which together won 58 parliamentary seats _ have
refused to even consider Hun Sen's invitation to join him in a
coalition government.
	   On Tuesday, the National Election Committee officially rejected
304 complaints of irregularities and fraud _ including voter
intimidation and improper counting procedures _ saying that ``no
ballot fraud as alleged by the parties'' was found.
	   The NEC said what minor irregularities it did note would be
corrected before the official election results are announced Aug.
29, but stressed that the changes will not affect the allocation of
seats.
	   Sam Rainsy said Sihanouk stated ``he would be prepared to
preside over a `Siem Reap Informal Meeting' if requested,'' as a
possible way to avoid a deadlock.
	   ``The king said it was advisable for the parties to have
dialogue,'' said Sam Rainsy, who proposed the idea.
	   Hun Sen welcomed the idea of an informal meeting. Several days
ago, he had warned that Cambodia could face a new political crisis
if the opposition parties tried to block the formation of a new
government.
	   ``Hun Sen would like to fully welcome the role of the king in an
informal meeting,'' said Om Yeng Tieng, an adviser to Hun Sen.
	   The polls came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual premiership
formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and foreign aid lost after
his takeover.

U.S. Embassy leases gas station to ward off threats

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy hastily paid off
and shut down a nextdoor gas station Wednesday to prevent any
attempts by terrorists to use it as a bombing base.
	   The embassy had been negotiating for some time to take over the
Shell station, said embassy spokesman James Warren.
	   ``The interest in negotiations has increased dramatically over
the past few days,'' he said, adding the lease agreement was
finalized Wednesday.
	   Most operations at the embassy closed Monday, after the State
Department ordered half a dozen missions to suspend operations
because of increased threats of terrorism.
	   It named U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen as
particularly threatened targets.
	   Heightened precautions have been taken at U.S. embassies
worldwide, particularly those without sufficient barriers against
roadside terrorist threats, following car-bomb explosions at U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania Friday.
	   The bombings killed at least 250 people and injured more than
5,000.
	   The Malaysian government assured embassy staff of their safety
and said the U.S. diplomatic compound had been placed under heavy
police guard to supplement its own security forces following last
week's attacks.
	   ``I think the U.S. Embassy in Malaysia will be safe, but we are
taking the necessary precautions,'' Deputy Home Minister Tajol
Rosli Ghazali was quoted as saying by the government news agency
Bernama.
	   While more than 120 police officers, many of them in plain
clothes, circled the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, gas station
attendants pumped gasoline out of the underground tanks into a
parked tanker. The unleaded gasoline was being stored for use by
embassy vehicles, said a contractor.
	   He said some 18,800 liters (5,000 gallons) had to be drained
from the tanks.
	   ``We're going to get all we can out tonight,'' said John Harvey,
the embassy facility manager.
	   Conical road blocks had been placed to close off the station
just outside the high embassy walls fortified by razor-tipped
barbed wire fencing atop them.
	   The State Department said Tuesday night it had received
information of threats to U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and
Yemen.
	   ``This could include attacks on buildings,'' the department said
in a statement.
	   Several police officers from a Malaysian combat unit, once used
against communist guerrillas, were posted outside the U.S. Embassy
on Wednesday in addition to the local police.
	   No group has been identified by the FBI or Kenyan and Tanzanian
investigators as responsible for Friday's bombings.
	   The embassy spokesman in Kuala Lumpur said there had been no
threats from Malaysians.
	   ``Our concerns are with an outside group that may come into
Malaysia. We're not worried about Malaysians. These threats are
coming from outside the country,'' said Warren.
	   The embassy was gripped by panic last year after death threats
to Americans in Malaysia during a time when Malaysian leaders were
blaming U.S. currency speculators for the Asian crisis and some
U.S. lawmakers were demanding Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
resignation over alleged anti-Jewish remarks.

Jordan trade minister to discuss trade barriers with Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordanian Trade Minister Hani Mulqi said
Wednesday that he would discuss Israeli barriers to Jordanian and
Palestinian trade in meetings in Israel.
	   Mulqi spoke with reporters before leaving at midday for talks
with Israeli Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
	   Jordanian exporters have complained of problems in getting their
goods to Israel, sometimes because of disputes over quality
standards. And, they say, Israel has been hampering Jordanian trade
with the Palestinians.
	   He complained that trade between Jordan and the Palestinians has
declined despite the kingdom's 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
	   Figures from the Jordanian Chamber of Commerce indicate that
two-way trade with the Palestinians totaled 34 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 48 million) in 1997. In the past five months, it was
just 9.3 million dinars (dlrs 13 million).
	   Mulqi said he also wanted to discuss Israeli imports via the
Jordanian port of Aqaba and Jordanian imports via Haifa, Israel.
	   Mulqi said that Jordanian imports via Haifa totaled just 15,000
tons since the peace treaty was signed.
	   He said the two sides also would discuss Jordan's request that
the required Israeli input into products manufactured in the
Qualified Industrial Zone in Irbid in northern Jordan be reduced to
8 percent from 11.5 percent.
	   Products manufactured in the jointly sponsored zone _ including
textiles, electrical goods and foodstuffs _ qualify for duty-free
access to the United States.

Palace calls new Diana book `complete fantasy'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a strongly worded statement, Buckingham Palace
on Wednesday dismissed a new book about Princess Diana's death as
fantasy and called it ``deeply hurtful'' to the royal family.
	   In ``The Day Diana Died,'' author Christopher Andersen alleges
that within an hour of hearing the princess had been killed in a
Paris car crash Aug. 31, Queen Elizabeth II inquired about whether
she had any royal jewels with her and whether they were safe.
	   The claim is ``completely inaccurate and without any foundation
whatsoever,'' said a palace spokeswoman, speaking with customary
anonymity.
	   The book, published this week in the United States, also said
the queen tried to stop Prince Charles from flying to France to
claim his ex-wife's body.
	   ``The allegations are deeply hurtful to the royal family
especially coming as they do near to the first anniversary of the
death of Diana, Princess of Wales,'' the spokeswoman said.
	   The claims are ``complete fantasy'' and the palace is ``treating
this book with the contempt it deserves,'' she said.
	   Andersen says the the book was based on interviews with palace
sources, hospital workers and staff at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.

Two Israeli soldiers wounded in south Lebanon attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas attacked an Israeli
patrol in southern Lebanon, wounding two soldiers, security
officials said Wednesday.
	   They said Israeli troops came under rocket and mortar shell fire
late Tuesday night when they were on patrol duty at the Sojod
outpost in an Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon.
	   Two soldiers were wounded and were airlifted by a helicopter to
Israel for treatment, the Lebanese officials said, speaking on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said two soldiers were ``lightly
wounded'' in the attack, which was claimed by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group.
	   Sojod, 22 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of the port city of
Sidon, is in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
occupied zone.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is used by Hezbollah as a
base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese
militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   On Monday, Hezbollah guerrillas killed an Israeli-allied
militiaman in a roadside bomb explosion in south Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

Philippine stocks fall sharply; index loses 4.8 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with peso closing higher, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks fell sharply
Wednesday, with the market's main index plunging at one point
nearly 8 percent to a six-year low before bargain hunting pulled
prices slightly higher toward the close.
	   The peso, meanwhile, strengthened against the U.S. dollar after
banks lowered their rates for the U.S. currency following a sharp
rally by the Japanese yen.
	   Manila's stock market was among the worst performing in the
region, although most Asian markets also posted losses.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index ended the day down
65.89 points, or 4.8 percent, at 1,307.30, surpassing the low of
1,325.245 it hit Jan. 20, 1993. The index fell as far as 1,263.82
during the session.
	   A number of blue chips set record lows. Real estate concern
Ayala Land Inc. fell 7.9 percent to 8.20 pesos, oil refiner Petron
Corp. dropped 6 percent to 2.20 pesos and Philippine National Bank
fell 12 percent to 32 pesos.
	   ``We got slaughtered today. There was massive hemorrhaging all
over the place,'' said Ian Kane, trader for Anscor-Hagedorn
Securities Inc.
	   Traders blamed overnight losses on Wall Street, continued
regional currency uncertainty and an increase in the Philippine
central bank's overnight rates for the steep losses.
	   In an effort to reduce pressure on the peso, the central bank
has raised overnight rates by 5 percentage points over the past two
days. Stock traders said they believe this will draw scarce funds
to fixed-income instruments and away from stocks.
	   Kane said the total picture remains gloomy, with Asian currency
markets bracing for further declines in the Japanese yen against
the dollar and the possible devaluation of the Chinese yuan. Such a
development may trigger a fresh round of currency depreciations in
the region, traders said.
	   U.S. funds were reportedly moving out of the market, and this
was reflected in heavy trading Wednesday, said Edwin Siao, trader
for institutional sales of Abacus Securities Corp.
	   Dealers expect a technical bounce somewhere between 1,180 and
1,250 points.
	   Siao said, however, that ``the bigger issue is the question of
how well the new government can perform to resolve domestic
problems. We heard from foreign fund managers that they are giving
President Joseph Estrada two months to show some signs that he can
put the Philippines on the road to recovery.''
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 43.393 pesos, down from
Tuesday's 43.968 pesos.
	   It was last traded at 43.150 pesos, near its lowest level for
the day of 43.100 pesos.
	   The Philippine Central Bank's higher overnight borrowing rate,
which was raised to 18 percent from 15 percent on Tuesday, also
helped strengthen the peso. The rate increase helped siphon off
funds that could have been used to speculate on the dollar.

Refugees still on run as Kosovo fighting flares up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with ethnic Albanians saying Serbs
launched attack on Junik, two Yugoslav soldiers killed, more
reports of heavy fighting.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed by heavy artillery, Serb
forces launched a fierce attack Wednesday against a major ethnic
Albanian stronghold, trapping thousands of civilians and militants.
	   The attack against the village of Junik, near the Albanian
border, came after a three-week Serb siege of one of the main bases
for Kosovo Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian sources reported.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has personally guaranteed
to European Union envoys that Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters
and as many civilians are believed to be trapped, would not be
attacked.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
appealed to the international community to help in forming a safe
corridor for the civilians trapped in Junik.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians remain on the run in Kosovo,
international aid officials warned Wednesday, as Serb forces battle
rebels for control of a region near the Albanian border.
	   Tens of thousands of people in Kosovo have been displaced in the
past two weeks alone, Amanda Williamson, spokeswoman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said in Geneva.
	   She said thousands of people in Kosovo may still be living in
the woods or hills after being forced from their homes by recent
clashes.
	   The ICRC has delivered more than 100 tons of aid to various
places in the last few days, but Williams warned that international
aid might not be enough.
	   ``We have a big crisis on our hands,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, Serb sources in Kosovo reported that heavy fighting
in the Decani area, close to the border with Albania, continued
overnight. The most intense clashes were said to be around the
village of Glodjane, another KLA stronghold.
	   Serbia's independent B-92 radio reported that several thousand
KLA fighters were putting up strong resistance to police attacks on
the village.
	   The radio said there are fears of many dead and wounded and
quoted both Serb and Albanian sources describing the latest
fighting near the Albanian border is the fiercest since the clashes
in Kosovo started in early March.
	   On Tuesday, Albanian sources reported that the Yugoslav army was
sending reinforcements to the area. Two Yugoslav soldiers were
killed in the fighting near the Albanian border Tuesday, the army
said Wednesday.
	   Williamson said that over the weekend, a Red Cross team
evacuated to Kosovska Mitrovica some 55 Albanians sheltering on a
dried-up river bed in woods in the north of the central Drenica
area. They included ill women, children and elderly people.
	   The latest figures from the U.N. refugee agency published
Tuesday put the total figure of those displaced by the fighting at
around 240,000.
	   World leaders are still deliberating on what to do to halt the
fighting if they can't bring the warring sides to a negotiating
table soon. In Brussels on Wednesday, NATO allies were fine-tuning
options for military action aimed at getting Serb forces to halt
their offensive against secessionists in the southern Serbian
province, populated mostly by ethnic Albanians.
	   At the United Nations on Tuesday, the Security Council
reiterated calls for a cease-fire. Three members _ Britain, France
and Slovenia _ pushed for action against Yugoslavia, and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the Yugoslavs'
``scorched-earth policy.''
	   But the council's statement broke no new ground, although it did
single out Milosevic's regime as using ``excessive force.''
	   In a report to the council, Annan said international agencies
had failed to make good on promises to monitor an arms embargo on
Kosovo.

Mideast, African embassies tighten security after bombings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Embassy Bombings &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. diplomats who worked in outlying
buildings were moved into the fortified embassy compound in Cairo.
New checkpoints appeared around the American Embassy in Kuwait. At
least two U.S. diplomatic missions _ in Uganda and Sudan _
temporarily closed.
	   The heightened security _ including some steps not made public _
followed last Friday's twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and a U.S. State
Department warning Tuesday that others were at risk.
	   Diplomats in several countries said ambassadors in the Middle
East and Africa held special staff meetings to review security
procedures, not only at U.S. embassy buildings but also at their
residences.
	   In most cases, embassy officials declined to discuss specifics
of upgraded security activities for security reasons.
	   ``We don't think it's appropriate to disclose any security
arrangements, whether we have or have not taken them,'' said Bill
Blaine, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain, where it updated
its phone-in ``hot line'' service for Americans, urging them to
stay vigilant.
	   On Tuesday, the State Department issued a statement in
Washington saying it ``received information that there may be a
threat to U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen.''
	   It gave no reason for the warning, but said the threatened
actions ``could include attacks on buildings.''
	   The response in Egypt was ``to temporarily relocate some staff
from peripheral U.S. government facilities,'' a statement from the
embassy said.
	   Embassy spokesman David Ballard said this involved diplomats and
Egyptian employees who worked with the U.S. Agency for
International Development at a building several blocks away from
the U.S. Embassy.
	   Most were moved into the embassy compound, surrounded by a high
stone wall and guarded by U.S. Marines and Egyptian security
forces.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the U.S. Embassy on Wednesday paid
off and shut down an adjacent gas station to prevent it from being
used by a would-be attacker.
	   In Kuwait, the embassy closed to the public on Sunday while
diplomats reviewed security procedures, said spokesman Claud Young.
	   Since then, new checkpoints jointly manned by Kuwaiti and
American security officers have been erected around the embassy,
which stands alone on a large lot surrounded by a high wall and
concrete barriers.
	   Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy said Tuesday that
about half a dozen embassies suspended operations, but he declined
to name them.
	   They appeared to include those in Sudan and Uganda.
	   In the Sudanese capital Khartoum, the gates of the U.S. Embassy
were chained and locked, and no one has answered telephone calls to
embassy numbers this week. But uniformed Sudanese police still
stand watch outside.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Sudan in January 1996,
when Washington said it couldn't guarantee their security. They
periodically return to provide consular and other services.
	   The embassy in Kampala, Uganda, also has been closed since
Monday, and traffic was blocked from an adjacent road to ensure the
embassy's security, police said.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Swaziland was evacuated for several hours
Tuesday after a phoned bomb threat. Sniffer dogs searched the
embassy and a nearby building housing embassy offices and found
nothing, an American spokeswoman said.
	   As would be expected, security was especially tight in Tanzania
and Kenya.
	   At the temporary U.S. Embassy headquarters in a Nairobi suburb,
armed guards used mirrors and sniffer dogs to search all all cars
seeking to enter the compound.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Three more Italian cyclists were
disqualified Wednesday from the Tour of Portugal for failing blood
tests, raising the number of riders expelled so far to seven.
	   Gilberto Simoni and Andrea Dolci, from the Cantina Tollo team,
and Massimo Apollonio, racing for Vini Caldirola, were expelled
just before they were to have set off on the third leg of the tour
from the southern Portuguese city of Faro, Portuguese radio TSF
reported.
	   Four Italians from the Mobilvetta team were kicked out of the
tour on Tuesday for the same reason.
	   With seven expulsions in the first three days of the race, the
Tour of Portugal looks set to be marred by the kind of doping
scandals that plagued last month's Tour de France.
	   All seven Italians disqualified were tested by a medical team
from the International Cycling Union. The ICU describes the blood
test as a safety measure rather than a doping control.
	   The cyclists failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was above 50 percent, considered a health risk.
	   There is no reliable way of detecting the use of EPO, a
synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying
red blood cells, although a high red blood cell count can indicate
its use.
	   Festina is among the 18 teams taking part in the 2,177-kilometer
(1,350-mile) Tour of Portugal that began in the southern Spanish
city of Seville on Monday and is due to finish in Lisbon on Aug.
23.
	   Festina was kicked out of the Tour de France after team
officials and some riders admitted using EPO. Six other teams later
withdrew from the tour, protesting police investigations.

Irish woman caught with drugs at Romanian border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Irish woman was detained by border
police as she tried to leave Romania with small quantities of drugs
in her handbag, police reported Wednesday.
	   Samantha Blanford Hutton, 30, was caught late Tuesday carrying
two grams (0.07 ounces) of cocaine in a plastic bag, one gram
(0.035 ounce) of marijuana and one cigarette containing hashish,
said police officer Mariana Alexandreanu.
	   She was due to to fly to London from Bucharest's Otopeni
airport.
	   Hutton said she bought the drugs for her personal use from a
foreigner in Bucharest.

Bigmat team questioned in Tour de France drug scandal probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Police on Wednesday were questioning members
of the Bigmat cycling team, after suspect medication was seized
during the recent scandal-plagued Tour de France.
	   Police sources, who requested anonymity, said the Bigmat
sporting director, doctor and masseur, were among a dozen members
of the team being questioned.
	   Customs police seized about 100 doses of medication from the
Bigmat team van during a routine check at Albertville in the French
Alps on July 28. The medication was sent off for analysis.
	   The Tour de France, the world's premier cycling event, was
marred by a rider revolt over an investigation _ which included
police raids _ into alleged widespread drug-taking by cyclists.
	   Only 14 of the original 21 teams ended the race. Six dropped out
and one team, Festina, was expelled after officials acknowledged
drug abuse. The pack was reduced to fewer than 100 riders from the
original 189.

Indonesian government seeks to calm nerves ahead of independence

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of security personnel
drilled in the center of the capital Wednesday and a senior Cabinet
minister urged Indonesians to disregard rumors that riots will
erupt on Aug. 17, the nation's independence day.
	   An estimated 15,000 soldiers, riot police and civil defense
officers trained in the parking lot of a Jakarta sports stadium.
	   Jakarta military chief Maj. Gen. Djadja Suparman has promised
that the armed forces will safeguard the city of 10 million, while
its governor, Sutiyoso, has urged residents to tighten personal
security ahead of the celebrations.
	   The city was shaken in May by riots that killed about 1,200
people and helped force President Suharto to resign after 32 years
of authoritarian rule. Economic hardship was the chief cause of the
unrest.
	   Feisal Tanjung, coordinating minister of politics and defense,
denied reports that rumors of fresh riots have prompted many
fearful members of the Chinese minority to flee Jakarta.
	   The shops and homes of Chinese, resented for their relative
wealth, were targeted during the May upheaval. There were
widespread reports that looters singled out Chinese women for rape.
	   ``Don't believe the rumors that riots will happen Aug. 17,''
Tanjung said. ``They're all distributed by irresponsible people.''
	   The retired army general urged the media not to circulate rumors
that could unnerve people.
	   His remarks were the latest in a series of guarantees from
government officials that Aug. 17, the 53rd anniversary of
Indonesia's independence from Dutch rule, will be peaceful. Many
people fear that any demonstrations staged on that day might
trigger rioting.
	   After Wednesday's training exercise, Suparman said 100 companies
of troops would be on hand in Jakarta to support the security
measures taken by police.
	   Despite the size of Wednesday's training exercise, Jakarta
police chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajoesman said the drill had not
been prompted by rumors.
	   ``This is just a routine security measure, especially prior to
national day,'' he said.
	   Fears of rioting are also rife among ethnic Chinese in the Java
Island cities of Semarang and Surabaya.
	   In Semarang, the capital of Central Java province, authorities
found graffiti on Chinese-owned homes and shops, allegedly marking
them as targets for attack.
	   Residents said they had been told that a painted triangle
identifies a building as a target for looters and a circle
symbolizes that women in a building are targets for rape.
	   Municipal workers, however, have scrubbed away the signs.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. diplomats who worked in outlying
buildings were moved into the fortified embassy compound in Cairo.
New checkpoints appeared around the American Embassy in Kuwait. At
least two U.S. diplomatic missions _ in Uganda and Sudan _
temporarily closed down.
	   The heightened security _ including some steps not made public _
followed last Friday's twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and a State Department
warning Tuesday that others were at risk.
	   Diplomats in several countries said that ambassadors in the
Middle East and Africa had held special staff meetings to review
security procedures, not only at U.S. embassy buildings but also at
their residences.

Refugees still on run as Kosovo fighting flares up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with ethnic Albanians saying Serbs launched
attack on Junik, two Yugoslav soldiers killed, more reports of
heavy fighting.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed by heavy artillery, Serb
forces launched a fierce attack Wednesday against a major ethnic
Albanian stronghold in separatist Kosovo province, trapping
thousands of civilians and militants.
	   The attack against the village of Junik, near the Albanian
border, came after a three-week Serb siege of one of the main bases
for the militant Kosovo Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian sources
reported.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has personally guaranteed
to European Union envoys that Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters
and as many civilians are believed to be trapped, would not be
attacked.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
appealed to the international community to help in forming a safe
corridor for the civilians trapped in Junik.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians remain on the run in the southern
Serbian province of Kosovo, international aid officials warned
Wednesday, as Serb forces battle rebels for control of a region
near the Albanian border.
	   Tens of thousands of people in Kosovo have been displaced in the
past two weeks alone, Amanda Williamson, spokeswoman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said in Geneva.
	   She said thousands of people in Kosovo may still be living in
the woods or hills after being forced from their homes by recent
clashes.
	   The ICRC has delivered more than 100 tons of aid to various
places in the last few days, but Williams warned that international
aid might not be enough.
	   ``We have a big crisis on our hands,'' she said.
	   Meanwhile, Serb sources in Kosovo reported that heavy fighting
in the Decani area, close to the border with Albania, continued
overnight. The most intense clashes were said to be around the
village of Glodjane, another KLA stronghold.
	   Serbia's independent B-92 radio reported that several thousand
KLA fighters were putting up strong resistance to police attacks on
the village.
	   The radio said there are fears of many dead and wounded and
quoted both Serb and Albanian sources describing the latest
fighting near the Albanian border is the fiercest since the clashes
in Kosovo started in early March.
	   On Tuesday, Albanian sources reported that the Yugoslav army was
sending reinforcements to the area. Two Yugoslav soldiers were
killed in the fighting near the Albanian border Tuesday, the army
said Wednesday.
	   Williamson said over the weekend, a Red Cross team evacuated to
Kosovska Mitrovica some 55 Albanians sheltering on a dried-up river
bed in woods in the north of the central Drenica area. They
included ill women, children and elderly people.
	   The latest figures from the U.N. refugee agency published
Tuesday put the total figure of those displaced by the fighting at
around 240,000.
	   World leaders are still deliberating on what to do to halt the
fighting if they can't bring the warring sides to a negotiating
table soon. In Brussels on Wednesday, NATO allies were fine-tuning
options for military action aimed at getting Serb forces to halt
their offensive in the province, populated mostly by ethnic
Albanians.
	   At the United Nations on Tuesday, the Security Council
reiterated calls for a cease-fire. Three members _ Britain, France
and Slovenia _ pushed for action against Yugoslavia, and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the Yugoslavs'
``scorched-earth policy.''
	   But the council's statement broke no new ground, although it did
single out Milosevic's regime as using ``excessive force.''
	   In a report to the council, Annan said international agencies
failed to make good on promises to monitor an arms embargo on
Kosovo.

Palace calls new Diana book `complete fantasy'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New graf 5 UPDATES with queen suggested royal plane to bring
back Diana's body &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In a strongly worded statement, Buckingham Palace
on Wednesday dismissed a new book about Princess Diana's death as
fantasy and called it ``deeply hurtful'' to the royal family.
	   In ``The Day Diana Died,'' author Christopher Andersen alleges
that within an hour of hearing the princess had been killed in a
Paris car crash Aug. 31, Queen Elizabeth II inquired about whether
she had any royal jewels with her and whether they were safe.
	   The claim is ``completely inaccurate and without any foundation
whatsoever,'' said a palace spokeswoman, speaking with customary
anonymity.
	   The book, published this week in the United States, also said
the queen tried to stop Prince Charles from flying to France to
claim his ex-wife's body.
	   On the contrary, the spokeswoman said, the queen suggested her
son use a Royal Squadron aircraft, as befitting the task of
bringing the princess's body back to Britain.
	   ``The allegations are deeply hurtful to the royal family
especially coming as they do near to the first anniversary of the
death of Diana, Princess of Wales,'' the spokeswoman said.
	   The claims are ``complete fantasy'' and the palace is ``treating
this book with the contempt it deserves,'' she said.
	   Andersen says the the book was based on interviews with palace
sources, hospital workers and staff at the Ritz Hotel in Paris.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ An Australian man who was among 14
foreigners arrested in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in
Tanzania has been released, Australian officials said Wednesday.
	   Muhamed Hassan Qassim, a Somali-born Australian citizen, has
been freed by Tanzanian authorities, said a Department of Foreign
Affairs and Trade spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The department can confirm he has been released,'' the
spokesman said.
	   Qassim, believed to come from Sydney, had just arrived in
Tanzania with his wife and five children to take up a position with
the United Nations High Commission for Refugees when he was
arrested by authorities investigating the blast.
	   ``They've been checking identities and papers and he was caught
up in that,'' the spokesman said.
	   UNHCR spokesman Paul Stromberg said Qassim was arrested for not
carrying his passport in a security sweep following the blast.
	   Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said the Australian man was
not a suspect in the blast.
	   ``To the best of my knowledge this Australian has been detained
because he didn't have on his person a passport when he was
stopped,'' Downer said.
	   ``He does somewhere have an Australian passport but he didn't
happen to have the passport on his person at the time he was
questioned.
	   ``I understand in Tanzania a lot of people have been stopped and
asked questions by authorities, but there isn't any indication that
he had in any way any involvement whatsoever in the bombings that
took place.''
	   The Tanzanian embassy bombing killed 10 people and injured 70,
while a simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya killed at
least 224 people and injured 5,000.
	   The other foreigners arrested in Tanzania over the bombing
include six Iraqis, six Sudanese and a Turkish citizen.

Police, demonstrators in stand-off in Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Police surrounded opposition protesters
outside the royal palace Wednesday and were locked in a stand-off
with the demonstrators, who refused to disperse.
	   People have been gathering outside the palace of King Letsie III
since early last week, denouncing last May's elections in this tiny
African kingdom as rigged.
	   Army chief Lt. Col. Makhula Motakeng broadcast on order on the
radio Tuesday evening for the several hundred protesters to leave.
The army moved in during the morning after they refused.
	   Bareng Sekhonyana, a spokesman for the opposition Basotho
National Party, said there were a number of issues that needed to
be resolved before the protesters would disperse.
	   These included represenation by opposition party members on the
the Independent Electoral Commission panel which is to recount the
votes of the general election.
	   The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy took 79 of the 80
seats in the National Assembly.
	   The opposition parties also wanted protection for protesters
against what he said were ruling party ``gangs'' assaulting them,
Sekhonyana said.
	   He said these issues had been raised in discussions with the
army chief and opposition parties were awaiting his response.
	   ``The protesters are orderly and they are not causing any damage
to the shops in the area,'' he said. ``We are just singing and
praying, causing harm to no one.''
	   This impoverished, mountainous nation of 2 million is entirely
surrounded by South Africa.

Search for survivors of Nairobi bombing ends

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers at the site of the U.S. Embassy
bombing in Nairobi declared the search for survivors over
Wednesday, hours after retrieving the body of Rose, a Kenyan whose
cries for help inspired their work.
	   With the end of the search _ and the retrieval of Rose's body _
spirits sank. ``Everybody was Rose, everybody they could have
pulled out alive,'' said Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow.
	   Rose Wanjiku was found at 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) when weary soldiers
finally peeled back the last layers of wreckage that had trapped
her near an elevator, said Israeli Col. Udi Benuri, rescue
spokesman.
	   Five days after the explosion Friday, Benuri declared the search
for survivors over at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT).
	   No one had been brought out alive since Saturday, the day after
nearly simultaneous terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam,
a Tanzanian port, killed more than 250 people and injured some
5,000.
	   Benuri said Wanjiku had died less than 24 hours before rescuers
got to her. She last spoke Sunday, but her persistent tapping
Monday spurred rescuers.
	   Reaching Wanjiku was extremely difficult because of the weight
of material blocking her and the danger of shifting material,
Benuri said. She was one of more than 240 people killed in Kenya,
including 12 Americans.
	   As backhoes gnawed on the last of the rubble, the FBI removed
what could be a vital piece of evidence: a vehicle plastered
against the Nairobi embassy wall by the force of the blast.
	   A bulldozer pried it off and hauled it across the street, to a
parking lot the FBI has turned into a crime lab for bomb-blasted
vehicles.
	   FBI agents scurried behind the bulldozer scooping up the bits of
debris-turned-evidence that tumbled from the shredded wreckage.
	   ``I think they've moved most of the potential evidence across
the road,'' said Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British
Army in Kenya, who has been helping U.S. officials.
	   Jones, a demolition expert who has investigated Irish Republican
Army bombings in Northern Ireland, said the bomb left a
4-meter-diameter (13-foot-diameter) crater.
	   All that remained of the four-story Ufundi Cooperative building,
which bore the brunt of the explosion aimed at the American mission
next door, was churned up dirt littered with tattered clothes,
stained papers, shattered glass and tangled wire.
	   Worn out by their ordeal, exhausted Kenyan, Israeli and French
soldiers sprawled on the ground, some of them sleeping.
	   ``It's sad we didn't save more people,'' said Sgt. Doron Caspi,
a member of the Israeli team. ``Unfortunately, it was only
bodies.''
	   Investigators suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in
the attacks, but no link has been found to any particular group, a
senior U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the FBI arrested 14 people,
including six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali-born Australian and a
Turk.
	   Tanzania's ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi,
said some of those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack
that killed 10 Africans. He said they had been turned over to the
FBI for interrogation.
	   In Dar es Salaam, a dozen FBI agents raked Laibon Road outside
the wrecked embassy, searching debris for clues. The FBI said more
than 175 agents are either in or heading to the two East African
nations.
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents used cotton balls to swab fences, walls
and metal fragments at the bomb site to capture traces of
explosives.
	   The Kenyan Television Network on Tuesday night quoted a source
as saying an engine block had been found in the crater.
	   In Washington, the United States said it has temporarily closed
about half a dozen embassies because of increased threats of
terrorism. Among them were the U.S. stations in Egypt, Malaysia and
Yemen.

18 dead as bus plunges down ravine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more deaths, details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ At least 18 people were killed and
19 seriously injured when a bus packed with passengers plunged down
a steep ravine in Montenegro Wednesday.
	   The accident occurred on the main Belgrade-Podgorica road when
the bus hit a rock on the edge of the road and slid down a 30-meter
(100-foot) deep ravine in the Moraca River Canyon.
	   Yugoslav army helicopters were engaged in transporting the
wounded to a hospital in Podgorica from the accident site some 15
kilometers (9 miles) north of the Montenegrin capital.
	   Dr. Ivo Djurisic, the director of the hospital, said all the 18
dead, including seven women and a child, are Yugoslavs. Out of the
19 injured, three were fighting for their life, he said.
	   A public appeal for blood was launched by the health
authorities.
	   The narrow and often slippery stretch of road that winds down
the Moraca River Canyon where the accident occurred is infamous for
tragic accidents.
	   A TV footage showed rescuers trying to pull people out of the
bus wreckage that turned into a bundle of metal.
	   ``It is a miracle that anyone managed to stay alive in this
horrendous accident,'' Dr. Djurisic said.

Suharto's son-in-law admits wrongdoing in kidnapping case,
</HEADLINE>
investigator says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A general who is the son-in-law of
former President Suharto has admitted wrongdoing in the kidnapping
of dozens of political activists, a military investigator said
Wednesday.
	   It remains unclear, however, whether Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto
gave the order to troops under his command to abduct opponents of
Suharto, 14 of whom remain missing.
	   A military panel is investigating Prabowo, once a fast-rising
star in the military whose career was sidelined by the sudden
downfall in May of his autocratic father-in-law.
	   Investigators have arrested 10 members of Indonesia's special
forces, alleging they were involved in the kidnapping of more than
two dozen activists in 1997 and earlier this year.
	   Those that have been released said they were abducted, tortured
and questioned about their political activities. Prabowo was in
charge of the special forces at the time.
	   In testimony this week, Prabowo repeated an earlier pledge to
take responsibility for the kidnappings if his troops were found
guilty, said army chief of staff Gen. Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, who
heads the tribunal.
	   ``Prabowo has admitted wrongdoing, and will take
responsibility,'' Subagyo said.
	   Without elaborating, Subagyo said that Prabowo admitted that he
``wrongly analyzed'' a military procedure in which troops of one
unit are shifted temporarily to the command of another.
	   Subagyo did not say whether the troops accused of kidnapping
were under Prabowo's command at the time.
	   Prabowo has been suspended from duty pending the investigation
by the tribunal of seven generals. Human rights activists have
accused top military brass of ordering the abductions.
	   Suharto resigned amid riots and student protests in May. Shortly
thereafter, Prabowo was transferred from his powerful command to
head a military college.
	   Under reform-minded President B.J. Habibie, the military has
pledged to pursue those implicated in human rights abuses.
	   A separate government team investigating the May riots is also
expected to question Prabowo about allegations of military
involvement in the violence, in which 1,200 people were killed and
thousands of buildings were looted, damaged or burned.

Sumitomo to pay dlrs 99 million in rogue copper trading case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Corp. said Wednesday it has agreed to pay
plaintiffs of six class action lawsuits in New York dlrs 99 million
for losses racked up by a rogue copper trader.
	   In the out-of-court settlement, however, the Japanese trading
house refused to admit any wrongdoing or liability for the losses.
	   Yasuo Hamanaka, a former Sumitomo star trader who has been
convicted of fraud and forgery by a Japanese court, caused dlrs 2.6
billion in losses in unauthorized copper trading over a decade.
	   The losses, which surfaced about two years ago, upset copper
markets and tarnished the image of Japanese management.
	   The settlement of the New York lawsuits, filed by copper futures
and options traders, is subject to approval by U.S. Federal Court,
which is expected to take several months, Sumitomo said.
	   Traders have said Hamanaka's activities kept the price of copper
high on the New York and London futures markets in 1995-1996.
	   In May, Sumitomo agreed to pay dlrs 125 million to U.S.
regulators and 5 million pounds (dlrs 8 million) to British
regulators in fines.
	   It paid an additional dlrs 25 million to the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission to be set aside for claims by private
parties in the United States.
	   The fund will cover dlrs 18 million of Wednesday's dlrs 99
million settlement, and the remaining dlrs 81 million (11.4 billion
yen) will be posted as a special loss for the six months ending in
September, Sumitomo said.
	   The company will ``continue to take appropriate action'' to
resolve remaining lawsuits, it said. A California class action
lawsuit representing copper buyers is still pending.
	   Japanese prosecutors said Hamanaka, 50, forged the signatures of
his bosses four times to keep his off-the-books trading secret.
	   Starting in 1985, Hamanaka and his boss at the time, Saburo
Shimizu, allegedly made high-risk bets on the future direction of
copper prices on the London copper market.
	   In April, Hamanaka was sentenced in a Tokyo court to eight years
in prison. He has appealed. Sumitomo has filed a separate civil
lawsuit against Hamanaka.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A cargo plane crashed while trying to
land in eastern Angola, killing its Russian pilot and injuring
seven other people, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported
Wednesday.
	   The crash occurred Tuesday at Saurimo airport about 500 miles
(800 kilometers) east of the capital Luanda, Lusa said.
	   Survivors said the Russian-made Antonov plane dipped suddenly as
it approached the runway and that the pilot, identified as Victor
Nikolevitch, lost control when a tyre in the landing gear burst,
Lusa reported.
	   The plane belonged to the Angolan airline Allada and was
carrying 14 tons of equipment for use in the Katoka diamond mine,
the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass reported from Moscow.
	   Katoka is being developed by the Russian company ALROSA in
cooperation with Angolan, Brazilian and Israeli companies,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   A Russian flight engineer, two Angolan journalists and two local
policemen were among the injured, according to the agency, which
quoted Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations.
	   No further details were immediately available.

South Korea bans former World Cup coach from domestic soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Cha Bum-kun, former head coach of
South Korea's 1998 World Cup team, will be banned from the domestic
soccer league for five years on charges of defaming the league,
officials said Wednesday.
	   The penalty by the Korea Football Association goes into effect
early next month, when its executive committee will meet to approve
Wednesday's decision by a disciplinary board, association officials
said.
	   In an interview published last month, Cha, 45, alleged
widespread rigging in South Korea's professional league matches. He
did not give details.
	   The association denied Cha's allegation and accused him of
spreading false rumors to gain revenge for his humiliating
dismissal as World Cup head coach.
	   Cha lost his job in the middle of this summer's World Cup finals
in France after a dismal 5-0 loss to the Netherlands. He now is
coach of the Pingan team in Shenzhen, a Chinese industrial city
near the border with Hong Kong.
	   In a letter delivered to the association Tuesday, Cha defended
his claim but ``apologized for the way he raised that issue,'' the
officials said.
	   Cha was the most famous and successful striker in the history of
South Korean soccer. He spent 10 years in Germany with Bayer
Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfort between 1979 and 1989, winning
the UEFA Cup with both teams.
	   After South Korea's 3-1 loss to Mexico and 5-0 defeat by the
Netherlands in the World Cup finals, however, Cha was heavily
criticized. He was accused of mismanagement of the national team
and an unwise selection for his starting lineup.
	   After Cha was fired, South Korea managed a 1-1 draw in its last
first-round match against Belgium.
	   South Korea has appeared in the World Cup finals five times but
never won a game.
	   South Korea and Japan will be co-hosts for the 2002 Cup finals.

Soccer star to visit Angola as part of anti-land mines campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French soccer star David Ginola will make his debut
in the campaign against land mines in Angola later this month, the
French office of the Red Cross said Wednesday.
	   Ginola, a French international who plays for England's Tottenham
Hotspur and is a part-time model, announced in July that he had
agreed to be the public face of the campaign on behalf of the
International Committee for the Red Cross.
	   Angola and Cambodia are the countries thought to have the
largest share of the world's estimated 60 million land mines.
	   Ginola has said he will try to match the dedication shown by
Britain's Princess Diana, who helped give the anti-mine crusade
huge worldwide publicity.
	   ``I have decided to go out into the field, to the countries most
affected by land mines, in order to better understand the situation
and give my support to the victims,'' Ginola was quoted as saying
in a statement.
	   The date of Ginola's trip to Angola was not released.

U.S. cites Taiwan for intellectual piracy

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Officials said Wednesday it was a pity
Washington had put Taiwan on a watch list for intellectual property
rights violations because the island had done more than others to
fight piracy.
	   The Clinton administration repeatedly has singled out Taiwan
under a section of trade law governing copyrights and patents.
	   In its annual review of U.S. trade partners in April, it
indicated it was not satisfied with Taiwan's efforts to protect
U.S. films, books and computer software from piracy. On Tuesday in
Washington, the United States formally put Taiwan on the watch
list.
	   Under a process outlined in the law, the Clinton administration
could impose retaliatory trade penalties if Taiwan failed to
protect U.S. intellectual property rights.
	   Vice Minister of Economic Affairs Lin I-fu told reporters that
Taiwan ``deeply regretted'' the decision, and that his government
had done more than any other country on the watch list to combat
piracy.
	   Chiang Ping-kun, chairman of the government's economic planning
council, was quoted by the official Central News Agency as saying
that the United States also gave Taiwan time to improve.
	   ``We can explain our side to the U.S. businessmen within this
time,'' it quoted Chiang as saying.
	   Steve Chen Ruey-long, director general of the government's Board
of Foreign Trade, said the standards set by the United States
``were too high.'' He was also quoted by the agency as saying that
Taiwan's foreign trade ``would not necessarily be affected.''
	   According to official U.S. trade statistics, Taiwanese exports
account for the second-largest amount of counterfeit goods seized
by U.S. customs officials.
	   Taiwan has responded with public awareness campaigns and police
crackdowns that have forced the trade underground. But it is far
from being snuffed out.
	   Hidden under a bridge in downtown Taipei, high school boys and
computer enthusiasts browsed Wednesday through displays of computer
equipment, CDs, CD-ROMs and video games.
	   Video CDs of Disney's ``Little Mermaid'' and ``Lion King'' sell
for less than 350 Taiwan dollars (dlrs 10), while ``Vantage
Master'' and ``Dark Earth'' video games go for about 250 Taiwan
dollars (dlrs 7).
	   In one shop, a 10-disc set of Hollywood films cost 400 Taiwan
dollars (dlrs 11), and Windows 98 CD-ROMs cost 100 Taiwan dollars
(dlrs 2.80) each. The owner refused to give his name, but claimed
that the discs were made legally in Taiwan under license.
	   In addition, Taiwan Television showed goods allegedly pirated
from U.S. brands, including pregnancy tests and painkillers.
	   The Clinton administration has indicated it would like to see
legal changes to make it easier for U.S. companies to sue in local
courts for copyright and patent infringement.
	   At present, senior corporate officials must sign off on all
paperwork before a lawsuit can proceed, a process that can take
months. Meanwhile, violations continue.

Israeli wins major science prize for work on grioundwater
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ When Gedeon Dagan decided he wanted to
leave communist Romania for Israel, he took the underground route _
by becoming an expert in underground water.
	   His expertise now has paid off with winning this year's
Stockholm Water Prize, a top scientific award. The dlrs 150,000
prize is to be presented Thursday.
	   Dagan, of Tel Aviv University, won the prize for his work in
applying probability theory to analyzing groundwater pollution. The
work is of particular value to Israel, where water availability is
a potentially explosive issue with the Palestinians.
	   ``By providing rational tools, we can inject some kind of
lucidity and rationality into the peace process,'' Dagan said in an
interview.
	   ``It's much easier for scientists and specialists to get some
kind of positive dialogue than politicians apparently can do,'' he
said.
	   Dagan said that as a teen-ager, he had decided that he wanted to
leave Romania for Israel and that he chose his field of study
largely because he knew that water engineering was a key issue for
Israel. He emigrated in 1962.
	   The issue has become more serious for the country since then, he
said.
	   ``Our situation is quite difficult. We utilize our resources to
the limit,'' Dagan said. ``If you overexploit, it's like you create
an overdraft in your bank account ... if you do it for a prolonged
period, you go bankrupt.''
	   Assessing how groundwater flows, and how pollutants seep into it
from the surface, is difficult because the subsurface in many areas
is a bewilderingly complex mixture of soils and rock strata.
	   Digging wells to monitor the groundwater is prohibitively
expensive and because such wells assess only a small area, they may
not detect pollution encroaching from a very short distance away,
Dagan said.
	   Depending on conditions, some groundwater flows only ''tens of
meters a year,'' he said. Pollutants, such as fertilizers, can seep
at a similarly slow pace and water that is drinkable one year may
be polluted a year later.
	   By applying probability theory, analysts can take a small core
sample of a given area's subsurface, then extrapolate with
reasonable certainty how water and pollutants will move through it,
Dagan said.
	   The prize is presented in connection with the annual Stockholm
Water Symposium.

Indonesia to free more political prisoners to mark independence
</HEADLINE>
day &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's government plans to mark
53 years of independence next week by releasing as many as 100
political prisoners, including some imprisoned over an alleged
abortive communist coup in 1965, a news report said Wednesday.
	   The newspaper Jakarta Post quoted Justice Minister Muladi as
saying many aging prisoners would be released on ``humanitarian
grounds'' Monday.
	   ``The number will be around 75 or 100, but the final number is
still being processed,'' Muladi said in the central Javanese city
of Yogyakarta.
	   ``Most of them are over 70 years old or have served jail
sentences of more than 30 years.''
	   Indonesia's government traditionally releases some prisoners and
cuts the terms of others to mark the 1945 proclamation of
independence from Dutch colonial rule and Japanese occupation at
the end of World War II.
	   The planned release will be the fourth ordered by President B.J.
Habibie, who has promised greater democracy since succeeding
autocratic former President Suharto in May.
	   So far, Habibie has released 73 political prisoners.
	   About another 130, including those to be freed Monday, remain
behind bars.
	   Indonesia's communist party was crushed by the Indonesian
military after party members were accused of trying to stage a
coup.
	   Suharto, then an army general, took a leading role in purging
the communists and took control of the country in 1966.
	   Until now, Habibie's government has maintained that imprisoned
communists would not be released.
	   It has also said that Xanana Gusmao, the commander of rebel
guerrillas in the disputed territory of East Timor, would not be
freed until a peace settlement had been reached over the disputed
territory.
	   The United Nations is sponsoring negotiations between Indonesia
and Portugal, East Timor's former colonial master.

Roma coach questioned by prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ The coach of AS Roma, who has shaken up the
Italian soccer world, was questioned by a prosecutor Wednesday
about his allegations that some top players may use
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Zdenek Zemen walked past reporters without commenting following
a 2 1/2-hour session with prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello.
	   Following questioning Tuesday by Italian Olympic Committee
officials, Zemen stood his ground, insisting a series of published
remarks he made were for the good of soccer on an ``ethical
issue.''
	   He underlined, however, he never spoke specifically of drugs but
of ``medicines'' and that he did not have specific names of
medicines in mind.
	   He had particularly drawn the ire of officials of soccer dynasty
Juventus by expressing his ``amazement'' at the quick muscular
development of current star Alessandro Del Piero and former star
Gianluca Vialli, now player-coach of English club Chelsea.
	   The head of Juventus' medical team, Riccardo Agricola, denied
administering steriods or other banned substances to his players
and said he doubted other teams used them.
	   ``Healthy people practice sports and healthy people don't need
to take medicines,'' Zemen said Tuesday.
	   After the Turin session, Zemen rejoined his club in pre-season
training in the Alps north of Venice.

Concert for neo Nazi bands canceled
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Members of a neo-Nazi organization vowed
to find another venue for a massive concert this weekend, after
authorities in the village of Moenchhof banned the music festival.
	   Alexander Behrend, a member of the extreme rightist ``New Youth
Offensive'' told the Austria Press Agency Wednesday that the group
was determined to find another place to hold the concert. He
declined further comment.
	   Herbert Gross, the mayor of Moenchhof, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southeast of Vienna, canceled the concert shortly after the group
registered it with municipal authorities Tuesday.
	   The planned concert was to bring together some of the ``biggest
names in neo-Nazi music from Germany,'' such as Joerg Haehnl and
the Schlachthaus and Sturmtrupp bands.
	   Numerous neo-Nazis from Germany were expected to join their
Austrian counterparts at the concert.
	   Austrian law forbids any neo-Nazi activity or the display of any
Nazi symbols.

Louise Woodward to tell TV execs about televised trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Louise Woodward, the former au pair who was
convicted of manslaughter in the 1997 death of a baby in
Massachusetts, will speak to a gathering of TV executives about her
experience of a televised trial.
	   Ms. Woodward will address the Edinburgh International Television
Festival on Aug. 31. Her lawyer, Barry Scheck, will also speak.
	   Ms. Woodward, 20, returned to Britain in June after
Massachusetts' highest court upheld a manslaughter conviction in
the death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen and sentence of 279 days
she had already served after her February 1997 arrest.
	   The conference organizers said Ms. Woodward would not be paid
for speaking and won't be addressing the question of her guilt or
innocence or specifics of the case.
	   ``In a sense, it's an irrelevance. We have gone past that and
Louise isn't there to be put on trial by the media,'' said festival
advisory chair Ruth Pitt, Granada's head of documentaries. The
media, she said, are ``being put on trial by the session.''

Cambodian king offers to play conciliator: Sam Rainsy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from FUNCINPEC in grafs 11-13; minor editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk has offered to
help stave off a political crisis in Cambodia by serving as a
conciliator in informal talks between rival parties, opposition
politician Sam Rainsy said Wednesday.
	   ``The king offered to play a conciliatory role if asked to do so
by two or three of the major parties,'' Sam Rainsy said after a
two-hour meeting with Sihanouk at his residence in the northwestern
town of Siem Reap.
	   The king's proposal, which could not be independently confirmed,
comes as the country faces a political deadlock just two weeks
after holding parliamentary elections.
	   Co-Premier Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party won a
slight majority in the 122-seat National Assembly, but not the
two-thirds majority needed to form a government.
	   The two opposition parties have alleged rampant fraud in voting
and ballot-counting and have threatened to boycott the new National
Assembly session if their complaints are not properly investigated.
	   Meanwhile, Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the
Sam Rainsy Party _ which together won 58 parliamentary seats _ have
refused to even consider Hun Sen's invitation to join him in a
coalition government.
	   On Tuesday, the National Election Committee officially rejected
304 complaints of irregularities and fraud _ including voter
intimidation and improper counting procedures _ saying that ``no
ballot fraud as alleged by the parties'' was found.
	   The NEC said what minor irregularities it did note would be
corrected before the official election results are announced Aug.
29, but stressed that the changes will not affect the allocation of
seats.
	   Hun Sen welcomed the idea of an informal meeting. Several days
ago, he had warned that Cambodia could face a new political crisis
if the opposition parties tried to block the formation of a new
government.
	   ``Hun Sen would like to fully welcome the role of the king in an
informal meeting,'' said Om Yeng Tieng, an adviser to Hun Sen.
	   The 43 FUNCINPEC members who won National Assembly seats met for
three hours Wednesday evening but did not discuss the proposal for
informal talks.
	   Member of Parliament Ahmad Yahya said FUNCINPEC members at the
meeting agreed only to ``stand firm'' on their decision to reject
Hun Sen's offer to form a coalition government until irregularities
in the polling and counting process are investigated.
	   Ahmad Yahya said FUNCINPEC will appeal to the Constitutional
Council over the election committee's decision to reject the 304
election complaints.
	   The polls came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual premiership
formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and foreign aid lost after
his takeover.

Russia will not import grain, despite drought
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will not import foreign grain this year,
despite a severe summer drought that has damaged one-third of its
crop, officials said Wednesday.
	   Grain yields in 1998 are estimated to total between 62 million
metric tons (68 short tons) and 67 million metric tons (74 short
tons), Food and Agriculture Minister Viktor Semyonov said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   The estimate was a further downward revision from the 70 million
metric tons (77 million short tons) predicted just two weeks ago.
	   ``The situation is very serious indeed, but we must state that
this year's projected harvest and the 20-million-(metric)-ton
remainder from last year will enable Russia to secure a sufficient
grain balance so as not to make emergency grain purchases abroad,''
Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov was quoted as saying.
	   One-third of Russia's crops have suffered from the drought,
Semyonov said. Crops have been damaged on more than 40,000 hectares
(98,800 acres) and completely ruined on 12,000 hectares (30,000
acres).
	   Nemtsov, a deputy premier, has signed an order to allocate 141
million rubles (dlrs 22.7 million) from the federal budget as
relief to farms hurt by the drought.

Taliban claims another victory in north
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Russian charges Pakistan helping Taliban in grafs 11-12.

 &UR; By ZAHEERUDDIN ABDULLAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The Taliban claimed another victory in
the opposition-based north Wednesday in their goal of putting all
of Afghanistan under their rigid version of Islamic law.
	   Taliban spokesman Abdul Hay Muttayn said Pul-e-Kumri, about 175
kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital Kabul, fell with little
resistance, and the opposition retreated south toward the central
province of Bamiyan, one of its last remaining strongholds. Muttayn
had few details, and his claim could not be independently
confirmed.
	   Muttayn said Taliban troops were continuing their march north.
The Taliban Foreign Ministry vowed last week to pursue a military
solution to Afghanistan's civil war and establish ``100 percent
Islamic law.''
	   Anti-Taliban coalition member Syed Jaffer Naderi had his
headquarters at Pul-e-Kumri, which would be the fourth strategic
town or city to fall to the Taliban in the last week and a half. A
major prize came Saturday, when Taliban troops captured
Mazar-e-Sharif, the biggest city in the north.
	   The Taliban, whose name means ``students of Islam,'' emerged in
southern Afghanistan in 1994, surprising many with the speed at
which they captured most of the country, including Kabul. Under its
strict interpretation of Islamic law, girls are barred from school,
most women are confined to their homes, and music, movies and
television are banned.
	   The Taliban has pledged to bring peace to a country that has
been in conflict since a series of military and communist coups in
the 1960s.
	   Afghanistan borders three former Soviet republics: Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Tajik officials have said that in some
areas the Taliban have advanced to within 20 to 40 kilometers (12
to 25 miles) of the Tajik border.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry said Tuesday that Taliban advances
posed ``a real threat'' to the coalition of former Soviet
republics, the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia is ready
to fortify the southern borders of former Soviet republics in
Central Asia to guard against any spillover of the turmoil, the
ministry said.
	   Russia fears the entrenchment of a radical Islamic state in
Afghanistan would bring an influx of refugees and weapons into the
former Soviet republics of Central Asia.
	   Valery Nesterushkin, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, also
accused the Pakistani military of helping the Taliban advance in
northern Afghanistan.
	   ``There is hard evidence to support this, including the capture
of Pakistani prisoners by forces in northern Afghanistan,''
Nesterushkin said. There had been no independent confirmation of
the anti-Taliban alliance's claims that it had Pakistani troops
fighting alongside the Taliban.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to be the force behind the
fundamentalist movement, but both Pakistan and the Taliban have
denied such accusations. The Taliban have also said their campaign
is no threat to neighboring countries.
	   On Wednesday, Iranian police surrounded the Pakistani Embassy in
Tehran after scores of protesters tried to force their way into the
compound to demand the release of Iranians allegedly captured in
Afghanistan.
	   Iran, which is suspected of supporting the anti-Taliban
coalition, claims that 11 of its diplomats, a correspondent of the
state-run Islamic Republic News Agency and 32 Iranian drivers were
captured by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan.
	   Iran has said it holds Pakistan responsible for the Iranians'
safety because of its alleged support for the Taliban.
	   Pakistan has said that it could not be responsible for events in
northern Afghanistan but that it had used all possible influence to
ensure the safety of any Iranians.
	   The Taliban say they know nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
although they claim to be holding some 30 Iranians suspected of
arming their enemies.

German neo-Nazi convicted of libel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ One of Germany's most notorious
neo-Nazis has been convicted of libeling the head of an association
for former Nazi concentration camp prisoners, a court spokesman
said Wednesday.
	   Guenter Deckert, the former chairman of the extreme-right
National Party of Germany, was convicted late Tuesday by a court in
Bruchsal, southwestern Baden-Wuerttemberg state, of sending a
libelous letter to Max Mannheimer, chairman of the Dachau prisoners
association. He was sentenced to three months in jail.
	   In the letter, Deckert cast doubt on whether Mannheimer's
relatives had been persecuted by the Nazis.
	   The court spokesman said appeals were being considered by both
sides.
	   Deckert is currently serving a 4 1/3-year sentence for
incitement to racial hatred. He has been convicted several times of
denying the Holocaust and similar charges.

Airport authorities confiscate 721 bottles of banned Viagra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian customs officials confiscated
bottles of the impotence drug Viagra worth about 1 million Egyptian
pounds (dlrs 294,000) from an Egyptian-American, airport officials
said Wednesday.
	   The officials, who did not identify the man, said he was trying
to smuggle 721 bottles of Viagra, which is banned in Egypt, and 391
bottles of other drugs. They added that he arrived in Egypt on
Tuesday from Turkey.
	   The man, a pharmacist, claimed he did not know Viagra was banned
in Egypt, said the officials who spoke on customary condition of
anonymity. They said a report was being prepared for the Health
Ministry to determine what should be done with the man.
	   Egypt imposed a ban on Viagra in May, saying it wanted to
conduct its own tests on the drug despite its approved use in the
United States where it is manufactured.
	   Health inspectors and police have been raiding pharmacies and
confiscating the drug, which continues to appear and is sold on the
streets and in clinics for about 60 pounds (dlrs 17.50) per pill.
The drug costs dlrs 10 per pill in the United States.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A cargo plane crashed while trying to
land in eastern Angola, killing its Russian pilot and injuring
seven other people, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported
Wednesday.
	   The crash occurred Tuesday at Saurimo airport about 500 miles
(800 kilometers) east of the capital Luanda, Lusa said.
	   Survivors said the Russian-made Antonov plane dipped suddenly as
it approached the runway and that the pilot, identified as Victor
Nikolevitch, lost control when a tire in the landing gear burst,
Lusa reported.
	   The plane belonged to the Angolan airline Allada and was
carrying 14 tons of equipment for use in the Katoka diamond mine,
the Russian news agency ITAR-Tass reported from Moscow.
	   Katoka is being developed by the Russian company ALROSA in
cooperation with Angolan, Brazilian and Israeli companies,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   A Russian flight engineer, two Angolan journalists and two local
policemen were among the injured, according to the agency, which
quoted Russia's Ministry for Emergency Situations.
	   No further details were immediately available.

Kohl promises to make tax reform top priority of fifth term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Election Poll &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ With little more than six weeks to go
before German elections, Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Wednesday a
come-from-behind victory was within reach and promised to make tax
reform to combat unemployment his first priority if re-elected.
	   ``We're on a good path,'' Kohl said at a news conference to
present the final planks _ on economics and immigration _ in his
campaign platform.
	   Promising ``security, dependability and stability,'' he said his
center-right government would again take up proposals to lower tax
rates immediately after the election if he wins a record fifth
term.
	   Kohl insists such a reform would improve Germany's business
climate and aid in the fight on unemployment, the core issue in
this year's election campaign.
	   His reform package was blocked last year in the upper house of
parliament, which the left-leaning Social Democrats control. They
argued the plan was too generous to the wealthy and would have
forced welfare cuts because it had no provisions for making up for
lost tax revenues.
	   Social Democratic chancellor hopeful Gerhard Schroeder has
sought to steer his party toward a ``new center,'' even suggesting
last week he could work with Kohl's Christian Democrats on tax
reform after the election.
	   But Kohl accused Schroeder of seeking only to deceive voters and
declared the Sept. 27 election ``a clear campaign about
direction.''
	   Polls show Kohl's three-party coalition closing on Schroeder and
his likely coalition partner, the environmentalist Greens.
	   Theo Waigel, chairman of the Christian Democratic Union's
Bavarian sister-party, the Christian Social Union, said victory was
within reach because the Social Democrats were losing ground.
	   ``That has to do with their chancellor candidate's inability to
commit himself,'' Waigel charged.
	   He also said the federal government was in better fiscal shape
today, despite the costs of unification, than when Kohl replaced
Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt as chancellor 16 years ago.
	   Regarding immigration, Kohl's parliamentary whip, Wolfgang
Schaeuble, said the state must work to better integrate foreigners,
but they also had a responsibility to make an effort to fit into
German society.

Labor-management talks break down at Hyundai Motor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Negotiators stormed out of a meeting
at Hyundai Motor Co. Wednesday, declaring there would be no more
talks in the labor dispute that has crippled operations at South
Korea's largest automaker for 24 days.
	   Tensions rose as 3,000 militant Hyundai workers set up
barricades in expectations of a police raid to break up their
strike. Thousands of police stood guard around Hyundai's main plant
in Ulsan, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southeast of Seoul, but said
they could not move in without a formal request from the company.
	   ``That will be the last choice for us because such a crackdown
will certainly result in a massive, violent clash,'' said Min
Kyong-hwan, a Hyundai spokesman.
	   At least 28 people have been injured in the past two days when
union members clashed with management officers who tried to restart
the plant. Most of them suffered minor bruises or cuts, and none
was in serious condition.
	   Hyundai's 26,000 unionized workers have downed their tools since
last month to protest rising layoffs.
	   They refused to return to work unless the company takes back
1,600 workers it fired July 31 because of sharply falling domestic
sales.
	   Authorities have ruled the strike illegal, noting that the union
did not seek mandatory government mediation, but so far have taken
no action against the strikers.
	   In Wednesday's talks, the company said it could take back 60
percent of those laid off last month and put them on a two-year
unpaid leave.
	   But the union demanded reinstatement for all. In exchange, it
proposed a reduction in working hours or a work-sharing program
that it said would save the company up to dlrs 192 million a year.
	   Each side called the other's proposals unacceptable.
	   ``There will be only fighting now,'' said labor leader Kim
Kwang-shik.
	   The company, which earlier got rid of 6,100 workers by offering
them enhanced early retirement packages, insists it has to reduce
its work force in line with slumping demand for its cars.
	   Hyundai Motor, a subsidiary of the Hyundai group, South Korea's
second largest conglomerate, has been operating at 40 percent of
its annual capacity of 1.25 million cars.
	   Hyundai's union is known for its militancy. Previous police
intervention in Hyundai's disputes resulted in violent clashes with
workers.

Cosmonauts, experts complete preparations for new manned mission
</HEADLINE>

CLARIFIES that cargo ship to follow Mir at distance, graf 10 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Cosmonauts decoupled a cargo ship Wednesday to
prepare the Mir space station for docking with a manned Soyuz ship
that is scheduled to arrive in three days.
	   Meanwhile, at the Baikonur cosmodrome in the former Soviet
republic of Kazakstan, space experts were completing preparations
for the Soyuz launch, set for Thursday.
	   The Soyuz will carry a three-man crew, including politician and
former presidential adviser Yuri Baturin, flight commander Sergei
Avdeyev and engineer Gennady Padalka.
	   Baturin told reporters at Baikonur that he would like to work
aboard the international space station after the Mir is retired,
but said he would be patient. The first, American-led crew is
expected to board the station in July 1999.
	   ``Young guys have now joined the group of Russian cosmonauts,''
the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted Baturin as saying. ``Let them fly
first, and then maybe I will try.''
	   The Soyuz will approach Mir on Saturday, but docking plans are
threatened by possible problems with the station's docking system,
known as Kurs, which has malfunctioned in recent days.
	   A test on Monday showed that the system was not responding to
commands. However, it appeared to be operational again on Tuesday
and Wednesday, said Mission Control spokeswoman Irina Manshilina.
	   After detaching the Progress cargo ship from Mir on Wednesday,
the cosmonauts simulated re-docking it again to test the Kurs
system, which appeared to be working fine, Mission Control
spokesman Valery Lyndin said.
	   If Kurs fails, Soyuz flight commander Avdeyev can dock his ship
manually, but the procedure is more complicated.
	   The Progress will follow the Mir at a distance of at least
several kilometers (miles), until Aug. 25, when the current crew
leaves on a Soyuz ship, vacating the spot for docking the Progress
again.
	   The new crew is to stay on the Mir until February. However,
Avdeyev, the flight commander, may remain on the orbiter until next
June, when the Mir is to be closed and lowered to Earth.
	   A French and a Slovak astronaut are also expected to visit the
Mir before it is abandoned.

Search for survivors of Nairobi bombing ends

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers at the site of the U.S. Embassy
bombing in Nairobi declared the search for survivors over
Wednesday, hours after retrieving the body of Rose, a Kenyan whose
cries for help inspired their work.
	   With the end of the search _ and the retrieval of Rose's body _
spirits sank. ``Everybody was Rose, everybody they could have
pulled out alive,'' said Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow.
	   Rose Wanjiku was found at 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) when weary soldiers
finally peeled back the last layers of wreckage that had trapped
her near an elevator, said Israeli Col. Udi Benuri, rescue
spokesman.
	   Five days after the explosion Friday, Benuri declared the search
for survivors over at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT). No one had been brought
out alive since Saturday, the day after nearly simultaneous
terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, a Tanzanian port.
	   A total of 247 bodies were pulled from the Nairobi wreckage,
including those of 12 Americans, and 5,436 people were injured,
said Maj. Gen. George Agoi, Kenya's chief of the rescue operation.
	   In Tanzania, 10 Africans were killed, and more than 70 hurt.
	   Benuri said Wanjiku, who was not severely injured, had died less
than 24 hours before rescuers got to her. She last spoke Sunday,
but her persistent tapping Monday spurred rescuers.
	   Reaching Wanjiku was extremely difficult because of the weight
of material blocking her and the danger of shifting material,
Benuri said.
	   As backhoes, gnawed on the last of the rubble, the FBI removed
what could be a vital piece of evidence: a vehicle plastered
against the Nairobi embassy wall by the force of the blast.
	   A bulldozer pried it off and hauled it across the street, to a
parking lot the FBI has turned into a crime lab for bomb-blasted
vehicles.
	   FBI agents scurried behind the bulldozer scooping up the bits of
debris-turned-evidence that tumbled from the shredded wreckage.
	   ``I think they've moved most of the potential evidence across
the road,'' said Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British
Army in Kenya, who has been helping U.S. officials.
	   Jones, a demolition expert who has investigated Irish Republican
Army bombings in Northern Ireland, said the bomb left a
4-meter-diameter (13-foot-diameter) crater.
	   All that remained of the four-story Ufundi Cooperative building,
which bore the brunt of the explosion aimed at the American mission
next door, was churned up dirt littered with tattered clothes,
stained papers, shattered glass and tangled wire.
	   Worn out by their ordeal, exhausted Kenyan, Israeli and French
soldiers sprawled on the ground, some of them sleeping.
	   ``It's sad we didn't save more people,'' said Sgt. Doron Caspi,
a member of the Israeli team. ``Unfortunately, it was only
bodies.''
	   Investigators suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in
the attacks, but no link has been found to any particular group, a
senior U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the FBI arrested 14 people,
including six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali-born Australian and a
Turk.
	   Tanzania's ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi,
said some of those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack.
He said they had been turned over to the FBI for interrogation.

NATO finetunes options for Kosovo; Announce no specific actions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting over; ADDS comments by Solana, others &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies again debated military
plans Wednesday to force Serb troops to ease up on Kosovo
secessionists, but announced no action as war in the Serbian
province continues unabated.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said envoys of the 16
alliance nations reviewed ``planning for a full range of options
for the use of military force to bring an end to violence and
create the conditions for negotiations.''
	   His statement repeated a line NATO embraced two months ago.
Officials said the finetuning of military options continues and
provide for ground and air operations.
	   Solana said NATO's planning ``include the use of ground and air
power, and in particular the full range of options of air power
alone. They will ensure that NATO can act swiftly and credibly
should the occasion arise.''
	   Military planners are polling NATO governments to see if they
are ready and willing to participate in air strikes, he added.
	   NATO has drafted essentially three options: a preventive
deployment of troops along the borders of Kosovo in neighboring
Albania and Macedonia; a graduated air campaign against targets
inside Yugoslavia; and a deployment of peacekeeping troops into
Yugoslavia.
	   These plans have emerged very slowly reflecting sensitivities in
capitals about NATO intervening in a domestic Yugoslav dispute.
	   One NATO official, who asked not to be named, said any military
action ``would have an appropriate legal basis'' but acknowledged
NATO governments disagree on whether a United Nations mandate would
be required.
	   Also, the United States and Britain have been at odds over how
fast the allies should deploy war planes to end the fighting
between Serb forces and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia. The United Nations has estimated the fighting has made
some 240,000 people into refugees.
	   NATO's seemingly endless planning process has had no effect on
the war in Kosovo. As the NATO envoys discussed Kosovo anew
Wednesday, Serb forces attacked an ethnic Albanian stronghold
trapping thousands of civilians and militants in the village of
Junik, near the Albanian border.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   In mid -June, an allied military intervention seemed an imminent
possibility as warplanes from 13 of the 16 NATO nations roared over
Albania and Macedonia in four hours of heavy-duty sabre-rattling.

China sentences four Taiwanese businessmen accused of spying
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Taiwan response throughout, television appearance

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A Beijing court on Wednesday convicted four
Taiwanese businessmen of spying in a case that threatened to set
back tentative efforts to resume talks between China and Taiwan.
	   One of the men, Kou Chien-ming, was sentenced to four years in
prison, while the other three were not punished, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported.
	   Chinese state television showed the four in civilian clothes
standing expressionless before a judge as the verdicts were read.
	   ``The facts in the case were clear and the evidence was
incontrovertible,'' Xinhua said in its report of the verdict.
	   Kou immediately filed an appeal of the verdict, Taiwan's Central
News Agency said. Quoting a Chinese lawyer hired by the families,
it said the other three men had been moved from jail, but would not
be free to return to Taiwan until a confirmation of the verdict was
issued.
	   The court's apparent leniency for what can be a capital crime in
China could reflect a desire by Chinese authorities not to let the
case derail plans for Chinese and Taiwanese negotiators to meet
later this year.
	   Taiwanese newspapers have speculated that China was likely to
repatriate the men to Taiwan to minimize disruption to efforts to
renew dialogue between the two sides that has been suspended since
1995. China regards Taiwan as a rebel province and has been pushing
for talks on reunification.
	   Taiwan's semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation, which handles
contacts with China, said it hoped to arrange for the three men to
return home as soon as possible, and would continue to push for
Kou's release.
	   ``The SEF hopes people from our side who visit the mainland
acquaint themselves with the differences in legal environment to
protect themselves and their property,'' the foundation said.
	   The Beijing No. 1 Intermediate Court ruled that the four men
worked for Taiwan's military intelligence bureau under the cover of
a civic organization set up to promote exchanges between China and
Taiwan, Xinhua said.
	   They ``illegally entered the mainland and engaged in political,
economic and military espionage between June of 1993 and March of
1998,'' it said.
	   Taiwan's intelligence agencies and the men's families have
strongly denied that the men were spies. Other officials of the
organization said Kou may have unintentionally broken state
security laws while setting up a China business information web
site on the Internet.
	   Kou's wife, Chang Wen-chi, said in a statement his sentencing
may have resulted from differences between what constitutes
classified information in Taiwan and China.
	   Kou was secretary-general of the organization described by the
court as a front for espionage. Chen Shao-yu, Han Yue-ting and Chou
Chang-ming _ all members of Kou's organization _ were not sentenced
because of their ``meritorious performance,'' Xinhua said without
elaborating.
	   The four were detained earlier this year while in China on what
their families said were business trips. China announced their
arrests on May 28, claiming the men confessed to spying for Taiwan.
	   Taiwanese have grown increasingly anxious about their safety in
China, where many have business dealings. Concerns rose again this
month when a Taiwanese politician was kidnapped and killed in
northeastern China.

Tel Aviv scientist wins major science prize for work on
</HEADLINE>
groundwater &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A Tel Aviv University scientist has won
this year's Stockholm Water Prize for his research in groundwater
pollution.
	   Gedeon Dagan's reasearch applied probability theory to analyzing
groundwater pollution. The work is of particular value to Israel,
where water availability is a potentially explosive issue with the
Palestinians.
	   ``By providing rational tools, we can inject some kind of
lucidity and rationality into the peace process,'' Dagan said in an
interview. ``It's much easier for scientists and specialists to get
some kind of positive dialogue than politicians apparently can
do.''
	   Dagan said that as a teen-ager, he decided he wanted to leave
Romania for Israel and that he chose his field of study largely
because he knew that water engineering was a key issue for Israel.
He emigrated in 1962.
	   The issue has become more serious for the country since then, he
said.
	   ``Our situation is quite difficult. We utilize our resources to
the limit,'' Dagan said. ``If you overexploit, it's like you create
an overdraft in your bank account ... if you do it for a prolonged
period, you go bankrupt.''
	   Assessing how groundwater flows, and how pollutants seep into it
from the surface, is difficult because many areas have a
bewilderingly complex mixture of soils and rock strata.
	   Digging wells to monitor the groundwater is prohibitively
expensive and because such wells assess only a small area, they may
not detect pollution encroaching from a very short distance away,
Dagan said.
	   Depending on conditions, some groundwater flows only ``tens of
meters a year,'' he said. Pollutants, such as fertilizers, can seep
at a similarly slow pace and water that is drinkable one year may
be polluted a year later.
	   By applying probability theory, analysts can take a small core
sample of a given area's subsurface, then extrapolate with
reasonable certainty how water and pollutants will move through it,
Dagan said.
	   The dlrs 150,000 science prize is to be presented Thursday in
connection with the annual Stockholm Water Symposium.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The author of a book on Malaysian
Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was arraigned in court
Wednesday on charges of writing ``false news'' with malicious
intent.
	   Khalid Jafri, author of ``50 Reasons Why Anwar Shouldn't Be

imprisoned for three years or fined 20,000 ringgit (dlrs 5,000) if
convicted. The next hearing is scheduled Aug. 19.
	   The book drew national attention after it was widely circulated
to senior politicians attending the annual convention of Malaysia's
ruling party, the United Malays National Organization.
	   It contained allegations ranging from illicit sex and bribery to
attempts to undermine the country's leadership, according to Anwar,
who has threatened to ``teach the authors a lesson.''
	   The court hearing came a day after Anwar pledged his full
support and loyalty to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, whom he
characterized as both a mentor and a father figure.
	   Although he was formerly considered Mahathir's automatic
successor, Anwar's relations with his boss have reportedly soured
in recent months over policy differences.
	   But on Tuesday, Anwar said there were no differences between the
two and that he would not challenge the 72-year-old prime minister
in party elections next year.
	   ``Talk that there will be a contest for the UMNO presidency next
year is baseless and does not make sense at all,'' local news
reports quoted him as saying.
	   Last Friday, Anwar also dismissed rumors of his imminent
resignation as finance minister. He blamed foreign media and the
financial markets for spreading such ``baseless'' rumors.

Singapore extends electronic filing to Supreme Court
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Supreme Court said Wednesday it
will begin this week using documents in electronic form during
hearings of appeal.
	   Electronically filed documents have been used in a number of
criminal and civil trials since 1995 in the Technology Court, which
is specially equipped with computers and multimedia capabilities.
	   Now their use has been extended to the country's High Court and
Court of Appeal, which are under the Supreme Court, in preparation
for the eventual full implementation of the Electronic Filing
System in all hearings in Singapore.
	   ``With electronic hearings, much time can be saved as the chief
justice and the judges of appeals can concentrate on the counsel's
submissions instead of plowing through the various, usually
voluminous bundles of court documents placed before them,'' the
Supreme Court said.
	   Initially, lawyers will be assisted free of charge by courts in
converting the paper documents into an electronic format. But
ultimately law firms will have to prepare electronic documents
themselves.
	   ``The move to hear appeals in an electronic environment is yet
another manifestation of the judiciary's commitment to evolving to
meet the needs of court users into the next millennium,'' the
Supreme Court said.
	   The Electronic Filing System is to be fully implemented in the
Singapore judiciary by 2002.
	   At an estimated cost of 29 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 17
million), EFS is expected to revolutionize civil litigation in this
city state of 3.1 million.
	   In addition to minimizing paper flow and storage, and allowing
for quick access to and transmission of court documents, the system
will be equipped with special security features against
unauthorized users.

NATO finetunes options for Kosovo; Announce no specific actions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting over; ADDS comments by Solana, others &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The NATO allies again debated military
plans Wednesday to force Serb troops to ease up on secessionists in
Kosovo, but announced no action as war in the southern Serbian
province continued unabated.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said envoys of the 16
alliance nations reviewed ``planning for a full range of options
for the use of military force to bring an end to violence and
create the conditions for negotiations.''
	   His statement repeated a line NATO embraced two months ago.
Officials said the finetuning of military options continues and
provide for ground and air operations.
	   Solana said NATO's planning ``include the use of ground and air
power, and in particular the full range of options of air power
alone. They will ensure that NATO can act swiftly and credibly
should the occasion arise.''
	   Military planners are polling NATO governments to see if they
are ready and willing to participate in air strikes, he said.
	   NATO has drafted essentially three options: a preventive
deployment of troops along the borders of Kosovo in neighboring
Albania and Macedonia; a graduated air campaign against targets
inside Yugoslavia; and a deployment of peacekeeping troops into
Yugoslavia.
	   These plans have emerged slowly, reflecting sensitivities in
capitals about NATO intervening in a domestic Yugoslav dispute.
	   One NATO official, who asked not to be named, said any military
action ``would have an appropriate legal basis'' but acknowledged
NATO governments disagree on whether a United Nations mandate would
be required.
	   Also, the United States and Britain have been at odds over how
fast the allies should deploy war planes to end the fighting
between Serb forces and the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia. The United Nations has estimated the fighting has made
some 240,000 people into refugees.
	   Kosovo is a province in southern Serbia where ethnic Albanians,
who demand independence, represent 90 percent of the population.
Serbia and the smaller republic of Montenegro make up what is left
of Yugoslavia.
	   In mid -June, an allied military intervention seemed an imminent
possibility as warplanes from 13 of the 16 NATO nations roared over
Albania and Macedonia in four hours of heavy-duty sabre-rattling.

	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Maize production in the 13 states of the
Southern African Development Community will fall 6 percent to 16
million metric tons in the current season, says the community's
latest food security bulletin released here Wednesday.
	   Output of the region's staple food crop would drop by 91 percent
in Botswana, 72 percent in Namibia aand 65 percent in Lesotho,
warned the bulletin, which put average annual total production over
the past five years at 17.7 million tonnes.
	   Maize harvests of 1 million tons in Zimbabwe and 649,000 tons in
Zambia last season would fall more than 30 percent due to poorly
distributed rains resulting from the El Nino weather phenomenon in
the Eastern Pacific Ocean.
	   However, Mozambique may be able to raise production eight
percent to 1.1 million tons and Tanzania 50 percent to 2.8 million
tons.
	   Failure of maize crops places a crippling burden on southern
African economies as Governments are forced to expend scarce hard
currency importing overseas stocks.

	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A judge in Sierra Leone has begun
the lengthy process of summing up evidence against 18 civilians,
including five journalists, accused of treason and aiding the
country's ousted military junta.
	   Judge Edmond Cowan told the 12-member jury Tuesday that most of
the defendants had admitted joining the former junta which was
ejected from the capital following a military barrage by West
African intervention troops in February.
	   However, the accused said they had no love for the military
rulers and were merely trying to serve their country, Cowan added.
	   If found guilty, the accused face death by firing squad or
hanging.
	   Among those accused are former BBC correspondent Hilton Fyle,
state radio employees Gipo Felix George and Dennis Smith and
newspaper editor Ibrahim Ben Kargbo.
	   Another of the accused journalists, state radio reporter Olivia
Mensah gave birth to a girl last month while in prison.
	   The jury was expected to return a verdict later this week.

	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon _ Amid a drive by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to win South African backing for his position in the stalled
Middle East peace process, Israeli parliament members began their
own bid to gain supporters in Africa.
	   Addressing diplomats and reporters in Cameroon's commercial
capital of Yaounde on Tuesday, Emmanuel Zisman blamed Islamic
fundamentalists for the U.S. embassy blasts in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Zisman is among five members of Israel's parliament, or Knesset,
who are each visiting a number of African countries over the next
month.
	   ``If the Islamic fundamentalists can go to Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, you don't know what may happen to Yaounde and Douala,''
Zisman said referring to Cameroon's two largest cities.
	   ``We are not asking Cameroon to fight terrorism militarily,''
Zisman said. ``But it is now necessary to be brave and condemn the
terrorists and their supporters.''
	   Other countries on the Israeli diplomatic itinerary include
Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of Congo,
Congo, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, Rwanda and possibly Ivory Coast.
	   Arafat was in South Africa for a three-day visit ending
Wednesday.
	   -------
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ President Henri Konan Bedie has
increased his cabinet from 29 to 35 ministers and deputies, making
13 new appointments and firing seven.
	   The widely anticipated government reshuffle was announced on
Tuesday, but the changes were smaller than expected.
	   None of the country's key portfolios were touched and nine new
positions, including five ministerial and four deputy posts were
created.
	   Opposition leaders dismissed the shuffle as a non-event.
	   The reshuffle is expected to provoke criticism from foreign
lending institutions like the International Monetary Fund which
have urged the Ivory Coast, one of Africa's most heavily indebted
countries, to curb government expenditure.

Former bandit-turned-politician to visit massacre site
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Phoolan Devi, India's famous
bandit-turned-politician, plans to visit the village where she
allegedly gunned down 21 men 17 years ago, her political colleagues
said Wednesday.
	   Devi, who denies she had any hand in the massacre, will visit
Behmai village later this month to tell the families of the victims
that she was falsely blamed for the killings.
	   As a humanitarian gesture, she will offer financial assistance
to the widows and children of the men who were killed, members of
her Samajwadi Party said.
	   Behmai is 180 miles (110 miles) northwest of Lucknow, capital of
the Uttar Pradesh state where Behmai is also located.
	   Devi gained worldwide fame with the release of ``Bandit Queen,''
a 1993 movie about her life as leader of a band of feared bandits
in the ravines of northern India. She allegedly killed the men _ 18
of them from the warrior caste _ to avenge her rape by them in
1980.
	   She spent 11 years in jail without trial after she surrendered
in 1983 under an amnesty deal offered by a state government. After
her release, she joined politics and became a lawmaker in 1996.
	   But charges against her have been re-opened and she is currently
battling 14 court cases, including the one on the Behmai massacre.
	   Devi's alleged mass rape and the massacre are shrouded in doubt
with survivors of the massacre and the villagers of Behmai denying
the rape charge.
	   The Samajwadi Party, which represents lower castes, is in touch
with prominent high caste to make Devi's visit possible. The
Samajwadi Party is trying to broaden its support base in the state
and wooing the upper caste leaders.
	   Though Devi will announce substantial financial aid to the
families of the Behmai victims, she will not apologize for the
killings, said Ram Saran Dass, Samajwadi Party state chief.
	   Devi ``denies her involvement in the massacre. So there is no
question of her apologizing for the massacre,'' Dass said.

Japanese group predicts East Asian trade to slow further this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Trade in East Asia is expected to further stagnate
this year due to the regional currency crisis, a Japanese trade
group said in a report released Wednesday.
	   Imports in the region grew 1.4 percent in 1997, down from a 4.9
percent rise in the previous year, because of sluggish demand as a
result of the crisis, the Japan External Trade Organization said.
	   ``East Asian economies are wrapped up in the problems of
restructuring their financial institutions, making export-led
recovery difficult in the near term,'' JETRO said. ``More than one
year after the crisis began, there are no signs of recovery.''
	   Exports in East Asia grew 6.9 percent in 1997, following a 4.2
percent rise in 1996, the trade group said.
	   A devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997 led to speculative
attacks against several currencies in the region and started East
Asia's now year-old financial crisis.
	   The slump has hurt Japan more than the United States or the
European Union, the organization said. While Japan's exports to the
rest of the East Asian nations dropped 1.9 percent last year, U.S.
exports rose 6.6 percent and EU exports grew 3.8 percent.
	   The organization is the trade promotion arm of the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry. Its white paper summarizes and
analyzes world trade performance and related trends.
	   The report said global trade in goods in 1997 grew 9.6 percent
in volume terms, accelerating from a 6.2 percent rise the previous
year. Increases in global trade came as world gross domestic
product grew 4.1 percent.
	   In value terms, however, global trade in 1997 rose only 3.4
percent to dlrs 5.46 trillion, down slightly from a 3.9 percent
rise in 1996. The gap between growth in volume and value was due to
a strong gain in the U.S. dollar against local currencies, JETRO
said.

Four Italian cyclists may be fired after failing blood tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Four Italian cyclists, disqualified from the
Tour of Portugal for failing blood tests, may be fired by their
commercial team, Mobilvetta Northwave, for misconduct.
	   ``They are professionals and must take responsibility for their
behavior,'' team manager Stefano Giuliani told an Italian radio
network Wednesday. ``If their contract provides punishment for
misconduct, dismissal letters will mailed immediately.''
	   The four cyclists - Mario Manzoni, Paolo Alberati, Graziano
Recinella and Renzo Ragnetti _ all failed blood tests carried out
by a medial team of the International cycling Union (ICU) before
the start of the second stage Tuesday.
	   The Italians failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was above 50 percent.
	   This is considered a health risk and may indicate the use of
EPO, a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of red
blood cells.
	   Meanwhile another cycling team, France's Cofidis, announced it
would definitely fire its Italian star Francesco Casagrande if
second tests confirm he used forbidden substances.
	   Casagrande, winner of the San Sebastian Classic last Saturday,
tested positive of testosterone last month but has appealed results
of tests claiming he naturally produces a high level of that
substance.
	   ICU has intensified blood tests before races in the wake of the
doping scandal which marred this year's Tour of France.
	   Almost daily tests have led to the suspension of three more
Italian cyclists from the Tour of Portugal on Wednesday - two of
the Cantina Tollo team and one of Vini Caldirola.

Austria encourages the last of its Bosnian war refugees to return
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Starting early next month, Austria will
begin encouraging the last Bosnian refugees it supports to return
home by offering them startup money, the Interior Ministry said
Wednesday.
	   The Austria Press Agency quoted Heide-Marie Fenzl, the head of
the Bosnia-Action branch of the Interior Ministry, as saying the
government hopes 2,000 of the country's remaining refugees would
accept the offer of up to 20,000 schillings (dlrs 1,600) in startup
money to begin their new lives in Bosnia.
	   Refugees with special cases _ those needing medical care,
treatment for trauma, or witnesses of war crimes _ will be allowed
to stay in the country indefinitely, Fenzl said.
	   Austria will also donate up to 200 million shillings (dlrs 16
million) in reconstruction aid to the municipalities welcoming the
returned refugees.
	   This country of 8 million took in 91,000 war refugees from
Bosnia at the height of the 1992-95 war.

 &UR; Saudi King Fahd undergoes gall bladder surgery
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES urgent series, CLARIFIES that gall bladder was
removed; CORRECTS in 3rd graf that he was admitted to hospital last
week; ADDS 4th graf with name of chief surgeon.

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Doctor's successfully removed Saudi
King Fahd's gall bladder in an operation led by an American
specialist, the royal court said in a statement.
	   The king was well after the operation in the Saudi capital,
Riyadh, said the statement carried by the official Saudi Press
Agency.
	   Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was admitted to the King Faisal
Specialist Hospital last week and Wednesday's operation came
following consultations with a number of specialists from the
United States, France, Italy and Germany, the statement said.
	   It said the surgical team was led by Dr. Ted Pappas of Duke
University in North Carolina.
	   The statement said consultations also were conducted via
satellite with the renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota,
which recommended that a cholecystectomy should be carried out. The
operation is the removal of the gall bladder.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to his half-brother, Crown Prince
Abdullah.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   He went back into the hospital on Aug. 2. Officials said he was
to undergo tests, but the following day a medical statement said
doctors had removed a pus-like fluid from his stomach.
	   Fahd has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   He was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat on Wednesday slammed Israeli intransigence for threatening
the Middle East peace process and warned of a return of violence
and war to the region.
	   Addressing South Africa's Parliament, Arafat told lawmakers
Palestinians had opted for compromise while the Israeli government
had gone back on promises of a fair peace deal.
	   Israel ``has challenged international legitimacy and resolutions
and opened the door wide to the return of violence, anarchy, war
and destruction,'' said Arafat, who was given a standing ovation
when he arrived.
	   ``Since the present Israeli government assumed power, it has
hindered this (peace) process through procrastination and by
evading its commitments.''
	   Arafat demanded President Bill Clinton try to break deadlock on
an American proposal that Israel withdraw troops from an additional
13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian guarantees
to combat terror. Arafat has accepted the plan, while Israel has
yet to agree.
	   Arafat, who ends a three-day state visit Wednesday, has been
accorded the formal welcome of a full head of state and received
the country's highest honor for foreigners _ the Order of Good
Hope.
	   Earlier on Wednesday, Arafat told journalists he hoped President
Nelson Mandela would use his good relationship with Clinton to
promote the Palestinian cause in the peace process.
	   Reporters asked Arafat what he wanted Mandela to tell Clinton.
Arafat replied: ``To be tough with those who are refusing a
peaceful initiative.''
	   Arafat was visiting Robben Island, site of a former jail just
off the coast at Cape Town, where Mandela spent 18 years as a
prisoner of the apartheid government.
	   Guided by Ahmed Kathrada, who was jailed alongside Mandela for
fighting white rule, Arafat toured the tiny island prison which has
now been converted into a tourist attraction and nature reserve.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Irish woman was detained by border
police as she tried to leave Romania with small quantities of drugs
in her handbag, police reported Wednesday.
	   Samantha Blanford Hutton, 30, was caught late Tuesday carrying

Governing coalition in crisis after Cabinet walkout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ An unprecedented Cabinet walkout
by ministers from the ruling coalition's junior partner threw the
New Zealand government into crisis Wednesday, leaving Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley clinging to power with a minority
government.
	   The walkout by New Zealand First ministers leaves Shipley to
rule with her National party's 44 seats in the country's Parliament
of 120 members, and informal agreements with other minority
parties.
	   Shipley described the walkout as ``terribly serious'' for New
Zealand's international credibility and for its governance, but
said she has enough support in Parliament on the crucial issues of
confidence and monetary bills to hang on to power.
	   ``It is my intention to carry on as a minority government,''
Shipley told reporters.
	   Immediately after the walkout, Shipley invoked the coalition's
disputes procedure, which gives the senior leadership of the two
parties seven days to resolve fundamental disputes before the
coalition can be dissolved.
	   ``I want to make it clear that it is my intention to explore all
options with the coalition partner and consider whether or not they
view this as a matter of irreconcilable breakdown,'' Shipley told
reporters.
	   New Zealand First leader Winston Peters, asked whether the
walkout meant the end of the coalition government that has ruled
for the past 20 months, said: ``We'll see tomorrow.''
	   But his party would ``not back the sale of New Zealand
ownership'' of strategic assets, a reference to a dispute about the
sale of Wellington airport.
	   Peters and his three Cabinet colleagues stormed out of a meeting
that had been called to agree to the sale of the government's 66
percent stake in the airport to a private sector buyer.
	   Peters said that keeping a 51 percent stake in the airport in
New Zealand hands was ``fundamental to us (New Zealand First).''
	   National Party Cabinet ministers voted to sell the airport after
the NZ First walkout.
	   Refusing to concede the coalition with National was at an end,
Peters said he was still the deputy prime minister and treasurer in
the government.
	   The ``door would remain open'' for negotiations with National on
the airport sale, he said.
	   The coalition has governed with National's 44 votes, supported
by NZ First's 16 and the unaligned support of minor party ACT New
Zealand (eight votes) and the votes of two independents.
	   Opposition leader Helen Clark said New Zealand did not have a
functioning government.
	   ``The government is in meltdown. It is an extraordinary
position,'' she said. ``It's a shambles ... they (the government)
should get out of the way.''

Premier League inundated with foreign imports: good or bad for the
</HEADLINE>
game?
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ English soccer is almost a contradiction in terms
these days.
	   The Premier League is stocked with so many imports from Norway,
Italy, the Netherlands, France and other countries that English
players are becoming nearly obsolete at some clubs.
	   More than 150 non-British players are registered with the 20
Premier League clubs. When the new season kicks off this weekend,
fewer than half of the 220 starting players are expected to be
English.
	   Debate over whether the influx of foreign stars is good or bad
for the domestic game is taking center stage.
	   On the upside, British fans can see some of the world's biggest
stars in action every week. On the downside, budding young English
stars are getting fewer chances.
	   Organizers of England's 2006 World Cup bid market the Premier
League as the most ``cosmopolitan'' competition in the world,
embracing more World Cup stars than any other.
	   Campaign director Alec McGivan said 75 of the players at the
France '98 World Cup played for English clubs in the 1997-98 season
and half the nations had at least one squad member based in
England.
	   Apart from Europe, English top-flight soccer is attracting
players from Africa, South America, Australia and the Caribbean.
	   The major reason why foreign stars are flocking to England is
that the Premier League, thanks to television revenues, has become
the richest soccer league in the world. Clubs are able to pay huge
transfer fees and salaries for top talent.
	   England's Professional Footballers' Association president Gordon
Taylor has been outspoken in his criticism of the foreign influx.
	   ``How many (Michael) Owens have been lost to the game because
there was no stage for them to develop?'' he said.
	   Taylor cited Chelsea, which has 16 foreign players on its books,
as a prime example.
	   Chelsea's Italian player-coach Gianluca Vialli went on a summer
buying spree, spending 12 million pounds (dlrs 19.68 million) on
foreign players while selling British players.
	   Vialli signed French World Cup star Marcel Desailly, Spanish
international Albert Ferrer, Italian Pierluigi Casiraghi and Danish
international Brian Laudrup. They join an international cast that
includes Italians Gianfranco Zola and Roberto Di Matteo, France's
Frank Leboeuf, Romania's Dan Petrescu and Norway's Tor Andre Flo.
	   Dennis Wise and England World Cup player Graeme Le Saux could be
the only English players figuring in Vialli's plans this season.
	   Chelsea _ the League Cup and European Cup Winners' Cup holders _
is the league's major importer, although clubs like Arsenal and
Derby are not far behind.
	   Football Association spokesman Steve Double said having the
likes of Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp playing in the Premier
League generates appeal for spectators.
	   ``On the downside, it could be stifling the development of
home-grown players,'' he said.
	   Double said highlighted the number of foreign goalkeepers in the
Premier League, including U.S. internationals Kasey Keller
(Leicester) and Brad Friedel (Liverpool), as one problem area.
	   ``England once prided itself on its goalkeepers, who were the
envy of the world. Now there's hardly any English goalkeepers in
the League,'' he said.
	   Double ruled out the introduction of a cap on foreign players
joining the Premier League.
	   ``You have to bear in mind that with the introduction of the
Bosman rule, we've just come out of a situation where the cap on
overseas players has been removed,'' he said.
	   But former England coach Terry Venables believes there should be
restrictions on the number of foreign players allowed at each club.
	   ``Not only would this ensure that only the best players were
bought to add to the quality of the game but it would also,
perhaps, encourage some caution on the prices paid,'' he said.
	   Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, a Frenchman, warned that foreign
players would start dominating England's domestic competition to
the detriment of the national team.
	   ``Nothing can stop the arrival of foreign players...everyone
knows that eventually it will kill off the young talent,'' Wenger
said. ``Ultimately it can only mean the death of the national
team.''
	   The Arsenal boss admitted he had contributed to the problem _
the FA Cup and league champions have 13 foreign players, including
Dutch pair Bergkamp and Marc Overmars and French World Cup heros
Emmanuel Petit and Patrick Vieira, on the roster.
	   West Ham manager Harry Redknapp said Wenger was wrong.
	   ``If you're young and you're English, you have every chance of
making it. If you're average, it will be harder,'' he said. ``I
don't see anything wrong in that. The game's in better shape now
than it has been for years. I would say keep them coming, not keep
them out.''
	   David Mellor, head of the government's soccer task force and a
lifelong Chelsea fan, said foreign players only improve the quality
of play in England.
	   ``If I wanted a lad to really get excited about football and be
determined to play the game the right way, I'd much rather he
watched Bergkamp and Gianfranco Zola than the kind of Brits that
used to wear their shirts,'' he said.
	   ``People say English talent is stifled but that's rubbish.
Michael Owen had no problem displacing (German international
striker) Karl-Heinz Riedle at Liverpool.''
	   Premier League president Mike Lee said surveys showed the
overwhelming majority of fans wanted international stars in their
domestic competition.
	   ``It's the reverse of the situation a few years ago, before the
Premier League was formed, when a lot of our best players went
overseas and played in Italy and other countries,'' he said.
``Attendences at matches is up 40 percent and foreign players have
had a lot to do with that.''

Two Israeli soldiers wounded in south Lebanon attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Hezbollah guerrillas attacked an Israeli
patrol in southern Lebanon, wounding two soldiers, security
officials said Wednesday.
	   Israeli troops came under rocket and mortar shell fire late
Tuesday night while patrolling the Sojod outpost in an
Israeli-occupied border enclave in south Lebanon, they said.
	   Two soldiers were wounded and airlifted to Israel for treatment,
the Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army said two soldiers were ``lightly
wounded'' in the attack claimed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah
guerrilla group.
	   Sojod, 22 kilometers (14 miles) southeast of the port city of
Sidon, is in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah stronghold that faces the
occupied zone.
	   Iqlim al-Tuffah, or Apple Province, is used by Hezbollah as a
base to launch attacks on Israeli troops and their allied Lebanese
militiamen in the occupied zone.
	   On Monday, Hezbollah guerrillas killed an Israeli-allied
militiaman in a roadside bomb explosion in south Lebanon.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from guerrilla attacks across the border.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian aviation plant will sell China eight
Ka-28 helicopters by the end of next year, the Interfax news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   The Kamov aviation plant in Kumertau, Bashkortostan _ about
1,200 kilometers (750 miles) east of Moscow _ will sell four
Ka-28PS search-and-rescue helicopters and four Ka-28PL
anti-submarine helicopters to China, said the plant's deputy
general designer, Veniamin Kasyannikov.
	   The helicopters are the export versions of the Kamov model that
is used by Russia's navy, Interfax said. Each costs dlrs 4 million
to dollars 5 million.

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Soldiers fired stun grenades toward
opposition protesters outside King Letsie III's palace in the
capital Wednesday. There was no immediate word on injuries.
	   Monica Mopeli, a spokeswoman for the opposition parties, told
South African Press Association that the shootings caused panic.
	   ``They started shooting at about 2:10 p.m. and it is chaos here,
with people running in all directions. We have not established how
many, if any, people have been injured at this stage,'' she said.
	   The army came to the palace after several hundred protesters
ignored an order to disperse.
	   People have been gathering outside the palace since early last
week, denouncing last May's elections in this tiny African kingdom
of 2 million people as rigged.
	   Bareng Sekhonyana, a spokesman for the opposition Basotho
National Party, said there were a number of issues that needed to
be resolved before the protesters would disperse.
	   These included represenation by opposition party members on the
the Independent Electoral Commission panel which is to recount the
votes of the general election.
	   The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy took 79 of the 80
seats in the National Assembly.
	   The opposition parties also wanted protection for protesters
against what he said were ruling party ``gangs'' assaulting them,
Sekhonyana said.
	   He said these issues had been raised in discussions with the
army chief and opposition parties were awaiting his response.
	   ``The protesters are orderly and they are not causing any damage
to the shops in the area,'' he said. ``We are just singing and
praying, causing harm to no one.''
	   This impoverished, mountainous nation is entirely surrounded by
South Africa.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. Embassy hastily paid off
and shut down a nextdoor gas station Wednesday to prevent any
attempts by terrorists to use it as a bombing base.
	   The embassy had been negotiating for some time to take over the
Shell station, said embassy spokesman James Warren.
	   ``The interest in negotiations has increased dramatically over
the past few days,'' he said, adding the lease agreement was
finalized Wednesday.
	   Most operations at the embassy have been closed since Monday,
after the State Department ordered half a dozen missions to suspend
operations because of increased threats of terrorism.
	   It named U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen as
particularly threatened targets.
	   ``This could include attacks on buildings,'' the department said
in a statement.
	   Heightened precautions have been taken at U.S. embassies
worldwide, particularly those without sufficient barriers against
roadside terrorist threats, following car-bomb explosions at U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania Friday.
	   The bombings killed at least 250 people and injured more than
5,000.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Wednesday there was no
reason for the State Department to consider American interests in
Malaysia a terrorist target.
	   ``As far as we can see, there has been no sign of any terrorist
activity in Malaysia,'' the prime minister said, adding that U.S.
interests would nonetheless receive full protection from the
government if they felt endangered.
	   Earlier, the government assured embassy staff of their safety
and said the U.S. diplomatic compound had been placed under heavy
police guard to supplement its own security forces following last
week's attacks.
	   ``I think the U.S. Embassy in Malaysia will be safe, but we are
taking the necessary precautions,'' Deputy Home Minister Tajol
Rosli Ghazali was quoted as saying by the government news agency
Bernama.
	   While more than 120 police officers, many of them in plain
clothes, circled the U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, gas station
attendants pumped gasoline out of the underground tanks into a
parked tanker. The unleaded gasoline was being stored for use by
embassy vehicles, said a contractor.
	   He said some 18,800 liters (5,000 gallons) had to be drained
from the tanks.
	   ``We're going to try to get all we can out tonight,'' said John
Harvey, the embassy facility manager.
	   Rectangular road blocks had been placed to close off the station
just outside the high embassy walls fortified by razor-tipped
barbed wire fencing atop them.
	   Several police officers from a Malaysian combat unit, once used
against communist guerrillas, were posted outside the U.S. Embassy
Wednesday in addition to the local police.
	   No group has been identified by the FBI or Kenyan and Tanzanian
investigators as responsible for Friday's bombings.
	   The embassy spokesman in Kuala Lumpur said there had been no
threats from Malaysians.
	   ``Our concerns are with an outside group that may come into
Malaysia. We're not worried about Malaysians. These threats are
coming from outside the country,'' said Warren.
	   Mahathir, asked by reporters whether such a threat warranted
concern, responded, ``I don't know. ... I really cannot say
anything because this is very sensitive. We are not supposed to say
anything because this might be misinterpreted.''
	   The embassy was gripped by panic last year after death threats
to Americans in Malaysia during a time when Malaysian leaders were
blaming U.S. currency speculators for the Asian crisis and some
U.S. lawmakers were demanding Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
resignation over alleged anti-Jewish remarks.

Italy begins releasing dozens of would-be immigrants from detention

 &UR; With AP photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy on Wednesday began releasing dozens of illegal
immigrants from detention centers in Sicily. Some were sent home by
plane or ferry but others were handed expulsion papers that
basically amount to freedom to go where they want.
	   According to Italy's new immigration law, the immigrants cannot
be held at detention centers for longer than 30 days. Authorities
have been rushing to identify about 3,000 people, most of them
Africans, who sailed to Italian shores and islands illegally. But
the paperwork wasn't completed withing the time limit, and now the
arrivals must be released from detention centers.
	   Once released, the immigrants are virtually free to wander
through Italy and northern Europe in search of black-market jobs or
relatives.
	   So far, about 700 immigrants have been identified and all are
expected to be reimpatriated.
	   A group of 28 Tunisians released from centers in Sicily was sent
home on a ferry which also carried about a dozen tourists. The
would-be immigrants, who were escorted by police, yelled out that
they would return to Italy soon.
	   Another five Tunisians returned home on a Tunisian airline
flight from Rome.
	   Earlier this year, Italy dropped border controls with several
European nations under the Schengen Treaty, an open-border
agreement that requires countries to be more vigilant at other
entry points.
	   To please its northern neighbors, Italy then stiffened its
immigration law, but even this has not stemmed the flow and the
30-day time limit is a major loophole.
	   In the past, Italy did not detain immigrants. It merely gave
them papers ordering them to leave the country within 15 days, then
left them to do as they pleased.

days. The Premier League is stocked with so many imports from
Norway, Italy, the Netherlands, France and other countries that
English players are becoming nearly obsolete at some clubs. With
the new season kicking off this weekend, debate over whether the
influx of foreign stars is good or bad for the domestic game is
taking center stage.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The skies above Sydney buzzed with
military helicopters Wednesday as Australian defense forces
practiced anti-terrorist maneuvers ahead of the 2000 Olympics.
	   Ten Australian army Black Hawk helicopters swooped around the
Sydney Opera House and the city's harbor bridge during exercises to
familiarize pilots and crews with the downtown area in case of
terrorist attacks during the Olympics.
	   They carried teams of commandos from the army's Special Forces
unit, which will provide counter-terrorist support for state
authorities handling security during the Games.
	   ``It is highly likely that most members of the Sydney public
will see one or more of these aircraft in the central business
district or suburbs within the next fortnight,'' defense spokesman
Col. Keith Jobson said.
	   ``While we will try to keep noise nuisance to an absolute
minimum, the training is essential to familiarize our air crew and
Special Forces with operating in Sydney.''

Birthday gift blown up during Arafat visit to South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ It's better to be safe than
sorry. That was the belief of nervous police here who on Wednesday
blew up a surprise birthday gift sent to a top government official.
	   Put on high alert during a state visit by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, police manning the reception at President Nelson
Mandela's Tuynhuys offices were surprised when an unexpected
package was delivered to their door.
	   After alerting a bomb disposal unit, the package was exploded
outside the gates of parliament, just two hours before Arafat was
scheduled to deliver a speech to lawmakers.
	   Sifting through the wreckage, however, it was discovered that
the package contained a coffee machine intended for Ahmed Kathrada,
Mandela's parliamentary advisor and former jail-mate.
	   At the time, Kathrada was escorting Arafat around the former
jail on Robben Island the official and Mandela had spent 18 years
as prisoners of white rule.

Taliban allow foreign aid groups to resume operations in Kabul
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds meeting between Taliban and aid agencies set for Monday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Foreign aid groups can resume
operations in the war-ravaged Afghan capital Kabul while they talk
with Taliban rulers about whether to move to dilapidated
dormitories, according to an agreement worked out Wednesday with
the United Nations.
	   ``It is a breakthrough,'' said Bronek Szynalski, acting
coordinator of U.N. humanitarian projects in Afghanistan, who
conducted negotiations with Taliban officials in Kabul this week.
There was no immediate comment from Taliban officials.
	   Szynalski said aid groups could return to Kabul and operate from
their old offices. Meantime, a seven-member committee with members
representing the Taliban, the United Nations and aid groups would
try to find a compromise on the relocation issue.
	   The committee will hold its first meeting Monday, a statement by
the United Nations said.
	   Taliban officials expelled about 200 aid workers from 38
independent humanitarian agencies on July 20 when they refused to
move their homes and offices to dormitories on a university campus
heavily damaged in Afghanistan's long civil war. Aid workers said
the dormitories were unsafe and uninhabitable.
	   ``I am sure we will reach a mutually acceptable agreement in the
next couple of weeks,'' said Charles MacFadden, of Acbar, the
coordinating body for aid groups in Afghanistan. It was unclear
when aid workers, most of whom went to neighboring Pakistan after
being expelled, would begin returning.
	   The aid groups carried out or supplemented U.N. humanitarian
programs including providing food, health care and safe water. Only
the United Nations and the Red Cross were unaffected by the
relocation order.
	   The dormitory dispute capped a long period of friction between
aid groups and Kabul's Taliban rulers.
	   Taliban officials have imposed a strict interpretation of Islam
since capturing Kabul in 1996, barring girls from school and
confining most women to their homes. International aid groups say
Taliban rules hamper their efforts to provide education and other
services to all, while the Taliban accuse the groups of flouting
the country's laws and traditions.

Far from depressed, U.N. suspects seek to boost `hope and faith'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ War crimes suspects held by a U.N.
tribunal in a prison where two have died this summer denied
Wednesday they're preparing for an uprising, calling such reports
``complete nonsense and lies.''
	   In an open letter, the 26 detainees held by the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said reports that characterized them as being
depressed and preparing for riots are ``the result of malicious
disinformation.''
	   ``Far from being depressed, we are seeking ways to increase our
hope and faith that it is worth fighting for justice and truth,''
according to the letter, signed by all 26 suspects.
	   The statement, which was addressed to tribunal president
Gabrielle Kirk McDonald of the United States, was released
Wednesday.
	   The suspects are jailed in the tribunal's holding cell in
Scheveningen, a North Sea town just north of The Hague.
	   In recent months, two Bosnian Serb suspects have died in their
cells, prompting critics to contend that inmates are getting
inadequate medical treatment.
	   Suspect Slavko Dokmanovic committed suicide in his cell in June,
and on Aug. 1, detainee Milan Kovacevic died of a heart attack.
Both deaths have been followed by tribunal investigations.
	   Talks of an uprising came from Serb doctor Slobodan Ivanovic,
who visited the tribunal last week. The doctor reportedly said both
deaths have had a bad effect on the detainees, and that most of
them are in deep depression.
	   But in their letter, the detainees themselves said the deaths
have actually sparked closer bonds between them.
	   ``Every one of us has reacted to these tragic events in his own
way. But they have also brought about something positive: We have
become closer to each other,'' they wrote.
	   Their letter, however, did request daily medical care, more
fresh air and exercise, better food, better accommodation for
visiting family members and lawyers, and television and radio
programs from home.
	   The suspects have also invited Kirk McDonald to visit their
cells and discuss those issues.
	   In a separate letter forwarded to the U.N. Security Council, the
U.N. General Assembly and human rights groups, the suspects called
for fair and speedy trials and complained of what they see as an
inequality of resources between the tribunal's prosecution and the
defense.

Mideast, African embassies tighten security after bombings

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. diplomats who worked in outlying
buildings were moved into the fortified embassy compound in Cairo.
New checkpoints appeared around the American Embassy in Kuwait. At
least two U.S. diplomatic missions _ in Uganda and Sudan _
temporarily closed down.
	   The heightened security _ including some steps not made public _
followed last Friday's twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and a State Department
warning Tuesday that others were at risk.
	   Diplomats in several countries said that ambassadors in the
Middle East and Africa had held special staff meetings to review
security procedures, not only at U.S. embassy buildings but also at
their residences.
	   In most cases, embassy officials declined to discuss specifics
of upgraded security activities _ for security reasons.
	   ``We don't think it's appropriate to disclose any security
arrangements, whether we have or have not taken them,'' said Bill
Blaine, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain.
	   Still, the Bahrain embassy updated its phone-in ``hot line''
service for Americans, urging them to stay vigilant in the wake of
the East African bombings.
	   On Tuesday, the State Department issued a statement in
Washington saying it had ``received information that there may be a
threat to U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen.''
	   It gave no reason for the warning, but said the threatened
actions ``could include attacks on buildings.''
	   The response in Egypt was ``to temporarily relocate some staff
from peripheral U.S. government facilities,'' a statement from the
embassy said.
	   Embassy spokesman David Ballard said this involved diplomats and
Egyptian employees who worked with the U.S. Agency for
International Development at a building several blocks away from
the U.S. Embassy.
	   Most were moved into the embassy compound, which is surrounded
by a high stone wall and guarded by U.S. Marines and Egyptian
security forces.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the U.S. Embassy has suspended public
operations since Monday. On Wednesday, diplomats paid off and shut
down a gas station adjacent to the embassy to prevent it from being
used by a would-be attacker.
	   The American Embassy in the Yemen capital San`a also was closed.
Yemen military jeeps were seen Wednesday patrolling the area around
the embassy, and extra guards were posted at the perimeter.
	   In Kuwait, the embassy closed to the public on Sunday while
diplomats reviewed security procedures, said spokesman Claud Young.
	   It has reopened since, with new checkpoints jointly manned by
Kuwaiti and American security officers set up around the embassy,
which stands alone on a large lot surrounded by a high wall and
concrete barriers.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh on Wednesday issued a statement
saying diplomats and U.S. military personnel stationed in Saudi
Arabia were ``making improvements and changes wherever possible to
lessen their vulnerabilities.'' It gave no specifics.
	   The statement also urged Americans ``to exercise caution in
their daily work habits and to be continually aware of their
surroundings.''
	   A similar statement was issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut,
Lebanon, where extremists car-bombed embassies in 1983 and 1984.
	   ``We are coordinating with the Lebanese government on security
issues,'' said spokeswoman Maha Hamdan. ``We are in a state of
alert, but we can't go into details concerning security measures.''
	   Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy said Tuesday that
about half a dozen embassies suspended operations after the
bombing, but he declined to name them.
	   In addition to Malaysia and Yemen, they appeared to include
those in Kampala, Uganda, which has been closed since Monday, and
in Sudan.
	   In the Sudanese capital Khartoum, the gates of the U.S. Embassy
were chained and locked, and no one has answered telephone calls to
embassy numbers this week. But uniformed Sudanese police still
stand watch outside.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Sudan in January 1996,
when Washington said it couldn't guarantee their security. They
periodically return from offices in Nairobi and Cairo to provide
consular and other services.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Swaziland was evacuated for several hours
Tuesday after a phoned bomb threat. Sniffer dogs searched the
embassy and a nearby building housing embassy offices and found
nothing, an American spokeswoman said.

	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Torrential rains flooded streams and
triggered landslides in central South Korea Wednesday, killing at
least eight people and forcing thousands of farmers to flee their
homes.
	   Another five people were missing in landslides and floods
triggered by the downpour that buffeted Poun, Sangju and three
other counties, about 150 kilometers (93 miles) southeast of Seoul,
the Home Ministry said.
	   Rain-swollen streams overflowed early Wednesday, submerging
5,000 homes and forcing at least 18,000 people, mostly farmers, to
run for higher ground, ministry officials said.
	   Nearly all of those killed were elderly farmers who could not
escape quickly in the darkness, they said.
	   Thousands more were being urged to abandon their homes along the
Nakdong River, which rose dangerously high.
	   With dams discharging water from swollen reservoirs and weather
forecasters expecting more rain, a flood warning was issued along
the other major rivers cutting through central South Korea.
	   Up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) of rain fell in central South
Korea Wednesday. Roads were washed away and telephone poles downed,
cutting off small villages, police said.
	   More casualties and property damage may be reported when
communications to remote villages are restored, they said.
	   Kim So-rae, 85, was killed when flood water engulfed her home
early Wednesday. A 67-year-old woman was found dead after her home
collapsed under a landslide.
	   At least six other people were killed in landslides or
floodwaters in nearby towns.
	   Floods and landslides in the Seoul metropolitan area and central
South Korea have killed 189 people, including 13 South Korean and
U.S. soldiers, and left 51 missing since last week. A week earlier,
flash floods raging down mountain valleys at the southern tip of
the Korean Peninsula killed 67 campers and left 29 missing.
	   More than 136,000 people have been driven from their homes by
the on-again, off-again rains, and property damage is estimated at
up to dlrs 2 billion.

Russian markets rises a day after falling
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with top officials' reassurance to
support ruble, SUBS final 5 grafs with 3 grafs on strikes across
country, minor edits throughout. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top Russian officials pledged anew Wednesday to
support the national currency and make debt payments, in an effort
to reassure foreign investors and stabilize the stock market after
a plunge the day before.
	   ``If we though that devaluation was unavoidable, we would not be
taking the measures we are taking now,'' said Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov, referring to the government's austerity program.
	   The Russian stock market fell more than 9 points Tuesday,
following market tumbles across Asia and in anticipation of drops
in the United States. The market opened higher Wednesday.
	   Zadornov said the government can guarantee its debt payments and
support the ruble because of increased tax revenues collected in
July and August. He also said that about dlrs 1 billion of an
International Monetary Fund loan will be set aside for these
purposes.
	   The IMF and other international lenders have put together a dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package for Russia. In exchange, they demanded
tough economic reforms, including better tax collection.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, visiting an aircraft engine
factory in central Russia, told reporters that the government
``must pursue our economic policy more precisely and firmly in the
face of falling markets,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia's market has been in a free fall for several months, both
because of the Asian financial crisis and because of fundamental
problems in the slow transition from a command economy.
	   Despite repeated government assurances that it can stave off
another run on the markets, foreign investors still worry that
Russia cannot.
	   In labor unrest in Russia on Wednesday, striking emergency
medical workers and regional officials in the eastern port city of
Vladivostok failed to end a strike that has left the city with only
four on-duty ambulances instead of the usual 30.
	   The workers are demanding months of back wages that have not
been paid because local and regional officials disagree over who
should fund the service.
	   And striking coal miners near Vorkuta, 1,900 kilometers (1,200
miles) northeast of Moscow, threatened to flood their mine if they
don't get twelve months of back wages.

Report: Reinsurance group says Indonesian riot losses not covered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An international reinsurance
association has decided that the majority of losses incurred in
riots in Indonesia in May are not covered by existing insurance
contracts, a news report said Wednesday.
	   In a letter to the Indonesia Insurance Council obtained by Dow
Jones Newswires, the Singapore Reinsurers Association said the
magnitude and scale of the events in May resembled more a ``civil
commotion'' or ``popular uprising'' than riots and thus aren't
covered by insurance policies.
	   The association stressed it hasn't taken a definitive view on
the situation, but ``with each passing day, new evidence has been
uncovered which tends to point out that the riots were organized.''
	   ``This would further strengthen our view that most of the losses
are excluded,'' it said.
	   Insurance policies that include a clause covering ``riots,
strikes and malicious damages'' tend to exclude losses incurred
from civil commotion or popular uprising of an organized nature.
	   However, the association said it couldn't make a blanket
recommendation to its members not to cover all losses, as different
parts of Indonesia were affected in different ways by the civil
unrest.
	   In Jakarta, for instance, the unrest was much more severe than
in other parts of the country.
	   May's violence left about 1,200 people dead. Thousands of
buildings and homes burned or damaged.
	   Women's groups claim that more than 150 women and girls were
raped.
	   The rioting, which followed a wave of student protests, led to
the resignation of autocratic former President Suharto.
	   Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority, many of them Christians or
Buddhists, were targeted by mobs.
	   Chinese make up only a fraction of the 202 million population,
but dominate commerce and industry.
	   As such they have been made scapegoats for a deep economic
crisis gripping the predominantly Muslim nation.

Swedish soccer star Tomas Brolin quits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish soccer international Tomas Brolin,
28, announced Wednesday that he is giving up his career.

<TEXT>
	   Brolin was Sweden's No. 1 player in the 1994 World Cup in the
United States, where Sweden finished third. After the World Cup, he
was selected to the World Team. Brolin was then playing for Italy's
Parma.
	   After breaking his leg during a match for Sweden, Brolin could
not keep his place in Parma and got at transfer to England's Leeds,
but never came to terms with that team's coach.
	   Brolin last season played for Crystal Palace, which finished in
the last place in England's Premier League.
	   ``I do not feel like playing elite soccer any longer,'' Brolin
told a news conference in Stockholm.
	   Brolin, who looked overweight and out of shape, has been
criticized by the Swedish press for spending more time in night
clubs with his jet set friends than trying to get fit again.
	   Brolin declared that he from now on will dedicate himself to the
marketing of sports shoes.

Development Bank of Singapore reports 50 percent drop in net
</HEADLINE>
profit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Development Bank of Singapore, one of the
city-state's Big Four banks, on Wednesday reported a 50 percent
drop in net profit for the first half of 1998.
	   The government-linked bank, which also is one of Southeast
Asia's biggest banks, said its profit fell to 178.6 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 105 million) following an increase in
bad-loan provisions.
	   For the first half of 1998, provisions set aside for possible
loan losses and other asset deterioration reached 315.5 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 185 million), up from 52.4 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 30 million) in 1997's first half.
	   Of this total, 110.7 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 64 million)
was set aside ``to meet contingencies which may arise from the
group's regional exposure,'' the bank said.
	   The half-year report continues the trend from 1997, when the
bank noted a 35 percent drop in net profit to 436 million Singapore
dollars (dlrs 268 million).
	   The main reason for the bank's profit drop last year was a
five-fold increase in the amount of funds set aside to cover
unforeseen contingencies, mainly uncollectable loans resulting from
the regional currency crisis.
	   By the end of 1997, the bank's provisions had climbed to 495
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 291 million), with 63 percent of
that described as a precautionary measure against ``a possible
further deterioration in the quality of the group's regional
exposures.''

Filipinos eating 5 percent less rice
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Filipinos are eating less rice
because of a combination of poverty and the influence of fast
foods, the agriculture secretary said Wednesday.
	   In a report to the president on rice and corn supplies,
Agriculture Secretary William Dar said the average Filipino ate
97.2 kilograms (214 pounds) of rice last year, down from 103
kilograms (227 pounds) the previous crop year.
	   He said one reason is a decline in the purchasing power of
people, particularly in rural areas. Many Filipinos in urban areas
also have shifted to eating more bread and pasta because of the
influence of fast food chains, he said.
	   Dar said the total rice supply this crop year is estimated at
9.55 million tons, including stocks of 1.8 million tons, production
of 6.49 million tons and imports of 1.2 million tons.
	   As of June, the country had a 92-day supply of rice, he said.
	   On Tuesday, Dar said the Department of Agriculture has requested
a 25 billion peso (dlrs 580 million) annual budget for the next
five years to boost the country's rice production.
	   Much of the extra money will go for irrigating more rice land
and ensuring national rice self-sufficiency by 2003, Dar said.

Indonesia wants foreign intelligence officials to join rape
</HEADLINE>
investigation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Responding to international protests,
Indonesia wants foreign intelligence officials to help investigate
allegations of mass rapes during rioting in May, a Cabinet minister
said Wednesday.
	   Women's rights groups estimate at least 168 women and girls,
most from the ethnic Chinese minority, were raped during the riots
that helped drive former Indonesian President Suharto from power.
	   Twenty of the women reportedly were killed by their attackers or
died later of injuries.
	   About 1,200 people were killed in May's violence and hundreds of
homes and buildings, mainly Chinese-owned, were looted, damaged and
burned.
	   Outrage over the anti-Chinese attacks has galvanized ethnic
Chinese worldwide, sparking protests outside several Indonesian
diplomatic posts and calls for action by Beijing.
	   Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiyah said President B.J.
Habibie had been ``upset and surprised'' by international criticism
of Indonesia, including anti-Indonesian messages on the Internet.
	   She said he had ordered Indonesian officials to ask intelligence
officers from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United States to
take part in an official investigation into the rapes that already
has begun.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population
but control an estimated 70 percent of the country's wealth.
	   As such, they have been made into scapegoats for the worst
economic crisis in 30 years.

Georgian parliament calls for end to Abkhazian military action
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The Georgian parliament called Wednesday
for an end to military action by separatist Abkhazians.
	   Violence has broken out sporadically since a 13-month war in
Abkhazia, located on the northwest coast of the Black Sea, despite
the presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region.
	   ``The aggravation of tension in the zone of conflict and the
expansion of its scope correspond to the interests of forces that
are hampering progress in settling the conflict,'' a Georgian
parliamentary commission said Wednesday, according to parliamentary
spokesman Sulkhan Meladze.
	   Abkhazian gunmen opened fire Tuesday on ethnic Georgians' homes
and wounded one person, officials said. Georgian troops returned
fire, forcing the gunmen to flee. Five houses were burned down in
the skirmish.
	   Abkhazia's Interior Ministry said in a statement Tuesday that
Georgian militants have killed 24 people this summer in the Ghali
district, among them 13 Abkhazian soldiers, five Russian
peacekeepers, and six civilians.
	   Gunmen loyal to Georgia's government ambushed a patrol vehicle
in Abkhazia on Tuesday, killing four policemen.
	   A Russian Foreign Ministry statement released after the attack
called on Georgia and Abkhazia to uphold peace agreements drafted
after their 1993 war, in which separatist in Abkhazia drove out
Georgian troops and ethnic Georgian civilians.

Farmers launch tax protest over murders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIETERMARITZBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Local farmers on Tuesday
launched a tax boycott and say they will picket an international
heads-of-state meeting to protest a wave of farm attacks around the
country.
	   The KwaZulu-Natal Agricultural Union urged farmers to pay taxes
into a trust fund that will generate interest to pay for farmers'
legal defense and vigilante anti-crime activities.
	   Nearly 80 farmers, mostly white, have been slain this year,
bringing the total to 554 since 1994's first all-race election
ended apartheid.
	   The group's president, Graham McIntosh, said it would rally up
to 50,00 farmers at the Nonaligned Movement conference in Durban
later this month unless such a gathering would pose ``a problem to
the stretched resources of the security for the conference.''
	   ``We've had huge support for (the rally idea) from both black
and white farmers since it was first announced over farm radio last
Friday,'' McIntosh said.

Far from depressed, U.N. suspects seek to boost `hope and faith'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ War crimes suspects held by a
United Nations tribunal in a prison where two have died this summer
denied Wednesday that they're preparing for an uprising, calling
such reports ``complete nonsense and lies.''
	   In an open letter, the 26 detainees held by the Yugoslav war
crimes tribunal said reports characterizing them as being depressed
and preparing for riots are ``the result of malicious
disinformation.''
	   ``Far from being depressed, we are seeking ways to increase our
hope and faith that it is worth fighting for justice and truth,''
according to the letter, signed by all 26 suspects.
	   The statement, addressed to tribunal president Gabrielle Kirk
McDonald of the United States, was released Wednesday.
	   The suspects are jailed in the tribunal's holding cell in
Scheveningen, a North Sea town just north of The Hague.
	   In recent months, two Bosnian Serb suspects have died in their
cells, prompting critics to contend that inmates are getting
inadequate medical treatment.
	   Suspect Slavko Dokmanovic committed suicide in his cell in June.
Detainee Milan Kovacevic died Aug. 1 of a heart attack. Both deaths
have been followed by tribunal investigations.
	   Talks of an uprising came from Serb doctor Slobodan Ivanovic,
who visited the tribunal last week. The doctor reportedly said both
deaths have had a bad effect on the detainees, and that most of
them are in deep depression.
	   But in their letter, the detainees themselves said the deaths
have actually sparked closer bonds.
	   ``Every one of us has reacted to these tragic events in his own
way. But they have also brought about something positive: We have
become closer to each other,'' they wrote.
	   Their letter, however, did request daily medical care, more
fresh air and exercise, better food, better accommodation for
visiting family members and lawyers, and television and radio
programs from home.
	   The suspects have also invited Kirk McDonald to visit their
cells and discuss those issues.
	   In a separate letter forwarded to the U.N. Security Council, the
U.N. General Assembly and human rights groups, the suspects called
for fair and speedy trials and complained of what they see as an
inequality of resources between the tribunal's prosecution and the
defense.

Netanyahu asks Cabinet for increased defense budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Citing ``increasing nearby and distant
threats,'' Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu asked his Cabinet on
Wednesday to increase defense spending for the first time since the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords in 1993.
	   The Cabinet was debating a 1999 budget that would reportedly
increase the defense budget by 2 billion shekels (543 million
dlrs), while still cutting overall spending by 2.2 billion shekels
(598 million dlrs).
	   Netanyahu said he was proposing a multi-year program to increase
the defense budget ``in light of increasing nearby and distant
threats.''
	   Several commentators attributed the request to the deadlock in
talks with the Palestinians and rising tensions with the Arab
world, but Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the prime
minister was referring to the growing danger of confrontation with
Iran and possibly Iraq.
	   Netanyahu said last week that Israel would invest in military
responses to Iran's recent test of the Shahab-3 missile, which is
capable of reaching Israeli cities.
	   In light of such developments, Israel needs ``to confront the
worst-case scenarios,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   ``It doesn't have to do with this government's policy or stance
in relation to the peace process'' with the Palestinians, he said.
	   Bar-Illan said Israel would invest in increased intelligence
capabilities and missile defense, but declined to be more specific.
	   Israel and the United States are jointly developing the Arrow
antimissile missile, at an estimated cost of dlrs 1.6 billion.
	   Zeev Schiff, military analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz,
said the increased defense budget is needed in part to modernize
the military's aging equipment and ammunition.
	   But he said Netanyahu's hardline policies were also a factor.
	   ``It looks very much like the government decided that it sees
complete deadlock and hostilities in its future, and not just with
the Palestinians,'' Schiff said.
	   ``You can't have a policy of confrontation and expect everything
to be quiet.''
	   Yossi Beilin, a leading figure in the opposition Labor Party,
said Netanyahu wanted more money for defense ``because there is now
intelligence information that a war is not impossible for the first
time in four years.
	   ``Nothing could be more symbolic than this of the missed
opportunity under the Netanyahu government,'' he said.
	   If the Cabinet approves the budget plan, it would go to Israeli
lawmakers in the fall. By law, the Knesset has to pass a spending
plan by Dec. 31.
	   If the Knesset approved the increased defense spending, it would
reportedly be the first increase _ when adjusted for inflation _ in
a decade.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Trucking companies will begin an
open-ended strike Thursday to protest a government decision to curb
trucks during the tourist season, newspapers said Wednesday.
	   Unions representing truck owners and the quarrying industry
decided on the strike at a meeting Tuesday that was called to
discuss the decision by the governor of Mount Lebanon province,
Mohammed Suheil Yammout, to ban trucks from driving during the
morning rush hour and restricting them to certain roads after that.
	   Yammout says the ban will apply to September 30.
	   The Daily Star newspaper said the quarriers would go on strike
Wednesday and truck companies would follow Thursday.
	   Truck drivers have been blamed for aggravating Lebanon's long
traffic jams and for causing road accidents.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan has boosted its production of
natural gas by 26 percent owing to increased output from an eastern
field, the chairman of the National Petroleum Company said
Wednesday.
	   Thabet Taher said further drilling at a natural gas field in
Risheh, 270 kilometers (162 miles) northeast of the capital Amman,
had increased output from 500,000 cubic feet (15,000 cubic meters)
a day to more than 7 million cubic feet (210,000 cubic meters) a
day.
	   ``The kingdom's overall gas production has risen from 27 million
cubic feet (810,000 cubic meters) a day to 34 million cubic feet
(1,02 million cubic meters) a day as result,'' Taher said.
	   The company plans to upgrade the Risheh gas field soon in order
to produce 45 million cubic feet a day (1,35 million cubic meters)
a day, he added.
	   The gas from Risheh is mainly used for generating power.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The United Fisheries of Kuwait Co. has posted
losses of 1.2 million dinars (dlrs 3.92 million) in the first half
of the year, the Kuwait Stock Exchange announced Wednesday.
	   The losses are nearly four times as large as those incurred in
the first half of 1997.
	   Managing Director Amer al-Tamimi put the losses down to the
company's bearing the losses of two subsidiary firms as well as the
fact that the fishing season in the northern Gulf had not yet
started.
	   Al-Tamimi said he expects the company to make up for the losses
in the second half. The fishing season starts Sept. 1.
	   United Fisheries of Kuwait is listed on the exchange with a
paid-up capital of 15 million dinars (dlrs 49 million). Earlier
this year the government sold its 50 percent share in the company
to the private sector.
	   The company sells its product locally and abroad.

Kohl promises to make tax reform top priority of fifth term
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kohl saying he'll give up party chairmanship if
defeated; size of tax cut; other details; tightens &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Election Poll &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl seemed to soften a
bit Wednesday on the possibility of his party joining the main
opposition in a ``grand coalition'' after national elections.
	   While political analysts have called the scenario increasingly
likely in recent weeks, Kohl, who is seeking a fifth term, has so
far categorically ruled out participating in such a coalition after
the Sept. 27 vote.
	   But for the first time Wednesday, he said he would step down as
Christian Democratic party chief if he loses, which would clear the
way for his parliamentary faction leader, Wolfgang Schaeuble, to
take the reins.
	   And instead of saying a ``grand coalition'' was out of the
question, he said he didn't think his Social Democratic challenger,
Gerhard Schroeder, would reach a position to negotiate such a
partnership.
	   Schroeder, who has a slim lead in the polls, has said he would
turn to the Christian Democrats if coalition talks with the
environmentalist Greens don't work out.
	   But Kohl continued to express optimism that voters would turn to
his own center-right coalition in the final weeks, and promised a
30 billion mark (dlrs 17 billion) tax cut to combat unemployment if
re-elected.
	   ``We're on a good path,'' Kohl said at a news conference to
present the final planks _ on economics and immigration _ in his
campaign platform.
	   Promising ``security, dependability and stability,'' Kohl said
his government would again take up proposals to lower tax rates
immediately after the election.
	   Kohl insists such a reform would improve Germany's business
climate and aid in the fight on unemployment, the core issue in
this year's election campaign.
	   His reform package was blocked last year in the upper house of
parliament, which the left-leaning Social Democrats control. They
argued the plan was too generous to the wealthy and would have
forced welfare cuts because it had no provisions for making up for
lost tax revenues.
	   Schroeder has sought to steer his party toward a ``new center,''
even suggesting last week he could work with the Christian
Democrats on tax reform after the election.
	   But Kohl accused Schroeder of seeking only to deceive voters and
declared the election ``a clear campaign about direction.''
	   Regarding immigration, Schaeuble said the state must work to
better integrate foreigners, but they also had a responsibility to
make an effort to fit into German society.

Tourism in China booming despite Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite a decline in visitors from other Asian
countries, the number of foreign tourists traveling to China rose
13 percent in the first half of this year, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported Wednesday.
	   The number of visitors to China between January and June rose to
30.18 million, while China's tourism earnings in those months
climbed to dlrs 5.96 billion, an increase of 8.81 percent from
January-June last year, Xinhua cited the China National Tourism
Administration as saying.
	   It said the number of Asian visitors in the first half of the
year fell by 8.11 percent, with significant declines in arrivals
from Thailand, South Korea, and Malaysia _ some of the countries
hardest hit by the regional financial crisis.
	   The number of overseas Chinese tourists rose 21.53 percent from
a year earlier, while tourism revenues from that group rose 44.28
percent.
	   Arrivals from Hong Kong and Macau climbed 16.19 percent, but the
amount of their spending in China increased only by 9.25 percent
over the same period last year.
	   The report said the number of visitors from Australia and
Kazakstan grew by more than 20 percent.

Official: Uzbek troops on alert as Taliban approaches border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 12th graf with Tajik Foreign Ministry denying
Tajik armed forces fighting in Afghanistan. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Afghanistan &QL; 
 &UR; By TIMOFEI ZHUKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's Taliban movement has
captured an Afghan city just across the border from Uzbekistan, and
Uzbek border troops have been put on alert to guard against a
possible spillover of violence, a government official said
Wednesday.
	   The Taliban have captured Hayratan, a city on the Afghan side of
the Amu Darya River, which marks the border with Uzbekistan, said
an Uzbek Defense Ministry official, who asked not to be identified
by name.
	   All Uzbek border troops along the 147-kilometer (90-mile)
stretch of the border with Afghanistan have been put on high alert,
said the Defense Ministry official.
	   Russia has said it was ready to fortify the borders of the
former Soviet republics to prevent Afghanistan's turmoil from
spreading elsewhere in Central Asia.
	   ``The situation in Afghanistan is very complicated; the threat
to the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) borders has
grown,'' Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Wednesday in
Moscow.
	   ``We are constantly and closely following the developments in
Afghanistan, and naturally are taking appropriate steps to
strengthen our troops,'' Sergeyev said.
	   Russia has for years had 25,000 Russian troops in Tajikistan,
where they help support the government and guard the country's
border with Afghanistan.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin said military experts and soldiers from Pakistan were
aiding the Taliban, Interfax reported.
	   ``Massive military assistance from the outside encourages the
Taliban, fueling a dangerous armed conflict,'' Nesterushkin was
quoted as saying.
	   In Tajikistan, the government said the fighting was approaching
its border, and appealed to the warring sides and to the United
Nations to act urgently to stop the conflict.
	   A government statement said that the turmoil in Afghanistan has
in some areas reached the Tajik border, and Tajikistan's security
is under ``direct threat,'' Interfax reported.
	   The Tajik Foreign Ministry on Wednesday denied what it called
``provocative and baseless'' Russian media reports that Tajik
troops were fighting on the side of the Northern Alliance, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Afghanistan's fundamentalist, Taliban forces have been advancing
in the country's north and recently captured several key cities,
including the opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   However, the Taliban have said they are only seeking to take
full control of Afghanistan and have no designs on their neighbors.
Still, a Taliban takeover of northern Afghanistan could send
refugees and weapons streaming into the former Soviet republics of
Central Asia.
	   Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov said his country will not
be able to avoid Afghanistan's influence if the Taliban wins, the
ITAR-Tass and Interfax news agencies reported.
	   ``No matter how much we calm ourselves down, the situation on
the border will have a negative effect on the general atmosphere,''
Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov was quoted as saying by
ITAR-Tass.

Myanmar pro-democracy leader blocked again from traveling

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government on
Wednesday blocked a fresh attempt by pro-democracy leader Aung San
Suu Kyi to travel outside the capital to meet with members of her
political party, claiming the journey was ``unsafe.''
	   Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, was headed
for Bassein, 160 kilometers (100 miles) west of Yangon, when she
was stopped at the same roadblock where she had been held up for
six days last month, government and party sources confirmed.
	   ``The government of Myanmar regrets that security conditions in
Ayarwaddy Division make it unsafe for Ms. Suu Kyi to travel there
at this time but the government encourages Ms. Suu Kyi to return
home and continue her political activities in a more secure
environment in Yangon,'' said a government statement.
	   It didn't explain what was unsafe about the journey. Her
activities in the capital are severely restricted.
	   Suu Kyi's previous journey ended on July 29 after a six-day
standoff where she was blocked 32 kilometers (19 miles) west of the
capital. Authorities seized her car, forcibly restrained her and
drove her back to her home against her will. She spent several days
recovering from a high fever and dehydration.
	   The government statement said Suu Kyi and her companions
``remain free to return to their homes at any time or to continue
staying by the roadside as long as the conditions remain safe.''
	   Suu Kyi was again accompanied Wednesday by Hla Pe, a 75-year-old
member of her party's central executive committee, as well as two
drivers.
	   In apparent preparation for another standoff, she was traveling
in a friend's van instead of the sedan she had used on previous
trips. The van would allow more comfort for an extended stay and be
able to carry more food and water.
	   Suu Kyi's six-day confrontation garnered international
attention, with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright saying
that the United States would hold Myanmar's government directly
responsible for her welfare.
	   Her latest challenge follows the detention of 18 foreign
democracy activists for handing out anti-government leaflets on the
streets of Yangon on Sunday.
	   The detainees include six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippine citizens and an
Australian. They have not yet been formally charged with any crime.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, is largely
confined to her home and has little political maneuvering room. But
she has recently stepped up challenges to the government.
	   The foray Wednesday was her fourth attempt in two months to
drive outside Yangon. More importantly, she has given the military
an Aug. 21 deadline to seat the parliament elected in a 1990
general election.
	   The military, which has ruled Myanmar _ also known as Burma _
since 1962, allowed the election to go forward but refused to honor
the result when Suu Kyi's party won a landslide victory.
	   A Myanmar exile opposition group claimed Wednesday that four
would-be members of parliament from her party were detained earlier
this month for defying the military's orders restricting their
movements.
	   The All Burma Students' Democratic Front said the number of such
detentions since mid-June now totaled 83. The report could not
immediately be confirmed.
	   The league's elected lawmakers have faced fierce repression,
with nearly 200 dead, imprisoned or in exile. In addition to the
latest alleged detentions, the All Burma Students' Democratic Front
said two other members had been intimidated into resigning from
parliament.
	   Last month, the government denied it had detained any of them,
saying they had only been ``temporarily prevented'' from leaving
their hometowns to prevent them from agitating among students.
	   The military has allowed Suu Kyi to travel outside Yangon only
once since releasing her from six years of formal house arrest in
July 1995, to visit a Buddhist monk.
	   Since September 1996, the government has installed police
checkpoints near Suu Kyi's lakeside compound, refusing journalists
entry and restricting access by diplomats and party members.
	   Government security personnel installed inside her compound were
withdrawn Friday on her demand. The government has added security
checkpoints on nearby roads and has searched cars leaving her home.
	   On Saturday, Myanmar marked the 10th anniversary of a nationwide
uprising against military rule. It was eventually crushed by
troops. An estimated 3,000 people died.
	   Myanmar's own people were calm on the anniversary. A day later,
however, 18 foreign democracy activists were arrested after handing
out leaflets urging people to remember the uprising. They were
still being held Wednesday.

Mideast, African embassies tighten security after bombings

Malaysia embassy remains closed. &QL;

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ U.S. diplomats who worked in outlying
buildings were moved into the fortified embassy compound in Cairo.
New checkpoints appeared around the American Embassy in Kuwait. At
least four U.S. diplomatic missions temporarily closed down.
	   The heightened security _ including some steps not made public _
followed last Friday's twin bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and a U.S. State
Department warning Tuesday that others were at risk.
	   Diplomats in several countries said ambassadors in the Middle
East and Africa held special staff meetings to review security
procedures, not only at U.S. embassy buildings but also at their
residences.
	   In most cases, embassy officials declined to discuss specifics
of upgraded security activities for security reasons.
	   ``We don't think it's appropriate to disclose any security
arrangements, whether we have or have not taken them,'' said Bill
Blaine, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Bahrain, where it updated
its phone-in ``hot line'' service for Americans, urging them to
stay vigilant.
	   On Tuesday, the State Department issued a statement in
Washington saying it ``received information that there may be a
threat to U.S. interests in Egypt, Malaysia and Yemen.''
	   It gave no reason for the warning, but said the threatened
actions ``could include attacks on buildings.''
	   The response in Egypt was ``to temporarily relocate some staff
from peripheral U.S. government facilities,'' an embassy statement
said.
	   Embassy spokesman David Ballard said this involved diplomats and
Egyptian employees who worked with the U.S. Agency for
International Development at a building several blocks away from
the U.S. Embassy.
	   Most were moved into the embassy compound, which is surrounded
by a high stone wall and guarded by U.S. Marines and Egyptian
security forces.
	   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the U.S. Embassy has suspended public
operations since Monday. On Wednesday, diplomats paid off and shut
down an adjacent gas station to prevent it from being used by a
would-be attacker.
	   The American Embassy in the Yemen capital San`a also was closed.
Yemen military jeeps were seen Wednesday patrolling the area around
the embassy, and extra guards were posted at the perimeter.
	   In Kuwait, the embassy closed to the public on Sunday while
diplomats reviewed security procedures, said spokesman Claud Young.
	   It has reopened since, with new checkpoints jointly manned by
Kuwaiti and American security officers set up around the embassy,
which stands alone on a large lot surrounded by a high wall and
concrete barriers.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh on Wednesday issued a statement
saying diplomats and U.S. military personnel stationed in Saudi
Arabia were ``making improvements and changes wherever possible to
lessen their vulnerabilities.'' It gave no specifics.
	   The statement also urged Americans ``to exercise caution in
their daily work habits and to be continually aware of their
surroundings.''
	   A similar statement was issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut,
Lebanon, where extremists car-bombed embassies in 1983 and 1984.
	   ``We are coordinating with the Lebanese government on security
issues,'' said spokeswoman Maha Hamdan. ``We are in a state of
alert, but we can't go into details concerning security measures.''
	   Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy said Tuesday that
about half a dozen embassies suspended operations after the
bombing, but he declined to name them.
	   In addition to Malaysia and Yemen, they appeared to include
those in Kampala, Uganda, which has been closed since Monday, and
in Sudan.
	   In the Sudanese capital Khartoum, the gates of the U.S. Embassy
were chained and locked, and no one has answered telephone calls to
embassy numbers this week. But uniformed Sudanese police still
stand watch outside.
	   American diplomats were pulled out of Sudan in January 1996,
when Washington said it couldn't guarantee their security. They
periodically return from offices in Nairobi and Cairo to provide
consular and other services.
	   The U.S. Embassy in Swaziland was evacuated for several hours
Tuesday after a phoned bomb threat. Sniffer dogs searched the
embassy and a nearby building housing embassy offices and found
nothing, an American spokeswoman said.

Ukrainian president orders amnesty for about 25,000 convicts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma approved
an amnesty Wednesday for about 25,000 prisoners, the presidential
press service said.
	   The measure was approved last month by Ukraine's parliament. It
provides for an early release for young women, prisoners with
children under 16 years of age, invalids, elderly prisoners and
those convicted of petty crimes.
	   Ukraine's prisons now house about 325,000 people.
	   Authorities in the former Soviet republic have declared seven
amnesties since independence in 1991. More than 31,000 convicts
were pardoned last year, the Interfax news agency said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Amoseas Indonesia Inc., a contractor
of the state-run Pertamina oil company, has successfully tested the
world's largest dry steam geothermal well in West Java, according
to a statement Wednesday.
	   The well, called DRJ-21, was drilled to a total depth of 7,406
feet (2,389 meters), and is able to produce 68 kilograms (150
pounds) of dry steam per second, equivalent to more than 40
megawatts of electricity.
	   Pertamina said in a statement that Amoseas had earlier completed
a test on another nearby well with a production capacity of 32
megawatts.
	   The wells will supply a 70-megawatt power plant under
construction near Garut, 200 kilometers (125 miles) east of
Jakarta.
	   Amoseas Indonesia is jointly controlled by Chevron Corp. and
Texaco Inc.

Bosnian Serb government bans pro-Karadzic news agency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Bosnian Serb
government suspended Wednesday the official news agency, loyal to
supporters of war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic, on grounds of
``biased'' and ``imbalance'' reporting.
	   Rajko Vasic, the Bosnian Serb Information Minister, said he was
suspending the Bosnian Serb News Agency, or SRNA, until further
notice because of its ``biased reporting, fabrications and changing
of the speeches of top state officials and apparent imbalance in
the length of the reports about the state and local officials.''
	   SRNA was notorious for being one of the main propaganda tools
for Karadzic and his aides, who led the Bosnian Serbs into
rebellion in 1992 on a wave of ethnic hatred. After the Dayton
peace agreement stopped the fighting between Bosnia's Croats,
Muslims and Serbs in 1995, the agency stayed in business. It is the
only official news outlet that remains loyal to Karadzic and the
hardliners based in Pale, east of Sarajevo.
	   Karadzic lost his grip on power in the Serb half of Bosnia last
year when pro-Western President Biljana Plavsic challenged him and
rallied supporters around her in Banja Luka, winning parliamentary
elections last fall.
	   Shutting down the agency weeks ahead of general elections,
scheduled for Sep. 13-14, is expected to undermine the position of
pro-Karadzic camp. But the move could also heighten the tensions in
the Serb-run half of Bosnia, increasing the risk of violence.
	   The pro-Karadzic Serb Democratic Party pulled out the election
campaign Tuesday, citing an alleged witch hunt, after Plavisic's
head of police accused top hard-line official Momcilo Krajisnik of
orchestrating the killing of the Pale police chief, who had
recently become a supporter of the president.

	   It said a medical team headed by an American specialist operated
on Fahd, who is in his mid-70s. It identified the U.S. doctor as
Ted Pappas of Duke University.
	   Fahd was admitted to the King Faisal Specialist Hospital on Aug.
2. Wednesday's operation came following consultations with
specialists from the United States, France, Italy and Germany.
	   The statement said consultations also were conducted via
satellite with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995 and, two months later,
temporarily handed over power to his half-brother, Crown Prince
Abdullah.
	   Fahd has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.

Kohl says no U.N. mandate needed for NATO intervention in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Wednesday NATO
could intervene in Yugoslavia's troubled Kosovo province even
without a U.N. mandate.
	   While the U.N. Security Council must play a ``decisive role'' in
any military intervention, a situation could develop, like in
Bosnia, where the pressure of world opinion impels action, Kohl
said.
	   Washington has insisted no new Security Council resolution is
needed for NATO force to be used in Kosovo, but other permanent
council members disagree.

German high court rules families can be separated during asylum
</HEADLINE>
case &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Family members who apply for asylum in
different European countries don't have a basic right to live
together while their cases are being decided, Germany's highest
court ruled Wednesday.
	   The Federal Constitutional Court said such a temporary
separation did not violate the constitutional protection accorded
marriage and family.
	   The court ruled on a case involving a Turkish Kurd who went to
Spain in October 1995 and applied there for asylum. His family was
already in Germany and had applied for asylum here; their case is
still pending.
	   The father went back to Turkey and then flew to Germany, where
he applied for asylum again. His application was not accepted
because under the European Union's Schengen treaty, his case must
be decided in the first EU country he entered _ namely, Spain.
	   But he appealed his deportation to Spain and remains in Germany.
	   Meanwhile, Spain denied his asylum application in 1996, so the
court said he had to go back to Turkey now to apply to join his
family in Germany.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Yakushev, who played on the Soviet
Union's national hockey team during some of its most dominant
years, was elected coach of Russia's national team Wednesday, a
news agency said.
	   Yakushev won two Olympic gold medals and four world and European
championships during his time on the Soviet team. He played on the
famed 1972 series between Canada and the now-defunct Soviet Union
and later became a coach.
	   Russia's hockey powerhouse has fallen on hard times since the
Soviet Union collapsed and funding dried up. Most of the country's
talented players now play in the west instead of skating for poorly
financed Russian clubs.

Roma coach questioned by prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with quotes from FIFA president Sepp Blatter &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ The coach of AS Roma, who has shaken up the
Italian soccer world, was questioned by a prosecutor Wednesday
about his allegations that some top players may use
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Zdenek Zemen walked past reporters without commenting following
a 2 1/2-hour session with prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello.
	   Following questioning Tuesday by Italian Olympic Committee
officials, Zemen stood his ground, insisting a series of published
remarks he made were for the good of soccer on an ``ethical
issue.''
	   He underlined, however, he never spoke specifically of drugs but
of ``medicines'' and that he did not have specific names of
medicines in mind.
	   He had particularly drawn the ire of officials of soccer dynasty
Juventus by expressing his ``amazement'' at the quick muscular
development of current star Alessandro Del Piero and former star
Gianluca Vialli, now player-coach of English club Chelsea.
	   Sepp Blatter, the president of soccer's governing body, told the
Gazetta dello Sport daily that soccer is a clean sport. But he
called on governments to approve stiff anti-doping laws,
``otherwise soccer will lose credibility and the public will lose
interest.''
	   The FIFA president said he was closely monitoring the Italian
case and would make the fight against doping his main priority this
season.
	   The head of Juventus' medical team, Riccardo Agricola, denied
administering steroids or other banned substances to his players
and said he doubted other teams used them.
	   ``Healthy people practice sports and healthy people don't need
to take medicines,'' Zemen said Tuesday.
	   After the Turin session, Zemen rejoined his club in pre-season
training in the Alps north of Venice.

Lord Chancellor wants to disrobe tradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's chief legal officer is taking another
swipe at tradition by asking to swap his traditional breeches, silk
stockings and buckled shoes for a business suit when in the House
of Lords.
	   Lord Irvine of Lairg, who currently holds the position of Lord
Chancellor, has made a formal request to dispense with the
traditional 17th-century outfit he wears during official duties.
	   A House of Lords committee on procedure is considering the
request.
	   In May, another tradition was abandoned when Lord Irvine was
told he no longer had to walk backwards in front of Queen Elizabeth
II during the annual state opening of Parliament. That change was
approved by the government to make the ceremony safer and more
comfortable for him.
	   In his latest request, Lord Irvine is not seeking to abandon the
tradition entirely. In a memorandum obtained by the Daily
Telegraph, he said he ``would be content to wear the full
ceremonial dress on all important Parliamentary occasions such as
the State Opening.'' But he asked to wear ``trousers and black
shoes'' during ordinary working days.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rebounded in the United States and Europe
on Wednesday after a mixed showing in Asia as edgy traders looked
for bargains following a global selloff Tuesday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which began bouncing back from
steep losses late Tuesday, kept regaining lost ground in the early
going Wednesday. The Dow was up 45.83 at 8,508.68 in early trading.
	   At one point Tuesday, the Dow was down 257.98 points, or 3
percent, bringing losses to more than 1,000 points from the July 17
record of 9,337.97. But late buying reduced Tuesday's loss to 112
points.
	   Broader indicators also were on the rise Wednesday.
	   The market has been shaken by Japan's deepening recession and
fears it not only will set back a recovery in Asia's yearlong
economic crisis but worsen the fallout elsewhere. But the tailspin
in stocks paused Wednesday as lower prices attracted some
bargain-hunting.
	   In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index had climbed 2.9 percent, while
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index was up 0.8 percent in
afternoon trading.
	   In Russia, stocks rallied after a 9 percent drop on Tuesday in
which trading was temporarily halted because of the sharp losses.
The Russian Trading System was up 4.7 percent in early dealings.
	   At the Tokyo Stock Exchange, on its longest roll of losing days
in two years, Tuesday's tailspin in New York was only the latest in
a steady stream of dark market news. But with prices already low
and many dealers away for summer holidays, the reaction was muted.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average fell 28.02 points, or 0.18
percent, closing at 15,378.97 in its eighth straight day of losses.
	   ``It doesn't seem panicky ... just this sort of ongoing
depression,'' said Paul Migliorato, senior manager of institutional
sales at Jardine Fleming Securities. ``No one is near the window
ledges.''
	   Still, some were jittery after Tuesday's volatile performance in
markets around the world.
	   At a large electronic billboard listing stock prices near
Tokyo's main train station, a handful of concerned investors
crowded around during lunch break to monitor the action.
	   ``I am worried and the atmosphere is grim,'' said Seiji Kon, a
51-year-old office worker. ``If the economy in the United States
gets bad, Japan's economy will get even worse.''
	   Though the New York drop was a jolt after years of a bull market
on Wall Street, it was nothing compared to the daily mayhem that
Asian markets have suffered since the region's economy nose-dived
last year.
	   In Hong Kong, the mood is dark. The market's benchmark Hang Seng
Index is down a crushing 21 percent in the past three weeks,
including a 3.6 percent decline Tuesday to a five-year low of
6779.95 points.
	   The reaction in Hong Kong to Wall Street's drop Tuesday was
subdued, however. The Hang Seng gained 79.53 points, or 1.2
percent, closing at 6,859.48.
	   But the quiet ``doesn't necessarily mean that the worst is over,
or that investors should be rushing back into the market,'' said
James Osborn, sales director of ING Barings Securities.
	   Singapore reacted quickly to the turmoil. The Straits Times
Industrials Index benchmark at one point Wednesday hit a 10-year
low of 995.60 before closing at 995.77, down 12.16 points.
	   The retreat from record heights in the U.S. market is rooted in
the financial crisis in Asia and in particular the mounting
problems in Japan, where the world's second-largest economy is in
deep recession, its worst since World War II.
	   A Japanese recovery is seen as vital to ending the Asian fiscal
crisis, but that is growing increasingly remote. Japan's new
government is promising quick action, but opposition parties are
threatening to block key financial legislation.
	   The trouble has taken its toll on the yen, which hit an
eight-year low against the dollar Tuesday at 147.61 yen. The
currency rebounded somewhat Wednesday to 145.96 to the dollar.
	   A slump in the United States would come at a bad time for Asia,
robbing the region of its biggest market just when it's most
needed.

Russia considers sending its troops to join NATO exercises near
</HEADLINE>
Kosovo &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo available. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMI Igor Sergeyev insisted the participation of
Russian troops in NATO maneuvers to be held in Albania and
Macedonia does not mean a change in Moscow's policy, but he did not
elaborate.

<TEXT>
	   ``The involvement of a small Russian unit will depend on the
goal and purpose of these exercises,'' Sergeyev said at a news
conference. A final decision has not been made, he said.
	   Moscow has voiced concern over previous NATO air maneuvers in
June intended to put pressure on Serbia to stop its crackdown on
ethnic Albanians. At that time, Sergeyev publicly lashed out at a
top U.S. military commander, accusing NATO of failing to consult
with Moscow on the exercises.
	   The new exercises, known as ``Cooperative Assembly 1998,'' are
scheduled to run from Monday until the following Saturday and bring
together more than 1,200 troops from the United States, Canada,
Germany, France, Greece, Spain, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Turkey, Italy, Albania, Russia, and Lithuania.
	   A similar NATO exercise will be held in Macedonia Sept. 10-18
involving troops from 22 countries. The maneuvers are to be held
under NATO's Partnership for Peace program that Russia has joined.
	   On domestic military issues, Sergeyev reiterated a long-held
pledge to turn the cash-strapped and oversized Russian military
into a smaller professional force equipped with modern weapons.
	   But he added that the defense ministry is unlikely to meet
President Boris Yeltsin's order to end conscription by 2000.
	   Sergeyev acknowledged that the Defense Ministry has been unable
to pay wages to servicemen for several months overdue, but pledged
to pay all debts this month;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Chinese engineer who claims he can straighten
Pisa's Leaning Tower said Wednesday he will meet with Italian
authorities next week to discuss his ideas.
	   ``I'm sure if my technique is allowed, I can straighten the
tower in 10 months,'' Cao Shihzhong, who has straightened 80
leaning structures throughout China, told reporters.
	   On Monday he will meet in Turin with Michele Jamiolkowski, who
heads the international committee of experts in charge of the works
on the 12th-century, 55-meter (180-foot) high tower.
	   The committee's current project is to give the monument
supporting braces, dubbed ``suspenders'' by the Italian press.
	   Cao, who was invited by an organization which promotes exchanges
between Italy and China, said he intends to intervene on the
foundation of the tower. He didn't elaborate.
	   The tower was closed to tourists in 1990 for fear it might
topple over. It leans some four meters (13 feet) off the
perpendicular to its south side.

apart from (giving) advice, is not very strong,'' Pakistani Foreign
Minister Sartaj Aziz said in an interview. ``People do overestimate
our leverage on the Taliban.''
	   Observers have accused Pakistan of propping up the Taliban to
maintain influence in the region. Pakistan last year became one of
the first and remains one of the few countries to recognize the
Taliban as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan.
	   Aziz and his top foreign office aide on Afghanistan met earlier
Wednesday with the Iranian ambassador in Pakistan. Iran has called
on Pakistan to use its influence to secure the safety of 11 of its
diplomats it says were detained when Taliban fighters captured the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Saturday.
	   Taliban officials say they don't know where the Iranians are,
but say that if they find them, they will arrest and try them as
agents of a hostile government. Iran recognizes as Afghanistan's
legitimate leader ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, who the
Taliban pushed out of the capital, Kabul, in 1996.
	   Aziz said he was trying to confirm reports that the Iranian
envoys were safe with opposition forces in the central province of
Bamiyan.
	   Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery Nesterushkin added to
the fire Wednesday, when he told reporters in Moscow that a string
of recent Taliban military victories in northern Afghanistan came
``with the direct assistance of the Pakistani military forces, both
for strategy, planning and equipment supplies.''
	   Nesterushkin said Pakistani soldiers had been arrested fighting
alongside the Taliban. The anti-Taliban Afghan alliance has made
similar charges.
	   Aziz denied the charges, and denied Russia's assertion there was
proof.
	   ``So far nobody has ever arrested a Pakistani soldier in
Afghanistan,'' he said. But he acknowledged Pakistani civilians
have volunteered to fight alongside the Taliban, whose strict brand
of Islam appeals to some in Pakistan.
	   Russia has been accused of arming the anti-Taliban alliance, as
has Iran.
	   Aziz praised the Taliban, saying they had brought order to much
of the country after decades of civil war. But he said they would
have to come to an understanding with other elements in
Afghanistan, the goal of U.N.-sponsored talks in Pakistan that
collapsed in May.
	   ``Whether we call them peace talks of power-sharing talks, there
is a need for negotiations to continue,'' Aziz said. ``There's a
need for broad-based power sharing in Afghanistan. The Taliban have
to recognize this. Only then can there be a durable peace.''

Roma coach questioned by prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: CORRECTS spelling of coach throughout to Zeman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ The coach of AS Roma, who has shaken up the
Italian soccer world, was questioned by a prosecutor Wednesday
about his allegations that some top players may use
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Zdenek Zeman walked past reporters without commenting following
a 2 1/2-hour session with prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello.
	   Following questioning Tuesday by Italian Olympic Committee
officials, Zeman stood his ground, insisting a series of published
remarks he made were for the good of soccer on an ``ethical
issue.''
	   He underlined, however, he never spoke specifically of drugs but
of ``medicines'' and that he did not have specific names of
medicines in mind.
	   He had particularly drawn the ire of officials of soccer dynasty
Juventus by expressing his ``amazement'' at the quick muscular
development of current star Alessandro Del Piero and former star
Gianluca Vialli, now player-coach of English club Chelsea.
	   Sepp Blatter, the president of soccer's governing body, told the
Gazetta dello Sport daily that soccer is a clean sport. But he
called on governments to approve stiff anti-doping laws,
``otherwise soccer will lose credibility and the public will lose
interest.''
	   The FIFA president said he was closely monitoring the Italian
case and would make the fight against doping his main priority this
season.
	   The head of Juventus' medical team, Riccardo Agricola, denied
administering steroids or other banned substances to his players
and said he doubted other teams used them.
	   ``Healthy people practice sports and healthy people don't need
to take medicines,'' Zeman said Tuesday.
	   After the Turin session, Zeman rejoined his club in pre-season
training in the Alps north of Venice.

Kohl's party warns against ex-communist party on Berlin Wall
</HEADLINE>
anniversary eve &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ As Germany prepares to mark the anniversary
of the building of the Berlin Wall that once symbolized a divided
nation, Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Wednesday warned voters against
allowing new political divisions.
	   ``Radicals, either from left or right, must not be allowed to
win greater influence in our nation,'' Kohl said in an address
prepared in advance of Thursday's anniversary.
	   Politicians in Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Party
singled out the ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism as a
particular danger. His party has long warned that a Social
Democratic government might only be viable with the tacit support
of the ex-communist PDS.
	   ``The dangers of communism have a new brilliance because our
vigilance has been eased,'' said the Christian Democrats' general
secretary, Peter Hintze.
	   ``It's a scandal that the Social Democrats have ignored the
danger that this party represents,'' Hintze said.
	   The Social Democrats have disavowed any intention of cooperating
with the PDS on the national level, despite such an arrangement in
one eastern German state.
	   Kohl's conservative coalition was gaining in polls six weeks
ahead of the Sept. 27 election, but still trailed a likely Social
Democrats-Greens coalition.
	   The 37th anniversary of the founding of the Berlin Wall will be
marked Thursday with a ceremony in Berlin dedicating a 70-meter
(230-foot) section of the Wall as a memorial to the city's
division.
	   At least 255 people were killed trying to escape past the Berlin
Wall, which East Germany started to erect on Aug. 13, 1961 to stop
its citizens from leaving for the West.

Hoddle branded `pathetic' after Gazza revelations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England coach Glenn Hoddle came under fire
Wednesday for revealing details of how Paul Gascoigne threw a fit
when he was dropped from the World Cup squad.
	   Bryan Robson, Gascoigne's manager at Middlesbrough, described
Hoddle's revelations as ``pathetic.'' Newspapers suggested Hoddle
was a hypocrite for making money off the Gascoigne story by
publishing it in his autobiography and a tabloid paper.
	   Clergy, doctors and lawyers are all bound by rules of
confidentiality but Hoddle didn't feel obliged to stick to the same
rules, critics charged.
	   Excerpts of Hoddle's autobiography are being published in the
Sun. The book, ``Glenn Hoddle: The 1998 World Cup Story,'' goes on
sale Aug. 20 for 17.99 pounds (dlrs 27.78).
	   In Tuesday's Sun, Hoddle described in graphic detail how a
slurring, swearing drunken Gascoigne kicked a chair, smashed a lamp
and acted ``like a man possessed'' when he was told he'd been axed
from England's squad. He had to be dragged away by two assistant
coaches.
	   This account, journalists noted, was very different from the
muted version of events that Hoddle gave at the team's training
camp in Spain the morning after Gascoigne was dropped.
	   ``We had a chat for about two or three minutes and there were
some tears in his eyes,'' Hoddle said then. ``He was extremely
disappointed and upset. He went to his room and some friends in the
squad went to console him.''
	   Robson, a former teammate of Hoddle's on the England team, was
seething after the publication of Hoddle's latest version.
	   ``It's pathetic the way everyone is jumping on the Gazza
bandwagonm,'' Robson said. ``I am not going to get involved in a
slanging match with Glenn Hoddle but let's say I'm disappointed.
	   ``There are too many people living off the back of Gazza's
reputation. People are selling stories, right, left and center.
	   ``They know that he is very high profile and see it as a way of
making easy money. The annoying thing is that people won't write
about Paul Gascoigne the footballer.''
	   Gascoigne's adviser, Mel Stein, said he was disppointed that
Hoddle had gone public about the events surrounding Gascoigne's
axing from the England team.
	   ``We regard any conversation between us and Glenn Hoddle as
private and will continue to do so,'' he said.
	   Hoddle's revelations are likely to erode his support among
England fans, the National Federation of Football Supporters Club
said Wednesday.
	   ``For these revelations, particularly about Paul Gascoigne to
come out later in a book, which obviously will earn (Hoddle) a
substantial amount of money, is slightly immoral and unnecessary,''
said Ian Todd, chairman of the group.
	   The Sun, meanwhile, continued to feature Gascoigne on its front
page. The top story in Wednesday's edition was a ``world
exclusive'' that Gascoigne's estranged wife, Sheryl, will divorce
him within days.

	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ Six Air Force guards gently
loaded the flag-draped coffin of one American killed in the bombing
of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi onto a military aircraft Wednesday
for the final leg of the journey home.
	   The body of Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds was
being flown to her native Florida via Dover Air Force Base in
Delaware at the request of her family.
	   The remaining 10 bodies of American victims flown to Germany
this week will be accompanied by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland following a military
ceremony early Thursday.
	   Seven wounded Americans also departed Ramstein Air Base for
Andrews on Wednesday.
	   Six will be taken to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington for treatment, and the seventh to the burn center at
Brooks Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.
	   Albright was scheduled to meet with the remaining wounded, one
American and 11 Kenyans, at the U.S. military hospital in nearby
Landstuhl immediately after arriving Wednesday evening.
	   A 12th Kenyan was being treated at the University Medical Center
in Homburg.

Cabinet meets Netanyahu request, approves defense budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet approving budget, RAISES reference to
threats; ADDS fresh Netanyahu quote &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet
Wednesday approved an increase in Israel's defense spending for the
first time since the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords were
signed.
	   Netanyahu's aides said an increase was necessary because
countries such as Iran and Iraq are becoming increasing threats to
Israel's security.
	   The increase will be reflected in the 1999 budget which the
Cabinet debated and later approved Wednesday.
	   The budget reportedly calls for an increasing the defense budget
by 2 billion shekels (543 million dlrs), while still cutting
overall spending by 2.2 billion shekels (598 million dlrs).
	   Netanyahu had said that the defense spending was necessary in
the face of ``increasing nearby and distant threats.'' The Cabinet
approved the budget by 10-6 vote, with opposition mostly coming
from religious parties whose budgets will be tightened.
	   Netanyahu said he was proposing a multi-year program to increase
the defense budget ``in light of increasing nearby and distant
threats.'' ``I am happy the government has approved this budget,''
Netanyahu said afterwards.
	   Several commentators attributed the request to the deadlock in
talks with the Palestinians and rising tensions with the Arab
world, but Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the prime
minister was referring to the growing danger of confrontation with
Iran and possibly Iraq.
	   Netanyahu said last week that Israel would invest in military
responses to Iran's recent test of the Shahab-3 missile, which is
capable of reaching Israeli cities.
	   In light of such developments, Israel needs ``to confront the
worst-case scenarios,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   ``It doesn't have to do with this government's policy or stance
in relation to the peace process'' with the Palestinians, he said.
	   Bar-Illan said Israel would invest in increased intelligence
capabilities and missile defense, but declined to be more specific.
	   Israel and the United States are jointly developing the Arrow
antimissile missile, at an estimated cost of dlrs 1.6 billion.
	   Zeev Schiff, military analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz,
said the increased defense budget is needed in part to modernize
the military's aging equipment and ammunition.
	   But he said Netanyahu's hardline policies were also a factor.
	   ``It looks very much like the government decided that it sees
complete deadlock and hostilities in its future, and not just with
the Palestinians,'' Schiff said.
	   ``You can't have a policy of confrontation and expect everything
to be quiet.''
	   Yossi Beilin, a leading figure in the opposition Labor Party,
said Netanyahu wanted more money for defense ``because there is now
intelligence information that a war is not impossible for the first
time in four years.
	   ``Nothing could be more symbolic than this of the missed
opportunity under the Netanyahu government,'' he said.
	   If the Cabinet approves the budget plan, it would go to Israeli
lawmakers in the fall. By law, the Knesset has to pass a spending
plan by Dec. 31.
	   If the Knesset approved the increased defense spending, it would
reportedly be the first increase _ when adjusted for inflation _ in
a decade.

Singapore to reform financial markets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's de facto central bank announced
Wednesday it has accepted a host of recommendations to reform the
city-state's financial markets.
	   The Monetary Authority of Singapore embraced nearly all of 46
recommendations from a government-appointed committee, which ranged
from easing restrictions on ownership of local brokerage firms to
letting them expand their activities.
	   The changes aim to make Singapore's bond, stock and foreign
exchange markets ``more international, competitive and robust,'' a
statement from the government body said.
	   A committee from the Stock Exchange of Singapore issued the
recommendations to ``upgrade, restructure and adapt'' existing
practices relating to membership, brokerage commissions,
regulations, new products and services.
	   The Monetary Authority said it approved the committee's
suggestion to allow corporations outside the financial services
industry to own stock exchange member companies.
	   It also adopted a proposal limiting foreign ownership to 70
percent of new or existing joint-venture companies that are members
of the stock exchange.
	   Foreign brokerage houses that want total ownership of SES member
brokerage firms should be allowed to buy out local partners, the
committee said.
	   The authority also agreed with the committee's recommendations
that existing foreign brokers are to be encouraged to seek
International Member status and that no additional approved foreign
brokers are to be admitted to the SES.
	   The International Member status gives foreign brokerage houses
almost full membership status in the Singapore Exchange and allows
them to trade in all Singapore stocks. Approved foreign broker
status allows brokers to trade only in non-Singapore dollar
denominated stocks.
	   It also agreed with the committee's recommendations that, in the
longer term, both the 49 percent cap on foreign ownership of full
SES members and the remaining restrictions on International Member
status are to be removed.
	   It approved a recommendation that minimum commission rates be
reduced by 5 percent for all transactions in 1999, ``to give
impetus to brokerage liberalization.'' The MAS didn't indicate the
current rates.
	   The MAS also agreed to develop products similar to listed
property trusts and real-estate investment trusts. It noted that
there is growing interest among intermediaries to develop these
trusts, and that they can contribute to the range of instruments
available to investors in the capital market.
	   It said, however, that such investment trusts ``should not be
viewed as a way to bail out the current depressed property
market.''
	   The MAS said it has agreed to let the SES study ways to develop
an SES stock index options product in Singapore dollars and a
country basket of shares of regional and global stock indexes in
U.S. dollars.
	   The MAS said it will ask the SES to study the viability of
developing an electronic bulletin board and subsequently, an
organized over-the-counter market for foreign securities, including
South Korean and Indian global depository receipts and Asian
convertible bonds.
	   The authority said it wants the SES to study recommendations
further to broaden the scope of the SES options market by launching
options on more securities, including Clob Malaysian securities.

Congo calls on UN, OAU to demand Rwanda and Uganda withdraw
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Congo asked the United Nations and the
Organization of African Unity on Wednesday to demand that Rwandan
and Ugandan troops withdraw from the country.
	   In a letter to the Security Council, Congo's deputy minister for
foreign affairs, David M'Bwankiem, accused both countries of trying
to overthrow Laurent Kabila's government.
	   ``We request the United Nations and the Organization of African
Unity to use their respective prerogatives to demand that Rwanda
and Uganda withdraw their troops immediately,'' he wrote.
	   He called on the OAU to condemn their alleged involvement.
	   Tutsi rebels have been fighting for more than a week to topple
Kabila's 14-month-old regime. It is widely believed Rwandan troops
were helping the rebels in eastern Congo, and Congo has repeatedly
accused Uganda of backing the fight.
	   The U.N. chief, Kofi Annan, and the Security Council last week
sent muted expressions of support for Kabila's government,
recognizing the need to respect Congo's sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
	   Diplomats from Zimbabwe, Zambia, Tanzania and Namibia, under the
auspices of the OAU, have been traveling in the region this week to
try to help find an end to the revolt.
	   Uganda and its southern neighbor, Rwanda, were early backers of
Kabila when he toppled dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in May 1997.
	   But they have expressed anger at Kabila's failure to contain
attacks on their territory by rebels based in eastern Congo _ the
principal reason they backed his fight against Mobutu.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda have dismissed claims that they are
involved in the fighting.
	   In his letter, M'Bwankiem dismissed claims the rebels were
principally Banyamulenge, or Congolese Tutsis, saying the offensive
was clearly the work of the Rwandan-Ugandan coalition.

Zhirinovsky: Russia should support Taliban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky
called Wednesday for Russia to change its stance on the Afghan
conflict and throw its support behind the Taliban movement.
	   Zhirinovsky said that the fundamentalist Taliban constituted a
``truly patriotic'' movement, the Interfax news agency reported. He
said that while the Taliban had been trained to fight the Soviet
army, it was no longer ``anti-Russian.''
	   The Russian government is ``repeating the error of 1979 (when
Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan) and is about to support its own
opponents in Afghanistan,'' Zhirinovsky said in a letter to the
Russian Foreign Ministry, Defense Ministry and Border Guards
Service.
	   The Russian government has expressed growing alarm over the
Taliban's advance toward the southern borders of the former Soviet
republics of Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. It already
has 25,000 border troops in Tajikistan, and the Foreign Ministry
said Tuesday that it was ready to do more to fortify the region.
	   Russia fears a radical Islamic state in Afghanistan would bring
an influx of refugees and weapons into formerly Soviet Central Asia
and threaten its own stability. Already, some 30,000 Afghans who
fled their homeland after the Soviet army withdrawal are living in
Russia.

Myanmar says foreign detainees not cooperating

Australian foreign minister in grafs 15-16; stands as 2nd lead for
some points &QL;

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ The detention of 18 foreign democracy
activists is being prolonged because they have failed to cooperate
with authorities, the military regime said Wednesday.
	   The 18 were apprehended in downtown Yangon and at the airport
Sunday after distributing leaflets urging people to remember a
failed 1988 uprising against military rule and not to give up hope.
	   The government has accused the six Americans, three Thais, three
Malaysians, three Indonesians, two Philippine citizens and an
Australian of breaking the law and trying to incite unrest.
	   The government has so far not decided whether they will be
charged with any crime or tried. Deportation still remains an
option, officials said.
	   A government spokesman, in a faxed statement to The Associated
Press in Bangkok, Thailand, said he believed some of the detainees
were still being questioned, four days after their arrest.
	   ``Because of their lack of cooperation, the process has been
unnecessarily prolonged,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
	   The U.S. Embassy made official representations Wednesday for the
early release of the detainees, an embassy spokeswoman said.
	   Visits to the detainees were allowed Tuesday by diplomats of
their embassies. U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley said
in Washington that all six Americans were in good health.
	   ``They had no complaint about their treatment and appeared to
have been treated humanely,'' Foley said.
	   In Manila, Philippines President Joseph Estrada urged Myanmar to
free the two Filipinos and ensure their safety.
	   Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told reporters in Bangkok he
believed the government of Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ would be
fair in seeking justice.
	   ``In my opinion, the activists might have broken Myanmar law but
they didn't do anything violent,'' he said.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, however, said
Wednesday in Canberra that the detentions ``expose the regime in
Burma in a way that it deserves to be exposed and that is it's a
regime that doesn't allow any dissent, any discussion any debate.''
	   ``They need to move away from a military-dominated government to
a government which has, if you like, broad civil authority,'' he
said. ``As long as they don't do that, these sorts of incidents
will occur.''
	   U.S. Rep. Christopher Smith, who chairs the House International
Operations and Human Rights subcommittee, said he planned to fly to
Southeast Asia Wednesday to seek the release of the detainees.
	   Smith is the congressman for the New Jersey district home to one
of the detainees, 19-year-old Michele Keegan.
	   Smith spoke to Myanmar's ambassador in Washington and said he
expects to speak to the detainees, government officials and
opposition leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.
	   The Myanmar government spokesman, however, hinted Wednesday that
Smith might not be granted a visa.
	   It was ``quite unfortunate'' that Myanmar had suspended issuing
visas to U.S. officials after Washington barred members of
Myanmar's government from visiting the United States, the spokesman
said.
	   ``The congressman has been assured that the Myanmar government
will exercise utmost restraint in dealing with the misguided
individuals,'' the spokesman said.
	   The U.S. ban was proclaimed by President Bill Clinton to
sanction Myanmar for increasing pressure on the pro-democracy
movement led by Suu Kyi.

Mubarak meets Sudanese opposition leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met with
Sudanese opposition leaders Wednesday and stressed the need to keep
Sudan united.
	   Mubarak met with Sudanese rebel leader John Garang, former Prime
Minister Sadiq el-Mahdi and Mohammed Osman al-Mirgani _ who heads
the National Democratic Alliance _ in the Mediterranean port city
of Alexandria. The NDA is an umbrella group for Sudanese
opposition.
	   The Sudanese opposition leaders began a three-day conference in
Cairo Tuesday at the request of the Egyptian government. Egypt
fears that the civil war in southern and eastern Sudan could lead
to a division of the country and affect control of the Nile River,
the source of Egypt's water.
	   Garang _ whose Sudan People's Liberation Army have led the
15-year insurgency in southern Sudan _ assured Mubarak that his
group does not seek the division of Sudan, Egypt's al-Ahram
newspaper said.
	   ``I confirm that the liberation movement (SPLA) abides by
Sudan's unity, which is based on justice in the new Sudan ... and
we are working with the Sudanese people to achieve this,'' Garang
told Al-Ahram.
	   The meeting of the Sudanese opposition leaders in Egypt comes
after peace talks between the rebels and the Sudanese government
failed to make headway in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia on Friday. At issue
were a cease-fire, the boundaries of southern Sudan, the role of
Islam and a referendum on self-determination for the non-Muslim
south.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for greater autonomy
for the Christians and animists in the south from the Islamic
north. More than 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
related famines.
	   The Sudanese government on Aug. 3 declared a unilateral
cease-fire, expanding a limited truce designed to get international
aid to famine-stricken regions.

Swedish international announces retirement at 28
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: REPEATING to European lines to CORRECT slug to conform to
style; edits throughout, adds background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Midfielder Tomas Brolin, who helped
Sweden to third place at the 1994 World Cup but never fully
recovered from an injury later that year, announced his retirement
from soccer on Wednesday at the age of 28.
	   After returning from USA '94, Brolin scored but broke his ankle
in Sweden's a 2-0 European Championship qualifying victory over
Hungary on Nov. 16, 1994.
	   A four-year veteran of the Italian Serie A after transferring
from Sweden's Norkopping to Italy's Parma in 1990, he missed most
of the 1994-95 season because of the ankle injury and transferred
to Leeds in November 1995 for a reported dlrs 5.8 million.
	   He never gained a place in the regular starting lineup with
Leeds, partly due to his form and also a conflict with manager
Howard Wilkinson.
	   Brolin had surgery on the ankle in May of 1996 and returned to
Parma on loan for six months the following season, but again never
regained form or his starting place.
	   Brolin last season played for Englan's Crystal Palace, which
finished last in the Premier League and was relegated to the second
division.
	   Wilkinson had criticized Brolin's general fitness and the
playmaking midfielder gained a reputation for a jet-set lifestyle
in night clubs.
	   ``I do not feel like playing elite soccer any longer,'' Brolin
told a news conference in Stockholm.
	   Brolin declared that he from now on will dedicate himself to the
marketing of sports shoes.

Rebel commander says 60,000 fighters closing in on Kinshasa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS to lead with envoy in Kinshasa; UPDATES with
stepped up rhetoric against Rwanda, wounded reportedly flooding
eastern Kivu hospitals. Edits to trim. No pickup.
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A Zambian envoy began an investigation
Wednesday into charges that Rwanda and Uganda are waging a war
against Congo as part of a rebellion to topple President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Congo stepped up its rhetoric against its eastern and
northeastern neighbors, vowing to ``massacre'' its enemies.
	   Rwanda and Uganda both deny involvement in the Tutsi-led revolt,
but the accusations have helped to rally Kinshasa's population
behind an embattled Kabila.
	   ``The entire population has become a military population from
today onwards,'' state radio said, quoting a Congolese army
officer. ``You will detect enemies and massacre them without
mercy.''
	   The rebels, meanwhile, say they have more than 60,000 troops and
are marching toward the capital.
	   Aid workers said Wednesday that 19 hospitals in Congo's eastern
Kivu, including a hospital in the city of Goma near Rwanda's
border, were being ``overwhelmed'' by a growing number of patients
wounded in the rebellion.
	   The hospitals face a ``desperate need for safe blood,'' the New
York-based Catholic Medical Mission Board said in a written
statement appealing for donor assistance to its aid projects in the
region.
	   The Zambian envoy, government minister Eric Siluwamba, meanwhile
said he hopes to open a dialogue between Congo and Rwanda to help
ease tensions between the feuding nations.
	   The peace effort follows weekend meetings in Victoria Falls,
Zimbabwe, where a commission was established by some of Congo's
neighbors to investigate Kabila's charges against Rwanda and
Uganda.
	   Both say they have nothing to do with the 10-day-old Tutsi
uprising, which closely resembles Kabila's own rebel movement that
in May 1997 toppled the reign of longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu
Sese Seko.
	   Kabila's relations with the two neighbors had been gradually
deteriorating, particularly because of his failure to control
Congo's vast eastern border region.
	   Rwanda has been frustrated by Kabila's failure to stop
cross-border ethnic Hutu rebel attacks on its territory.
	   During Kabila's rebel war in 1996-97, Rwanda also denied
involvement, although it is widely believed to have played an
instrumental role in helping Kabila.
	   Many of the troops that fought for Kabila last year have
defected and joined the new rebel movement.
	   Both the rebels and Kabila's loyalists on Wednesday claimed to
have made military gains in the eastern region and in the west.
State radio in Kinshasa said the government had retaken the town of
Bukavu, a claim refuted by the rebels.
	   The insurgents quickly captured Bukavu and the city of Goma near
the Rwandan border last week. Following an airlift to the west,
they seized control of the Kitona, Banana and Muanda on the coast.
	   Now, they say, the plan is to push to Kinshasa.
	   On Tuesday, commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane said rebel troops had
cut an oil pipeline in western Congo that supplies Kinshasa. He
also said troops had reached the outskirts of the major Congo River
port of Matadi, 280 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of the
capital.
	   The reported advances came amid government claims that its
forces had made inroads in both the far west and east.
	   It was not immediately possible to obtain independent
confirmation of the claims from either side.
	   Ondekane, who served under Mobutu until he was overthrown, said
most of the mutinous soldiers were from his 10th Congolese brigade.

Four more charged in Hong Kong airport corruption case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Four more people were charged Wednesday in a
scandal involving bribery to cover up shoddy construction connected
to Hong Kong's new airport railroad, anti-graft officials said.
	   Two men were jointly charged with offering bribes totaling
100,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12,820) to a building
inspector who identified problems in the foundation work at the
site of a train station and discovered forged concrete delivery
documents, a statement by the Independent Commission Against
Corruption said.
	   The pair are Shek Kwok-wing, 52, director of a transportation
company, and Ng Chun-hing, 41, a former superintendent of an
engineering company, the statement said.
	   Ng faces another charge of offering 100,000 Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 12,820) to the inspector, it said.
	   Ng Chak-fung, 23, a surveyor, was charged with conspiring with
several others to defraud several companies by forging the concrete
delivery documents to cover up the problems, it said.
	   Cheng Siu-ming, 24, an assistant engineer at a construction
company, was charged with conspiring with others to defraud by
forging a report showing the construction work being examined was
up to building standards, it said.
	   All four were released on bail pending a court hearing Friday,
the statement said.
	   Last month, a 50-year-old industrial diver was jailed for 20
months for offering bribes totaling 200,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 25,600) to the inspector in the same case. Three others also
are awaiting trial.
	   The corruption case followed a string of problems, including a
temporary halt of cargo services, since the dlrs 20 billion airport
opened July 6.
	   The high-speed railroad connects the airport, built on reclaimed
land off a remote outlying island, to downtown.
	   Three separate investigations have been launched to find out
what went wrong and who is responsible for the debacle.

Peace group: close to 6,000 houses being built in West Bank, Gaza
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANNA HARMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Nearly 6,000 new houses and apartments are
under construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, while close to 3,000 are standing empty, a peace group said
Wednesday.
	   The Israeli government authorized the construction despite the
United States' call for a freeze in settlement expansion.
	   Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the government's
settlement policy, visited all but two of Israel's 144 settlements
in the West Bank and Gaza on Wednesday and counted 5,892 units
under construction. They also found 2,888 fully built housing units
standing empty.
	   There are currently 42,000 housing units in the West Bank and
Gaza, Peace Now leader Mosi Raz said. The new building will
increase the number of units by 15 percent, he said.
	   Last year, Peace Now counted 5,200 houses under construction.
	   ``These counts prove, for the umpteenth time, that this
government is pro-settlements, that building is steadily increasing
and that there is no thought to the consequences,'' Raz said at a
news conference.
	   Land is central to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because the
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza. The Palestinians charge that expansion of the
settlements is an attempt to pre-empt talks on a final peace
settlement.
	   Peace Now teams visited every settlement save two. They were
prevented from entering the Itamar settlement by residents who
confronted them at the gate, blocking their way in. One settler was
detained on suspicion of striking a press photographer traveling
with the group.
	   The survey teams chose not to enter the settlement of Itzhar,
where residents are still in mourning following the murder of two
settlers there last week. Israeli troops detained two Palestinians
from a nearby village in connection to the killings on Tuesday.
	   Israel's Housing Ministry claimed that only 220 of the units
under construction were government-funded. Any other building was
private, ministry advisor Moshe Eilat said.
	   However that statement was refuted by both Peace Now and
Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, who both said that close to
two-thirds of all housing units in the West Bank and Gaza were
publicly funded.
	   All building in the settlements, public or private, must be
approved by the Defense Ministry before it can go ahead.
	   Statistics Bureau figures from April _ the most recent month
available _ reported 3,410 units under construction, of which 2,290
were public. The Bureau's figures are based on reports provided by
the settlements themselves and on estimates based on statistical
models.

Official: man confesses to arson in southern Greece wildfires
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A suspected arsonist has confessed to
setting fires that scorched thousands of hectares (acres) of forest
and brushland in southern Greece, the public order minister said
Wednesday.
	   Giorgos Anastasopoulos, 30, told police he started six of seven
fires in the prefecture of Ilia between July 17 and Aug. 8 after
being encouraged to do so by his uncle, 45-year-old Giorgos
Mavroidis, added Public Order Minister Georgios Romeos.
	   Arrests were also ordered for Mavroidis and a forestry service
employee, Alexis Kranitis, 46, in connection with the fires, which
burned a total of 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres).
	   Kranitis allegedly had offered money to Mavroidis to set the
fires, saying he wanted to damage the reputation of the fire
department, authorities claim.
	   The government shifted jurisdiction for dealing with wildfires
from the forestry to the fire department last year. Critics of the
legislation insisted firefighters used to battling blazes in city
buildings were not trained and equipped to deal with forest fires.
	   Although forest and brush fires are common in Greece during the
hot and dry summer months, this season has been described as the
most devastating.
	   In July, more than 2,800 wildfires were reported compared with
3,100 from April to October last year, the government said.
	   Officials have repeatedly said they suspect many of these fires
were set deliberately. In the past, property owners were accused of
setting fires to circumvent laws banning construction on forested
land.
	   The government is offering a reward of between five million
drachmas (dlrs 17,000) and 20 million drachmas (dlrs 67,000) for
any information leading to the arrest of an arsonist responsible
for any wildfire since July 1.
	   State security officials have been assigned to investigate other
alleged arson cases around the country.

Nigerian leader Abiola died of natural causes: Canadian coroner
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ontario's chief coroner said Wednesday an autopsy
shows that jailed Nigerian opposition leader Moshood Abiola died
last month of natural causes.

Two Palestinians arrested in connection with settler shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Two Palestinians have been arrested by
Israel in connection with the shooting deaths of two Jewish
settlers last week, relatives said Wednesday.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office said it could not
immediately provide information on the arrests.
	   Sabet Nassar, a 20-year-old nursing student, and Ahmed Kat, a
28-year-old teacher, were arrested late Tuesday night in their
village Medama, family members said.
	   Medama is near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, outside of
Nablus, where two seminary students were killed a week ago as they
patrolled the settlement's boundaries.

Three more cyclists ejected for failing blood test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Three more Italian cyclists were
disqualified Wednesday from the Tour of Portugal for failing blood
tests, raising the number of riders expelled so far to seven.
	   Gilberto Simoni and Andrea Dolci, from the Cantina Tollo team,
and Massimo Apollonio, racing for Vini Caldirola, were expelled
just before they were to have started the third leg from the
southern Portuguese city of Faro, Portuguese radio TSF reported.
	   Four Italians from the Mobilvetta team were disqualified on
Tuesday for the same reason.
	   With seven expulsions in the first three days, the Tour of
Portugal is beginning to parallel the kind of doping scandals that
plagued last month's Tour de France.
	   All seven Italians disqualified were tested by a medical team
from the International Cycling Union. The UCI describes the blood
test as a safety measure rather than a doping control.
	   The cyclists failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was above 50 percent, considered a health risk.
	   There is no reliable way of detecting the use of EPO, a
synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying
red blood cells, although a high red blood cell count can indicate
its use.
	   Festina is among the 18 teams taking part in the 2,177-kilometer
(1,350-mile) Tour of Portugal that began in the southern Spanish
city of Seville on Monday and is due to finish in Lisbon on Aug.
23.
	   Festina was kicked out of the Tour de France after team
officials and some riders admitted using EPO. Six other teams later
withdrew from the tour, protesting police investigations.

Clubs report record advance ticket sales as Bundesliga kicks off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's quarterfinal ouster at the
World Cup has not dampened enthusiasm for the Bundesliga. On the
contrary, the clubs are reporting record advance sales for the
season that kicks off over the weekend.
	   The 18 clubs have sold a total of 284,000 season tickets _
31,000 more than last year, an increase of 12.3 percent. Various
television deals will bring in 400 million marks (dlrs 226
million).
	   ``The Bundesliga is booming, as we can see from the season
tickets record. The German fans seem to be happy with what the
clubs can offer,'' said national team coach Berti Vogts.
	   The league hopes it will beat last season's record of more than
10 million fans.
	   ``I hope that this enthusiasm before the start of the new season
will be carried over throughout the entire season,'' said Vogts,
who has stayed on as national coach despite severe criticism over
Germany's lackluster performance at the World Cup in France.
	   Vogts has urged Bundesliga coaches to rely increasingly on
German talents so that the national team can benefit from the
development of young players.
	   But with the open doors policy now ruling European soccer, the
German clubs have gone on another spending spree, paying out a
total of 115 million marks (dlrs 65 million) on the transfer
market.
	   This remains a relatively modest sum by the standards of the
big-spending English, Spanish and Italian leagues and few truly big
international stars have signed for Bundesliga clubs. Most of the
new arrivals are little-known but cheap imports from eastern
Europe.
	   The most expensive player to come to Germany is Brazil's World
Cup player Ze Roberto, who joined Bayer Leverkusen from Rio de
Janeiro's Flamengo on a 12-million-mark (dlrs 6.8 million) deal.
	   The Bundesliga can boast only one World Cup champion with
Bixente Lizarazu, the French defensive midfielder who plays for
Bayern Munich.
	   Lizarazu spent much of the last season nursing injuries, but he
was a starter for France at the World Cup and Bayern hopes the
Frenchman will boost its title hopes.
	   Most experts see Bayern, the perennial powerhouse, as the
biggest favorite for the title.
	   Last season, Bayern lost in the opening round to newly promoted
Kaiserslautern and never recovered. Kaiserslautern marched on to
the title, becoming the first Bundesliga club to win the
championship in the season it got promoted.
	   To avoid another embarrassment, Bayern, with 14 Bundesliga
crowns, revamped its roster and brought in coach Ottmar Hitzfeld,
who won the Champions Cup with Borussia Dortmund.
	   Adding to an already impressive roster, Bayern signed Bosnian
international Hasan Salihamidzic, who had an outstanding season
with Hamburg, German international Jens Jeremies from crosstown
rival 1860 Munich, Stefan Effenberg from Borussia Moenchengladbach
and Iranian World Cup striker Ali Daei.
	   ``My top favorite for the title is clearly Bayern,'' Vogts said.
``It would be nice of course for the Bundesliga if an outsider
upset the favorite, as Kaiserslautern did last year. But I can't
imagine it will happen again.''
	   Hitzfeld's team has already won its first title, clinching the
German League Cup last weekend with a 4-0 thrashing of Stuttgart.
	   ``We've brought in reinforcements for the positions we needed to
strengthen,'' Hitzfeld said. ``We now have a deep roster and we
need it for all the competitions we are in.''
	   While the Bundesliga championship remains its biggest target,
Bayern would also like to play a major role in Europe. The club is
one of those that have been linked to a possible new European Super
League.
	   Hitzfeld showed no false modesty in predicting the outcome of
the championship: ``We are going to be the champions. But in no
league in the world is the title a given for any team, especially
not the German title for Bayern Munich.''
	   As Bayern's greatest rivals, Hitzfeld picked Kaiserslautern,
Dortmund and Leverkusen.
	   Kaiserslautern has signed a pair of Egyptian defenders, Hany
Ramzy and Samir Ibrahim, plus German striker Uwe Roesler, who left
Manchester City.
	   Dortmund, after finishing only 10th last season, got German
international midfielder Thomas Haessler and hopes Matthias Sammer
will resume his injury-ridden career.
	   Leverkusen, third last year, has added U.S. World Cup player
Frankie Hejduk. The only other American in the Bundesliga is
Wolfsburg's Claudio Reyna.

Cambodian parties endorse informal talks led by king
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with endorsement of proposal from three
main parties; edits to conform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's rival political parties,
bogged down in disputes over the election and forming a new
government, endorsed a proposal Wednesday for informal talks with
King Norodom Sihanouk as conciliator.
	   ``The king offered to play a conciliatory role if asked to do so
by two or three of the major parties,'' opposition politician Sam
Rainsy said after a two-hour meeting with Sihanouk at his residence
in the northwestern town of Siem Reap.
	   In a national election July 26, Co-Premier Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party won a slight majority in the 122-seat
National Assembly, but not the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government.
	   The two opposition parties have alleged rampant fraud in voting
and ballot-counting and have threatened to boycott the new National
Assembly session if their complaints are not properly investigated.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and the Sam Rainsy
Party _ which together won 58 parliamentary seats _ have refused to
even consider Hun Sen's invitation to join him in a coalition
government.
	   ``Hun Sen would like to fully welcome the role of the king in an
informal meeting,'' said Om Yeng Tieng, an adviser to the
co-premier.
	   Several days ago, Hun Sen had warned that Cambodia could face a
new political crisis if the opposition parties tried to block the
formation of a new government.
	   In a statement broadcast on radio Wednesday night, Hun Sen's
party said it supported the king's role of bringing the three
parties together ``to quickly cooperate in the spirit of liberal
democracy and sincere national reconciliation aiming at creating a
coalition government.''
	   FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party issued a joint statement
saying they ``look forward to attending such a meeting,'' adding
that they would not bother the king with technical matters about
irregularities, which will be addressed through the proper legal
procedures.
	   On Tuesday, the National Election Committee officially rejected
304 complaints of irregularities and fraud _ including voter
intimidation and improper counting procedures _ saying that ``no
ballot fraud as alleged by the parties'' was found.
	   The NEC said what minor irregularities it did note would be
corrected before the official election results are announced Aug.
29, but stressed that the changes will not affect the allocation of
seats.
	   FUNCINPEC Member of Parliament Ahmad Yahya said the 43 FUNCINPEC
members who won National Assembly seats agreed at a meeting
Wednesday to ``stand firm'' on their decision to reject Hun Sen's
offer to form a coalition government until irregularities in the
polling and counting process are investigated.
	   Ahmad Yahya said FUNCINPEC will appeal to the Constitutional
Council over the election committee's decision to reject the 304
election complaints.
	   The polls came one year after Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-premier in a violent coup, shattering a tense dual premiership
formed after the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   Hun Sen hoped that new elections would restore his legitimacy in
the eyes of the international community and foreign aid lost after
his takeover.

	   Abiola, who was 60, died as speculation mounted that he was
about to be released soon from four years of imprisonment.
	   Born in poverty, Abiola amassed a fortune in industries
including publishing, shipping and oil, then became an unlikely
hero for Nigeria's struggling democracy movement.
	   Once an ally of the powerful military, Abiola fell out of favor
after winning 1993 presidential elections, which were annulled by
the military government. Abacha came to power in a coup later that
year, and when Abiola insisted on his claim to the top office,
Abacha jailed him and convicted him of treason.

Four Italian cyclists may be fired after failing blood tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Four Italian cyclists, disqualified from the
Tour of Portugal for failing blood tests, may be dismissed by their
team _ Mobilvetta Northwave _ for misconduct.
	   ``They are professionals and must take responsibility for their
behavior,'' team manager Stefano Giuliani told an Italian radio
network Wednesday. ``If their contract provides punishment for
misconduct, dismissal letters will be mailed immediately.''
	   The four cyclists _ Mario Manzoni, Paolo Alberati, Graziano
Recinella and Renzo Ragnetti _ all failed blood tests carried out
by a medial team of the International cycling Union (UCI) before
the start of the second stage Tuesday.
	   The Italians failed the test because their hematocrit level _
the proportion of red blood cells to the total volume of blood _
was above 50 percent.
	   This is considered a health risk and may indicate the use of
EPO, a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of red
blood cells.
	   On Wednesday, three more Italian competitors were disqualified
from the race for failing the same test.
	   Meanwhile another cycling team, France's Cofidis, announced it
would definitely dismiss Italian star Francesco Casagrande if a
second test confirms he used forbidden substances.
	   Casagrande, winner of the San Sebastian Classic on Saturday,
tested positive for abnormally high levels of testosterone last
month but has appealed the results claiming he naturally produces a
high level.
	   The UCI has intensified blood tests before races in the wake of
the doping scandal which marred this year's Tour of France.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Rescuers at the site of the U.S. Embassy
bombing in Nairobi declared the search for survivors over
Wednesday, hours after retrieving the body of Rose, a Kenyan whose
cries for help inspired their work.
	   With the end of the search _ and the retrieval of Rose's body _
spirits sank. ``Everybody was Rose, everybody they could have
pulled out alive,'' said Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow.
	   Rose Wanjiku was found at 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) when weary soldiers
finally peeled back the last layers of wreckage that had trapped
her near an elevator, said Israeli Col. Udi Benuri, rescue
spokesman.
	   Five days after the explosion Friday, Benuri declared the search
for survivors over at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT). No one had been brought
out alive since Saturday, the day after nearly simultaneous
terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, a Tanzanian port.
	   At least 247 died in the Nairobi bombing, including those of 12
Americans, and 5,436 people were injured, said Maj. Gen. George
Agoi, Kenya's chief of the rescue operation.
	   In Tanzania, 10 Africans were killed, and more than 70 hurt.
	   Rescuers marked the end of their search with a ceremony at the
ruins Wednesday afternoon.
	   The U.S., French, Kenyan, and Israeli flags flew at half staff
on the rubble. Eight wreaths lay on a pyramid of broken concrete,
which U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell sprinkled with red roses.
	   Earlier, in an interview with APTV, she said that three Kenyan
employees of the embassy were still missing, down from 130 the day
after the bombing.
	   She also said the embassy had been turned over to the FBI as a
crime scene. ``The full team of FBI investigators are here,'' she
said.

Thompson wins with one of best times ever
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRESNO, California (AP) _ Chris Thompson swam one of the fastest
800-meter races ever by an American on Tuesday night in the opening
session of the U.S. Swimming Championships.
	   Thompson's time of 7 minutes, 58.26 seconds was the
second-fastest in the world this year and sixth-fastest ever by an
American.
	   Thompson took the lead for good from top-seeded Tom Dolan midway
through the race. Dolan, a four-event winner in the 1998 Spring
Nationals, suffered an asthma attack during the race, according to
his coach, Jon Urbanchek.
	   ``I knew that he was going out fast and I was just hoping to
keep up with him,'' Thompson said. ``I really didn't know how far
ahead I was because there was too much glare and I couldn't see the
other swimmers.''
	   Urbanchek said the 38-degree-plus Celsius (100-plus Fahrenheit)
conditions along with unusually high humidity may have contributed
to Dolan's physical problems.
	   Nat Lewis finished second behind Thompson and Austin Ramirez was
third.
	   Diana Munz upset Brooke Bennett in the first event of the meet,
winning the women's 800-meter freestyle in 8:31.74.
	   Munz was second to Bennett in the 1996 Olympics and the 1998
World Championships.
	   ``She's the Olympic and world champion. I am just amazed that I
beat her,'' Munz said. ``I have beat her a couple of times but this
was the biggest one by far.''
	   Bennett led for the first 500 meters before Munz took over.
	   ``My goal always is to just stay with Brooke as long as possible
and hope that I have something left for the last 200 meters,'' Munz
said.
	   Bennett ended up second with Melissa Deary third.

Government campaigns for increased fire protection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ In a campaign aimed at preventing a
repeat of this summer's destructive fires, the government vowed
Wednesday to upgrade the country's firefighting units and raise
fire awareness among the public.
	   In a statement issued to the media Wednesday, the government
said that more needed to be done to alert and educate the public
about fire hazards and prevention. They also said the nation's
firefighting units need more advanced training and equipment.
	   Dozens of homes have been razed and two people were killed in a
spate of blazes that swept across the south of the country last
week. The most critical fires have abated, but several blazes
continue to burn across the Dalmatia in the south, especially two
island resorts Lastovo and Korcula, where firefighters are battling
to restrain flames from spreading to urban dwellings.
	   More than 2,700 hectares (acres) of forest and brush have been
destroyed in the fires, including dense pine forests surrounding
resort towns and rich olive plantations.
	   More than 1,500 firemen from across the country convened in
Dalmatia to help combat this season's fires. Television reports
showed many of them hanging off archaic fire trucks or beating
flames with branches.
	   Interior Minister Ivan Penic said that the government would
purchase two additional Canadair firefighting planes, worth dlrs 22
million each, through a World Bank loan. Croatia currently has only
three such aircraft. Two additional planes were borrowed from
France to assist in containing the fires.
	   Penic dismissed criticism that the country was ill prepared,
blaming gale-force winds and land mines uncleared in the wake of
Croatia's independence war in 1991 for the severity of the blazes.
	   Dalmatia in southern Croatia is a sparsely populated region with
small isolated towns along the coastline. The towns are separated
by long stretches of dry land, dotted mostly with brush and pine
growth, making the region is highly susceptible to fires during the
summer, when temperatures soar and the population swells with
tourists.

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Border troops were put on alert to
guard against a possible spillover of fighting after Afghanistan's
Taliban movement captured an Afghan city just across the border, an
Uzbek government official said Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's Defense Ministry called for a meeting with
foreign ministers and security officials from the former Soviet
republics of Central Asia to coordinate plans for responding to the
fighting in Afghanistan, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   It said that the countries should concentrate primarily on
political activities, including dissuading other countries _
Pakistan in particular _ from interfering in Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban captured Hayratan, a city on the Afghan side of the
Amu Darya River, which marks the border with Uzbekistan. All Uzbek
border troops along the 147-kilometer (90-mile) stretch of the
border with Afghanistan have been put on high alert, said a Defense
Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia has said it was ready to fortify the borders of the
former Soviet republics to prevent Afghanistan's turmoil from
spreading elsewhere in Central Asia.
	   ``The situation in Afghanistan is very complicated; the threat
to the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) borders has
grown,'' Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Wednesday in
Moscow.
	   ``We are constantly and closely following the developments in
Afghanistan, and naturally are taking appropriate steps to
strengthen our troops,'' Sergeyev said.
	   Russia has for years had 25,000 Russian troops in Tajikistan,
where they help support the government and guard the country's
border with Afghanistan.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin accused military experts and soldiers from Pakistan of
aiding the Taliban, Interfax reported.
	   ``Massive military assistance from the outside encourages the
Taliban, fueling a dangerous armed conflict,'' Nesterushkin was
quoted as saying.
	   The government of Tajikistan said in a statement that the
turmoil in Afghanistan has in some areas reached the Tajik border,
and Tajikistan's security is under ``direct threat,'' Interfax
reported.
	   The Tajik Foreign Ministry on Wednesday denied what it called
``provocative and baseless'' Russian media reports that Tajik
troops were fighting on the side of the Northern Alliance against
the Taliban, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   It said, however, that a Tajik rebel commander, Col. Makhmud
Khudoiberdyev, and his supporters could be in Afghanistan.
	   Afghanistan's fundamentalist, Taliban forces have been advancing
in the country's north and recently captured several key cities,
including the opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   However, the Taliban have said they are seeking only to take
full control of Afghanistan and have no designs on their neighbors.
Still, a Taliban takeover of northern Afghanistan could send
refugees and weapons streaming into the former Soviet republics of
Central Asia.
	   Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov said his country will not
be able to avoid Afghanistan's influence if the Taliban wins,
ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported.
	   ``No matter how much we calm ourselves down, the situation on
the border will have a negative effect on the general atmosphere,''
ITAR-Tass quoted Nazarov as saying.

Russian markets rises a day after falling

 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to UPDATE with stocks closing 1.6 percent
lower. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Top Russian officials pledged anew Wednesday to
support the national currency and make debt payments, in an effort
to reassure foreign investors and stabilize the stock market after
a plunge the day before.
	   ``If we though that devaluation was unavoidable, we would not be
taking the measures we are taking now,'' said Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov, referring to the government's austerity program.
	   The Russian stock market fell more than 9 points Tuesday,
following market tumbles across Asia and in anticipation of drops
in the United States. The market opened higher Wednesday, but ended
the day 1.6 percent lower.
	   Zadornov said the government can guarantee its debt payments and
support the ruble because of increased tax revenues collected in
July and August. He also said that about dlrs 1 billion of an
International Monetary Fund loan will be set aside for these
purposes.
	   The IMF and other international lenders have put together a dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package for Russia. In exchange, they demanded
tough economic reforms, including better tax collection.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, visiting an aircraft engine
factory in central Russia, told reporters that the government
``must pursue our economic policy more precisely and firmly in the
face of falling markets,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia's market has been in a free fall for several months, both
because of the Asian financial crisis and because of fundamental
problems in the slow transition from a command economy.
	   Despite repeated government assurances that it can stave off
another run on the markets, foreign investors still worry that
Russia cannot.
	   In labor unrest in Russia on Wednesday, striking emergency
medical workers and regional officials in the eastern port city of
Vladivostok failed to end a strike that has left the city with only
four on-duty ambulances instead of the usual 30.
	   The workers are demanding months of back wages that have not
been paid because local and regional officials disagree over who
should fund the service.
	   And striking coal miners near Vorkuta, 1,900 kilometers (1,200
miles) northeast of Moscow, threatened to flood their mine if they
don't get twelve months of back wages.

Illegal immigrants stone police to stop their removal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) _ Illegal immigrants pelted police with
stones and bottles Wednesday to stop the authorities from moving
some of them to alternative accommodation.
	   Some 107 immigrants from Africa and the Middle East have been
detained in a hotel in this southeast Cypriot port since they were
rescued from a Syrian ship drifting off the coast in June. They had
paid the captain to take them to Europe.
	   They resisted when police arrived to take seven of the
immigrants to another hotel. Some 50 immigrants came out of the
hotel and started throwing stones at the police in the street.
	   Other immigrants lobbed bottles and glasses from the hotel
balconies.
	   Riot police were called, but not before three policemen had been
injured, one seriously, the police said in a statement.
	   Costas Papamichael, the director of the government's Migration
Department, said the police had come to take seven Sudanese
immigrants to another hotel, ``to relieve the overcrowded
conditions at their hotel.''
	   But the immigrants believed the Sudanese would be deported, he
said. On Tuesday, the immigrants also resisted a police attempt to
move the seven.
	   The immigrants have been struggling to gain political asylum.
The government said in July that it would repatriate them as all
but three had failed to qualify for asylum. Some 70 immigrants
embarked on a hunger strike last month to protest the decision.
	   Papamichael said the immigrants calmed down when they were
assured that their applications for refugee status were being
examined by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and that they
would not be deported in the meantime.
	   However, the seven Sudanese have still not moved to new
accommodation, he said.
	   The chief UNHCR officer in Cyprus, Freddie Galatopoulou,
confirmed the government had promised nobody would be deported
until the U.N. agency had reviewed their applications for asylum.
	   Galatopoulou said the immigrants were tired of being confined by
police guard to a hotel for almost two months. But, she added,
their conditions were ``better than in most countries where illegal
immigrants are detained in prisons, not hotels.''
	   Last month Amnesty International appealed to the Cypriot
government to grant asylum to the immigrants, saying their lives
might be at risk if they were repatriated.
	   The immigrants, who include women, arrived in Cyprus on June 29.
Their ship had left Lebanon 11 days before and its engine had
failed off the coast of Cyprus. Two immigrants had died from lack
of food and water by the time they were rescued by a passing ship.
	   The Cypriot authorities have charged the ship's captain, a
Syrian, with ``causing death by failing to take adequate
precautions and carrying passengers on an unsafe vessel.''

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ The Georgian parliament called Wednesday
for an end to military action by separatist Abkhazians.
	   Violence has broken out sporadically since a 13-month war in
Abkhazia, located on the northwest coast of the Black Sea, despite
the presence of Russian peacekeepers in the region.
	   ``The aggravation of tension in the zone of conflict and the
expansion of its scope correspond to the interests of forces that
are hampering progress in settling the conflict,'' a Georgian
parliamentary commission said Wednesday, according to parliamentary
spokesman Sulkhan Meladze.
	   The Abkhazian leadership countered that Georgia was standing in
the way of peace and ``blocking safe conditions for the
population,'' according to a statement issued by the separatist
Foreign Ministry.

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Two Palestinians have been arrested by
Israel in connection with the shooting deaths of two Jewish
settlers last week, relatives said Wednesday.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office said it could not
immediately provide information on the arrests.
	   Sabet Nassar, a 20-year-old nursing student, and Ahmed Kat, a
28-year-old teacher, were arrested late Tuesday in their village
Medama, family members said.
	   Medama is near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, outside of
Nablus, where two seminary students were killed a week ago as they
patrolled the settlement's boundaries.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A drunken man who decided to pat a lion's

	   Viktor Savchuk, 24, got past two fences to approach the sleeping

Interfax said.

Neel's grand slam helps Orix beat Nippon Ham 6-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Troy Neel hit a grand slam home run in the top of
the second inning Wednesday and the Orix BlueWave went on to beat
the Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters 6-0 at Tokyo
Dome.
	   Neel, formerly of the Oakland Athletics, has 19 homers this
season.
	   Orix starter Nobuyuki Hoshino (5-9) pitched a two-hitter and
struck out five in his second complete game this season.
	   The Fukuoka Daiei Hawks rapped out 14 hits, including two
homers, and beat the second-place Kintetsu Buffaloes 15-4, their
first victory in four games.
	   Koichiro Yoshinaga hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the
first inning, followed by Tadahito Iguchi's two-run homer in the
sixth.
	   Also in the sixth, Hawks catcher Kenji Jojima was ejected for
charging at Buffaloes starter Hiroshi Takamura after being hit by a
pitch. He was the 15th player ejected from a game this season.
	   At Seibu Dome, Domingo Martinez, formerly of the Triple-A
Rochester team, scored Taisei Takagi with a sacrifice fly in the
bottom of the ninth inning, giving the Seibu Lions a 5-4 victory
over the Chiba Lotte Marines.
	   Takagi and Kazuo Matsui each hit a solo homer in the first
inning for the Lions.
	   In the Central League, Eric Anthony hit a solo homer in the top
of the ninth inning, lifting the Yakult Swallows to a 2-1 victory
over the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.
	   It was the former Los Angeles Dodgers player's first homer since
he joined the Swallows in June.
	   At Yokohama, Takuro Ishii drove in the only run in the bottom of
the fifth inning Wednesday as the front-running Yokohama BayStars
edged the Yomiuri Giants 1-0.
	   BayStars starter Hisashi Tokano (4-5) gave up five hits, struck
out three and walked two in seven innings.
	   At Nagoya Dome, Kazuki Inoue doubled home three runs in the
fifth inning as the Chunichi Dragons shut out the Hanshin Tigers
6-0.
	   Dragons' starter Ken Kadokura (7-6) gave up only three hits,
struck out eight and walked four in his first shutout victory in
two years.
	   The Tigers now have lost eight games in a row.

Pakistan's new foreign minister firm on India

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan's new foreign minister is
standing firm on his country's traditional wary stance toward
neighboring India.
	   Sartaj Aziz, in an interview Wednesday, one week after switching
from finance minister to foreign minister, said the disputed
territory of Kashmir must be treated as the center of the
long-standing Indo-Pakistani hostility.
	   Nuclear weapons tests by India in May, followed quickly by
answering tests from Pakistan, focused the world's fearful
attention on the rivals. The prime ministers of the two countries
met in Colombo, Sri Lanka, last month, but their talks failed to
open the way to normal relations.
	   ``Colombo was not very successful because the Indians showed
very little willingness to talk about Kashmir,'' Aziz said.
	   Pakistan insisted in Colombo that negotiations focus on
resolving competing Indian and Pakistani claims to all of Kashmir,
a Himalayan territory divided between the two countries. India
proposed talks on opening up trade and taking other
confidence-building measures along with discussing Kashmir.
	   ``If the Indian side wants to use discussions of other issues to
relegate Kashmir, then the other issues of course will not move
forward,'' Aziz said. ``It is very difficult for the economic
relationship to move forward if the political relationship is
moving backward.''
	   Kashmir has been the flash point for two of the three wars
between India and Pakistan since the independent nations were
carved out of the same British empire in 1947.

concentrate themselves in the west interior and northwest sections
of Puerto Rico.

behind the tropical wave. This stable air mass will likely result
in an increase in haze across the northeast Caribbean for the last
half of the week.

International autopsy: Nigerian opposition leader died of natural

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Jailed Nigerian opposition leader Moshood Abiola
died last month of natural causes, according to international
experts who released their final autopsy findings Wednesday.
	   Dr. James Young, Ontario's chief coroner and a leader of the
team, told a news conference in Ottawa that the 60-year-old
businessman-politician suffered from a narrowing of the arteries
and had an enlarged heart.
	   Young said the autopsy, performed by doctors from Britain,
Canada and the United States, found no traces of poisons or toxins.
	   Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner, died July 7
while meeting a group of U.S. officials who were visiting him in
custody.
	   Young's announcement Wednesday reinforced preliminary findings
that the medical team reported when they came to Nigeria
immediately after Abiola's death. They have continued more detailed
investigations in the subsequent weeks.
	   Abiola's family had said they suspected foul play. The timing of
his death _ a month after dictator Gen. Sani Abacha's demise _
spawned numerous conspiracy theories.
	   Rioting and violence broke out in Lagos and elsewhere in
southern Nigeria, where dozens of people were killed.
	   Abiola died as speculation mounted that he was about to be
released soon from four years of imprisonment.
	   Born in poverty, Abiola amassed a fortune in industries
including publishing, shipping and oil, then became an unlikely
hero for Nigeria's struggling democracy movement.
	   Once an ally of the powerful military, Abiola fell out of favor
after winning 1993 presidential elections, which were annulled by
the military government. Abacha came to power in a coup later that
year, and when Abiola insisted on his claim to the top office,
Abacha jailed him and convicted him of treason.
	   Resolving the crisis over the annulled election is the biggest
task facing the new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who
has freed at least 30 political prisoners and tried to restore
relations with Nigeria's international allies. Abubakar has
promised to hold free elections early next year.

Buzek defends papal cross in letter to Washington Holocaust museum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ In a letter Wednesday to the head of the
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, Polish Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek defended Poland's right to display the cross at
memorials to Christian victims of the Nazis.
	   Buzek was responding to a letter from museum head Miles Lerman
concerning more than 50 crosses erected in the past three weeks on
property adjoining Auschwitz, the former death camp where Nazis
killed more than 1 million Jews.
	   Lerman greeted Buzek's letter as ``positive in tone'' but told
Polish Radio 3 he still believed the crosses should be removed.
	   Conservative Catholics have added the crosses to protest Jewish
calls for the removal of the eight-meter (26-foot) papal cross
erected there in 1988 to memorialize 152 Poles executed at the site
by the Nazis.
	   Buzek said the government will do ``everything it can to restore
the climate of respectful dialogue with all sides,'' and expressed
hope that Poland's Catholic bishops will find ``basis for a
solution'' when they meet Aug. 25.
	   The Israeli government and Jewish groups have protested the
additional crosses.
	   Buzek said a ``lasting solution to the problem requires
respecting the right to use symbols appropriate to the religious
creed of the Nazi victims at execution sites.''
	   And he said neither the camp nor the cross ``should be used as
instruments by extremist groups seeking their goals.''
	   Jewish groups say the papal cross, visible from within the camp,
violates the memory of the Jews killed there.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Firefighters managed Wednesday to extinguish a brush
fire that had threatened a resort on Italy's island of Elba,
forcing the evacuation of about 350 tourists.
	   The fire burned about 800 hectares (2,000 acres) in the island's
southeast since breaking out Monday night. Flames approached the
resort of Costa dei Gabbiani on Tuesday night, leading authorities
to evacuate the guests to a nearby school.
	   The tourists were allowed to return Wednesday, Italy's AGI news
agency reported.
	   Witnesses told authorities they had seen someone in a car toss a
benzene-soaked rag into the brush, Italian dailies said.
Authorities suspected the fire may have been set by local people
angry that land had been set aside for a national park on the
island, off Tuscany in western Italy.
	   Other fires burned hundreds of acres in the regions of Abruzzo,
Umbria, Emilia Romagnia and the island of Sardinia.

Ukrainian prime minister brings debtor executives to tent camp
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's prime minister summoned nearly
1,500 business executives to a civil defense camp Wednesday and
said they will have to stay there and listen to lectures on natural
disasters until they agree to pay their overdue taxes.
	   It could be days before the executives, many of whom are also
civil defense officials, are allowed to go home, said Prime
Minister Valery Pustovoitenko.
	   Ukraine has been in financial decline since the Soviet collapse
and Pustovoitenko said last week the situation was critical. The
government was owed 7 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.5 billion) in taxes
and the state pension fund 3 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.5 billion), he
said.
	   The civil defense camp is just one part of Pustovoitenko's
unorthodox campaign to crack down on tax delinquents, which some
newspapers have called heavy-handed and authoritarian.
	   The business executives gathered at a civil defense base in
Pereyaslav-Khmelnytsky, 30 miles (50 kms) outside Kiev, where 30
tents and a makeshift dining hall had been set up.
	   They were to hear lectures and see films on natural disasters at
the base, the Interfax news agency reported. Ukrainian authorities
barred foreign journalists from the site, which is surrounded by a
concrete fence.
	   Pustovoitenko said the gathering would last until the executives
``solve the question'' of their debts.
	   ``I want all those present, all the people of our state to
understand that we shall keep the process of tax and pension fund
payments under control,'' he told the executives Wednesday.
	   Pustovoitenko began his tax crackdown last week by bringing
executives from debtor companies and organizations to a meeting in
Kiev. After Cabinet leaders admonished the executives,
Pustovoitenko told them that no one would be allowed to leave the
Ukraina Palace until at least some of their debts were paid.
	   Ukrainian newspapers said the comments touched off general
confusion in the hall, with some participants standing in line to
sign the required papers while others rushed to find a telephone.
Reporters said no one was forcibly prevented from leaving.
	   Many executives agreed to pay a large portion of their debts
within days and the rest by the end of August.
	   However, they came up with only 94 million hryvna (dlrs 47
million) for the pension fund and 63 million hryvna (dlrs 31.5
million) in taxes, Interfax said.
	   Also Wednesday, all Cabinet staff surrendered 50 percent of
their monthly salaries to the pension fund. Pustovoitenko said he
would appeal to all state workers across Ukraine to do the same.

Rights commission: Don't recognize party faction that ousted
</HEADLINE>
Megawati &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The National Commission on Human
Rights urged the government Wednesday to withdraw recognition of
the Indonesian Democratic Party under its present leaders, who
ousted democracy champion Megawati Sukarnoputri.
	   The 25-member commission also renewed its call for legal action
against those involved in a bloody crackdown two years ago to quell
Megawati's supporters.
	   ``Legal settlement is needed in order to settle abuses of law
that have happened, for the sake of justice and prevention of
similar incidents in the future,'' said commission
secretary-general Baharuddin Lopa.
	   Megawati, who persistently called for more democracy, was ousted
as the opposition party's leader in June 1996 by a party faction
supported by the government of then President Suharto, who had
replaced her father, Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, in
1966.
	   On July 27, 1996, soldiers and police raided the party
headquarters, then occupied by Megawati supporters.
	   At least five people were killed in the ensuing riot, and more
than a dozen people are still missing.
	   Megawati also was barred from running in last year's elections
for parliament, a body that joined in giving Suharto a seventh
five-year term in March this year.
	   But amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis in three decades,
Suharto had to step down two months later following riots over food
prices and widespread student-led protests against his 32-year
authoritarian rule.
	   Lopa said at a news conference that the current conflict within
the party could be settled only if ``those directly or indirectly
involved in the July 27 attack are put on trial.''
	   Marzuki Darusman, the commission's vice chairman, said the issue
of the party ``has touched on the aspects of our existence as a
state and nation,'' along with other problems such as widespread
abuse of human rights in the past.
	   The commission's call came as the party's rival faction, led by
Suryadi, was planning to hold a national congress.

EU president condemns attack on village of Junik
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schuessel, in capacity as EU president, condemned a Serb attack on
the ethnic Albanian stronghold of Junik in Kosovo province
Wednesday, that reportedly trapped hundreds of civilians.
	   Serb police attacked Junik, one of the main bases for the Kosovo
Liberation Army, Wednesday after besieging the village for three
weeks and subjecting it to sporadic shelling. Schuessel said there
were 1,000 civilians trapped in Junik ``under the most difficult
conditions.''
	   Schuessel was particularly concerned about reports that
antipersonnel mines had been planted around Junik, preventing
civilians from fleeing the fighting. It was unclear, however, which
side had laid the mines.
	   Schuessel instructed the Austrian ambassador in Belgrade,
Wolfgang Petritsch, to make urgent appeal to the government to
avoid any escalation which would make this ``already unbearable
humanitarian situation'' even worse.
	   The latest figures from the U.N. refugee agency show that more
than 230,000 people in Kosovo have been forced to flee their homes.

Three Brazilian teams reach semifinals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANTOS, Brazil (AP) _ The Conmebol Cup is rapidly turning into
an all-Brazilian affair.
	   Three Brazilian teams qualified for the semifinals of the
continent-wide tournament Tuesday night. The only non-Brazilian
team left is Rosario Central of Argentina.
	   Santos plays host to Sampaio Correa in their opening semifinal
game on Sept. 9, while Atletico Mineiro travels to Argentina to
face Rosario Central.
	   Santos, a traditional powerhouse that Pele made famous, is
heavily favored against Sampaio Correa, a club from the poor
northeastern state of Maranhao that doesn't even have a telephone
listing.
	   But Sampaio Correa had the better quarterfinal series. The team
defeated Deportes Quindio of Colombia twice by a score of 1-0 and
gets to play the second game of the two-leg semifinal series in Sao
Luis.
	   Santos, meanwhile, tied LDU of Ecuador 2-2 in its opening
quarterfinal match before qualifying at home with a 3-0 win on
Tuesday, on two goals by former all-star forward Viola and one from
Claudiomiro.
	   Atletico Mineiro advanced with a 1-0 victory over Bolivia's
Wilsterman in Cochabamba on Tuesday. The Brazilians also won the
first game 3-1 in Belo Horizonte.
	   But Atletico will face Rosario without striker Valdir, who was
expelled from Tuesday's game and must sit out at least the next
game.
	   Rosario Central reached the final with a 2-0 victory over
Huracan Buceo of Uruguay, with goals by German Rivarola and Walter
Gaitan. Rosario also won their first game 3-2.
	   The winners advance to the two-leg finals, set for Oct. 7 and
21.

China says floods cost dlrs 24 billion, trimming growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with estimated cost of floods &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's worst flooding in 44 years could shave
half a percentage point off economic growth this year, state media
warned Wednesday, as new floodwaters surged down the Yangtze River
toward sodden dikes already threatening to collapse.
	   Direct economic losses from the floods that have affected 240
million Chinese _ nearly a fifth of the population _ will surpass
200 billion yuan (U.S. dlrs 24 billion), the official Xinhua News
Agency said, quoting unidentified economists.
	   The floods have killed more than 2,000 people. Damage to grain
crops also will make it difficult to achieve the harvest target of
490 million tons, the agency reported.
	   China's economy already was slowing because of the financial
crisis buffeting Asia. Stuttering growth will make it harder for
the government to re-employ millions of workers being laid off from
state companies, creating possibly fertile ground for social
unrest.
	   Flooding is further denting industrial growth, with flooded
factories forced to close and transport disrupted.
	   In the first seven months of the year, industrial output grew by
7.8 percent, well off the year's 11 percent target, the China Daily
reported.
	   Xinhua reported that the floods could shave 0.5 of a percent off
overall economic growth this year. Even before the floods, the
government's 8 percent growth target was looking overly ambitious,
with the economy growing by just 7 percent in the first six months.
	   Nor is any letup to the flooding in sight. A new crest of high
floodwaters _ the Yangtze's fifth this year _ was rolling down
upper reaches of the river Wednesday, further threatening levees
weakened by more than a month of high waters and torrential rain.
	   Water levels also were rising on the Nen River in northeast
China. The river breached a dike Tuesday, stranding 2,300 people,
state media said. More than 200,000 people were guarding levees
around the industrial city of Qiqihar in Heilongjiang province that
were ``seriously threatened'' by the rising waters, Xinhua said.
	   Another 15,000 have been stranded by a breach in the Hulin River
in the same area.
	   Meanwhile, new orders by the Communist Party to ensure stability
reinforced indications that authorities are struggling to prevent
anarchy in inundated areas.
	   Police and militia have stepped up patrols around railheads and
storehouses of relief supplies to protect the large accumulation of
relief goods, the official Legal Daily said Wednesday.
	   Looting of houses and public buildings abandoned to flooding
must be closely guarded against, it said.
	   ``Punish severely those deserving punishment, don't go lightly.
Secure order in disaster areas,'' the paper said, quoting a party
circular issued Tuesday.
	   Previous directives warned police to guard against food riots or
fights over distribution of relief supplies, and deputized
civilians have been organized into safety patrols. State media have
reported several arrests for livestock stealing and burglary in
flooded areas.
	   Several Communist Party officials have also been punished for
dereliction of flood prevention duties.
	   Dysentery and infections from polluted water are rife among
refugees, but authorities have been well prepared to prevent
outbreaks of disease, according to Red Cross teams who have visited
flooded areas.
	   Some outbreaks have been reported, but were quickly controlled,
the Health Ministry's official newspaper, Health Daily, reported.
It did not name the types of disease discovered. Millions of flood
victims are living in makeshift shelters amid brutally hot and
humid weather.
	   Flooding has been blamed in part on a weather pattern that has
created conditions eerily similar to 1954, when 30,000 died in
floods along the Yangtze, Xinhua quoted meteorologist Chao Jiping
saying.

Japan sets framework for bigger budget, more public works spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet approved a
blueprint Wednesday for a bigger national budget next year, with
expanded public works spending intended to help revive Japan's
economy.
	   At an extraordinary meeting, the Cabinet endorsed standards that
government agencies must follow when making requests for their 1999
budgets.
	   The criteria would increase spending on public projects by as
much as 30 percent from the original 1998 budget and suspend a law
designed to balance the budget while the government focuses on
restoring the economy's health.
	   Obuchi said the budget outline was ``a part of policies to
ensure a speedy economic recovery,'' Kyodo News service reported.
	   Under the guidelines, the overall budget would increase about 11
percent to 49.4 trillion yen (dlrs 338 billion), Kyodo reported,
quoting the Finance Ministry.
	   The blueprint sets aside 4 trillion yen (dlrs 27 billion) for
``special emergency spending'' to stimulate economic growth,
including 2.7 trillion yen (dlrs 18 billion) for public works such
as bridges and roads, and 1.3 trillion yen (dlrs 9 billion) for
other projects that would help the economy.
	   The plan calls for an emphasis on improving public
telecommunications systems, scientific and technological
development and protecting the environment.
	   The standards freeze growth in outlays for defense, foreign aid
and education _ areas where spending is not seen as having a direct
and immediate impact on economic growth.
	   They also set the boundaries for government ministries and
agencies that are scheduled to submit their budget requests to the
Finance Ministry by the end of this month.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Alexander Yakushev, who played on the Soviet
Union's national team during some of its most dominant years, was
selected as coach of Russian national team Wednesday, a news agency
said.
	   Yakushev won two Olympic gold medals and four world and European
championships during his time on the Soviet team. He played in the
famed 1972 series between Canada and the now-defunct Soviet Union
and later became a coach.

Japan trading house, Arco may develop Alaskan natural gas fields
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A major Japanese trading house said Wednesday it
has agreed to join Atlantic Richfield Co. and three other partners
in a feasibility study for a massive new natural gas development
project in Alaska.
	   The four-year study, to start later this year, is expected to
lead to the establishment of a joint venture for developing natural
gas deposits in the North Slope area of Alaska, a dlrs 12 billion
project, said Marubeni Corp. spokesman Toshio Kagaya.
	   Atlantic Richfield will shoulder more than a third of the dlrs
100 million cost of the initial probe, with Japan's Marubeni,
Bartlesville, Oklahoma-based Phillips Petroleum Co., CSX Corp. of
Richmond, Virginia, and Canada's Foothills Pipelines Ltd. taking
smaller stakes.
	   If the study shows the project to be economically feasible _
something the Marubeni spokesman said was a ``high possibility'' _
the partners may begin commercial production of liquefied natural
gas by 2007.
	   More than half of the estimated 14 million tons a year produced
would be sold to Japan, with the remainder earmarked for other
Asian markets such as South Korea and Taiwan, the spokesman said.

Saudi King Fahd undergoes gall bladder surgery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS for AMs; UPDATES with details, background.

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A medical team led by a U.S. surgeon
successfully removed Saudi King Fahd's gall bladder Wednesday, the
royal court said in a statement.
	   The king was recovering well after the operation in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh, said the statement carried by the official Saudi
Press Agency.
	   The operation on Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was carried out at
the King Faisal Specialist Hospital by Dr. Ted Pappas of Duke
University in North Carolina and Saudi surgeons.
	   Fahd was admitted to hospital last week and Wednesday's
operation followed consultations with a number of specialists who
were brought to the kingdom from the United States, France, Italy
and Germany, the statement said.
	   It said consultations also were conducted via satellite with the
renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which recommended
that a cholecystectomy should be carried out. The operation is the
removal of the gall bladder.
	   Fahd's health has been the source of much speculation since he
suffered a stroke in November 1995. Two months later, he
temporarily handed over power to his half-brother, Crown Prince
Abdullah.
	   Since the stroke, Fahd has used a wheelchair and is able to take
a few steps or stand up to meet visitors only with the help of a
cane.
	   The stroke also left him with short-term memory loss and the
inability to concentrate for any stretch of time. In addition, Fahd
has suffered for years from diabetes and arthritis.
	   The king was admitted to the same hospital in March for
treatment of a gall bladder infection.
	   He went back to the hospital on Aug. 2. A medical statement said
doctors had removed a pus-like fluid from his stomach.
	   Fahd was born in 1924 but the exact date is not known.

Britain's censor says legal porn would allow regulation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's chief censor says explicit pornography
should be legalized so it can be strictly regulated.
	   As it is, restrictions on ``conventional'' pornography have
encouraged a black market willing to deal in far more obscene
videos involving children, animals and violence, James Ferman said
in his annual report released Wednesday.
	   Ferman, outgoing director of the British Board of Film
Classification, said that if explicit porn were legal, it could be
controlled properly and the police would no longer have to act as
surrogate censors.
	   ``I feel strongly about it because the black market will just
grow and grow,'' Ferman told Press Association, the national news
agency, on Tuesday. ``A little of what people want is OK as long as
it's on the harmless end of the spectrum. The more you try to ban
it, the more it grows.''
	   Ferman, who noted that prosecutors now have trouble getting
pornography convictions, stressed that pornography involving
violence should not be legalized.
	   In his report, Ferman said film is the greatest art form in the
20th century and should be treated with respect. He pinpointed the
influx of violent sex videos into the country as the biggest
failure of his 23-year tenure in office.
	   The Association of Chief Police Officers said it would welcome a
review of pornography legislation, but cautioned against taking
``too liberal'' a line.
	   The association's spokesman on pornography, Gloucestershire
deputy chief constable Tim Brain, said some material could
encourage pedophiles, and that the pornography industry can lead to
coercion and exploitation of vulnerable individuals.
	   ``We suspect that the majority of the public, who may take a
generally broadminded approach to pornography in principle, do not
have any direct experience of it and would be truly horrified if
they saw some of the material that police officers have to
encounter in the course of their work,'' he said.

Chinese students protest attacks on Indonesian Chinese women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Students at prestigious Beijing University are
organizing demonstrations and putting up posters accusing China's
government of reacting apathetically to rapes of ethnic Chinese in
Indonesia during riots in May, sources said Wednesday.
	   Several hundred students gathered on campus lawns on recent
evenings to discuss the issue. Representatives of the university's
student union said they had applied to police for permission to
stage a demonstration next weekend outside Indonesia's embassy in
Beijing, where small protests already have been reported in recent
days.
	   China's Foreign Ministry has decried the rapes, and demanded at
least three times that Indonesia investigate the attacks.
	   The ``big character posters'' plastered on Beijing University
campus walls since early August, however, accused the government of
reacting with ``cold indifference.''
	   The local police office declined to confirm or deny whether
staff there were considering the students' request to protest.
Student sources said they would abide by laws requiring police
permission for any demonstration.
	   China typically keeps a tight lid on civic protests out of fear
that they could escalate into attacks on the ruling Communist
Party. Controls are especially strict at Beijing University and
other campuses in the city that initiated massive pro-democracy
demonstrations in 1989.
	   Foreign journalists are barred from the campus. University
officials contacted by telephone said they didn't know anything
about such posters, and that the official authorized to comment was
out for the day.
	   Women's rights groups estimate at least 168 women and girls,
most from the ethnic Chinese minority, were raped during the riots
that helped drive Indonesian President Suharto from power. Twenty
of the women reportedly were killed by their attackers or died
later of injuries.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population
but control an estimated 70 percent of the country's wealth.
Suspicious and envious of their success, Indonesians singled out
Chinese-owned homes and businesses for looting and burning during
the riots.
	   Outrage over the May attacks has galvanized ethnic Chinese
worldwide, sparking protests outside Indonesia's representative
offices in Taipei and Hong Kong.
	   Chinese democracy campaigners also have joined the fray,
accusing the Indonesian government of complicity in the attacks.

Policeman leaves hospital seven weeks after World Cup attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A French policeman on Wednesday left the
hospital where he lay in a coma for six weeks after German soccer
fans clubbed him during the World Cup.
	   Daniel Nivel, 44, was accompanied by his wife by helicopter from
Lille to a military hospital near Paris where he will undergo
physical therapy there for many months.
	   Doctor's have been optimistic about Nivel's progress since he
regained consciousness and was taken off a respirator a little over
a week ago.
	   ``He's recuperating physically. As far as his level of
comprehension, it's better, but he still can't speak,'' said
hospital spokesperson Annie Evrard.
	   Nivel was attacked by a group of German fans shortly after a
June 21 soccer match between Germany and Yugoslavia in the northern
French town of Lens.
	   At the time of the attack, Nivel was guarding a police vehicle
near the stadium. He was hit on the back of the head with an iron
bar.
	   Four suspects are in custody in Germany, facing charges of
attempted murder, causing serious bodily harm, and disturbing the
peace. Another man is being held in France.
	   German prosecutors say they have caught most of those involved,
but that their investigation remains open.

Latvian witnesses testify in Canadian Nazi case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Canadian justice officials are holding
hearings in Latvia to try to determine whether a British Columbia
man was a guard in a Nazi concentration camp.
	   Eduards Podins has denied allegations that he was a camp guard,
aying he only ran a store that sold goods at the camp during the
Nazis' 1941-44 occupation of Latvia.
	   Podins is not attending the hearings in Valmiera, about 100
kilometers (60 miles) northeast of the capital of Riga, near where
he allegedly worked. The hearings are being held in Latvia because
many of the dozen hearing witnesses are aged and unable to travel
to Canada, the Canadian embassy in Riga said.
	   Canadian prosecutors last year alleged that Podins lied about
his wartime activities when applying for Canadian citizenship. If
the hearings produce evidence he lied, Canada could strip Podins of
his citizenship and deport him to Latvia for trial.
	   More than 80 percent of Latvia's approximately 90,000 Jews were
killed during the Nazi occupation.
	   After Latvia became independent in 1991, it vowed to to
prosecute alleged Nazi war criminals, but none have been brought to
trial.
	   The hearings are expected to last about two weeks.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were rebounding in the United States and
closed with gains in leading European exchanges Wednesday after a
mixed showing in Asia as edgy traders looked for bargains following
a global selloff Tuesday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial, which began bouncing back from steep
losses late Tuesday, kept regaining lost ground and was up 74.66 at
8,537.51 by late morning.
	   At one point Tuesday, the Dow was down 257.98 points, or 3
percent, bringing losses to more than 1,000 points from the July 17
record of 9,337.97. But late buying reduced Tuesday's loss to 112
points.
	   Broader indicators also were on the rise Wednesday.
	   The market has been shaken by Japan's deepening recession and
fears it not only will setback a recovery in Asia's yearlong
economic crisis but worsen the fallout elsewhere. But the tailspin
in stocks paused Wednesday as lower prices attracted some
bargain-hunting.
	   On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
with a gain of just over one-half percentage point Wednesday.
Frankfurt, Germany's DAX index rose 1.9 percent and the Paris CAC
40 index rose 2.6 percent.
	   In Russia, stocks were unable to hold early gains and the major
index finished down 1.6 percent Wednesday. Because of worries that
Russia's economic problems will be aggravated by Asia's turmoil,
shares plummeted 9 percent in a stormy session Tuesday in which
trading was temporarily halted because of the steep losses.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Jailed Nigerian opposition leader Moshood Abiola
died last month of natural causes, according to international
experts who released their final autopsy findings Wednesday.
	   Dr. James Young, Ontario's chief coroner and a leader of the
team, told a news conference in Ottawa that the 60-year-old
businessman-politician suffered from a narrowing of the arteries
and had an enlarged heart.
	   Young said the autopsy, performed by doctors from Britain,
Canada and the United States, found no traces of poisons or toxins.
	   Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner, died July 7
while meeting a group of U.S. officials who were visiting him in
custody.
	   Young's announcement Wednesday reinforced preliminary findings
that the medical team reported when they came to Nigeria
immediately after Abiola's death. In the subsequent weeks, tissue
samples were examined in London and toxicology tests were conducted
at a forensic center in Toronto.
	   Young said these detailed tests supported a conclusion that
Abiola died ``due to rapid deterioration in a diseased heart.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed by mortars and machine guns,
Serb forces captured a major ethnic Albanian stronghold Wednesday
and attacked another, trapping thousands of civilians and rebels.
	   Serb police on Wednesday entered the village of Glodjane, ``one
of the strongest bases for the Albanian terrorists,'' near the
Albanian border after a fierce two-day fight, according to the
state Tanjug news agency. Five Serb policemen and two Yugoslav army
soldiers were killed, it said. The Kosovo Information Center, under
ethnic Albanian control, reported three KLA fighters were killed
and 45 wounded.
	   Tanjug said Goldjane was ``under full police control'' as of
Wednesday afternoon.
	   An APTV crew and an AP photographer saw heavy exchanges of
machine-gun fire and mortars on Wednesday morning as Serb police
launched a mopping-up operation. Smoke billowed from several
houses.
	   Serb police launched a simultaneous attack Wednesday against the
nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian sources reported. The
village has been under Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three
weeks.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had promised European
Union envoys that Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters and as many
civilians are believed trapped, would not be attacked.
	   In Vienna, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schussel condemned
the Junik attack. Speaking on behalf of the EU, Schussel appealed
to the Yugoslav government to avoid actions that would worsen the
``already unbearable humanitarian situation.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
appealed to the international community to help in forming a safe
corridor for the civilians trapped in Junik.
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio, quoting Serb and Kosovo
Albanian sources, described Wednesday's fighting near the Albanian
border as the fiercest since the clashes in Kosovo started in early
March.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians remain on the run in Kosovo,
international aid officials warned Wednesday, as Serb forces battle
rebels for control of a region near the Albanian border.
	   Tens of thousands of people in Kosovo have been displaced in the
past two weeks, Amanda Williamson, spokeswoman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said in Geneva.
	   She said thousands of people in Kosovo may still be living in
the woods or hills after being forced from their homes.
	   The ICRC has delivered more than 100 tons of aid to various
places in the last few days, but Williamson warned that
international aid might not be enough.
	   ``We have a big crisis on our hands,'' she said.
	   The latest figures from the U.N. refugee agency put the total
figure of those displaced by the fighting at around 240,000.
	   Williamson said that over the weekend, a Red Cross team
evacuated to Kosovska Mitrovica some 55 Albanians sheltering on a
dried-up river bed in woods in the north of the central Drenica
area. They included ill women, children and elderly people.
	   World leaders are still deliberating on what to do to halt the
fighting if they can't bring the warring sides to a negotiating
table soon. In Brussels on Wednesday, NATO allies were fine-tuning
options for military action aimed at getting Serb forces to halt
their offensive against secessionists in the southern Serbian
province, populated mostly by ethnic Albanians.
	   At the United Nations on Tuesday, the Security Council
reiterated calls for a cease-fire. Three members _ Britain, France
and Slovenia _ pushed for action against Yugoslavia.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the Yugoslavs'
``scorched-earth policy.''
	   But the council's statement broke no new ground, although it did
single out Milosevic's regime as using ``excessive force.''
	   In a report to the council, Annan said international agencies
failed to make good on promises to monitor an arms embargo on
Kosovo.

Freeport Indonesia to temporarily stop operations: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Freeport Indonesia's huge gold and
copper mine in New Guinea has decided to suspend activities because
of a strike by some of its workers, the official Antara news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   About 5,000 workers of Freeport Indonesia, a unit of the New
Orleans-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc., began a strike
on Monday to demand pay raises bigger than the 10 percent recently
granted.
	   Antara quoted Yuli Ismartono, a company spokesman in Timika, as
saying the suspension was aimed at guaranteeing the safety of the
workers and preventing possible confrontations.
	   Timika is in Irian Jaya province, in the Indonesian portion of
New Guinea, about 3,450 kilometers (2,160 miles) northeast of
Jakarta.
	   Ismartono said the protest so far has been peaceful, with no
damage or casualties and no effect on shipments at the mines' port.
	   Antara said the strike had almost totally crippled mining
activities.
	   Ismartono said negotiations were under way among company
officials, the workers and representatives of their union, Antara
added. Officials of Indonesia's Ministry of Mines and Energy also
were attending the talks.
	   Antara earlier quoted sources at the company as saying the
management in New Orleans had promised a pay raise of 50 percent,
and the workers blamed company officials in Jakarta and Timika for
the smaller raise.
	   Freeport Indonesia pays Indonesia's largest tax bill and has
been active in Irian Jaya since the 1960s.
	   Freeport McMoRan owns 81.28 percent of Freeport Indonesia and
the Indonesian government owns 9.36 percent. A minority stake in
the company is controlled by a charitable foundation headed by
former President Suharto.

Dengue fever epidemic may reach record highs: Red Cross
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ The Red Cross warned Wednesday that
Cambodia may be facing its worst-ever dengue fever epidemic and
that an urgent response was needed to the upsurge in cases, which
could reach a record-breaking 16,000 this year.
	   More than 7,500 cases of dengue fever among children were
reported by late July. With the rainy season continuing, the number
is expected to double, the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies said in a press release.
	   The mosquito-borne disease's symptoms of fever and muscle pain
are usually temporary for adults, but can be fatal for children.
	   More than 10,000 children were diagnosed with disease in 1995.
At least 450 died. Health officials said earlier this month that at
least 144 children have died of dengue fever this year.
	   Because damp weather creates favorable mosquito breeding
conditions, dengue cases regularly peak during the rainy season,
which officially starts in July.
	   The situation may be worsened this year by the El Nino
phenomenon, whose late rains and warm weather caused an unusual dry
season outbreak in early January.
	   The Red Cross is seeking dlrs 330,000 from its headquarters in
Geneva to provide immediate treatment for 10,000 Cambodian children
and to support a major health education and safe water campaign.
	   More than 25,000 units of intravenous fluids and other medical
supplies will be airlifted to Cambodia, and blood transfusion kits
will be supplied to hospitals, the Red Cross said.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The skies above Sydney buzzed with
military helicopters Wednesday as Australian defense forces
practiced anti-terrorist maneuvers ahead of the 2000 Olympics.
	   Ten Australian army Black Hawk helicopters swooped around the
Sydney Opera House and the city's harbor bridge during exercises to
familiarize pilots and crews with the downtown area in case of
terrorist attacks during the Olympics.
	   They carried teams of commandos from the army's Special Forces
unit, which will provide counter-terrorist support for state
authorities handling security during the Games.
	   ``It is highly likely that most members of the Sydney public
will see one or more of these aircraft in the central business
district or suburbs within the next fortnight,'' defense spokesman
Col. Keith Jobson said.
	   ``While we will try to keep noise nuisance to an absolute
minimum, the training is essential to familiarize our air crew and
Special Forces with operating in Sydney.''

Shanghai police block campaign to end labor camps: report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report of dissident detained in grafs 6-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Police in Shanghai have blocked democracy
activists' attempts to circulate a petition demanding the closure
of China's labor camp prisons, a human rights group said Wednesday.
	   Veteran activists Zhou Jianhe and Han Lifa were briefly detained
Tuesday by police who told them to drop plans to collect signatures
on the petition, said the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China. Police warned them they would ``have
only themselves to blame'' if they continued to circulate the
petition, the Hong Kong-based center said.
	   Zhou and Han were among nine people who applied Aug. 5 for
police permission, as required by law, to collect signatures at two
downtown plazas. Police turned down a first request, and the men
had planned to file a second application, the center said.
	   Police guards have since been posted outside the men's homes and
plainclothes officers trail them wherever they go, it said.
	   Chinese law permits police to sentence prisoners, without trial,
to up to three years in a labor camp, a system known as ``laogai,''
or reform through labor. The punishment is often given to democracy
activists to avoid potentially troublesome trials.
	   Meanwhile, police in the southern city of Changsha went to the
home of another dissident, Xie Changfa, and took him away
Wednesday, the group said. Police in the city also were hunting for
another dissident, Tan Li, it said.
	   Last week, Xie, Tan and two other dissidents had applied on
behalf of 40 dissidents for police permission to demonstrate in
Changsha for the release of two detained activists, the group said.
Police turned down the request, a decision Xie and Tan planned to
appeal, as allowed by Chinese law, it said.
	   On a separate issue, the human rights group said the wife of
exiled Chinese dissident Wang Xizhe plans to apply for a passport
to visit her husband in the United States.
	   Su Jiang, who remained behind in the southern city of Guangzhou
after her husband fled into exile in 1996, hopes to be reunited
with Wang, the group said.
	   It was unclear whether Su would be granted a passport. In May,
police prevented her from traveling to the nearby Portuguese colony
of Macau to join her husband, who was attending a gathering of
dissidents there.
	   After Wang left China, the government said his case should be
classified as ``illegal emigration.'' Wang's subsequent
announcement that he wanted to join the Nationalist Party of
Taiwan, historic rivals of China's Communist Party, further angered
Beijing.
	   Wang, a former factory worker, was sentenced to 14 years in
prison in 1981 for what the government called
``counterrevolutionary'' activities. After his early release in
1993, he was jailed off and on for democracy campaigning.

Report: Thai universities can't pay water, electricity bills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Ministry of University
Affairs wants the government to cover the mounting unpaid water and
electricity bills of cash-strapped universities, a Thai newspaper
reported Wednesday.
	   The unpaid bills have been piling up for months since Thailand's
financial crisis cut deeply into state university budgets at the
same time costs of water and electricity were rising, said the
Thai-language daily Matichon.
	   The unpaid utility bills total more than 500 million baht (dlrs
12 million), the newspaper reported.
	   Wanchai Sirichana, the ministry's secretary-general, was quoted
as saying the ministry will ask the government for help in clearing
the bills so the universities don't face cutoffs of their water and
electricity supplies.

<TEXT>
	   LILLE, France (AP) _ A French police officer on Wednesday left
the hospital where he lay in a coma for six weeks after being
beaten by German fans during the World Cup.
	   Daniel Nivel, 44, was accompanied by his wife by helicopter from
Lille to a military hospital near Paris where he will undergo
several months of physical therapy.
	   Doctor's have been optimistic about Nivel's progress since he
regained consciousness and was taken off a respirator a little over
a week ago.
	   ``He's recuperating physically. As far as his level of
comprehension, it's better, but he still can't speak,'' hospital
spokesperson Annie Evrard said.
	   Nivel was attacked by a group of German fans shortly after a
June 21 first-round match between Germany and Yugoslavia in the
northern French town of Lens.
	   At the time of the attack, Nivel was guarding a police vehicle
near the stadium. He was hit on the back of the head with an iron
bar.
	   Four suspects are in custody in Germany, facing charges of
attempted murder, causing serious bodily harm and disturbing the
peace. Another man is being held in France.
	   German prosecutors say they have caught most of those involved,
but that their investigation remains open.

Cabinet meets Netanyahu request, approves defense budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES ATTRIBUTION in grafs 2, 6; ADDS Netanyahu quote in
graf 5; TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet
Wednesday approved an increase in Israel's defense spending for the
first time since the 1993 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords were
signed.
	   Netanyahu said an increase was necessary because countries such
as Iran and Iraq are becoming increasing threats to Israel's
security.
	   The increase will be reflected in the 1999 budget which the
Cabinet debated and later approved Wednesday.
	   Netanyahu said that the defense spending was necessary in the
face of increasing regional threats.
	   ``It's in response to the latest developments in Iraq and Iran.
We have the means, we have the technology, we have the brain power,
we have the soldiers, to give a proper defense against this,''
Netanyahu told reporters.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky said the defense budget
would be increased by roughly by 2 billion shekels (543 million
dlrs), while still cutting overall spending by 2.2 billion shekels
(598 million dlrs).
	   The Cabinet approved the budget by 10-6 vote, with opposition
mostly from religious parties whose ministerial budgets will be
tightened. Netanyahu said he was happy with the vote.
	   Several commentators attributed the request to the deadlock in
talks with the Palestinians and rising tensions with the Arab
world, but Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the expanse was
due to the growing danger of confrontation with Iran and possibly
Iraq.
	   Netanyahu said last week that Israel would invest in military
responses to Iran's recent test of the Shahab-3 missile, which is
capable of reaching Israeli cities.
	   In light of such developments, Israel needs ``to confront the
worst-case scenarios,'' Bar-Illan said.
	   ``It doesn't have to do with this government's policy or stance
in relation to the peace process'' with the Palestinians, he said.
	   Bar-Illan said Israel would invest in increased intelligence
capabilities and missile defense, but declined to be more specific.
	   Israel and the United States are jointly developing the Arrow
antimissile missile, at an estimated cost of dlrs 1.6 billion.
	   Zeev Schiff, military analyst for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz,
said the increased defense budget is needed in part to modernize
the military's aging equipment and ammunition.
	   But he said Netanyahu's hardline policies were also a factor.
	   ``It looks very much like the government decided that it sees
complete deadlock and hostilities in its future, and not just with
the Palestinians,'' Schiff said.
	   ``You can't have a policy of confrontation and expect everything
to be quiet.''
	   Yossi Beilin, a leading figure in the opposition Labor Party,
said Netanyahu wanted more money for defense ``because there is now
intelligence information that a war is not impossible for the first
time in four years.
	   ``Nothing could be more symbolic than this of the missed
opportunity under the Netanyahu government,'' he said.
	   The budget plan now goes before Israeli lawmakers in the fall.
By law, the Knesset has to pass a spending plan by Dec. 31.
	   If the Knesset approved the increased defense spending, it would
reportedly be the first increase _ when adjusted for inflation _ in
a decade.

Thousands swarm to 200th anniversary of apparition's sighting

<TEXT>
	   LA VANG, Vietnam (AP) _ La Vang's population steadily multiplied
Wednesday as Roman Catholics swarmed in by the busload for the
Church's biggest-ever event in Vietnam, the 200th anniversary of a
sighting of the Virgin Mary's apparition.
	   By the time the three-day festival wraps up with an
early-morning Mass on Saturday, up to 150,000 people are expected
to have made the pilgrimage.
	   With the communist government appearing more religion-friendly
this year, police were noticeably inconspicuous Wednesday, handling
only traffic on the one-lane road that leads from Highway 1 and
through rice paddies.
	   Security inside the church's six- to seven-hectare (17-acre)
site was being handled by more than 1,000 orange-capped volunteers,
mostly from the diocese in nearby Hue.
	   A tent city of bamboo poles, twine and tarpaulins steadily
expanded outward. People lolled in hammocks in the steamy midday
heat.
	   With Quang Tri province suffering its worst drought in a
half-century _ along with outbreaks of dengue fever and malaria _
church officials dug a new well and trucked in tanks of water. The
government health service sprayed insecticide.
	   A few people have been here up to a month already. Regular
crowds in the hundreds have been attending night Masses in hopes of
seeing the apparition again.
	   ``Over the past 200 years, many people have asked her for help
and got what they asked for,'' said Father Guise Duong Duc Toai,
head of the local church and the organizing committee for the
festival.
	   A thriving marketplace has sprung up on the road, offering
everything from cold drinks and food to religious souvenirs, beer
and karaoke. Merchants said they hadn't brought in much business
yet but remained hopeful.
	   Quang Tri saw some of the Vietnam War's fiercest fighting, and
the church, which officials say they don't have the money to
rebuild yet, still bears some of its most vivid unhealed wounds.
Entire sections of its walls are missing; those that remain are
pocked by bullets and artillery shells.
	   But the focus Wednesday was a towering statue of the Virgin Mary
under three trees where a Mass drew a crowd that spilled on to the
lawn.
	   Several makeshift confessionals stayed busy, with a priest
sitting in a high-backed chair and a person kneeling on the other
side reciting sins.
	   The huge crowd is expected despite efforts by the government,
which says patriotism comes before religion, to keep the numbers
down.
	   It warned there would be shortages of water, accommodation and
food, and hinted at possible security concerns. Last December, the
country's tourism organizations were told not to advertise the
festival.
	   But the government denied a report that Vietnamese Catholics
living abroad were being refused entry permits for the event.
	   Buddhism is Vietnam's primary religion, but an estimated 8
million of the 78 million people are Catholics. Other officially
sanctioned religions, including the indigenous Cao Dai and Hoa Hao,
also have strong backing.
	   But any religion not officially sanctioned by the government is
considered superstition that must be eliminated.
	   Still, the government has made a series of recent moves to
improve relations with the Vatican and says it will allow the U.N.
special rapporteur on religious intolerance to visit in October.
	   The government says it sees religion as a way to attack the rise
in social ills like drug addiction and prostitution as the country
goes through growing pains.

Indonesia to upgrade its disaster preparedness
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia has decided to upgrade its
preparedness against natural disasters, the information minister
said Wednesday.
	   Lt. Gen. Yunus Yosfiah said contingency plans would be made so
the world's fourth most populous nation could cope with
catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, floods and
fires.
	   He said plans would be made to secure emergency supplies of
food, medicine and equipment.
	   Last year and earlier this year, millions of hectares (acres)
were blackened by wildfires that destroyed forests and produced a
health-threatening haze over some neighboring countries.
	   Heavy rain recently caused floods in several areas, and more
unseasonal and potentially devastating downpours have been forecast
in the coming months, Yunus said.
	   In central Java, thousands of residents around the Mount Merapi
volcano were evacuated briefly after it spewed out hot gas and lava
in July.
	   On Sulawesi Island, villagers near the Mount Lokon volcano were
put on alert Tuesday after scientists warned of increased activity
inside its crater.
	   Indonesia has 500 volcanoes and sits on the so-called Pacific
``Ring of Fire'' that stretches from North America across through
Japan and Southeast Asia to the South Pacific.

Courts stymied by deaf, mute, illiterate accused murderer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A man accused of stabbing another to
death does not know he is on trial for murder and can't defend
himself because he is deaf, mute and illiterate and doesn't know
sign language, an Australian court heard Wednesday.
	   With the legal system so far stymied by his isolation from the
world, the conundrum of how to explain the justice process to
Roland Ebatarinja and hear his side of the story has reached
Australia's highest court.
	   Police charged Ebatarinja, a 20-year-old Aborigine from outback
central Australia, with the fatal stabbing in 1995 of a man in the
central Australian town of Alice Springs.
	   But lawyers for Ebatarinja argued he could not stand trial
unless he could follow the proceedings. All attempts to find a way
to communicate with him have failed, the court heard.
	   A magistrate refused to proceed after finding that Ebatarinja
did not know the charges against him, could not communicate with
defense lawyers and could not follow the proceedings.
	   Now the High Court has been asked to rule whether Ebatarinja
should be committed to stand trial.
	   Ebatarinja's lawyer, David Ross, asked the court's five sitting
judges Wednesday for a stay of proceedings until a proper
interpreter could be found and Ebatarinja could be provided with
facilities and training to communicate.
	   ``Certainly he has a right to know the case against him,'' Ross
said. ``The stark point is that he has to know that he's charged,
the second point is he has to know with what he is charged.
	   ``We say that for all we know ... there may well be an ironclad
alibi.''
	   Prosecutors agreed no way has been found to communicate with
Ebatarinja.
	   The judges reserved their decision and asked for further
documents in relation to the case.

	   MARBELLA, Spain (AP) _ Spanish police have arrested an Italian
suspected of being a leading member of a Naples-based criminal
gang.
	   Genaro Mazzarella, the alleged head of the so-called
``Mazzarella clan'' believed to be involved in extortion rackets
and smuggling around the southern Italian city, was arrested
Tuesday and is to be extradited back home shortly, police said in a
statement Wednesday.
	   Mazzarella was arrested in Puerto Banus, a luxurious suburb of
the southern coastal resort town of Marbella where he has resided
since January, 1997.
	   Mazzarella's father, Francesco, was killed in February, one of
some 60 victims in an internal crime gang war in Naples over the
past year.

Belarus orders McDonald's to use local products
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ In the latest attempt to prop up its
crumbling economy, the government of Belarus is demanding that
McDonald's restaurants in the former Soviet republic stop using
imported food and buy Belarusian products.
	   McDonald's, which accounts for 10 percent of Belarusian
restaurant business, imports dlrs 500,000 worth of goods a month,
mostly from Russia and Poland.
	   Belarusian products _ whose prices are strictly controlled by
authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko's government _ cost up
to one-third more than the imports, restaurant representatives were
quoted as telling the Dyen newspaper in neighboring Ukraine.
	   ``Purchases of Belarusian products would hurt both the company
and our customers: Big Macs would become much more expensive and
therefore, not affordable for Belarusians,'' McDonald's spokeswoman
Olga Troyan said, according to Dyen.
	   McDonald's is the fourth largest foreign investor in Belarus,
employing 600 people.
	   Many foreign investors have been fleeing Belarus for months,
complaining of bureaucratic and other barriers to their work.
	   Belarus has one of the least reformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most enterprises still under state control.

Philippine government battling termites at presidential offices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine government is waging a
new war against an old enemy that has survived many
administrations, including that of the late dictator Ferdinand
Marcos _ termites.
	   Press Undersecretary Icasiano Gutierrez was forced to move out
of his office in Kalayaan Hall beside the Malacanang presidential
palace because its mezzanine was in danger of collapsing from
termite-weakened columns and beams, officials said.
	   Kalayaan Hall was used by Gen. Douglas MacArthur when he was
field marshal of the Philippine army and military adviser to
Philippine President Manuel Quezon when the country was an American
colony before World War II.
	   Former U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower also worked at Kalayaan
as a member of MacArthur's staff.
	   In February 1986, Marcos and his family made their last public
appearance on one of the balconies at Kalayaan shortly before they
fled Malacanang at the height of the ``people power'' revolt that
toppled his 20-year administration.
	   The last major renovation and remodeling of the palace was done
in 1978 under the direction of former first lady Imelda Marcos.
	   Since the departure of the Marcoses, none of the three
presidents who succeeded Marcos has lived in the palace, parts of
which have been turned into a museum.
	   The first sign that the palace and other buildings in the
compound needed repairs came when a chandelier in the Malacanang
music room crashed to the ground shortly after President Joseph
Estrada walked underneath it on June 30, the day he took office.
	   The chandelier and others in the palace had not been inspected
for more than 20 years and screws may have been loosened over time,
investigators said.
	   Termites have also damaged ceilings at the Premier Guest House,
which was used by visiting dignitaries during the Marcos
administration. Estrada plans to live there with his family.
	   But the fight to eradicate termites is turning into a pitched
battle between the cash-strapped Estrada government and some of his
critics who question the large amounts of money involved in the
repairs.
	   One newspaper reported that Estrada, who loves to cook, was
planning to spend 100 million pesos (dlrs 2.33 million) to renovate
the guest house, including 10 million pesos (dlrs 232,500) just to
repair the kitchen.
	   A displeased Estrada then said he would only spend 10 million
pesos (dlrs 232,500) to renovate the whole building.
	   ``You can see the termite damage,'' Estrada said, pointing to
the ceiling as took reporters on a tour of the guest house Tuesday.
	   ``What if a chandelier falls on me?'' he said. ``They are trying
to give disinformation to the public. The problem here is they are
trying to discredit me.''

Scandinavian Airlines' profit jumps 31 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Scandinavian Airline System, the joint
national carrier for Sweden, Norway and Denmark, on Wednesday
reported a first-half operating profit of 1.45 billion kronor (dlrs
181 million), a 31-percent increase from the same period a year
ago.
	   Overall revenues were 19.83 billion kronor (dlrs 2.47 billion),
a 4.4-percent increase from January-June 1997.
	   The increase came despite a 2-percent decline in passenger
traffic in the second quarter due to strikes in Denmark and Norway.
	   The airline said the profit jump reflected, among other factors,
an income of 299 million kronor (dlrs 37 million) from aircraft
sales and strong improvements in SAS' hotel operations.

Australia defends position on human rights talks with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government on
Wednesday defended its human rights dialogue with China against
criticism that it ignored major issues such as China's one-child
policy.
	   Former political prisoner Harry Wu accused Australia of
excluding forced sterilization and abortion from human rights
dialogue with China. Senior officials from the two countries held
talks in Canberra this week.
	   Policies of ``constructive engagement'' should change to become
somewhere between engagement and containment, so that China would
learn there are ``no free lunches,'' the U.S.-based author and
human rights campaigner said Tuesday.
	   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Wednesday that
China's human rights position had improved in the past 14 months,
since Australia had initiated a new tack in its human rights
dialogue.
	   ``In the last year, there has been an improvement, even if it
hasn't been everything that any of us would like,'' Downer said.
	   It was ``a preposterous idea'' to expect that the whole system
would change in 14 months. ``No one expects that,'' Downer said.
	   Proof of improvement was that China had committed to signing two
international human rights instruments, he said.
	   ``There is now a growth of dialogue between China and other
countries on human rights issues rather than just the sort of
accusatory diplomacy we had in the past. That is a constructive
thing,'' Downer said, the day after talks in Canberra between
senior government officers from the two countries ended.

Hong Kong tourism spending down 35 percent in first half of year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Tourist spending dropped by more than a third
in Hong Kong in this year's first six months in another gloomy
reminder of the region's woes.
	   The fall in spending reflected not only a 21 percent decrease in
the number of travelers. Those who still are coming to Hong Kong
are not staying as long or spending as much, the Hong Kong Tourist
Association said.
	   They face lower hotel and retail prices, which also are
reflected in lower overall spending by visitors.
	   Tourism officials said receipts fell 35.6 percent from the first
half of 1997 to 25.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 3.3 billion).
	   The biggest drops were recorded in spending by visitors from
North Asia, which fell 61.3 percent, and Southeast Asia, which was
down 51.2 percent. Those drops reflect the economic troubles of
Hong Kong's Asian neighbors. However, there were hefty losses in
spending from all parts of the world.
	   Mainland Chinese accounted for more than a quarter of total
visitor spending, followed by Taiwan at more than 20 percent.
	   Biggest spenders per person were those from the Americas, who
left an average of 5,779 Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 745) behind them
in Hong Kong.

Denmark, Norway grant asylum to Indonesian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Denmark and Norway have granted
asylum to some of the Indonesian immigrants who took refuge in the
U.S. Embassy and U.N. compounds to avoid deportation, embassy
officials said Wednesday.
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees granted them refugee
status last month after determining that all 22 Acehnese
Indonesians, who claimed to belong to a separatist movement in the
northern tip of Sumatra, could be tortured and even killed by the
Indonesian military if they were deported.
	   Gottfried Koeffner, head of the UNHCR in Kuala Lumpur, confirmed
Wednesday that a number of Indonesians had been granted asylum.
However, he declined to specify which countries had agreed to
accept the refugees.
	   Danish and Norwegian embassy officials confirmed that their
countries have agreed to provide refuge for some of the
Indonesians, who are still currently holed up in the UNHCR office
and U.S. Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``We have accepted six persons but we can't confirm when they're
leaving for Denmark,'' said Ulrich Sorensen, Danish Embassy
consular.
	   Annette Abelsen, who heads Norway's delegation, also confirmed
that her country was arranging asylum for ``a group of
Indonesians'' but did not provide further details.
	   Fleeing a Malaysian police crackdown on illegal migrants, 14 of
the Acehnese rammed a truck through the gates of the U.N. compound
on March 30. Eleven days later, eight others hoisted themselves
over the walls of the U.S. Embassy, where they remained Wednesday.
	   A local newspaper reported Wednesday that the United States had
also agreed to take some of the refugees. Officials at the U.S.
Embassy declined to comment.

Swiss federation considers possible sanctions againt riders who
</HEADLINE>
admitted drug use

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss cycling federation officials
said Wednesday they had opened hearings which may result in
sanctions against riders expelled from the Tour de France for using
banned performance-boosting drugs.
	   The International Cycling Union, meanwhile, said it would
announce details of new anti-doping measures for the sport on
Thursday.
	   Hugo Steinegger, president of the Swiss Cycling Federation,
confirmed that the federation's anti-doping commission had opened
proceedings which may result in sanctions being imposed against
Swiss members of the Festina team.
	   Festina was expelled from the Tour de France because its riders
were implicated in systematic use of the banned endurance-boosting
hormome EPO. Swiss team members Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and
Armin Meier were among those who later admitted taking the drug.
	   Steinegger said Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were expected to attend
the hearing. He declined to give details of how long it would take
or when the outcome would be announced.
	   However, federation spokesman Remo Von Daeniken said the hearing
could take up to six weeks.
	   He said possible sanctions include a ban from competing of
between six months and two years, a 15,000 Swiss francs fine (about
dlrs 10,000) and the deduction of up to 100 international
classification points.
	   Steinegger has previously been quoted by Swiss daily Tribune de
Geneve as saying he believes the three riders should be treated
leniently.
	   The international federation, UCI, said it would announce
Thursday its plan of action following the meeting it held Tuesday
in Lausanne Tuesday with the sport's top officials and riders.

Filipino troops won't get same benefits as U.S. military in
</HEADLINE>
Philippines &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Filipino troops who commit crimes
while participating in military exercises in the United States will
be subject to prosecution by local authorities under a draft
agreement, unlike Americans who train in the Philippines, an
official said Wednesday.
	   U.S. and Philippine officials have already signed an agreement
that gives the United States automatic jurisdiction over American
troops who commit crimes while taking part in exercises in the
Philippines. A companion pact is being negotiated to cover the
status of Filipino troops who commit criminal acts while on duty on
U.S. soil, and officials had originally said it would provide
comparable rights.
	   Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, who has backed the agreements,
acknowledged the unequal handling of criminal jurisdiction. But he
said Filipino troops committing crimes in the United States could
be placed under Philippine jurisdiction in special cases.
	   Siazon said U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright have promised to make efforts to give
the Philippines jurisdiction over Filipino suspects ``in certain
cases of importance to us.''
	   Siazon did not explain what specific conditions would be
required.
	   He said Filipino troops will receive certain other benefits,
including duty-free privileges and visa-free entries for them and
their immediate dependents, and duty-free entry of equipment and
belongings while on duty in the United States.
	   The accord covering the visiting Filipino troops could be
concluded next week, he added.
	   The pact that has already been signed by the two sides, called
the Visiting Forces Agreement, must still be approved by the
Philippine Senate, and the differing treatment given to personnel
who commit crimes could potentially stall its ratification.
	   ``There should be reciprocity in the two accords,'' said Sen.
Juan Flavier. ``They should both be equal.''
	   The United States halted major joint exercises in the
Philippines and visits by U.S. military ships in December 1996,
when the Manila government ended a legal loophole that had shielded
U.S. military personnel from prosecution by the Philippines for
crimes committed here.
	   The criminal jurisdiction issue has been especially sensitive in
the Philippines, where many groups have opposed the Visiting Forces
Agreement.
	   Critics say the accord infringes on Philippine sovereignty
because it limits the Manila government's right to prosecute
American soldiers who commit crimes here.
	   They say the presence of foreign troops could also promote
prostitution.
	   Military ties with the United States have remained a sensitive
issue since a nationalist Philippine Senate forced the closure of
the last U.S. base in the country in 1992, ending close to a
century of American military presence in its former colony.

Swiss cycling federation says hearing opened against cyclists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss cycling federation officials said
Wednesday they have opened a hearing which may result in sanctions
against cyclists expelled from the scandal-rocked Tour de France
for using a banned performance-boosting drug.
	   The news came as the International Cycling Union said it would
publish Thursday the outcome of a meeting in Lausanne at which top
cycling officials and riders were due to discuss the sport's
growing doping crisis.
	   Thursday's announcement is expected to include details of new
strategies to combat the problem.
	   Hugo Steinegger, president of the Swiss Cycling Federation,
confirmed Wednesday that the federation's special anti-doping
commission had opened proceedings which may result in sanctions
being imposed against Swiss members of the Festina team thrown out
of this year's Tour de France.
	   Festina was expelled because its riders were said to have taken
the hormone EPO. Swiss team members Alex Zuelle, Laurent Dufaux and
Armin Meier were among those who later admitted taking the drug.
	   Steinegger said Zuelle, Dufaux and Meier were expected to attend
the hearing. He declined to give details of how long it would take

	   However, federation spokesman Remo Von Daeniken said the
proceedings could take up to six weeks.

Activists ask Blair to skip famous Italian horse race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair has opposed
fox-hunting at home, and now activists are demanding that he skip
the famous Palio horse race in Tuscany, where he is vacationing.
	   The Anti-Vivisection League issued a statement Wednesday
inviting Blair and his family not to go to the race, which has a
trial run Friday and the actual running Sunday, in the main square
of Siena, a Tuscan town.
	   Since 1975, 36 horses have been killed running the race, the
League said.
	   Blair's 10 Downing St. office had no comment on the appeal to
skip the race.
	   Horses, with jockeys using whips and riding bareback, race
around the cobblestone square in a kind of free-for-all. Many
horses and riders representing Siena's fiercely competitive
neighborhoods tumble to the ground and risk being trampled by
others.
	   The race, a medieval tradition and big tourist attraction, is
run twice each summer.
	   Blair has personally endorsed a ban on fox hunting in his
nation.

Belarusian government publicly praises, privately spurns its
</HEADLINE>
currency &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA BABKINA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The government of Belarus insists its
currency, the ruble, is strong. It just wants less of it.
	   After months of denying that the economy is crumbling and the
Belarusian ruble has become almost worthless, the government has
ordered the country to stop accepting its own currency as payment
for exports.
	   The order, which will take effect Monday, requires Belarusian
exporters to sell their goods abroad for foreign currencies,
National Bank spokesman Mikhail Zhuravovich confirmed Wednesday.
	   Belarus has one of the least reformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most enterprises still under state control. It
was rocked by an economic crisis this spring, when the government
was forced to impose strict price controls to stop the ruble from
plummeting.
	   The new export order applies to Belarus' main exports _ meat,
dairy products, grain, berries, alcohol, metals, furniture,
vehicles, art works and services. Russia is by far Belarus' largest
trading partner.
	   Zhuravovich insisted that the export measure was temporary, but
would not say how long it would last.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko and his government
publicly insist that the economy is growing. But the new export
order and other recent orders indicate concern about the real state
of affairs.
	   The government said Wednesday that gross national product has
increased by 10 percent so far this year, average incomes have
risen by more than 5 percent and real wages by 14.5 percent.
	   But independent economists say that the government had resorted
to printing money to pay wages, and that the infusion of newly
printed bills into the economy creates the appearance of growth.
	   In another sign of trouble, the Economics Ministry recently
ordered local utilities officials to sharply cut heat and energy
supplies to the capital Minsk and other towns.
	   The order, published in the independent Narodnaya Volya
newspaper, was confirmed Wednesday by a senior Economics Ministry
official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The order requires that central heating in apartment buildings
not be turned on until the average daily temperature falls to 5 C
(41 F) for a week. It limits the opening hours of street kiosks to
daylight, and bans the use of heaters in offices and factories.
	   Lukashenko again praised the state of the Belarusian economy
during a meeting Wednesday with the administration of a joint
venture that assembles Ford automobiles near Minsk.
	   ``You must not pay attention to the various difficulties between
politicians and diplomats,'' Lukashenko told the assembly, adding
that his government will continue to support Ford investors.
	   Lukashenko is engaged in a diplomatic standoff with more than 20
countries whose ambassadors he is trying to evict from a compound
on the outskirts of Minsk. Lukashenko says the compound needs
urgent water and sewer repairs, but the diplomats say they cannot
be forced to leave under the terms of an international treaty.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An anonymous telephone call saying
Wednesday a bomb had been placed at the U.S. Embassy proved to be a

	   A Romanian anti-terrorist brigade checked the area and said
afterward it was safe.
	   Following the recent bomb attacks against the U.S. missions in

 &UR; Ultra-Orthodox militants disrupt removal of ancient graves

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of ultra-Orthodox Jews disrupted work
at a highway project Wednesday, vandalizing tractors and taunting
archaeologists who worked to remove ancient graves at the site.
	   The protesters, dressed in traditional black coats and hats,
began praying near the graves which they consider sacred and
believe belong to Jews. But the protest quickly turned ugly when
the demonstrators called archaeologists `Nazis,'' and ``Grave
robbers.'' Police later removed the protesters from the site.
	   The completion of the road has been delayed for the past year
and a half because of ultra-Orthodox protests.
	   Archaeologists from Israel's antiquities authority have been
digging up the graves which are in the way of the road project, and
moving them to a nearby site.
	   Earlier this week, ceramic lamps adorned by crosses were found
at the site, backing the claim by the antiquities authority that
the site contains Christian, and not Jewish graves.

Official: man confesses to arson in southern Greece wildfires
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES wildfire jurisdiction moved from forestry to fire
department this year &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A suspected arsonist has confessed to
setting fires that scorched thousands of hectares (acres) of forest
and brushland in southern Greece, the public order minister said
Wednesday.
	   Giorgos Anastasopoulos, 30, told police he started six of seven
fires in the prefecture of Ilia between July 17 and Aug. 8 after
being encouraged to do so by his uncle, 45-year-old Giorgos
Mavroidis, added Public Order Minister Georgios Romeos.
	   Arrests were also ordered for Mavroidis and a forestry service
employee, Alexis Kranitis, 46, in connection with the fires, which
burned a total of 10,000 hectares (24,710 acres).
	   Kranitis allegedly had offered money to Mavroidis to set the
fires, saying he wanted to damage the reputation of the fire
department, authorities claim.
	   The government shifted jurisdiction for dealing with wildfires
from the forestry to the fire department earlier this year. Critics
of the legislation insisted firefighters used to battling blazes in
city buildings were not trained and equipped to deal with forest
fires.

World Fair embezzlement scandal grows
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portuguese police are investigating the
whereabouts of some 1.3 billion escudos (dlrs 7.2 million) believed
missing from the coffers of the Expo'98 World Fair in a major
financial scandal that came to light this week.
	   News reports said Wednesday police believe the amount embezzled
from the fair by its chief accountant Joao Caldeira was much
greater than the few thousand dollars he admitted to on being
arrested at the weekend.
	   The respected daily Publico said Caldeira's latest available
confession concerned some 125 million escudos (dlrs 700,000), but
said police still thought this was only a fraction of what he is
suspected of stealing.
	   The paper said police searches of Caldeira's office revealed
uncashed checks worth more than 500 million escudos (dlrs 2.7
million).
	   As well as heading the fair's accounts department, Caldeira was
the treasurer of a housing company that built apartment blocks on
the Expo site in Lisbon.
	   According to Publico, on the one hand Caldeira was responsible
for writing checks _ valued at 1.6 billion escudos (dlrs 8.8
million) _ to Expo to pay for the land that was to be built on.
	   But then as accounts chief at the fair, he was on the receiving
end of the very same checks. Police now suspect this is where most
of the money went astray, the paper added.
	   Prior to taking on the job with Expo, Caldeira was acquitted of
stealing 600 million escudos (dlrs 3.3 million) from a ceramics
factory in central Portugal, Publico said.
	   Expo's relationship with other companies has also come under
police scrutiny, Publico reported.
	   It said police were investigating a contract to keep three
luxury cruisers docked at the Expo riverside site at a cost of 1.5
billion escudos (dlrs 8.2 million).
	   The liners were intended to house artists and foreign
delegations unable to find a hotel accommodation in Lisbon, but the
ships have so far been starved of guests.
	   Expo '98 celebrates the International Year of the Oceans that
coincides with the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's discovery
of the sea route to India. It was expected to bring in 343 billion
escudos (dlrs 2 billion).
	   Daily attendance figures for the fair, which began May 22 and
winds up Sept. 30, have been averaging some 60,000, well below the
predicted 100,000 figure.

	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ Construction crews are building the
world's deepest ocean oil rig off the Caribbean island of Curacao,
Shell U.S.A. says.
	   At 300 feet by 300 feet (90 meters by 90 meters) and almost as
high, the floating Shell Ursa oil platform will plunge through
4,000 feet (1.2 kilometers) of water, the company says.
	   More than 100 crew will live aboard the rig, which is to be
installed in a submarine canyon off Louisiana.
	   It will beat the previous deepwater record of 3,214 feet (964
meters) held by a Shell-operated well in the Gulf of Mexico's
Viosca Knoll, said Sarah Payne, a spokeswoman for the New
Orleans-based company.
	   ``We'll be beating our own record with this one,'' Payne said.
Shell has a 45 percent stake in the dlrs 1.45 million project,
British Petroleum owns a 23 percent stake, and Conoco and Exxon
each own 16 percent.
	   Workers are building the floating platform in Curacao because
the island, 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of Venezuela, is
considered safer from hurricanes than the Gulf of Mexico.
	   When finished in November, it will be towed to a site over the
underwater Mississippi Canyon, 130 miles (210 kilometers) southeast
of New Orleans. There, it will be tied to the sea floor with 16
steel cables, each almost three feet (one meter) wide.
	   An underwater pipeline will carry the oil and gas to a seaborne
collection plant 47 miles (75 kilometers) away. Ships will take the
oil on to refineries.
	   Construction was briefly delayed after environmentalists and
hoteliers charged a crane ship damaged 6,000 square yards (5,000
square meters) of coral reef. Heerema Marine Construction, the
Dutch company building the rig, settled out of court and agreed to
hire a marine biologist to oversee underwater work.
	   Curacao's Lt. Gov. Stanley Betrian estimated the project would
pump guilders 3 million (dlrs 1.8 million) into the economy during
the four months of construction.
	   Heerema has hired 100 local workers and brought in 400 experts
from the Netherlands, Malaysia and Spain. Equipment and modules
have been been imported from Louisiana and Texas.

Pak ready to tame the links

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Karrie Webb's record-breaking
triumph at last year's Women's British Open came in sunny, almost
windless conditions.
	   This time she's running into a storm called Se Ri Pak.
	   Webb posted a championship record total of 19-under 269 at
Sunningdale last year. She won by eight strokes, tying another
record, and triumphed for the second time in three years.
	   Now, at windy Lytham St. Annes, Webb comes up against a
20-year-old Korean phenomenon who has blown everyone away on the
U.S. Tour.
	   With four victories _ including two majors _ in her rookie
season, Pak has become the most eye-catching player in women's
golf. In terms of results, she has even eclipsed her male
equivalent, Tiger Woods.
	   The LPGA and U.S. Women's Open champion faces up to some of the
biggest names in the sport once more _ only this time on a tricky
stretch of sandy links on the north-west coast of England. She
feels no pressure and even the fickle winds and the difficult Royal
Lytham course don't worry her.
	   ``It was tough. It was very tough,'' the 20-year-old newcomer
said on the eve of the championship after being buffeted by the
wind during Wednesday's Pro-Am round.
	   ``But I have to learn many different courses and many different
conditions. This is my first time here. It'll take me a long time
to be anything like great players like Nancy Lopez and Betsy King,
so I keep learning and learning.''
	   Pak's rivals, who have marveled at her play on the U.S. Tour,
are convinced she has the game to master the windy conditions.
	   ``She's got the game to win anywhere,'' said big-hitting Laura
Davies, who is looking for her first British Open triumph since
1986. ``She's a good player and, if you are playing well, you can
do well in any conditions.
	   ``It's a tough course but she can go anywhere and play anywhere.
If you're as solid as she is and the wind's blowing I wouldn't have
thought she'd think it was a big deal.''
	   With the weather conditions fluctuating almost hour by hour from
windy and wet to windy and sunny, the players know they're in for a
rough and unpredictable time when the championship starts Thursday
and they go in search of a first prize of 100,000 pounds (dlrs
165,000).
	   ``This will be very different,'' Webb said comparing the
conditions with windless Sunnindgale. ``You won't see scores like
that here. I'm exhausted. It was really difficult out there.
	   ``This is he first time I've played a links course here and this
weather is typical of over here. You had to laugh at yourself
sometimes. It was bad out there.
	   ``Everyone's going to hit it into the long stuff,'' Webb said.
``The winner will be the one who stays patient.''
	   The field of 138 also includes Annika Sorenstam, winner of three
titles on the U.S. Tour since early June, 1996 British Open winner
Emilee Klein and 1994 titlist Liselotte Neumann, who has won two
titles this year.
	   But Pak, who goes out with Neumann and England's Lisa Hackney,
has already attracted the biggest following even on her practice
rounds.
	   Coached by David Leadbetter, whose guidance helped Nick Faldo
and Nick Price to win majors, Pak makes good use of the leg and
body strength gained from her days as a teen-age track hurdler and
shot putter.
	   ``She has such great natural talent,'' said Leadbetter. ``Her
dad was a really good player and she has got all the fundamentals.
And she has an unbelieveable temperament. She never gets
flustered.''
	   Pak said she managed only two birdies during her round on
Wednesday but laughed when she was asked how many bogeys in the
windy conditions.
	   ``I'm not telling,'' she said. ``It's a secret.''

Government unveils financial aid for Northern Ireland's victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The British government on
Wednesday announced a possible 1.3 million pounds (dlrs 2.1
million) in aid for victims of violence in Northern Ireland.
	   ``I am committed to ensuring that victims get the recognition
they deserve,'' said Adam Ingram, the government's minister
responsible for security in Northern Ireland.
	   ``We must hope that there are no more victims, but realistically
that is not going to be the case,'' he said, referring to the
continuing violence and attacks by dissident paramilitary groups
that oppose April's peace agreement.
	   Ingram announced 250,000 pounds (dlrs 400,000) in special
educational support for the children of people slain in the past
three decades of conflict, and another 60,000 pounds (dlrs 100,000)
to start up other victims-related services, such as transport for
the disabled.
	   He also pledged that the government would provide up to 1
million pounds (dlrs 1.6 million) to families who have had members
slain or maimed. But to the consternation of some victims' support
groups, this aid will require matching funding from international
donors contributing to an as-yet-nonexistent charity.
	   ``It's about time. But I remain skeptical until I see actions
rather than words,'' said Paul Morrissey, whose father was
tortured, stabbed and fatally shot by an anti-Catholic gang in
1975, but has received no victim-related support from authorities,
such as counseling.
	   Ingram said the government also would review how it provides
financial compensation to people who are wounded or lose property
from politically motivated violence. The government's Compensation
Agency already spends several million pounds (dollars) annually to
that end.
	   Since civil unrest began in Northern Ireland in 1969, more than
3,200 have been killed and 35,000 wounded in the British-ruled
province. Another 220 have been slain in Britain and the Irish
Republic. Relatives of those victims are also eligible for the
government's aid initiative.

11 shot dead in troubled Pakistani city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen sprayed a crowd sitting in a
park outside a central Karachi apartment building Wednesday night,
killing eight people in an attack that police and a local
politician linked to the city's political violence.
	   Seven others were wounded, said Shoaib Bukhari, a member of the
provincial government's cabinet and of the Mohajir Quami Movement.
The MQM has is stronghold in Karachi, Pakistan's economic center.
Bukhari said all the victims were supporters of his party, and
accused a MQM breakaway faction in the shooting.
	   Three people were shot in three other political killings in
Karachi on Wednesday, police said.
	   The shootings were the first after a lull of several weeks in
the MQM factional war that has killed scores in Karachi in the last
two months.
	   The MQM, a member of Pakistan's governing coalition, represents
Muslims who moved to officially Islamic Pakistan from predominately
Hindu India when the two independent countries were carved out of
one British colony in 1947.
	   Militants among Mohajirs, as Muslims from India are known, claim
they are discriminated against and years ago turned to violence to
press their demands to be treated the same as Pakistan-born
Muslims. Various Mohajir factions soon began fighting each other
for power.

Three suspects arrested in customs official's killing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Tajik police on Wednesday arrested three suspects
in the killing of a high-ranking customs official, including his
bodyguard, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Deputy customs chief Ali Emomnazarov was killed last month when
his car exploded just 100 meters (yards) from a presidential
residence. His widow Said Emomnazarova was shot and killed the
following week while she visited her husband's grave.
	   Investigators said Wednesday that Emomnazarov's wife had
apparently taken out a contract on his life, paying the killers
dlrs 6,000.
	   The chief suspect in Emomnazarov's murder was the customs
official's bodyguard, Kurbon Davlyatov, Interfax reported. It said
that Davlyatov had confessed to setting the explosive device under
Emomnazarov's car.
	   Two of his alleged accomplices were also arrested on Wednesday.

River row threatens fate of India's government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A row between two southern states over
sharing river water could topple India's government.
	   On Wednesday, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's emissaries
apparently were unable to convince Jayaram Jayalalitha, a powerful
politician from the southern state of Tamil Nadu, to continue
supporting the minority government, local news agencies reported.
	   The two emissaries, Defense Minister George Fernandes and
Vajpayee's political adviser, Pramod Mahajan, refused to talk to
reporters in Madras, Tamil Nadu's capital, after meeting with
Jayalalitha, Press Trust of India and United News of India news
agencies reported.
	   Jayalalitha's decision will be announced Thursday at a meeting
of her All-India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam Party and its local
allies, according to Thambi Durai, one of the 30 lawmakers
supporting her. Without the support of Jayalalitha's group, known
by its Tamil initials, AIADMK, the government will not have a
majority in parliament.
	   In the last few days, she has been in touch with opposition
politicians, notably Sonia Gandhi, the powerful leader of the
Congress Party, to form another coalition.
	   The southern leader first announced her displeasure with
Vajpayee's government by signing an accord with two states over
sharing of the Cauvery River waters, which has been in dispute for
more than 30 years.
	   The Cauvery originates in the state of Karnataka and flows into
Tamil Nadu, which insists on a certain share of the water.
Karnataka says the demand will mean it will have to scale back
future irrigation projects. It also rejects a quota, saying a poor
monsoon could affect its own needs.
	   A tribunal in 1991 ordered Karnataka to release 5.8 billion
cubic meters of water to downstream Tamil Nadu. Karnataka refused
to accept the decision and the dispute went to the Supreme Court,
which is still hearing the case.
	   The court asked the federal government to notify the tribunal's
decision by this week. Vajpayee then got all four southern states _
two of them also fall in the river basin _ to agree to set up an
authority to decide how to share the river's waters.
	   Jayalalitha described the decision as a sellout to her political
foe in her state. She then announced that she would pull out of the
government.
	   Jayalalitha has repeatedly announced that she will withdraw
support from the government since it came to power in March. But
she has so far not carried out her threats.
	   She has said that like a boxer, she will spar for a while before
delivering the knockout punch.

of ``a number of people'' in connection with the U.S. Embassy
bombing Wednesday as rescuers declared the search for survivors
over.
	   A brief statement from the office of President Daniel arap Moi
said those arrested were being questioned about last Friday's
attack at the Nairobi embassy but gave no further details.
	   ``A number of persons have been detained in relation to this
incident and are providing useful leads into the circumstances
surrounding the bomb blast,'' the statement said.
	   The government said it was grateful that many Kenyans,
especially members of the public, ``have provided and continue to
provide useful information to the various branches of the Kenya
police who are in charge of these investigations.''
	   The arrests were announced shortly after rescuers ended a
five-day search for survivors with a moving ceremony at the site of
the bomb blast.
	   Hours earlier, the body of Rose, a Kenya whose cries for help
inspired rescue workers and became a symbol of their search, was
discovered.
	   With the end of the search _ and the retrieval of Rose's body _
spirits sank. ``Everybody was Rose, everybody they could have
pulled out alive,'' said Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow.
	   Rose Wanjiku was found at 3 a.m. (0000 GMT) when weary soldiers
finally peeled back the last layers of wreckage that had trapped
her near an elevator, said Israeli Col. Udi Benuri, rescue
spokesman.
	   Benuri declared the search for survivors over at 10 a.m. (0700
GMT). No one had been brought out alive since Saturday, the day
after nearly simultaneous terrorist attacks in Nairobi and Dar es
Salaam, a Tanzanian port.
	   At least 247 died in the Nairobi bombing, including those of 12
Americans, and 5,436 people were injured, said Maj. Gen. George
Agoi, Kenya's chief of the rescue operation.
	   In Tanzania, 10 Africans were killed, and more than 70 hurt.
	   Rescuers marked the end of their search with a ceremony at the
ruins Wednesday afternoon.
	   The U.S., French, Kenyan, and Israeli flags flew at half staff
on the rubble. Eight wreaths lay on a pyramid of broken concrete,
which U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell sprinkled with red roses.
	   Earlier, in an interview with APTV, she said that three Kenyan
employees of the embassy were still missing, down from 130 the day
after the bombing.
	   She also said the embassy had been turned over to the FBI as a
crime scene. ``The full team of FBI investigators are here,'' she
said.
	   Benuri said Wanjiku, who was not severely injured, had died less
than 24 hours before rescuers got to her. She last spoke Sunday,
but her persistent tapping Monday spurred rescuers.
	   Reaching Wanjiku was extremely difficult because of the weight
of material blocking her and the danger of shifting material,
Benuri said.
	   As backhoes, gnawed on the last of the rubble, the FBI removed
what could be a vital piece of evidence: a vehicle plastered
against the Nairobi embassy wall by the force of the blast.
	   A bulldozer pried it off and hauled it across the street, to a
parking lot the FBI has turned into a crime lab for bomb-blasted
vehicles.
	   FBI agents scurried behind the bulldozer scooping up the bits of
debris-turned-evidence that tumbled from the shredded wreckage.
	   ``I think they've moved most of the potential evidence across
the road,'' said Capt. Rhyl Jones, garrison engineer of the British
Army in Kenya, who has been helping U.S. officials.
	   Jones, a demolition expert who has investigated Irish Republican
Army bombings in Northern Ireland, said the bomb left a
4-meter-diameter (13-foot-diameter) crater.
	   All that remained of the four-story Ufundi Cooperative building,
which bore the brunt of the explosion aimed at the American mission
next door, was churned up dirt littered with tattered clothes,
stained papers, shattered glass and tangled wire.
	   Worn out by their ordeal, exhausted Kenyan, Israeli and French
soldiers sprawled on the ground, some of them sleeping.
	   ``It's sad we didn't save more people,'' said Sgt. Doron Caspi,
a member of the Israeli team. ``Unfortunately, it was only
bodies.''
	   Investigators suspect the powerful explosive Semtex was used in
the attacks, but no link has been found to any particular group, a
senior U.S. official in Washington said Tuesday on condition of
anonymity.
	   In Tanzania, police working with the FBI arrested 14 people,
including six Sudanese, six Iraqis, a Somali-born Australian and a
Turk.
	   Tanzania's ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi,
said some of those arrested ``may have had a hand'' in the attack.
He said they had been turned over to the FBI for interrogation.
	   In Dar es Salaam, a dozen FBI agents raked Laibon Road outside
the wrecked embassy, searching debris for clues. The FBI said more
than 175 agents are either in or heading to the two East African
nations.
	   In Nairobi, FBI agents used cotton balls to swab fences, walls
and metal fragments at the bomb site to capture traces of
explosives.
	   The Kenyan Television Network on Tuesday night quoted a source
as saying an engine block had been found in the crater.
	   In Washington, the United States said it has temporarily closed
about half a dozen embassies because of increased threats of
terrorism. Among them were the U.S. stations in Egypt, Malaysia and
Yemen.

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Two Palestinians have been arrested by
Israel in connection with the shooting deaths of two Jewish
settlers last week, relatives said Wednesday.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office confirmed the arrests.
	   ``Security forces arrested two Palestinians near Medama village
last night and they are being questioned,'' an army statement said.
It did not provide names of the two men but said they were being
questioned.
	   Sabet Nassar, a 20-year-old nursing student, and Ahmed Kat, a
28-year-old teacher, were arrested late Tuesday night in their
village Medama, family members said.
	   Medama is near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, outside of
Nablus, where two seminary students were killed a week ago as they
patrolled the settlement's boundaries.

	   VALPACOS, Portugal (AP) _ Two people were killed in an explosion
at a small firework factory in northern Portugal on Wednesday,

Russia's parliament refuses to meet on economic crisis

on economy. Trims. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In another blow to the government's efforts to
stabilize Russia's reeling economy, leaders of the
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament said Wednesday they
would not call a special session to implement an austerity program.
	   State Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said last week the
legislature would meet Aug. 19-20 to consider 17 draft laws.
	   But deputy speaker Sergei Baburin said following a meeting of
parliamentary leaders Wednesday that the bills ``are not of such
super-importance that they have to be considered urgently. They can
wait until autumn.''
	   The laws would enact economic reforms demanded by the
International Monetary Fund and others in exchange for a dlrs 22.6
billion bailout package. Parliament balked at enacting other
reforms before adjourning for its summer recess, forcing the
government to impose them by decree.
	   Mikhail Yuriev, another deputy speaker, said parliamentary
leaders would reconsider calling a special session if they received
a formal request from President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov also complained that the
government should not expect lawmakers to work during their
holidays since it owes the Duma 126 million rubles (dlrs 20.3
million).
	   ``Why hasn't the government transferred the money if it wants
the deputies to convene?,'' he asked, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Top government officials tried, meanwhile, the keep the
country's eyes on the necessity of carrying out the austerity
program that is intended to generate greater tax revenues and cut
government spending.
	   They pledged anew to support the national currency and make debt
payments, in an effort to reassure foreign investors and stabilize
the stock market after Tuesday's more than 9 percent plunge.
	   ``If we thought that devaluation was unavoidable, we would not
be taking the measures we are taking now,'' said Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov, referring to the government's austerity program.
	   The Russian stock market ended the day 1.6 percent lower at
108.19 points, after falling more than 9 percent on Tuesday. The
ruble also sank against the dollar.
	   Zadornov said the government can guarantee its debt payments and
support the ruble because of increased tax revenues collected in
July and August. He also said that about dlrs 1 billion of an
International Monetary Fund loan will be set aside for these
purposes.
	   Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, visiting an aircraft engine
factory in central Russia, told reporters that the government
``must pursue our economic policy more precisely and firmly in the
face of falling markets,'' according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia's market has been in a free fall for several months, both
because of the Asian financial crisis and because of fundamental
problems in the slow transition from a command economy.
	   Despite repeated government assurances that it can stave off
another run on the markets, foreign investors still worry that
Russia cannot.

Doctors testify doped female swimmers suffered liver damage, facial
</HEADLINE>
hair &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Two medical experts testifying Wednesday in the
doping trial of a former East German sports doctor said the female
swimmers they examined showed health damage linked to
performance-enhancing drugs, including liver damage and excessive
facial hair.
	   The two professors said they examined 11 swimmers, all of whom
were witnesses in the trial. Five of the women had changes in their
voices, they said. One had heavy facial hair that was either caused
or worsened by taking anabolic steroids, they said.
	   Two women were diagnosed with liver damage, they said, and
another had a liver tumor that could be traced back to taking a
combination of contraceptive pills and steroids for eight years.
	   Such side-effects of anabolic steroids have been generally known
since 1977, they said.
	   Horst Luebbert, a professor of clinical gynecology, cautioned,
however that while the health damage was ``with all probability''
linked to doping, ``we can't offer (absolute) security.''
	   Luebbert and pharmacology professor Norbert Rietbrock testified
in the trial against Dr. Dieter Binus. His case was severed from
five other defendants _ four coaches and another doctor _ after he
made a partial confession last month.
	   The six were charged with causing bodily harm by administering
performance-enhancing drugs to young swimmers without informing the
athletes or their parents.
	   Binus, 59, admitted administering anabolic steroids, but
insisted in court testimony that the doses were too small to cause
physical harm and that none of his athletes showed ill effects.
	   The next court date for his case was set for Aug. 24, when a
verdict could be handed down.
	   The five other defendants have not made any statements. Their
trial resumes Monday.

	   RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in Germany late Wednesday to comfort
some of those injured in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya
and bring the bodies of 10 Americans killed back home.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel was on hand to greet
Albright after her jet landed at Ramstein Air Base. They then were
headed to the U.S. military hospital in nearby Landstuhl.
	   Earlier, six Air Force guards gently loaded the flag-draped
coffin of one American killed in last week's bombing in Nairobi
onto a military aircraft for her final journey home.
	   Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Old was returning to
her native Florida via Dover Air Force Base in Delaware at the
request of her family.
	   Seven wounded Americans also departed Ramstein Air Base on
Wednesday for Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland.
	   Six will be taken to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington for treatment, and the seventh to the burn center at
Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.
	   Albright was to meet with the remaining wounded, one American
and 11 Kenyans, at the Landstuhl hospital, then leave for Andrews
early Thursday with the bodies of the remaining 10 American
victims.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Foreign minister Niels Helveg
Petersen is supporting a Danish company's demand that Estonia
compensate it for a cement factory nationalized by the Soviets, the
newspaper Politiken reported Wednesday.
	   Helveg Petersen has contacted the Estonian foreign ministry on
behalf of the demand by the F.L. Smidth company, the newspaper
said.
	   The factory was taken over in 1945 after the Soviet Union
occupied Estonia. The Soviet Union paid the Smidth company about
dlrs 45,000 in compensation in 1964.
	   But the company filed a new compensation claim after Estonia
became independent in the collapse of the Soviet Union. It has not
commented on how much it is seeking.

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ In the latest attempt to prop up its
crumbling economy, the government of Belarus is demanding that
McDonald's restaurants in the former Soviet republic stop using
imported food and buy Belarusian products.
	   McDonald's, which accounts for 10 percent of Belarusian
restaurant business, imports dlrs 500,000 worth of goods a month,
mostly from Russia and Poland.
	   Belarusian products _ whose prices are strictly controlled by
authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko's government _ cost up
to one-third more than the imports, restaurant representatives were
quoted as telling the Dyen newspaper in neighboring Ukraine.
	   ``Purchases of Belarusian products would hurt both the company
and our customers: Big Macs would become much more expensive and
therefore, not affordable for Belarusians,'' McDonald's spokeswoman
Olga Troyan said, according to Dyen.
	   McDonald's is the fourth largest foreign investor in Belarus.
Its five restaurants employ 600 people.
	   Many foreign investors have been fleeing Belarus for months,
complaining of bureaucratic and other barriers to their work.
	   Belarus has one of the least reformed economies in the former
Soviet Union, with most enterprises still under state control.

	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Border troops were put on alert to

republics of Central Asia to coordinate plans for responding to the
fighting in Afghanistan, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   It said that the countries should concentrate primarily on
political activities, including dissuading other countries _
Pakistan in particular _ from interfering in Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban captured Hayratan, a city on the Afghan side of the
Amu Darya River, which marks the border with Uzbekistan. All Uzbek
border troops along the 147-kilometer (90-mile) stretch of the
border with Afghanistan have been put on high alert, said a Defense
Ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Russia has said it was ready to fortify the borders of the
former Soviet republics to prevent Afghanistan's turmoil from
spreading elsewhere in Central Asia.
	   ``The situation in Afghanistan is very complicated; the threat
to the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) borders has
grown,'' Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said Wednesday in
Moscow.
	   ``We are constantly and closely following the developments in
Afghanistan, and naturally are taking appropriate steps to
strengthen our troops,'' Sergeyev said.
	   Russia has for years had 25,000 Russian troops in Tajikistan,
where they help support the government and guard the country's
border with Afghanistan.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin accused military experts and soldiers from Pakistan of
aiding the Taliban, Interfax reported.
	   ``Massive military assistance from the outside encourages the
Taliban, fueling a dangerous armed conflict,'' Nesterushkin was
quoted as saying.
	   The Pakistani embassy denied the accusation.
	   ``Pakistan regards Afghanistan as its valued neighbor and fully
respects its independence and territorial integrity. The recent
developments in Afghanistan are wholly internal,'' the embassy said
in a statement quoted by Interfax.

<TEXT>
	   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) _ Two Palestinians have been arrested by
Israel in connection with the shooting deaths of two Jewish
settlers last week, relatives said Wednesday.
	   The Israeli army spokesman's office confirmed the arrests.
	   ``Security forces arrested two Palestinians near Medama village
last night and they are being questioned,'' an army statement said.
It did not provide names of the two men but said they were being
questioned.
	   Sabet Nassar, a 20-year-old nursing student, and Ahmed Kat, a
28-year-old teacher, were arrested late Tuesday in their village
Medama, family members said.
	   Medama is near the Jewish settlement of Itzhar, outside of
Nablus, where two seminary students were killed a week ago as they
patrolled the settlement's boundaries.

Judge rebukes Mandela for insolence, lack of credibility
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: A separate version moving with ``s'' coding &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A South African judge issued a
written judgment Wednesday rebuking President Nelson Mandela for
insolence and said his court testimony was not credible in a case
stemming from alleged racism in the country's rugby union.
	   Such public criticism is highly unusual for Mandela, who is
regarded as the hero of the anti-apartheid struggle and beyond
reproach.
	   In Pretoria, Judge William de Villiers released the 1,159-page
formal report explaining his April ruling that dismissed Mandela's
appointment of a judicial commission to investigate racism and
mismanagement in the South Africa Rugby Football Union.
	   De Villiers wrote that the credibility of Mandela's evidence was
subject to serious doubt, and some of his replies were far fetched.
	   ``The President, throughout the course of cross-examination,
addressed unbridled insults at the cross-examiner,'' he wrote.
	   In court, de Villiers had to admonish members of the public for
laughing at Mandela's quips.
	   A former lawyer, Mandela seemed to relish crossing swords with
SARFU's lawyer Mike Maritz and lectured him when he thought Maritz
had implied he was not telling the truth.
	   ``When people use such expressions it is a reflection of their
own character,'' he said.
	   SARFU went to court to block the government's investigation,
dragging the president to the witness stand. That enraged many
blacks and some whites, who felt it had gone too far and was trying
to humiliate Mandela.
	   Mandela lost his patience in court when the hearing became
bogged down in legal debate over how closely Mandela followed
stories about SARFU in the newspapers.
	   ``Mr. Maritz is glued to the conception that the only duty I
have as president is to read newspapers,'' he said to titters of
laughter from a public gallery.
	   De Villiers' judgment drew fire from Mandela's ruling African
National Congress, which accused the judge of overstepping
``morally acceptable limits of commentary expected from the
bench''. It said the judge may even have ``deep-seated feelings of
discontent with our new democracy.''
	   De Villiers was appointed a judge under the former apartheid
regime that ended with 1994's first all-race election of Mandela as
president. Mandela has sought to use sports to bridge differences
in South Africa's still sharply divided society,
	   Events overtook the need for the rugby investigation when the
man behind the court challenge, SARFU president Louis Luyt,
resigned and a new leadership apologized to Mandela.
	   Rugby has vast support among Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended
settlers who dominated apartheid governments and still maintain a
stranglehold on most professional teams. Blacks grew to hate the
sport during the apartheid era, associating it with the white
minority.
	   Responding to a question from The Associated Press, ANC
spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said it seemed the judge was implying
Mandela lied.
	   The ANC said Wednesday that Mandela would likely appeal the
decision.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan government said Wednesday that
several people have been detained in connection with the bombing of
the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, the worst attack ever on a U.S.
mission.
	   ``A number of persons have been detained in relation to this
incident and are providing useful leads into the circumstances
surrounding the blast,'' said a statement from the office of
President Daniel arap Moi.
	   Police in Tanzania, hit by a nearly identical bombing, earlier
this week said they detained 14 people but offered few details.
	   The U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were
hit by nearly simultaneous blasts last Friday; 247 people died in
Nairobi, 10 in Tanzania, and nearly 5,000 were injured.
	   The announcement came as the five-day search for survivors of
the Nairobi bombing came to an emotional end after the last body
was pulled from the rubble.
	   The rescue operation was officially over, but not the search for
clues leading to the killers. The blackened, shredded wreckage of a
vehicle that might have been the bomb was pried off the Nairobi
embassy wall.
	   At a ceremony Wednesday honoring the dead, the injured and those
who saved them, the American, French, Kenyan, and Israeli flags
flew at half staff on the ruins of the Ufundi Cooperative House
next door to the embassy.
	   The Ufundi building collapsed when the bomb went off, trapping
scores of people inside, including students at a secretarial
school.
	   ``They were innocents,'' said a weary ambulance driver,
Elizabeth Mwangi, who had been there from the beginning. ``You'd
find their bodies still sitting at their desks. Or piled up. It
really gets to you.''
	   The last body, that of a woman named Rose whose plight inspired
the search, was pulled from what little remained of the Ufundi
around 3 a.m. Wednesday morning.
	   She was last heard from on Monday and the thought she might be
saved spurred on the crack Israeli team leading the search. But no
one was brought out alive after Saturday.
	   ``He who saves one soul, saves the world,'' the commander of the
Israeli team, Col. Shalom Ben-Ari, said at the ceremony, quoting an
old Hebrew saying.
	   But the consolation was slight.
	   When the ceremony ended, U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell
plucked a red rose from the ground and made her way across the
rubble to the barbed wire now strung around the scorched and
battered embassy. Her shoulders shuddered as she wept.
	   Among the dead at the embassy were 12 Americans and 34 Kenyans.
	   It was an emotional day for many.
	   ``When you get to the end and you don't have any more survivors,
it is quite devastating,'' said Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow.
	   In an interview Wednesday, Bushnell said the embassy had been
turned over to the FBI as a crime scene.
	   The FBI has used everything from cotton swabs to bulldozers to
collect evidence from the site of the worst ever attack on a U.S.
embassy.
	   At midday Wednesday, they removed what could be a vital piece of
evidence: a vehicle plastered against the embassy wall by the force
of the blast. There is speculation that it might have carried the
explosives.
	   A bulldozer pulled it off the wall, then hauled it across the
street to a parking lot the FBI has turned into a crime lab for
bomb-blasted wrecks.
	   FBI agents scurried behind the bulldozer scooping up the bits of
debris-turned-evidence that dribbled from the shredded wreckage.
	   ``I think they moved most of the potential evidence,'' said a
British army officer, Capt. Rhyl Jones, who has been helping the
Americans, Capt. Rhyl Jones.
	   Jones, the garrison engineer of the British Army in Kenya and a
demolition expert who has investigated Irish Republican Army
bombings in Northern Ireland, said it was too early to say for sure
if the vehicle was the bomb.
	   American investigators here refuse to discuss the investigation.
U.S. officials say more than 100 FBI agents as well as other
investigators are in Kenya and in Tanzania.
	   Police in Tanzania said they arrested six Sudanese, six Iraqis,
a Somali-born Australian and a Turk and turned them over to the
FBI.
	   Tanzania's ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi,
said some of the suspects ``may have had a hand'' in the attack.
	   In Kenya, the presidential statement said ``many Kenyans,
especially members of the public, have provided and continue to
provide useful information to the various branches of the Kenya
police.''
	   There have been several unverified claims of responsibility for
the attack, including one from a previously unknown Islamic group.
	   In Israel, David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, said, ``there seems to be almost unanimous
consensus on it being a fanatic Islamic group.''
	   ``What is clear is that an operation of this size and complexity
could not be mounted without the collaboration of at least elements
of governments,'' he said.
	   In addition to sending the search-and-rescue team, Israel
offered the help of its intelligence agency, Mossad.
	   So far, none of the governments involved in investigating the
embassy attacks have said that a link has been established to any
particular group.
	   There have also been a spate of threats against other U.S.
targets since the bombings.
	   At least two diplomatic missions _ in Uganda and Sudan _ were
temporarily closed and security was tight at many others in Africa
and the Middle East.
	   The Israeli team was scheduled to fly home on Thursday. On
Friday, the U.S. Embassy planned a memorial service for its 34 dead
Kenyan employees.
	   ``At this point, the good news is that only three of our Kenyan
employees are missing. That is down from 130 on Saturday,''
Bushnell said. Two other Kenyans are also missing.
	   On Monday, Bushnell saw off the coffins of 11 of the 12
Americans who died in the bombing. The 12th will be buried in
Kenya.
	   The United States government is offering a dlrs 2 million reward
for information leading to the capture of the embassy bombers.

Sonne wins second stage; UCI stages EPO ``raid''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _Morten Sonne became the first Dane to
win a leg in the Tour of Denmark in two years on Wednesday, winning
the third stage by more than 10 seconds on a day the International
Cycling Union stage a ``raid'' to catch EPO cheats.
	   Representives from the cycling union's (UCI) doping control
committee awoke 30 of 101 competitors at 7 a.m. and took blood
samples, none of which displayed evidence of the EPO use.
	   ``Before the race we informed the UCI that we, because of the
events in (the Tour de) France this summer, welcomed raids from the
doping control during the race,'' Danish Cycling Union chairman
Peder Pedersen said. ``We want to take part in a ``cleaning up'' of
the cycling sport......and there is only one way to do that: by
repeatedly making drug raids.''
	   The riders reacted with shrugs to the raid and no protest events
were staged.
	   Sonne of the Acceptcard team completed the 205 kilometers (127
miles) from Randers to Aarhus in 4 hours, 59 minutes and 45
seconds.
	   He escaped with countryman Soren Petersen, German Torsten
Schmidt and Belgian Karl Pauwels after only 40 kilometers (25
miles).
	   Sonne finished with a flourish, while Petersen 10 seconds
behind, Schmidt 11 and Pauwels 17.
	   All four were well back in the field and despite Wednesday's
showing, remained out of the top 10.
	   Belgian Marc Streel maintained the yellow jersey, 20 seconds
ahead of Erik Dekker of the Netherlands.
	   Italian Francesco Frattini of Telekom was knocked unconcious in
a crash a few yards before the finish and was taken to a hospital
in an ambulance.

U.S. House speaker meets Northern Ireland's key Catholic leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUNCRANA, Ireland (AP) _ U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich on
Wednesday met with the chief Irish Catholic architect of Northern
Ireland's peace process, after conferring with senior British
Protestant politicians in Belfast.
	   Gingrich dined with John Hume and Willie McCarter, director of
the International Fund for Ireland, near Hume's rural retreat in
County Donegal, just across the border from the British-ruled
province in the Republic of Ireland.
	   Hume, leader of the north's moderate Social Democratic and Labor
Party, was considered instrumental in encouraging the Irish
Republican Army cease-fires of 1994 and 1997 and in delivering a
multi-party agreement in Northern Ireland's peace negotiations.
	   The International Fund for Ireland _ financed since 1986 by the
United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand _ supports
employment and tourism projects in Northern Ireland and the Irish
Republic's six bordering counties, including Donegal.
	   The United States in 1995 increased its annual contribution to
dlrs 15 million as its chief financial contribution to peacemaking
here.
	   On Thursday, Gingrich planned to visit the geneological center
dedicated to the O'Dohertys, the clan of his maternal grandmother,
and to walk around Londonderry, Northern Ireland's second-largest
city.
	   On Friday, he is scheduled to meet Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern before flying back to Washington the next day.

Yugoslavia repels UN criticism about Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia reacted furiously
Wednesday to the U.N. Security Council statement that condemned it
for excessive use of force against ethnic Albanian separatists in
the Kosovo province.
	   A commentary by the government-controlled, state-run Tanjug news
agency said the non-binding statement ``does not help at all to
give an objective and true picture'' of the situation in Kosovo,
the southern province of Serbia, the larger of two Yugoslav
republics,
	   Violence has raged for months in the province where Serbian
police and federal army troops are battling secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army, a force formed by local ethnic Albanians, a strong
local majority in the province.
	   The Security Council document reiterated calls for a cease fire.
Three members _ Britain, France and Slovenia _ pushed for action
against Yugoslavia, and Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the
Yugoslavs' ``scorched-earth policy.''
	   The council's statement broke no new ground, although it did
single out Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's regime as using
``excessive force.''
	   ``By dramatizing the situation (the U.N. document) tries to hide
and ignore the responsibility that lies on the leaders of Albanian
minority,'' the commentary said, adding that police are ``forced to
react to terrorist attacks and provocations by extremists from the
ethnic Albanian minority,'' living in Serbia.
	   The Security Council is a point where opposing views on Kosovo
crisis have converged. Western powers lean toward an armed
intervention in Kosovo while China and Russia, Serbia's traditional
ally, strongly oppose it.
	   This has blocked a binding resolution or giving mandate to NATO
to intervene.
	   NATO allies have been considering to intervene without full
consent in the Security Council but remain reluctant because that
would create a precedent.
	   Government troops in Yugoslavia have over the past weeks forced
out the KLA from most of estimated one quarter of Kosovo that the
rebels had controlled.
	   Reacting to the statement, the commentary also accused Slovenia,
the current Security Council chair and the first republic that
seceded in 1991 from former Yugoslavia, of being ``true to its
anti-Yugoslav and anti-Serbian policy.''

Roma coach questioned by prosecutor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Vialli's remarks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ The coach of AS Roma, who has shaken up the
Italian soccer world, was questioned by a prosecutor Wednesday
about his allegations that some top players may use
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Zdenek Zeman walked past reporters without commenting following
a 2 1/2-hour session with prosecutor Raffaele Guariniello.
	   Following questioning Tuesday by Italian Olympic Committee
officials, Zeman stood his ground, insisting a series of published
remarks he made were for the good of soccer on an ``ethical
issue.''
	   He underlined, however, he never spoke specifically of drugs but
of ``medicines'' and that he did not have specific drug in mind.
	   He had particularly drawn the ire of officials of soccer dynasty
Juventus by expressing his ``amazement'' at the quick muscular
development of current star Alessandro Del Piero and former star
Gianluca Vialli, now player-coach of English club Chelsea.
	   Vialli, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa, said he
took creatine, supplements and other permitted medicine when he was
playing with Juventus.
	   ``I took supplements which are available in all stores ... (At
Juventus) I realized how much it's important to work on physical
form. It has improved me, it has extended my career. For this
reason at Chelsea I'm trying to imitate Juventus in the
organization and method of preparation,'' Vialli was quoted as
saying.
	   Vialli, who joined Chelsea two years ago after four seasons with
Juventus, criticized Zeman ``for creating a situation of witch-hunt
which I'm afraid will hurt everybody (in soccer).''
	   ``I think there is a plan to discredit Juventus, and Zeman is an
agent in this plan,'' Vialli said.
	   Meanwhile Sepp Blatter, the president of soccer's governing
body, told the Gazzetta dello Sport daily that soccer is a clean
sport. But he called on governments to approve stiff anti-doping
laws, ``otherwise soccer will lose credibility and the public will
lose interest.''
	   The FIFA president said he was closely monitoring the Italian
case and would make the fight against doping his main priority this
season.
	   The head of Juventus' medical team, Riccardo Agricola, denied
administering steroids or other banned substances to his players
and said he doubted other teams used them.
	   ``Healthy people practice sports and healthy people don't need
to take medicines,'' Zeman said Tuesday.
	   After the Turin session, Zeman rejoined his club in pre-season
training in the Alps north of Venice.

Arco pulling out of natural gas exploration in Myanmar
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Atlantic Richfield Co. is withdrawing from
Myanmar, where it had been exploring for natural gas, but denies it
is bowing to criticism of the human rights record of the Asian
nation's military government.
	   Changing investment priorities, ``not protests or events inside
Myanmar'' influenced the company's decision to discontinue
exploration projects in October, said Arco spokesman Al Greenstein.
	   Arco's acquisition of Houston-based Union Texas Petroleum
Holdings Inc., an oil and gas company with worldwide operations,
led the company to rethink its global priorities, Greenstein said
Tuesday. The merger is expected to sharply expand Arco's oil and
gas production and reserves.
	   Arco has spent about dlrs 50 million since it began exploring
for gas off the southern coast of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma,
two years ago. The Los Angeles-based company allowed one of two
exploration leases to expire in June and will allow the second one
to expire in October without renewing.
	   Arco's withdrawal leaves only one major U.S. company still in
Myanmar. Unocal Corp. is a partner in a multinational consortium
developing a dlrs 1.2 billion natural gas pipeline scheduled to
begin operating in December.
	   Alleged human rights abuses by that country's military
government last year led to a U.S. ban on new investment in
Myanmar. In addition, human rights activists and several state and
local government boycotts have sought to pressure U.S. companies
from doing business in Myanmar.

	   WILLEMSTAD, Curacao (AP) _ Construction crews are building the
world's deepest ocean oil rig off the Caribbean island of Curacao,
Shell U.S.A. says.
	   At 300 feet-by-300 feet (90 meters-by-90 meters) and almost as
high, the floating Shell Ursa oil platform will plunge through
4,000 feet (1.2 kilometers) of water, the company says.
	   More than 100 crew will live aboard the rig to be installed in a
submarine canyon off Louisiana. It will beat the previous deepwater
record of 3,214 feet (964 meters) held by a Shell-operated well in
the Gulf of Mexico's Viosca Knoll, said Sarah Payne, a spokeswoman
for the New Orleans-based company.
	   ``We'll be beating our own record with this one,'' Payne said.
Shell has a 45 percent stake in the dlrs 1.45 billion project,
British Petroleum owns a 23 percent stake, and Conoco and Exxon
each own 16 percent.
	   Workers are, 5th graf pvs

Judge rebukes Mandela for insolence, lack of credibility
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise background, reference to Mandela's effort to
integrate rugby. A separate version moving with ``s'' coding &QL; 
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A South African judge issued a
written judgment Wednesday rebuking President Nelson Mandela for
insolence and said his court testimony was not credible in a case
stemming from alleged racism in the country's rugby union.
	   Such public criticism is highly unusual for Mandela, who is
regarded as the hero of the anti-apartheid struggle and beyond
reproach.
	   In Pretoria, Judge William de Villiers released the 1,159-page
formal report explaining his April ruling that dismissed Mandela's
appointment of a judicial commission to investigate racism and
mismanagement in the South Africa Rugby Football Union.
	   De Villiers wrote that the credibility of Mandela's evidence was
subject to serious doubt, and some of his replies were farfetched.
	   ``The president, throughout the course of cross-examination,
addressed unbridled insults at the cross-examiner,'' he wrote.
	   SARFU went to court to block the government's investigation,
dragging the president to the witness stand. That enraged many
blacks and some whites, who felt it had gone too far and was trying
to humiliate Mandela, who has sought to use sports to bridge
differences in South Africa's still sharply divided society.
	   Rugby has vast support among Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended
settlers who dominated apartheid governments and still maintain a
stranglehold on most professional teams. Blacks grew to hate the
sport during the apartheid era, associating it with the white
minority.
	   Responding to a question from The Associated Press, ANC
spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said it seemed the judge was implying
Mandela lied. The ANC said Wednesday that Mandela would likely
appeal the decision.
	   In court, de Villiers had to admonish members of the public for
laughing at Mandela's quips.
	   A former lawyer, Mandela seemed to relish crossing swords with
SARFU's lawyer Mike Maritz and lectured him when he thought Maritz
had implied he was not telling the truth.
	   ``When people use such expressions it is a reflection of their
own character,'' he said.
	   Mandela lost his patience in court when the hearing became
bogged down in legal debate over how closely Mandela followed
stories about SARFU in the newspapers.
	   ``Mr. Maritz is glued to the conception that the only duty I
have as president is to read newspapers,'' he said to titters of
laughter from a public gallery.
	   De Villiers' judgment drew fire from Mandela's ruling African
National Congress, which accused the judge of overstepping
``morally acceptable limits of commentary expected from the
bench''. It said the judge may even have ``deep-seated feelings of
discontent with our new democracy.''
	   De Villiers was appointed a judge under the apartheid regime
that ended with 1994's first all-race election of Mandela as
president.
	   Events overtook the need for the rugby investigation when the
man behind the court challenge, SARFU president Louis Luyt,
resigned and a new leadership apologized to Mandela.

Serbs attack Kosovo Albanian strongholds, trapping civilians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tanjug denial of police push against Junik,
reports of Albanians handing over weapons in several villages,
Albanian media claims heavy fighting. no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by mortars and
machine guns captured a major ethnic Albanian stronghold in Kosovo
on Wednesday and attacked another, trapping thousands of civilians
and rebels.
	   The state Tanjug news agency reported that the Serb police
Wednesday entered Glodjane, ``one of the strongest bases for the
Albanian terrorists.''
	   It said that the village near the Albanian border was ``under
full police control'' as of early afternoon Wednesday.
	   Tanjug said that in the fierce two-day fighting for Glodjane,
five Serb policemen and two Yugoslav army soldiers were killed. The
Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control, reported
that seven KLA fighters were killed and 49 wounded.
	   An APTV crew and an AP photographer witnessed the fierce
fighting near Glodjane Wednesday morning. Heavy exchanges of
machine-gun fire, and mortars were seen as the Serb police launched
a mopping-up operation. Smoke billowed from several houses.
	   The Serb police launched a simultaneous attack Wednesday against
the nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the Kosovo
Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian sources reported. The village was
under a Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three weeks.
	   State television in neighboring Albania, which sympathizes with
Kosovo Albanians' push for independence, also reported heavy
fighting in Junik with deaths on boths sides and some territorial
gains reportedly made by the rebels.
	   But Tanjug said Albanian ``terrorists'' in Junik lobbed mortars
at the Serb police who have been ``blocking'' the village for more
than 10 days. ``The police did not respond,'' the report said.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has guaranteed to European
Union envoys that Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters and as many
civilians are believed to be trapped, would not be attacked.
	   In Vienna, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
condemned the attack. Speaking on behalf of the EU, Schuessel urged
the Yugoslav government to avoid actions that would worsen the
``already unbearable humanitarian situation.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
appealed to the international community to help in forming a safe
corridor for the civilians trapped in Junik.
	   Belgrade's independent B-92 radio, quoting Serb and Kosovo
Albanian sources, described Wednesday's fighting near the Albanian
border is the fiercest since the clashes in Kosovo started in early
March.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians remain on the run in Kosovo,
international aid officials warned Wednesday, as Serb forces battle
rebels for control of a region near the Albanian border.
	   Tens of thousands of people in Kosovo have been displaced in the
past two weeks alone, Amanda Williamson, spokeswoman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said in Geneva.
	   She said thousands of people in Kosovo may still be living in
the woods or hills after being forced from their homes by recent
clashes.
	   The ICRC has delivered more than 100 tons of aid to various
places in the last few days, but Williamson warned that
international aid might not be enough.
	   ``We have a big crisis on our hands,'' she said.
	   The latest figures from the U.N. refugee agency put the total
figure of those displaced by the fighting at around 240,000.
	   Williamson said that over the weekend, a Red Cross team
evacuated to Kosovska Mitrovica some 55 Albanians sheltering on a
dried-up river bed in woods in the north of the central Drenica
area. They included ill women, children and elderly people.
	   World leaders are still deliberating on what to do to halt the
fighting if they can't bring the warring sides to a negotiating
table soon. In Brussels on Wednesday, NATO allies were fine-tuning
options for military action aimed at getting Serb forces to halt
their offensive against secessionists in the southern Serbian
province, populated mostly by ethnic Albanians.
	   At the United Nations on Tuesday, the Security Council
reiterated calls for a cease-fire. Three members _ Britain, France
and Slovenia _ pushed for action against Yugoslavia, and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the Yugoslavs'
``scorched-earth policy.''
	   The council's statement broke no new ground, although it did
single out Milosevic's regime as using ``excessive force.''
	   Yugoslav authorities reacted furiously to this. A Tanjug
commentary, reflecting the official government stand, said the UN
document ``does not help at all to give an objective and true
picture'' and that the police ``is forced to react to terrorist
attacks and provocations by extremists from the ethnic Albanian
minority.''

	   LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) _ A dozen people injured in the U.S.
Embassy bombing in Kenya were visited Wednesday by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, who flew to Germany to bring the
bodies of 10 Americans killed in the attack back home.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel greeted Albright with a
kiss after her jet landed at Ramstein Air Base. They then headed to
the U.S. military hospital in nearby Landstuhl, where one American
and 11 Kenyans wounded in Friday's bombing are being treated.
	   An Albright spokeswoman, Maria Rodriguez, said the secretary
thanked Kinkel for Germany's help after the bombing, including
sending emergency blood supplies.
	   Reporters were kept outside the hospital during Albright's
visit.
	   She planned to spend the night at Ramstein before flying back to
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland at 7 a.m. Thursday (0500 GMT)
with the coffins of 10 American victims. No ceremony was planned
before they depart.
	   Earlier Wednesday, six Air Force guards gently loaded the
flag-draped coffin of one American killed in Nairobi onto a
military aircraft for her final journey home.
	   Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Old was returning to
her native Florida via Dover Air Force Base in Delaware at the
request of her family.
	   Seven wounded Americans also departed Ramstein Air Base on
Wednesday for Andrews.
	   Six will be taken to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington for treatment, and the seventh to the burn center at
Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.

Laver moved out of intensive care unit; condition upgraded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rod Laver, who suffered a moderate stroke
July 27, has been moved from the intensive care unit to a private
room at the UCLA Medical Center.
	   In addition, hospital spokesomwan Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster said
Laver's condition was upgraded from serious to fair.
	   Moster said doctors were hoping Laver would be moved to the
rehabilitation unit at the hospital in seven to 10 days.
	   Laver, who was 60 Sunday, suffered the stroke during a taped
television interview. He was moved out of the intensive care unit
July 31, but went back in several hours later when he developed a
fever.
	   Doctors treating Laver say he is not paralyzed, although he
continues having difficulty moving his right arm and right leg.
	   Laver, an Australian who lives in nearby Newport Beach, is the
only player to win two tennis Grand Slams, as an amateur in 1962
and as a pro in 1969.
	   During his career, he won four Wimbledon singles championships,
three Australian singles titles, two U.S. Open singles
championships and two French singles titles.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks were rebounding in the United States and
closed with gains in leading European exchanges Wednesday after a
mixed showing in Asia as edgy traders looked for bargains following
a global selloff Tuesday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which began bouncing back from
steep losses late Tuesday, kept regaining lost ground and was up as
much as 101 points Wednesday. By midafternoon, the Dow was up 54.58
at 8,517.43 in trading that was not quite as heavy as Tuesday's
hectic pace.
	   At one point Tuesday, the Dow was down 257.98 points, or 3
percent, bringing losses to more than 1,000 points from the July 17
record of 9,337.97. But late buying reduced Tuesday's loss to 112
points.
	   Broader indicators also were on the rise Wednesday.
	   The market has been shaken by Japan's deepening recession and
fears it not only will setback a recovery in Asia's yearlong
economic crisis but worsen the fallout elsewhere. But the tailspin
in stocks paused Wednesday as lower prices attracted some
bargain-hunting.
	   On the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the
blue-chip Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed
with a gain of just over one-half percentage point Wednesday.
Frankfurt, Germany's DAX index rose 1.9 percent and the Paris CAC
40 index rose 2.6 percent. All three had been down Tuesday.
	   In Russia, stocks were unable to hold early gains and the major
index finished down 1.6 percent Wednesday. Because of worries that
Russia's economic problems will be aggravated by Asia's turmoil,
shares plummeted 9 percent in a stormy session Tuesday in which
trading was temporarily halted because of the steep losses.

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A medical team led by a U.S. surgeon
successfully removed Saudi King Fahd's gall bladder Wednesday, the
royal court said in a statement.
	   The king was recovering well after the operation in the Saudi
capital, Riyadh, said the statement carried by the official Saudi
Press Agency.
	   The operation on Fahd, who is in his mid-70s, was carried out at
the King Faisal Specialist Hospital by Dr. Ted Pappas of Duke
University in North Carolina and Saudi surgeons.
	   Fahd was admitted to hospital last week and Wednesday's
operation followed consultations with a number of specialists who
were brought to the kingdom from the United States, France, Italy
and Germany, the statement said.
	   It said consultations also were conducted via satellite with the
renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which recommended
that a cholecystectomy should be carried out. The operation is the
removal of the gall bladder.
	   Saudi television broadcast songs wishing the king good health
and praising him for his achievements.
	   ``We thank God for your good health, Oh, Tiger of Arabs and
Muslims!'' chanted a singer. Fahd means tiger in Arabic.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Backed by mortars and machine guns,
Serb forces captured a major ethnic Albanian stronghold Wednesday
and attacked another, trapping thousands of civilians and rebels.
	   Serb police on Wednesday entered the village of Glodjane, ``one
of the strongest bases for the Albanian terrorists,'' near the
Albanian border after a fierce two-day fight, according to the
state Tanjug news agency. Five Serb policemen and two Yugoslav army
soldiers were killed, it said. The Kosovo Information Center, under
ethnic Albanian control, reported three KLA fighters were killed
and 45 wounded.
	   Tanjug said Goldjane was ``under full police control'' as of
Wednesday afternoon.
	   An APTV crew and an AP photographer saw heavy exchanges of
machine-gun fire and mortars on Wednesday morning as Serb police
launched a mopping-up operation. Smoke billowed from several
houses.
	   Serb police launched a simultaneous attack Wednesday against the
nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian sources reported. The
village has been under Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three
weeks.
	   State television in neighboring Albania, which sympathizes with
Kosovo Albanians' push for independence, also reported heavy
fighting in Junik with deaths on boths sides and some territorial
gains reportedly made by the rebels.
	   But Tanjug said Albanian ``terrorists'' in Junik lobbed mortars
at the Serb police who have been ``blocking'' the village for more
than 10 days. ``The police did not respond,'' the report said.

`Full monty' and `LOL': New directory words for the millennium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: embargoed until 2301 GMT Wednesday &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Full monty'' and ``road rage'' made it. So did
``reality check'' and ``LOL'', the e-mail abbreviation for laughing
out loud.
	   It's OK to say ``snuck'' instead of ``sneaked.'' And a ``barn
burner'' is a very exciting event.
	   Language purists may groan, but researchers at Oxford University
Press _ creators of the authoritative multi-volume Oxford English
Dictionary _ insist it's time to formally welcome new phrases and
words into the English language.
	   The New Oxford Dictionary of English, published Thursday, does
just that, adding 2,000 words that have entered the language since
the 1970s.
	   The 350,000-word dictionary is the first written from scratch by
Oxford lexicographers in 70 years.
	   A team of 30 editors and 60 consultants from throughout the word
spent six years and 3 million pounds (dlrs 5 million) compiling the
book. They looked at every word, and fed 20 years worth of written
material into a computer system for analysis. That material could
be scanned in seconds to list a word's different meanings.
	   ``What this shows is how the words are really used _ not just
their formal meanings,'' Oxford press spokeswoman Helen McManners
said Wednesday.
	   The results are both new words and new twists on old words,
springing from pop culture, sports, politics, food and computing.
	   ``Pepper,'' for example, is listed as also meaning a basketball
practice game. The North American stew and dumplings meal, a ``pot
pie'', makes an entrance. A ``Blairite'' is a follower of British
Prime Minister Tony Blair. Even the much-feared ``millennium bug''
computer problem is included.
	   In addition to new meanings, the word listings also offer advice
about when to use a word, warnings about common misspellings and
tips about changing pronunciations.
	   Political correctness is also addressed. The dictionary says
``black,'' ``white'' and ``person of color'' are fine. But
``poetess'' and ``authoress'' are sexist and patronizing, so use
``poet'' and ``author'' instead.
	   Another dictionary appearing this month taps into 1990s culture,
overlapping in some cases with the new Oxford University Press
offering.
	   The Chambers Dictionary has been revised to include 8,000 words
and meanings that have appeared in the English language in the past
five years.
	   It defines ``mouse potato'' as someone who spends considerable
time on a computer, and ``go ballistic'' as becoming violently
angry.
	   And beware if someone calls you a ``saddo,'' which pops up in
both books. That means you're a dull or inadequate person.

Judge rebukes Mandela for insolence, lack of credibility
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAT REBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A South African judge rebuked
President Nelson Mandela on Wednesday for insolent behavior and
called into question the credibility of his testimony during a
hearing earlier this year over an investigation into the country's
rugby union.
	   ``The President, throughout the course of cross-examination,
addressed unbridled insults at the cross-examiner,'' Judge William
de Villiers wrote in a belatedly released text in Pretoria.
	   The text was the formal report of de Villiers' April ruling that
dismissed Mandela's appointment of a judicial commission to
investigate racism and mismanagement in the South Africa Rugby
Football Union.
	   Such public criticism is highly unusual of a man regarded as the
hero of the anti-apartheid struggle and who is usually beyond
reproach.
	   De Villiers wrote that the credibility of Mandela's testimony
was subject to serious doubt and some of his replies were far
fetched.
	   Wednesday's report was harshly criticized by Mandela's ruling
African National Congress, which charged in a statement that the
judge had overstepped ``morally acceptable limits of commentary
expected from the bench.''
	   It said the judge may even have ``deep-seated feelings of
discontent with our new democracy.''
	   De Villiers was appointed a judge under the former apartheid
government that ended with 1994's first all-race election of
Mandela as president.
	   ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said it seemed the judge was
implying Mandela had lied.
	   Mandela was forced to testify after SARFU sued to dismiss the
commission and subpoenaed the president.
	   Even before de Villiers made his ruling on April 17, SARFU and
its president Louis Luyt were harshly criticized for making Mandela
testify and the National Sports Council demanded the resignation of
Luyt and the rest of the union's leadership.
	   The NSC, an umbrella group of the country's sports governing
bodies, required the resignations or threatened a call for an
international boycott of the Springbok national team.
	   In his 1,159-page report, the judge described Luyt's and other
SARFU testimony as ``truthful and honest''.
	   Despite winning the court ruling, pressure continued to mount on
SARFU and Luyt resigned May 11. The union's new leadership
apologized to Mandela, who turned 80 last month, and two days later
the boycott threat was lifted.
	   During the hearing in March, Mandela _ a former lawyer _ seemed
to relish crossing swords with SARFU's lawyer Mike Maritz and
lectured him when he thought Maritz had implied he was not telling
the truth.
	   ``When people use such expressions it is a reflection of their
own character,'' he said.
	   Bogged down in legal debate over how closely Mandela followed
stories about SARFU in the newspapers, Mandela lost his patience.
	   ``Mr. Maritz is glued to the conception that the only duty I
have as president is to read newspapers,'' he said to titters of
laughter from a public gallery.
	   Several times, de Villiers admonished the gallery for laughing
at Mandela's quips.
	   The ANC said on Wednesday that Mandela likely would appeal the
decision.
	   Mandela has sought to use sports to bridge differences in South
Africa's still sharply divided society, but three days after de
Villiers ruling called rugby and an ``icon of conflict, division
and resistance'' in the country.
	   The rugby commission was to investigate SARFU on several issues,
including the lack of development programs for non-white players.
	   Rugby has vast support among Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended
settlers, who dominated apartheid governments. Blacks grew to hate
the sport during the apartheid era, associating it with the white
minority.

Butler, IAEA: New restrictions could conceal weapons revival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Restrictions on arms inspectors make it
impossible to ensure that Iraq is not reviving its weapons
programs, the top U.N. weapons inspector said Wednesday, stepping
up pressure on the Security Council to address the latest crisis.
	   Richard Butler's letter to the Security Council, ``seeking
guidance,'' comes a day after his counterpart at the U.N. nuclear
agency made a similar request.
	   ``A number of inspections planned in the chemical, biological
and missile fields will be delayed pending resolution of the
current situation,'' Butler said in the letter.
	   ``Under these circumstances, the Commission cannot continue to
provide the Council with the same level of assurances of Iraq's
compliance with its obligations to not re-establish its proscribed
weapons programs,'' the letter said.
	   Iraq froze out the inspectors last week, after Butler said he
could not certify that Iraq had met the requirements to end eight
years of debilitating sanctions, imposed after Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Iraq has allowed existing monitoring activities _ through closed
circuit television and sensors _ to continue, but that is not
adequate, Butler wrote. The inspectors will not go out on spot
searches without Iraqi escorts, who provide security.
	   Butler has said he believes that the Iraqis may have frozen out
the inspectors now to conceal a biological or chemical weapons
program.
	   A letter Tuesday from the International Atomic Energy Agency
chief, Mohammed ElBaradei, cited similar concerns that the new
restrictions ``result in a significantly reduced level of
assurance'' that Iraq will not try to revive its nuclear program.
	   Butler told the Security Council that he ``fully shares''
ElBaradei's conclusions regarding the inspections.
	   The Security Council unanimously agreed last week that Iraq's
freeze was ``totally unacceptable,'' but advised of no further
action.
	   A similar freeze in February sent British and U.S. troops into
the region and prompted warnings of an attack on Iraq _ averted by
Secretary-General Kofi Annan when he brokered an agreement with the
Iraqis to allow the inspectors to work.
	   This time, Annan has advocated a ``comprehensive review'' of the
relationship which could include a formal commendation of the
Iraqis for areas in which they have cooperated.
	   Annan's envoy to the region, Prakash Shah, was due to arrive in
Baghdad Thursday to try and persuade the Iraqis to allow the
inspections to resume.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Galatasary playmakers Hakan Sukur and
Gheorghe Hagi scored goals as the Turkish league champions beat
Swiss team Grasshoppers 2-1 in the first leg of the Champions Cup
second qualifying round Wednesday.
	   After a slow first half, Hagi opened the scoring in the 59th
minute with a penalty shot awarded after Sukur was pulled to the
ground by defender Bernt Haas in the penalty area.
	   Sukur scored again eight minutes later with a spectacular
scissor kick from a rebound, which gave the Istanbul-based team a
2-0 lead.
	   Grasshoppers narrowed the gap in the 85th minute when Johann
Vogel converted a penalty kick, award when Galatasary defender
fouled Grasshoppers' Kubilay Turkyilmaz.
	   Turkyilmaz, of Turkish origin, presented one of the main threats
to Galatasary, narrowly missing the goal in 53rd minute with a
powerful strike from outside the penalty area.

Rebel commander says 60,000 fighters closing in on Kinshasa

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A Zambian envoy began an investigation
Wednesday into charges that Rwanda and Uganda are waging a war
against Congo as part of a rebellion to topple President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Congo stepped up its rhetoric against its eastern and
northeastern neighbors, vowing to ``massacre'' rebels and their
Rwandan allies who were reportedly being airlifted by the hundreds
to a rebel-held military base about 350 kilometers (200 miles)
southwest of the capital.
	   Both Rwanda and Uganda have dismissed claims that they are
involved in the 10-day-old Tutsi-led revolt, but the accusations
have helped to rally Kinshasa's population behind an embattled
Kabila.
	   ``The entire population has become a military population from
today onwards,'' state radio said, quoting a Congolese army
officer. ``You will detect enemies and massacre them without
mercy.''
	   The rebels say they have more than 60,000 troops and are
marching toward the capital. Their actions closely resemble
Kabila's own rebel movement that in May 1997 toppled the reign of
longtime Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Uganda and Rwanda were major backers of Kabila's fight against
Mobutu. But they have been angered by the Congolese president's
failure to contain attacks on their territory by renegade groups
based in eastern Congo.
	   Many of the troops that fought for Kabila have defected and
joined the new rebel movement.
	   Rebel reinforcements continued to be airlifted Wednesday by jets
into an airbase at Kitona, about 350 kilometers (200 miles)
southwest of the capital, according to Gabon's state radio
monitored in Kinshasa.
	   Among the troops were a number of Rwandan soldiers, the radio
station said. Rebels were close to capturing the key port of Matadi
some 280 kilometers (175 miles) downstream from Kinshasa on the
Congo river, Rwanda's national radio meanwhile said.
	   The reported rebel advances came amid government boasts that its
forces had made inroads in both the far west and east. Officials in
Kinshasa said their hold on Matadi was firm.
	   It was not immediately possible to confirm the claims from
either side.
	   Aid workers said Wednesday that 19 hospitals in Congo's eastern
Kivu, including a hospital in the city of Goma near Rwanda's
border, were being ``overwhelmed'' by a growing number of patients.
	   The hospitals face a ``desperate need for safe blood,'' the New
York-based Catholic Medical Mission Board said in a written
statement appealing for donor assistance to its aid projects in the
region.
	   Officials in Kinshasa said Wednesday the government would begin
allowing the Red Cross to visit an unspecified number of prisoners
of war rounded up by Kabila's government in the capital.
	   The prisoners _ including some Rwandans _ were either captured
fighters or suspected spies who had allegedly provided intelligence
to the rebels, Minister for Human Rights Leonard She O'Kitundu told
journalists.
	   The Zambian envoy, government minister Eric Siluwamba, said he
hopes to open a dialogue between Congo and Rwanda to help ease
tensions. The peace effort follows weekend meetings in Victoria
Falls, Zimbabwe, where a commission was established by some of
Congo's neighbors to investigate Kabila's charges against Rwanda
and Uganda.
	   Both the rebels and Kabila's loyalists on Wednesday claimed to
have made military gains. State radio in Kinshasa said the
government regained the eastern town of Bukavu, a claim refuted by
the rebels.
	   The insurgents quickly captured Bukavu and another eastern city,
Goma, near the Rwandan border last week. Following an airlift to
the west, they seized control of Kitona, Banana and Muanda near the
coast.
	   Commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane, who served under Mobutu, said
rebel troops on Tuesday cut an oil pipeline in western Congo that
supplies Kinshasa.

	   LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) _ A dozen people injured in the U.S.
Embassy bombing in Kenya were visited Wednesday by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, who flew to Germany to bring the
bodies of 10 Americans killed in the attack back home.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel greeted Albright with a
kiss after her jet landed at Ramstein Air Base. They then headed to
the U.S. military hospital in nearby Landstuhl, where one American
and 11 Kenyans wounded in Friday's bombing are being treated.
	   An Albright spokeswoman, Maria Rodriguez, said the secretary
thanked Kinkel for Germany's help after the bombing, including
sending emergency blood supplies.
	   Reporters were kept outside the hospital during Albright's
visit.
	   She planned to spend the night at Ramstein before flying back to
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland at 7 a.m. Thursday (0500 GMT)
with the coffins of 10 American victims. No ceremony was planned
before they depart.
	   Earlier Wednesday, six Air Force guards gently loaded the
flag-draped coffin of one American killed in Nairobi onto a
military aircraft for her final journey home.
	   Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds was returning to
her native Florida via Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Her coffin
went back before the others at the request of her family.
	   Seven wounded Americans also departed Ramstein Air Base on
Wednesday for Andrews.
	   Six will be taken to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington for treatment, and the seventh to the burn center at
Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.

Soccer chief refuses to step down until November
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The president of Poland's Soccer
Federation, under pressure from the sports minister and some clubs
to resign, refused to step down Wednesday but said he would not
seek re-election in November.
	   Marian Dziurowicz announced his plans at an emergency meeting of
the federation to discuss a crisis in Polish soccer.
	   More than 20 members of the federation supported Dziurowicz at
the meeting, while five criticized him.
	   The federation scheduled a special meeting on Nov. 12 to choose
a new leadership body, and Dziurowicz said he would not seek
re-election.
	   But he refused to resign Wednesday, as demanded by several clubs
that boycotted matches last weekend in the conflict over alleged
corruption and mismanagement in the federation.
	   Sports Minister Jacek Debski suspended the entire federation
leadership _ more than 20 people including Dziurowicz _ in May for
refusing to allow an investigation into alleged mismanagement. The
federation leaders claimed they were independent of the government
review.
	   Debski reinstated them Friday to avoid a suspension from
international matches FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, but
only after the federation agreed to let state controllers examine
its books and records.
	   Five Polish first division matches over the weekend were
suspended because players refused to take part to protest the
reinstatement of Dziurowicz's administration.
	   Poland's national team has failed to qualify for the World Cup
since 1982. Debski blames soccer officials for the general decline
of the sports.

to further reduce costs that Laura Ashley concedes are higher than
those of its competitors.
	   Victoria Egan, who recently ran a shopping mall in the
Philippines for Malaysia's MUI Group, will take over Friday as
chief executive, Laura Ashley Holdings PLC said in a statement.
	   Mrs. Egan, 54, replaces David Hoare, a turnaround specialist who
was brought in to stabilize Laura Ashley's business after the
former chief executive, Ann Iverson, was forced out last year after
failing to dress up results at the company that made its name
selling floral English fashions.
	   Laura Ashley chairman John Thornton praised Hoare's performance
in ending the decline, but said it was now up to Mrs. Egan to use
her retailing expertise to make Laura Ashley profitable.
	   Laura Ashley lost 49.3 million pounds (dlrs 80.4 million) last
year on revenues of 345 million pounds (dlrs 562 million). Analysts
have predicted the company will lose between 15 million pounds
(dlrs 24 million) and 18 million pounds (dlrs 29 million) this
year.
	   Laura Ashley's stock price remains depressed, closing at 21
pence (34 cents) per share Wednesday, before the company announced
its latest attempt to recover. Laura Ashley shares had been 10
times as high within the last 18 months.
	   The new management faces a big challenge turning around business
in the company's 132 stores in North America _ a crucial portion of
its 441 stores worldwide.
	   Laura Ashley was forced last year to scale back big expansion
plans and said it still is cutting costs whereever possible.
	   On that front, Laura Ashley said it plans to save some 3 million
pounds (dlrs 4.9 million) by trimming staff numbers at the head
office in London.
	   Founded by an entrepreneurial woman of the same name, Laura
Ashley made it big selling English country fashions and was heading
for a listing on the stock exchange just its namesake founder died
in 1985.
	   The troubles soon began. Laura Ashley tried to sell a new line
of modern classics, but customers weren't buying, and efforts to
recover have thus far failed.
	   MUI, a huge Malaysian conglomerate, paid 43.7 million pounds
(dlrs 71 million) for a 40 percent stake in April, bringing in Mrs.
Egan as deputy chief executive.
	   Mrs. Egan was previously in charge of a company that manages the
upscale Shangri-La Plaza shopping mall in Manila.

EU Troika proposes more options for Kosovo autonomy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A delegation of the representatives from
the European Union troika suggested a model for autonomy for
Serbia's strife-torn province of Kosovo Wednesday, based on working
examples semi-independent regions in Europe and Russia.
	   The model is one of many that are currently being batted around
in an attempt to end the five months of fighting between Serb
security forces and rebel ethnic Albanians fighting for
independence in the region.
	   ``The international community and the European Union are
exploring all the possible patterns of autonomy to present them to
the two parties,'' said Gerhard Jandl, an Austrian diplomat heading
the EU delegation.
	   The example proposed Wednesday fuses elements of autonomy from
the South Tyrol in Italy, the Aland Islands in Finland and Chechnya
in Russia together, to suggest how Kosovo could best survive
independently, while remaining within the borders of Serbia, the
dominate Yugoslav republic, Jandl said.
	   The delegation is made up of the Austrians, who currently hold
the EU presidency, Germany and Britain. The delegation is to travel
to Macedonia on Thursday

International autopsy: Nigerian opposition leader died of natural
</HEADLINE>
causes &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS: UPDATES with comment on Abiola's medical treatment in
prison. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ After a month of detailed tests, an international
medical team said Wednesday that Nigerian opposition leader Moshood
Abiola died of natural causes, but suggested further review of the
health care he received in prison.
	   Dr. James Young, Ontario's chief coroner and a leader of the
five-member team, told a news conference in Ottawa that the
60-year-old businessman-politician suffered from a narrowing of the
arteries and had an enlarged heart.
	   Abiola, Nigeria's most prominent political prisoner, died July 7
while meeting a group of U.S. officials who were visiting him in
custody.
	   Young said a medical investigation, conducted by doctors from
Britain, Canada and the United States, found no traces of poisons
or toxins.
	   His announcement reinforced preliminary findings by the team
after it conducted an autopsy in Lagos, Nigeria, on July 11. In
subsequent weeks, tissue samples were examined in London and
toxicology tests were conducted at a forensic center in Toronto.
	   Young said these detailed tests supported a conclusion that
Abiola died ``due to rapid deterioration in a diseased heart.''
	   Abiola died as speculation mounted that he was about to be
released from four years of imprisonment. The timing _ a month
after the death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha _ spawned numerous
conspiracy theories in Nigeria and triggered rioting which claimed
dozens of lives.
	   Abiola's family said they suspected foul play. A U.S.-based
doctors group, Physicians for Human Rights, contended that Abiola's
jailers played a hand in his death by neglecting to treat his heart
condition.
	   Young said the medical team, which interviewed members of
Abiola's family, was aware of the concerns about his treatment in
prison.
	   ``We continue to believe that these concerns are understandable
and deserve further consideration,'' Young said. ``Further comment
on these issues is beyond the scope of the investigation we were
asked to undertake.''
	   Born in poverty, Abiola amassed a fortune in industries
including publishing, shipping and oil, then became an unlikely
hero for Nigeria's struggling democracy movement.
	   Once an ally of the powerful military, Abiola fell out of favor
after winning 1993 presidential elections, which were annulled by
the military government. Abacha came to power in a coup later that
year, and when Abiola insisted on his claim to the top office,
Abacha jailed him and convicted him of treason.
	   Resolving the crisis over the annulled election is the biggest
task facing the new military ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who
has freed at least 30 political prisoners and tried to restore
relations with Nigeria's international allies. Abubakar has
promised to hold free elections early next year.

Catholic bishop reportedly ends 6-year exile for fathering son
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDs quotes from bishop of Kerry grafs 6,7

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Former Catholic Bishop Eamonn Casey, who
left Ireland six years ago after admitting he'd fathered a child,
has reportedly ended his missionary work in South America and
arrived in England.
	   Irish media reported that Casey, 71, arrived Tuesday at London's
Heathrow airport from Ecuador, where he had had worked among nuns
at a mission for the poor.
	   The former bishop of Galway, western Ireland, left the country
in 1992 after an American woman went public with news of their 1973
affair.
	   Annie Murphy protested that he wasn't paying sufficient support
for their son, Peter, now 23, who had rarely seen his father. The
Connecticut woman wrote a florid account of their romance called
``Forbidden Fruit.''
	   Much of the public was even more outraged that Casey had
improperly used collection-plate donations to cover his
surreptitious child-support payments.
	   William Murphy, bishop of Kerry, said he would treat any
application from Casey to work in his southwest Ireland diocese, in
which the disgraced bishop worked when he had his affair, very
carefully, ``because a lot of people are still hurt by what
happened.''
	   ``It would be very important that there should be a ceremony of
reconciliation with any parishioners to whom Casey might plan to
minister in the diocese,'' said Murphy, adding that it was for the
Vatican to decide whether Casey should work with the church in
Ireland.
	   Casey was last photographed in Ireland in 1994, when he returned
briefly to attend a relative's funeral _ and drew criticism from
church authorities for wearing his bishop's vestments. He has since
made a few more visits, but kept away from public events.

Arafat slams Israel for delaying peace process
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat address in Pretoria; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Wednesday said Israeli intransigence was threatening the Middle
East peace process and warned of a return of violence and war to
the region.
	   Addressing South Africa's Parliament, Arafat told lawmakers
Palestinians had opted for compromise while the Israeli government
had gone back on promises of a fair peace deal.
	   Israel ``has challenged international legitimacy and resolutions
and opened the door wide to the return of violence, anarchy, war
and destruction,'' said Arafat, who was given a standing ovation
when he arrived.
	   ``Since the present Israeli government assumed power, it has
hindered this (peace) process through procrastination and by
evading its commitments.''
	   Arafat demanded President Bill Clinton try to break deadlock on
an American proposal that Israel withdraw troops from an additional
13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian guarantees
to combat terror. Arafat has accepted the plan, while Israel has
yet to agree.
	   Later, Arafat addressed academics, diplomats and other officials
at the invitation of a thinktank in Pretoria and repeated his
commitment to ``exert my maximum efforts to support the peace
process.''
	   But in the written text of his remarks, he compared the Israeli
government and its treatment of Palestinians to the white apartheid
regime of South Africa and its policies towards blacks.
	   ``We need the same kind of international pressure, (which) was
put on the apartheid regime in its last years,'' directed toward
pushing Israel to carry out the peace accords, the text said.
	   Arafat, 70, who looked weary toward the end of his three-day
visit, has been accorded the formal welcome of a full head of state
and received the country's highest honor for foreigners _ the Order
of Good Hope.
	   Earlier on Wednesday, Arafat told journalists he hoped President
Nelson Mandela would use his good relationship with Clinton to
promote the Palestinian cause in the peace process.
	   Reporters asked Arafat what he wanted Mandela to tell Clinton.
Arafat replied: ``To be tough with those who are refusing a
peaceful initiative.''
	   Arafat was visiting Robben Island, site of a former jail just
off the coast at Cape Town, where Mandela spent 18 years as a
prisoner of the apartheid government.
	   Guided by Ahmed Kathrada, who was jailed alongside Mandela for
fighting white rule, Arafat toured the tiny island prison which has
now been converted into a tourist attraction and nature reserve.

Bomb explodes in Algeria, 7 dead, 11 wounded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A powerful bomb on a railroad track
exploded southwest of Algiers on Wednesday, killing 7 people and
injuring 11 others, official Algerian radio reported.
	   The explosion occurred near Ain Tork, about 150 kilometers (92
miles) southwest of the capital Algiers, Algerian radio said.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, and no further
details were immediately available.
	   Meanwhile, an Islamic militant, Hamou el Eulmi, 30, was killed
by Algerian security forces Tuesday, according to Algerian
newspaper reports Wednesday.
	   El Eulmi was allegedly a leader in the Armed Islamic Group, the
most radical Islamic organization actively trying to oust the
military-backed government.
	   The deaths were the latest violence in an Islamic insurgency
that began in 1992 and has killed an estimated 75,000 people.
	   The unrest was triggered by the government's decision to cancel
parliamentary elections the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was
poised to win.

Jones wins women's 100m, remains unbeaten this season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Reigning world champion Marion Jones
kept her season's record intact, winning the women's 100m on
Wednesday at the Weltklasse international meeting.
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season and has gone
under 11 seconds 12 times in the process, left the fiels trailing
behind her.
	   Her compatriot Chryste Gaines, trailing by a substantial .27
seconds, finished second, followed by Zhanna Pintusevich of the
Ukraine was third in 11.07.
	   While the time was enough to keep Jones in the race for the dlrs
1 million Golden League jackpot, it was not sufficient to improve
on her personal best of 10.71, and no where near Florence
Griffith-Joyner's world record of 10.49.
	   Jones, who has run the nine fastest times in the 100m so far
this year, remains unbeaten in the event since September 1997.
	   The sprint sensation has won 27 individual contests this year,
posting one win in 60, 14 in 100m, five at 200m, one at 400 and six
in long jump.
	   The 22-year-old American also competed in the long jump later
Wednesday evening.
	   In the men's 1,500m, Hachim El-Guerrouj posted the
second-fastest time ever to win the event in 3:26.45, narrowly
failing to break his own world record.
	   The Moroccan, with the aid of three hares enlisted to help him,
was expected to break his own record of 3:26.00 set in Rome last
month.
	   In the men's 110m hurdles, Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the
United States recorded the best time of the season, clocking 12.98.
	   Johnson, the reigning world champion, edged compatriot Mark
Crear, .02 back. Reggie Torian complete the American sweep, placing
third in 13.11.

Serbs attack Kosovo Albanian strongholds, trapping civilians

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by mortars and
machine guns captured a major ethnic Albanian stronghold in Kosovo
on Wednesday and attacked another, trapping thousands of civilians
and rebels.
	   The state Tanjug news agency reported that the Serb police
Wednesday entered Glodjane, ``one of the strongest bases for the
Albanian terrorists.''
	   It said that the village near the Albanian border was ``under
full police control'' as of early afternoon Wednesday.
	   Tanjug said that in the fierce two-day fighting for Glodjane,
five Serb policemen and two Yugoslav army soldiers were killed. The
Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control, reported
that seven KLA fighters were killed and 49 wounded.
	   An APTV crew and an AP photographer witnessed the fierce
fighting near Glodjane Wednesday morning. Heavy exchanges of
machine-gun fire, and mortars were seen as the Serb police launched
a mopping-up operation. Smoke billowed from several houses.
	   The Serb police launched a simultaneous attack Wednesday against
the nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the Kosovo
Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian sources reported. The village was
under a Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three weeks.
	   State television in neighboring Albania, which sympathizes with
Kosovo Albanians' push for independence, also reported heavy
fighting in Junik with deaths on boths sides and some territorial
gains reportedly made by the rebels.
	   But Tanjug said Albanian ``terrorists'' in Junik lobbed mortars
at the Serb police who have been ``blocking'' the village for more
than 10 days. ``The police did not respond,'' the report said.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has guaranteed to European
Union envoys that Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters and as many
civilians are believed to be trapped, would not be attacked.
	   In Vienna, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
condemned the attack. Speaking on behalf of the EU, Schuessel urged
the Yugoslav government to avoid actions that would worsen the
``already unbearable humanitarian situation.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
appealed to the international community to help in forming a safe
corridor for the civilians trapped in Junik.
	   Serb media also reported that ethnic Albanians in another
village handed over weapons given by the KLA, including machine
guns, mortars and rifles.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians remain on the run in Kosovo,
international aid officials warned Wednesday, as Serb forces battle
rebels for control of a region near the Albanian border.
	   Tens of thousands of people in Kosovo have been displaced in the
past two weeks alone, Amanda Williamson, spokeswoman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said in Geneva.
	   She said thousands of people in Kosovo may still be living in
the woods or hills after being forced from their homes by recent
clashes.
	   The ICRC has delivered more than 100 tons of aid to various
places in the last few days, but Williamson warned that
international aid might not be enough.
	   ``We have a big crisis on our hands,'' she said.
	   The latest figures from the U.N. refugee agency put the total
figure of those displaced by the fighting at around 240,000.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
province could face a food crisis unless refugees can return home
and harvest crops. He said the harvest season starts in about three
weeks, after which it may be too late to save the crops.
	   Williamson said that over the weekend, a Red Cross team
evacuated to Kosovska Mitrovica some 55 Albanians sheltering on a
dried-up river bed in woods in the north of the central Drenica
area. They included ill women, children and elderly people.
	   In Brussels on Wednesday, NATO allies were fine-tuning options
for military action aimed at getting Serb forces to halt their
offensive against secessionists in the southern Serbian province,
populated mostly by ethnic Albanians.
	   The meeting followed another call Tuesday by the U.N. Security
Council reiterated calls for a cease-fire. Three members _ Britain,
France and Slovenia _ pushed for action against Yugoslavia, and
Secretary-General Kofi Annan condemned the Yugoslavs'
``scorched-earth policy.''
	   The council's statement broke no new ground, although it did
single out Milosevic's regime as using ``excessive force.''
	   Yugoslav authorities reacted furiously to this. A Tanjug
commentary, reflecting the official government stand, said the UN
document ``does not help at all to give an objective and true
picture'' and that the police ``is forced to react to terrorist
attacks and provocations by extremists from the ethnic Albanian
minority.''

Battered Laura Ashley hopes new bosses can lead turnaround
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES word `as` in graf 11

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Troubled clothing retailer Laura Ashley, still
cutting out the frills, announced Wednesday it will try to return
to profitability under a new boss brought aboard by Malaysian
investors.
	   Part of the plan includes slashing dozens of adminstrative jobs
to further reduce costs that Laura Ashley concedes are higher than
those of its competitors.
	   Victoria Egan, who recently ran a shopping mall in the
Philippines for Malaysia's MUI Group, will take over Friday as
chief executive, Laura Ashley Holdings PLC said in a statement.
	   Mrs. Egan, 54, replaces David Hoare, a turnaround specialist who
was brought in to stabilize Laura Ashley's business after the
former chief executive, Ann Iverson, was forced out last year after
failing to dress up results at the company that made its name
selling floral English fashions.
	   Laura Ashley chairman John Thornton praised Hoare's performance
in ending the decline, but said it was now up to Mrs. Egan to use
her retailing expertise to make Laura Ashley profitable.
	   Laura Ashley lost 49.3 million pounds (dlrs 80.4 million) last
year on revenues of 345 million pounds (dlrs 562 million). Analysts
have predicted the company will lose between 15 million pounds
(dlrs 24 million) and 18 million pounds (dlrs 29 million) this
year.
	   Laura Ashley's stock price remains depressed, closing at 21
pence (34 cents) per share Wednesday, before the company announced
its latest attempt to recover. Laura Ashley shares had been 10
times as high within the last 18 months.
	   The new management faces a big challenge turning around business
in the company's 132 stores in North America _ a crucial portion of
its 441 stores worldwide.
	   Laura Ashley was forced last year to scale back big expansion
plans and said it still is cutting costs whereever possible.
	   On that front, Laura Ashley said it plans to save some 3 million
pounds (dlrs 4.9 million) by trimming staff numbers at the head
office in London.
	   Founded by an entrepreneurial woman of the same name, Laura
Ashley made it big selling English country fashions and was heading
for a listing on the stock exchange just as its namesake founder
died in 1985.

Iranian foreign minister visits Azerbaijan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Iran wants to cooperate with Azerbaijan
in developing the Caspian Sea's resources, the Interfax news agency
reported Wednesday.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi is in the former Soviet
republic on an official visit.
	   Iran and Azerbaijan are two of the five countries that border
the Caspian, which has some of the world's largest known oil and
gas reserves. The five have been unable to agree on how to divide
the sea's resources.
	   Kharrazi also said he favored direct dialogue between Azerbaijan
and Armenia over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is
located inside Azerbaijan but populated by ethnic Armenians.
	   And, asked about the fighting in northern Afghanistan between
the Taliban Islamic militia and an opposition alliance, Kharrazi
said ``only the government that represents the interests of all
ethnic group will be able to achieve stability in the country.''

	   LANDSTUHL, Germany (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright visited some of the injured from the U.S. Embassy bombing
in Kenya late Wednesday and prepared to bring the bodies of 10
Americans killed in the attack back home.
	   After talking with nine patients in a U.S. military hospital for
about an hour, Albright said, ``I told them we'd do everything to
support them.''
	   She also thanked the hospital staff for doing what she called
``an amazing job here in raising their spirits.''
	   Albright, who flew in to Ramstein Air Base late Wednesday,
planned to head back to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland early
Thursday with the coffins of 10 American victims. No ceremony was
planned.
	   ``This is a very hard trip,'' she told reporters outside the
hospital, a few minutes from the base in southwest Germany. ``I am
bringing home very brave people and they deserve the support of the
American people.''
	   She also repeated the determination of the United States to find
and punish those responsible for the blast in Kenya and at the U.S.
Embassy in Tanzania. More than 250 people were killed and more than
5,500 wounded.
	   ``We will not be intimidated by people who do not like what we
stand for, freedom and democracy,'' she said.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel greeted Albright with a
kiss upon her arrival. Albright's spokeswoman said the secretary
thanked him for Germany's help after the bombing, including sending
emergency blood supplies.
	   Earlier Wednesday, six Air Force guards gently loaded the
flag-draped coffin of one American killed in Nairobi onto a
military aircraft for her final journey home.
	   Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Sherry Lynn Olds was returning to
her native Florida via Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. Her coffin
went back before the others at the request of her family.
	   The 12th American victim was to be buried in Kenya.
	   Seven wounded Americans also departed Ramstein Air Base on
Wednesday for Andrews.
	   Six will be taken to Walter Reed Army Medical Center in
Washington for treatment, and the seventh to the burn center at
Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas.
	   Thirteen injured remain in Germany: one American and 11 Kenyans
at Landstuhl hospital and another Kenyan at the University Medical
Center in Homburg.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The five-day search for survivors of the
U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi bombing came to an emotional end
Wednesday after the last body was pulled from the rubble.
	   The rescue operation was officially over, but not the search for
clues leading to the killers.
	   The blackened, shredded wreckage of a vehicle that might have
been the bomb was pried off the Nairobi embassy wall. And the
Kenyan government announced that several people have been detained
in connection with the bombing.
	   They ``are providing useful leads into the circumstances
surrounding the blast,'' said a statement from the office of
President Daniel arap Moi.
	   Police in Tanzania, hit by a nearly identical bombing, earlier
this week said they had detained 14 people but offered few details.
	   The U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were
hit by nearly simultaneous blasts last Friday; 247 people died in
Nairobi, 10 in Tanzania. More than 5,500 were injured, mostly in
Nairobi.
	   At a ceremony Wednesday honoring the dead, the injured and those
who saved them, the American, French, Kenyan, and Israeli flags
flew at half staff on the ruins of the Ufundi Cooperative House
next to the embassy.
	   The building collapsed in the bombing, trapping scores of people
inside, including students at a secretarial school.
	   ``They were innocents,'' said a weary ambulance driver,
Elizabeth Mwangi, who had been at the site since Friday. ``You'd
find their bodies still sitting at their desks. Or piled up. It
really gets to you.''
	   The last body, that of a woman named Rose whose plight pushed
the search forward, was pulled from what little remained of the
Ufundi around 3 a.m. Wednesday morning.
	   She was last heard on Monday and the thought she might be saved
spurred on the crack Israeli team leading the search. But no one
was brought out alive after Saturday.
	   ``He who saves one soul, saves entire the world,'' the commander
of the Israeli team, Col. Shalom Ben-Ari, said at the ceremony,
quoting a Talmudic saying.
	   But the consolation was slight.
	   When the ceremony ended, U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell
plucked a red rose from the ground and made her way across the
rubble to the barbed wire now strung around the scorched and
battered embassy. Her shoulders shuddered as she wept.
	   Among the dead at the embassy were 12 Americans and 34 Kenyans.
	   It was an emotional day for many.
	   ``When you get to the end and you don't have any more survivors,
it is quite devastating,'' said Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow.
	   In an interview Wednesday, Bushnell said the embassy had been
turned over to the FBI as a crime scene.
	   The FBI has used everything from cotton swabs to bulldozers to
collect evidence from the site of the worst ever attack on a U.S.
embassy.
	   At midday Wednesday, they removed what could be a vital piece of
evidence: a vehicle plastered against the embassy wall by the force
of the blast. There is speculation that it might have carried the
explosives.
	   A bulldozer pulled it off the wall, then hauled it across the
street to a parking lot the FBI has turned into a crime lab for
bomb-blasted wrecks.
	   FBI agents scurried behind the bulldozer scooping up the bits of
debris-turned-evidence that dribbled from the shredded wreckage.
	   ``I think they moved most of the potential evidence,'' said a
British army officer, Capt. Rhyl Jones, who has been helping the
Americans, Capt. Rhyl Jones.
	   Jones, the garrison engineer of the British Army in Kenya and a
demolition expert who has investigated Irish Republican Army
bombings in Northern Ireland, said it was too early to say for sure
if the vehicle was the bomb.
	   American investigators here refuse to discuss the investigation.
U.S. officials say 175 FBI agents as well as other investigators
are in Kenya and in Tanzania.
	   Police in Tanzania said they arrested six Sudanese, six Iraqis,
a Somali-born Australian and a Turk and turned them over to the
FBI.
	   Tanzania's ambassador to Washington, Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi,
said some of the suspects ``may have had a hand'' in the attack.
	   In Kenya, the presidential statement said ``many Kenyans,
especially members of the public, have provided and continue to
provide useful information to the various branches of the Kenya
police.''
	   There have been several unverified claims of responsibility for
the attack, including one from a previously unknown Islamic group.
	   In addition to sending the search-and-rescue team, Israel
offered the help of its intelligence agency, Mossad.
	   So far, none of the governments involved in investigating the
embassy attacks have said that a link has been established to any
particular group.
	   There have also been a spate of threats against other U.S.
targets since the bombings. At least four U.S. diplomatic missions
temporarily closed.
	   The Israeli team was scheduled to fly home on Thursday. On
Friday, the U.S. Embassy planned a memorial service for its 34 dead
Kenyan employees.
	   ``At this point, the good news is that only three of our Kenyan
employees are missing. That is down from 130 on Saturday,''
Bushnell said. Two other Kenyans are also missing.
	   On Monday, Bushnell saw off the coffins of 11 of the 12
Americans who died in the bombing. The 12th will be buried in
Kenya.
	   The United States government is offering a dlrs 2 million reward
for information leading to the capture of the embassy bombers.

Champions League: Sparta Prague defeats Dynamo Kiev 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Dynamo Kiev, a Champions Cup quarter
finalist last year, suffered a 0-1 home defeat by Sparta Prague on
Wednesday in the first leg of the Champions' Cup second qualifying
round.
	   Stunned in the 5th minute by an unexpected goal from Miroslav
Baranek, Dynamo spent the rest of the game attacking. But all of
its efforts were turned back by Sparta's defense, despite support
from 15,000 fans who filled Kiev's downtown Dynamo stadium.
	   Dynamo's Oleksandr Khatskevich and Sparta's Vlastimil Svoboda
were both shown a red card, and Vladyslav Vashchuk and Andriy
Shevchenko of the Ukrainian team were shown a yellow card.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The five-day search for survivors of the
U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi bombing came to an emotional end
Wednesday after the last body was pulled from the rubble.
	   The rescue operation was officially over, but not the search for
clues leading to the killers.
	   The blackened, shredded wreckage of a vehicle that might have
been the bomb was pried off the Nairobi embassy wall. And the
Kenyan government announced that several people have been detained
in connection with the bombing.
	   They ``are providing useful leads into the circumstances
surrounding the blast,'' said a statement from the office of
President Daniel arap Moi.
	   Police in Tanzania, hit by a nearly identical bombing, earlier
this week said they had detained 14 people but offered few details.
	   The U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were
hit by nearly simultaneous blasts last Friday; 247 people died in
Nairobi, 10 in Tanzania. More than 5,500 were injured, mostly in
Nairobi.
	   At a ceremony Wednesday honoring the dead, the injured and those
who saved them, the American, French, Kenyan, and Israeli flags
flew at half staff on the ruins of the Ufundi Cooperative House
next to the embassy.
	   The building collapsed in the bombing, trapping scores of people
inside, including students at a secretarial school.
	   ``They were innocents,'' said a weary ambulance driver,
Elizabeth Mwangi, who had been at the site since Friday. ``You'd
find their bodies still sitting at their desks. Or piled up. It
really gets to you.''
	   The last body, that of a woman named Rose whose plight pushed
the search forward, was pulled from what little remained of the
Ufundi around 3 a.m. Wednesday morning.
	   She was last heard on Monday and the thought she might be saved
spurred on the crack Israeli team leading the search. But no one
was brought out alive after Saturday.
	   ``He who saves one soul, saves entire the world,'' the commander
of the Israeli team, Col. Shalom Ben-Ari, said at the ceremony,
quoting a Talmudic saying.
	   But the consolation was slight.
	   When the ceremony ended, U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell
plucked a red rose from the ground and made her way across the
rubble to the barbed wire now strung around the scorched and
battered embassy. Her shoulders shuddered as she wept.
	   Among the dead at the embassy were 12 Americans and 34 Kenyans.
	   It was an emotional day for many.
	   ``When you get to the end and you don't have any more survivors,
it is quite devastating,'' said Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow.
	   In an interview Wednesday, Bushnell said the embassy had been
turned over to the FBI as a crime scene.
	   The FBI has used everything from cotton swabs to bulldozers to
collect evidence from the site of the worst ever attack on a U.S.
embassy.
	   At midday Wednesday, they removed what could be a vital piece of
evidence: a vehicle plastered against the embassy wall by the force
of the blast. There is speculation that it might have carried the
explosives.
	   A bulldozer pulled it off the wall, then hauled it across the
street to a parking lot the FBI has turned into a crime lab for
bomb-blasted wrecks.
	   FBI agents scurried behind the bulldozer scooping up the bits of
debris-turned-evidence that dribbled from the shredded wreckage.
	   ``I think they moved most of the potential evidence,'' said a
British army officer, Capt. Rhyl Jones, who has been helping the
Americans, Capt. Rhyl Jones.
	   Jones, the garrison engineer of the British Army in Kenya and a
demolition expert who has investigated Irish Republican Army
bombings in Northern Ireland, said it was too early to say for sure
if the vehicle was the bomb.
	   American investigators here refuse to discuss the investigation.
U.S. officials say 175 FBI agents as well as other investigators

	   Police in Tanzania said they arrested six Sudanese, six Iraqis,
a Somali-born Australian and a Turk and turned them over to the

said some of the suspects ``may have had a hand'' in the attack.
	   In Kenya, the presidential statement said ``many Kenyans,

Dam failure in Spain hurts mining company's earnings
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Figures in U.S. dollars. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A damaging spill from a dam at a Spanish mine in
April cost Boliden Ltd. dlrs 34 million and contributed to a hefty
loss for the company in the second quarter of 1998.
	   Boliden reported Wednesday it lost dlrs 52.1 million in the
three months ended June 30, compared with net profits of dlrs 19.7
million for the same period of 1997.
	   Much of the loss was the dlrs 34 million charge stemming from
the dam failure at the Los Frailes gold mine near Seville, which
flooded the Spanish countryside with toxic mine tailings.
	   Torrents of acidic water and tailings spewed into Guadiamar
River and the nearby Rio Agrio, a seasonal watercourse in the
semi-arid region of southern Spain.
	   The spill contaminated vast tracts of farmland, destroying the
livelihood of 2,000 families in one of Spain's poorest regions.
	   The Spanish government and Boliden's wholly owned subsidiary,
Boliden Apirsa S.L., have agreed to split the cleanup costs.
	   Apirsa says it has finished cleaning up 60 percent of the area
for which it is responsible and expects to have the job done by
September. The entire cleanup should be complete by October.
	   Geological movements below the earth's surface are being blamed
for the dam's failure, the company said in a release.
	   ``The dam failure was not caused by rainfall,'' it said.
``Rather it would appear that the original dam project did not
properly take into account all the geological factors associated
with the site.''
	   Part of the dlrs 34 million charge includes payments being made
to farmers to compensate for lost income. Boliden said it believes
the area can be restored to its original condition.
	   Boliden, the Toronto-based subsidiary of Swedish mining giant
Trelleborg AG, reported an operating loss of dlrs 45.1 million in
the second quarter and dlrs 34.4 million in the first half of 1998,
compared with operating income of dlrs 27.4 million and dlrs 53.2
million in the same periods in the previous year.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Firefighters managed Wednesday to extinguish a brush
fire that had threatened a resort on Italy's island of Elba,
forcing the evacuation of about 350 tourists.
	   The fire burned about 800 hectares (2,000 acres) in the island's
southeast since breaking out Monday night. Flames approached the
resort of Costa dei Gabbiani on Tuesday night, leading authorities
to evacuate the guests to a nearby school.
	   The tourists were allowed to return Wednesday, Italy's AGI news
agency reported.
	   Witnesses told authorities they had seen someone in a car toss a
benzene-soaked rag into the brush, Italian dailies said.
Authorities suspected the fire may have been set by local people
angry that land had been set aside for a national park on the
island, off Tuscany in western Italy.
	   In the central region of Abruzzo, the 50 residents of two
hamlets, Badia and San Martino, about 200 kilometers (125 miles)
northeast of Rome, were evacuated when a blaze threatened their
houses.
	   Other fires burned hundreds of hectares (acres) in the regions
of Umbria, Emilia Romagna and the island of Sardinia.

Jones wins women's 100m, remains unbeaten this season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Reigning world champion Marion Jones
kept her season's record intact, winning the women's 100m on
Wednesday at the Weltklasse international meeting.
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season and has gone
under 11 seconds 12 times in the process, left the fiels trailing
behind her.
	   Her compatriot Chryste Gaines, trailing by a substantial .27
seconds, finished second, followed by Zhanna Pintusevich of the
Ukraine was third in 11.07.
	   While the time was enough to keep Jones in the race for the dlrs
1 million Golden League jackpot, it was not sufficient to improve
on her personal best of 10.71, and no where near Florence
Griffith-Joyner's world record of 10.49.
	   Jones, who has run the nine fastest times in the 100m so far
this year, remains unbeaten in the event since September 1997.
	   The sprint sensation has won 27 individual contests this year,
posting one win in 60, 14 in 100m, five at 200m, one at 400 and six
in long jump.
	   The 22-year-old American also competed in the long jump later
Wednesday evening.
	   In the men's 1,500m, Hachim El-Guerrouj posted the
second-fastest time ever to win the event in 3:26.45, narrowly
failing to break his own world record.
	   The Moroccan, with the aid of three hares enlisted to help him,
was expected to break his own record of 3:26.00 set in Rome last
month.
	   In the men's 110m hurdles, Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the
United States recorded the best time of the season, clocking 12.98.
	   Johnson, the reigning world champion, edged compatriot Mark
Crear, .02 back. Reggie Torian complete the American sweep, placing
third in 13.11.
	   Maria Mutola of Mozambique also ran a season best in the women's
800 meters, crossing in 1:56.11. American Jearl Miles-Clark was
second, setting a new North American record of 1:56.43.
Miles-Clark, who held the previous record, improved her time by
massive .67.
	   Austria's Stephanie Graf was third in 1:57.97.
	   Japheth Kimutai of Kenya won the 800m, crossing in 1:42.87,
followed by Denmark's Wilson Kipketer, second in 1:43.18 and Kenyan
Patrick Ndururi, third in 1:43.21.

Guinea-Bissau talks delayed by debate over mediators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The next round of peace talks between
Guinea-Bissau's government and military rebels have been postponed
due to a debate over who should broker them, Portuguese news
reports said Wednesday.
	   No alternative date was given for the talks, originally set for
Aug. 18-19 under the auspices of the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries, or CPLP, the Portuguese news agency
Lusa said.
	   The CPLP has recently come under increasing pressure from the
Economic Community of West African States _ECOWAS_ to give it a
greater role in resolving Guinea-Bissau's two-month-old conflict,
Lusa said.
	   The postponement was announced after a meeting Tuesday between
the two organizations in the Ivory Coast capital of Abidjan, Lusa
said.
	   Up until now the CPLP has dominated mediation efforts in the
former Portuguese colony, brokering a cease-fire agreement between
the government and the rebels on July 26 that was reaffirmed in a
second round of talks last Saturday.
	   After the Abidjan meeting, Cape Verde Foreign Minister Jose Luis
de Jesus said he was happy to include ECOWAS into his CPLP
mediation team for the third round of talks, Lusa said.
	   But De Jesus also recognized that the two organizations had ``a
different vision of the crisis in Guinea-Bissau,'' Lusa quoted him
as saying.
	   The possible presence of ECOWAS members from Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea in the new mediating team could be taken as
favorable to Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Shortly after the fighting started, Vieira began receiving
military help from these two neighboring countries.
	   The conflict erupted when Brig. Ansumane Mane led a rebellion
against Vieira, accusing him of rampant corruption. Mane had just
been dismissed as military chief for allegedly running arms to
Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   The CPLP is made up of Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique, Angola,
Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe. ECOWAS has 16
members in the region.

Turgeon wins dlrs 4.65 million in arbitration _ biggest ever
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ St. Louis Blues center Pierre Turgeon has
received the highest arbitration award in National Hockey League
history, dlrs 4.65 million, for a one-year contract.
	   The award tops the dlrs 4.5 million deal given to the Montreal
Canadiens' Mark Recchi on Monday.
	   ``We are pleased, Pierre is very happy,'' Turgeon's agent, Bob
Sauve, said.
	   Turgeon made dlrs 3 million last season and was expected to get
a hefty raise because of the inflated salary trend caused by the
unrestricted free-agent market. If he has another big season,
Turgeon could demand another large raise next year.
	   Sauve said the parties met Saturday and the arbitrator made the
award Tuesday night.
	   ``It's a tough process, but it was done well,'' the agent said.
``The Blues had a point to make, but they did it in a classy way.''
	   Turgeon, an 11-year NHL veteran who has been with St. Louis for
the past two years, had 22 goals and 46 assists for 68 points in 60
games last season.
	   The deal was disclosed in a news release Wednesday by the NHL
Players Association.

Jones wins women's 100m, Bailey injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with men's 100m &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Reigning world champion Marion Jones
won the women's 100m meters Wednesday, keeping her season's record
intact, while Olympic champion Donovan Bailey may have put an end
to his.
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season _ going
under 11 seconds 12 times in the process _ continued her dominance
of the women's field. Leaving the rest of the competitors in her
dust, Jones posted the sixth fastest time of the year, crossing in
10.77.
	   Bailey, meanwhile, left the future of his season in question
after injuring his leg in the men's 100 meters.
	   The world record holder strained his hamstring about 60 meters
into the race, leaping into the air in agony. The Canadian lay on
the ground in evident pain for several minutes before being helped
off the field.
	   The race was eventually won by Nigeria's Seun Ogunkoya, with a
personal best of 9.96.
	   Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, who has run more sub-10-seconds
100m races than any other sprinter in history, was in the lane next
to Bailey, and finished third in 10.04.
	   Jones, who has run the nine fastest times in the 100m so far
this year, remains unbeaten in the event since September 1997.
	   While the time was enough to keep Jones in the race for the dlrs
1 million Golden League jackpot, it was insufficient to improve on
her personal best of 10.71, and no where near Florence
Griffith-Joyner's world record of 10.49.
	   Her compatriot Chryste Gaines, trailing by a substantial .27
seconds, finished second, followed by Zhanna Pintusevich of the
Ukraine was third in 11.07.
	   Jones has won 27 individual contests this year, posting one win
in 60, 14 in 100m, five at 200m, one at 400 and six in long jump.
	   The 22-year-old American also competed in the long jump later
Wednesday evening.
	   In the men's 1,500m, Hachim El-Guerrouj posted the
second-fastest time ever to win the event in 3:26.45, narrowly
failing to break his own world record.
	   The Moroccan, with the aid of three hares enlisted to help him,
was expected to break his own record of 3:26.00 set in Rome last
month.
	   In the men's 110m hurdles, Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the
United States recorded the best time of the season, clocking 12.98.
	   Johnson, the reigning world champion, edged compatriot Mark
Crear, .02 back. Reggie Torian complete the American sweep, placing
third in 13.11.
	   Maria Mutola of Mozambique also ran a season best in the women's
800 meters, crossing in 1:56.11. American Jearl Miles-Clark was
second, setting a new North American record of 1:56.43.
Miles-Clark, who held the previous record, improved her time by
massive .67.
	   Austria's Stephanie Graf was third in 1:57.97.
	   Japheth Kimutai of Kenya won the 800m, crossing in 1:42.87,
followed by Denmark's Wilson Kipketer, second in 1:43.18 and Kenyan
Patrick Ndururi, third in 1:43.21.

Abiola's doctor, colleague find no comfort in autopsy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The personal doctor of the late political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, on Wednesday cautiously reserved judgment
on final autopsy findings that showed the jailed Nigerian
politician died of natural causes.
	   ``I have not yet received a copy of the report,'' Dr. Ore Falomo
told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Nigeria's
commercial capital of Lagos. ``It is imperative that I am given a
signed original copy.''
	   Falomo, who observed the original autopsy being performed on the
60-year-old Abiola, warned that he would demand another post-mortem
if he discovered irregularities in the final report.
	   ``If there is a need for another examination, we will be very
keen to do so,'' the physician said. ``The pathologists have enough
samples for another autopsy if necessary.''
	   Opposition leader Abraham Adesanya was also not comforted by
news of the autopsy results that concluded the 60-year-old Abiola
had suffered a narrowing of the arteries and had an enlarged heart.
No poisons or toxins were found.
	   Several of Abiola's family members and other politicians and
pro-democracy activists declined immediate comment until they had
seen the report.
	   The findings were announced Wednesday in Toronto, Canada by
Ontario's chief coroner, Dr. James Young, who led a team of
international experts in the investigation.
	   ``My view is whether Abiola was poisoned or not, the military
cannot wash its hands of his death,'' Adesanya, who leads the
opposition National Democratic Coalition which has attracted many
of Abiola's former followers, said. ``If you incarcerate a man in
inhuman circumstances for four years and he is not allowed medical
attention, he will surely die.''
	   Young, speaking to reporters after a month of detailed tests,
reinforced his preliminary finding made days after Abiola's death,
saying the 60-year-old businessman-politician died due to a ``rapid
deterioration in a diseased heart.''
	   Young suggested further review of the health care Abiola
received in prison.
	   Abiola's family and many other Nigerians immediately suspected
foul play, in part because Abiola's July 7 death closely resembled
the demise of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha exactly a month earlier.
	   Both men died suddenly of apparent heart failure.
	   Abiola, the apparent winner of 1993 elections, was imprisoned by
Abacha the following year after he laid claim to the presidency. He
died amid speculation that he was about to be freed from jail by
Abacha's military successor, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar.

Report: Israel discounted warning of Kenya bombing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Israeli denial of report &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel advised U.S. officials to treat with
skepticism a warning by an intelligence source that the American
Embassy in Kenya might be the target of a bombing attack, the daily
Haaretz reported Wednesday.
	   But a senior Israeli official denied the report, which said that
the warning came shortly before the synchronized bombing attacks
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netnayhu, called the Haaretz report ``baseless.''
	   ``We have looked into all the exchanges between Israel and
American and found nothing of the sort. It's a baseless story,''
Bar-Illan said.
	   More than 200 people were killed and nearly 5,000 injured in the
attacks.
	   According to Haaretz, at an internal briefing following the
attack, an Israeli security official said that prior to the
bombing, the Americans had asked Israeli intelligence for an
assessment of the source's credibility. Israel said that based on
its experience, the man's information should be treated with
skepticism.
	   The report gave no other details about the intelligence source's
identity, or Israel's previous dealings with him.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinksy would not comment directly
about the report when asked earlier.
	   ``It is not our habit to comment on security matters of this
kind, irrespective of whether (the allegations) are correct or
not,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Israel and the U.S. routinely exchange intelligence reports as
part of their counter-terrorism efforts.

Disaster appeal set up for Kenyans killed in Nairobi bomb blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Kenya Society said Wednesday it had
teamed up with the Kenyan High Commission in London to launch an
appeal for Kenyans killed at the U.S. embassy bombing in Nairobi.
	   The overwhelming majority of the 247 people killed when a car
bomb exploded near the U.S. embassy in the Kenyan capital on Friday
were local people.
	   ``Many of the victims were sole breadwinners with large extended
families,'' said John Edwards, a former British deputy-high
commissioner in Nairobi who is also chairman of the society, which
promotes ties between Britain and its former colony.
	   Edwards said that the appeal will be linked with the National
Disaster Fund established by the Kenyan government.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A train making a maneuver in Milan's main
station Wednesday night rammed past a barrier meant to stop it at
the end of the track, slightly injuring four people, railway police
said.
	   The train, which was getting ready to depart for Naples, knocked
down a kiosk in the area where passengers mill around before
heading to their trains.
	   Somehow the last car of the train rolled past the block at the
end of the track where trains finish their journey inside the
station. Police said cause of the accident was under investigation.
	   Reports said passengers had not yet begun boarding the train
when the accident occurred.

leading European exchanges Wednesday after a mixed showing in Asia
as edgy traders looked for bargains following a global selloff
Tuesday.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which began bouncing back from
steep losses late Tuesday, kept regaining lost ground and was up as
much as 101 points Wednesday. It closed with a gain of 90.11, or
1.1 percent, at 8,552.96 in trading that was not quite as heavy as
Tuesday's hectic pace.

Edmundo: Nike forced ailing Ronaldo to play in World Cup final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Voicing what many Brazilians already
believe, midfielder Edmundo says it was a contract between the
Brazilian confederation and Nike that resulted in Ronaldo playing
in the World Cup final despite illness.
	   ``The Nike business is true,'' Edmundo said in a taped interview
published by Brazilian newspapers on Wednesday. ``There's a
contract that (says) Ronaldo must play every game for the full 90
minutes.''
	   Speculation about Ronaldo's appearance and performance has raged
since the final whistle on July 12 in Saint-Denis, France, where
the French ran over Brazil 3-0 to win the World Cup title.
	   The mystery started when Edmundo appeared in the starting lineup
instead of Ronaldo, who was listed among the subsitutes, issued
more than an hour before kickoff. Then, 15 minutes later, just as
inexplicably, a new starting lineup was issued with Ronaldo instead
of Edmundo.
	   An uninspired performance led to questions and revelations in
post-game interviews that Ronaldo had vomited earlier in the day
but was cleared by doctors to play.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo admitted ``Ronaldo shouldn't have played''
but then erupted into a tirade when someone questioned why he
re-inserted the 22-year-old striker into the starting 11.
	   At the time, Zagallo said he decided to start Ronaldo to restore
the confidence of the squad.
	   Ronaldo later said he had gone into convulsions before the game,
and rumors flew that he played under orders from above.
	   U.S. sportswear maker Nike, which paid more than dlrs 200
million to the CBF in 1996 as part of a 10-year sponsorship deal,
became an obvious target of the speculation.
	   During the week preceeding the start of the World Cup, some
players groused at having to appear at a Nike promotional event in
Paris, saying they were ordered by Nike to break off practice to
attend.
	   But a Nike official said the event was scheduled months before
the team's arrival and that it did not ordered training to be cut
short.
	   Nike again was forced to deny the new rumors, with an official
quoted in Wednesday's reports as saying it would be ``madness'' to
interfere in such a situation.
	   Of the 22 players on Brazil's World Cup roster, 11 were under
personal contracts to Nike. Chief among them was Ronaldo, who has a
lifetime contract with the company.
	   Edmundo said details of Nike's contract were worked out
personally by confederation President Ricardo Teixeira.
	   ``Nike is strong,'' Edmundo was quoted as saying. ``It
negotiated directly with the president. That means, the president
took a percentage.''
	   Teixeira declined to comment on the accusation. The Associated
Press tried to phone Ronaldo and Edmundo but was told neither was
available for comment.

Jones wins 100m, Bailey injured, Johnson wins but misses record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with men's 400m, CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Reigning world champion Marion Jones
won the women's 100m meters Wednesday, keeping her season's record
intact, while Olympic champion Donovan Bailey may have brought his
to an abrupt end.
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season _ going
under 11 seconds 12 times in the process _ continued her dominance
of the women's field. Leaving the rest of the competitors in her
dust, Jones posted the sixth fastest time of the year, crossing in
10.77.
	   Bailey, meanwhile, left the future of his season in question
after injuring his thigh in the men's 100 meters.
	   The world record holder strained his hamstring about 60 meters
into the race, leaping into the air in agony. The Canadian lay on
the ground in evident pain for several minutes before being helped
off the field.
	   The 30-year-old sprinter was taken to hospital and went
``straight into therapy,'' said race organizers.
	   The race was eventually won by Nigeria's Seun Ogunkoya, with a
personal best of 9.96.
	   Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, who has run more sub-10-seconds
100m races than any other sprinter in history, was in the lane next
to Bailey, and finished third in 10.04.
	   Jones, who has run the nine fastest times in the 100m so far
this year, remains unbeaten in the event since September 1997.
	   While the time was enough to keep Jones in the race for the dlrs
1 million Golden League jackpot, it was insufficient to improve on
her personal best of 10.71, and no where near Florence
Griffith-Joyner's world record of 10.49.
	   Her compatriot Chryste Gaines, trailing by a substantial .27
seconds, finished second, followed by Zhanna Pintusevich of the
Ukraine was third in 11.07.
	   Jones has won 27 individual contests this year, posting one win
in 60, 14 in 100m, five at 200m, one at 400 and six in long jump.
	   The 22-year-old American also competed in the long jump later
Wednesday evening.
	   Zurich's fast track and dlrs 50,000 bonuses failed to produce
any of the world records it was expected to.
	   The Weltklasse, with a budget of 5.5 million Swiss francs (dlrs
3.68 million), traditionally attracts the top-flight competitors
from every discipline.
	   Last year the event saw three world records fall.
	   Though it was widely expected that double Olympic champion
Michael Johnson would finally break the 400m world record _ the
longest standing track record set by Butch Reynolds on the same
track a decade ago _ the American could only improve on his
season's best.
	   Crossing in 43.69, Johnson shaved off .07 off his best time this
year.
	   While the 30-year-old has claimed the 200m and 400m titles at
the 1995 world championships in Sweden, and doubled at the Olympics
in Atlanta _ shattering the 200m record in the process _ the 400m
record remains the one glaring omission on Johnson's brilliant
resume.
	   Ranked among the greatest track athletes of all time, Johnson,
has lost just two 400m races in the last decade.
	   Rounding into form after a slow start to the season caused by
nagging injuries, Johnson's 43.96 in Monaco last Saturday triggered
speculation that the American was poised to crack Reynold's record.
	   Alvin Harrison finished second behind his countryman in 44.19,
followed by another American Tyree Washington, third in 44.42.
	   In the men's 1,500m, Hachim El-Guerrouj posted the
second-fastest time ever to win the event in 3:26.45, narrowly
failing to break his own world record.
	   The Moroccan, with the aid of three hares enlisted to help him,
was expected to break his own record of 3:26.00 set in Rome last
month.
	   Kenya's Bernard Barmasai led a Kenyan sweep of the
	   3,000m steeplechase, winning in 8:01.98. Patrick Sang was second
in 8:08.03, followed by Wilson Boit Kipketer in 8:08.62.
	   In the men's 110m hurdles, Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the
United States recorded the best time of the season, clocking 12.98.
	   Johnson, the reigning world champion, edged compatriot Mark
Crear, .02 back. Reggie Torian complete the American sweep, placing
third in 13.11.
	   Maria Mutola of Mozambique also ran a season best in the women's
800 meters, crossing in 1:56.11. American Jearl Miles-Clark was
second, setting a new North American record of 1:56.43.
Miles-Clark, who held the previous record, improved her time by
massive .67.
	   Austria's Stephanie Graf was third in 1:57.97.
	   Japheth Kimutai of Kenya won the 800m, crossing in 1:42.87,
followed by Denmark's Wilson Kipketer, second in 1:43.18 and Kenyan
Patrick Ndururi, third in 1:43.21.

Champions League: Bayern beats Obilic 4-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bayern Munich scored three goals within a
six-minute span in the second halftime and beat Obilic Belgrade of
Yugoslavia 4-0 in a Champions Cup second qualifying round first-leg
match Wednesday.
	   Stefan Effenberg opened the flurry of goals in the 59th minute,
Brazilian striker Giovane Elber added the second in the 63rd and
two minutes later, Alexander Zickler made it 3-0.
	   Bayern's fourth goal came from Thorsten Fink in the 77th.
	   Bayern needed one hour to break down Obilic's dogged defense.
	   With the Yugoslav champion mainly trying to protect its net,
Bayern dominated the game and missed several good opportunities in
the first half time.
	   Obilic goalkeeper Nenad Lukic did well to save shots by
37-year-old veteran Lothar Matthaeus, Bayern's new Bosnian forward
Hasan Salihamidzic and Elber.
	   But the Belgrade team's defense collapsed after 59 minutes, when
Effenberg somehow managed to push the ball across the line from a
scramble in front of the Obilic goal. On the way into the net, the
ball bounced off Lukic's knee and hit another Belgrade defender
before rolling into the net.
	   Obilic was stunned by the goal and Elber headed in the second
four minutes later by connecting on a perfect cross from Thomas
Strunz to the near post.
	   In the 65th, Zickler, a substitute who helped revive Bayern's
game along with bench colleague Carsten Jancker, scored on a
powerful header off an Effenberg cross.
	   Fink got the fourth with a strong right-foot drive from 18
meters (yards) into the low far corner.
	   Obilic, which had two chances in the entire match, looks
unlikely to overcome the deficit in the second leg in Belgrade in
two weeks.

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ The coach of AS Roma, who has shaken up the
Italian soccer world, was questioned by a prosecutor Wednesday
about his allegations that some top players may use
performance-enhancing substances.
	   Immediately following his 2 1-2 hour session with prosecutor
Raffaele Guariniello, Zdenek Zeman made no comment to reports. But
later, when back in his training camp, in northern Italy, he told
reporters without elaborating: ``I recounted the facts.''
	   ``If I do something, I do it because I think it's right to do
it,'' Zeman added. ``If I said these things, it's because I care
about soccer, because I want it to go on. I have nothing to add.''

Makkawi, Yemeni exiled politician dies in Cairo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Abdel-Qawi Makkawi, a prominent Yemeni
opposition leader and a former prime minister of South Yemen died
in Cairo Wednesday. He was 73.
	   Yemeni exiles said Makkawi died of a heart attack in a Cairo
hospital where he was admitted three days ago.
	   Makkawi was the last prime minister of the government of Aden
during British rule and before Britain gave independence to the
then South Yemen in 1967.
	   After his dismissal by the British Governor in 1965 for his
alliance with the late Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser,
Makkawi went into exile in Egypt where he set up the Front for the
Liberation of South Yemen with Nasser's backing.
	   But two years later, the British government declared South Yemen
an independent state under the Marxist National Liberation Front,
Makkawi's bitter enemy.
	   Since then, Makkawi lived in exile in Egypt and turned down
appeals by the current Yemeni government to return home.
	   He was the leader of one of the main opposition groups to
President Ali Abdullah Saleh's rule.
	   South and North Yemen were united in 1990.
	   Makkawi will be buried in Cairo according to his will, said the
exiles, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Makkawi is survived by a wife. His three sons were killed in an
explosion in Aden in 1966.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel advised U.S. officials to treat with
skepticism a warning by an intelligence source that the American
Embassy in Kenya might be the target of a bombing attack, the daily
Haaretz reported Wednesday.
	   But a senior Israeli official denied the report, which said that
the warning came shortly before the synchronized bombing attacks
outside the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Friday.
	   David Bar-Illan, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netnayhu, said the report was baseless.
	   ``We have looked into all the exchanges between Israel and
American and found nothing of the sort. It's a baseless story,''
Bar-Illan said.
	   More than 200 people were killed and nearly 5,000 injured in the
attacks.
	   According to Haaretz, at an internal briefing following the
attack, an Israeli security official said that prior to the
bombing, the Americans had asked Israeli intelligence for an
assessment of the source's credibility. Israel said that based on
its experience, the man's information should be treated with
skepticism.
	   The report gave no other details about the intelligence source's
identity, or Israel's previous dealings with him.
	   Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinksy would not comment directly
about the report when asked earlier.
	   ``It is not our habit to comment on security matters of this
kind, irrespective of whether (the allegations) are correct or
not,'' Bushinsky said.
	   Israel and the U.S. routinely exchange intelligence reports as
part of their counter-terrorism efforts.

Disaster appeal set up for Kenyans killed in Nairobi bomb blast

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain's Kenya Society said Wednesday it had
teamed up with the Kenyan High Commission in London to launch an
appeal for Kenyans killed at the U.S. embassy bombing in Nairobi.
	   The overwhelming majority of the 247 people killed when a car
bomb exploded near the U.S. embassy in the Kenyan capital on Friday
were local people.
	   ``Many of the victims were sole breadwinners with large extended
families,'' said John Edwards, a former British deputy-high
commissioner in Nairobi who is also chairman of the society, which
promotes ties between Britain and its former colony.
	   Edwards said that the appeal will be linked with the National
Disaster Fund established by the Kenyan government.

Champions League: Inter routs Latvian team 4-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PISA, Italy (AP) _ Newly-signed star-forward Roberto Baggio made
a triumphant debut with Inter Milan Wednesday night as he scored
one goal and setup three others in a 4-0 rout of Latvia's Skonto
Riga in a first leg of the Champions Cup second qualifying round.
	   Baggio, 31, one of the biggest names in Italian soccer, set up
first half goals by Ivan Zamorano, Diego Simeone and Nicola Ventola
and kicked in his own goal with a diagonal shot in the 60th minute.
	   The veteran forward, who transferred to Inter from Bologna in
the offseason, received a standing ovation by a sold-out crowd of
25,000 as he left the field in the second half, replaced by younger
Andrea Pirlo.
	   Zamorano, the Chilean striker, headed in the opening goal in the
fourth minute on a precise long distance pass from Baggio.
Argentine midfielder Simeone made it two six minutes later, again
with a header and again on a pass from Baggio.
	   Ventola, a powerful centerforward just transferred from Bari,
headed in Inter's third goal from two meters, on a corner kick by
Baggio.
	   Baggio's goal came on an assist by Zamorano, who misses two
other scoring chances to make Inter's victory rounder.
	   Wednesday's success marked Inter's return into the most titled
European competition following a eight-year absence.
	   The Milan team got a berth in the qualifying round of the
Champions Cup by placing second to Juventus in the Italian Serie A
last season.
	   Inter could do without its Brazilian superstar Ronaldo against
the low-ranked Latvian team. Ronaldo was given an extra rest period
to recover from World Cup stress and is expected to rejoin his
Italian team by mid August.
	   Skonto's defense was often in trouble against Inter's
star-studded attack while its forwards had a few scoring chances.
	   The best one came in the 56th minute. The shot by midfielder
Marians Pahars went past goalie Gianluca Pagliuca but the ball hit
the post, bounced back and was cleared by a defender.
	   In the 89th, with Inter one player down for the expulsion of
defender Francesco Colonnese, Skonto again hit the post of the
Italian team.
	   The match was played at Arena Garibaldi, in this Tuscan city
renowned for its leaning tower, because the San Siro field in Milan
is being relaid with new grass.
	   The second leg is scheduled on Aug. 26 when Inter could be able
to field Ronaldo, Youri Djorkaeff and Aron Winter, who missed
Wednesday's match.
	   ``I'm looking forward to playing with Ronaldo. I expect to do
great things with him, as soon as we can develop a good
understanding,'' Baggio said.

Serbs attack Kosovo Albanian strongholds, trapping civilians
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Western diplomats expressing concern
about harvest; other Serb media reports; no pickup &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by mortars and
machine guns captured a major ethnic Albanian stronghold in Kosovo
on Wednesday and attacked another, trapping thousands of civilians
and rebels.
	   The state Tanjug news agency reported that the Serb police
Wednesday entered Glodjane, ``one of the strongest bases for the
Albanian terrorists.''
	   It said that the village near the Albanian border was ``under
full police control'' as of early afternoon Wednesday.
	   Tanjug said that in the fierce two-day fighting for Glodjane,
five Serb policemen and two Yugoslav army soldiers were killed. The
Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control, reported
that seven KLA fighters were killed and 49 wounded.
	   An APTV crew and an AP photographer witnessed the fierce
fighting near Glodjane Wednesday morning. Heavy exchanges of
machine-gun fire, and mortars were seen as the Serb police launched
a mopping-up operation. Smoke billowed from several houses.
	   The Serb police launched a simultaneous attack Wednesday against
the nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the Kosovo
Liberation Army, ethnic Albanian sources reported. The village was
under a Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three weeks.
	   For five months, Serb troops have been fighting the KLA, which
seeks independence from Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia. Kosovo's ethnic Albanians remain largely divided
between those loyal to pacifist ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova and those who support the militants.
	   State television in neighboring Albania, which sympathizes with
Kosovo Albanians' push for independence, also reported heavy
fighting in Junik with deaths on boths sides and some territorial
gains reportedly made by the rebels.
	   But Tanjug said Albanian ``terrorists'' in Junik lobbed mortars
at the Serb police who have been ``blocking'' the village for more
than 10 days. ``The police did not respond,'' the report said.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has guaranteed to European
Union envoys that Junik, where some 1,000 KLA fighters and as many
civilians are believed to be trapped, would not be attacked.
	   In Vienna, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel
condemned the attack. Speaking on behalf of the EU, Schuessel urged
the Yugoslav government to avoid actions that would worsen the
``already unbearable humanitarian situation.''
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership,
appealed to the international community to help in forming a safe
corridor for the civilians trapped in Junik.
	   Thousands of ethnic Albanians remain on the run in Kosovo,
international aid officials warned Wednesday, as Serb forces battle
rebels for control of a region near the Albanian border.
	   Tens of thousands of people in Kosovo have been displaced in the
past two weeks alone, Amanda Williamson, spokeswoman for the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said in Geneva.
	   The latest figures from the U.N. refugee agency put the total
figure of those displaced by the fighting at around 240,000.
	   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
province could face a food crisis unless refugees can return home
and harvest crops. He said the harvest season starts in about three
weeks, after which it may be too late to save the crops.
	   In Brussels on Wednesday, NATO allies were fine-tuning options
for military action aimed at getting Serb forces to halt their
offensive against secessionists in the southern Serbian province,
populated mostly by ethnic Albanians.

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A train making a maneuver in Milan's main
station Wednesday night rammed past a barrier meant to stop it at
the end of the track and smashed into a station smokeshop, slightly
injuring four people, railway police said.
	   The train, which was getting ready to depart for Salerno via
Naples, knocked down the kiosk in the area where passengers mill
around before heading to their trains.
	   Somehow the last car of the train went past the block at the end
of the track where trains finish their journey inside the station.
Police said cause of the accident was under investigation.
	   Reports said passengers had not yet begun boarding the train
when the accident occurred.
	   Two members of the train crew were slightly injured and taken to
a hospital for a checkup. The other two injured people who were
near the train suffered bruises which didn't require
hospitalization, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.

Guinea-Bissau talks delayed by debate over mediators
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The next round of peace talks between
Guinea-Bissau's government and military rebels have been postponed
due to a debate over who should broker them, Portuguese news
reports said Wednesday.
	   No alternative date was given for the talks, originally set for
Aug. 18-19 under the auspices of the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries, or CPLP, the Portuguese news agency
Lusa said.
	   The CPLP has recently come under increasing pressure from the
Economic Community of West African States _ECOWAS_ to give it a
greater role in resolving Guinea-Bissau's two-month-old conflict,
Lusa said.
	   The postponement was announced after a meeting Tuesday between
the two organizations in the Ivory Coast capital of Abidjan, Lusa
said.
	   Up until now the CPLP has dominated mediation efforts in the
former Portuguese colony, brokering a cease-fire agreement between
the government and the rebels on July 26 that was reaffirmed in a
second round of talks last Saturday.
	   After the Abidjan meeting, Cape Verde Foreign Minister Jose Luis
de Jesus said he was happy to include ECOWAS into his CPLP
mediation team for the third round of talks, Lusa said.
	   But De Jesus also recognized that the two organizations had ``a
different vision of the crisis in Guinea-Bissau,'' Lusa quoted him
as saying.
	   The possible presence of ECOWAS members from Senegal and the
Republic of Guinea in the new mediating team could be taken as
favorable to Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira.
	   Shortly after the fighting started, Vieira began receiving
military help from these two neighboring countries.
	   The conflict erupted when Brig. Ansumane Mane led a rebellion
against Vieira, accusing him of rampant corruption. Mane had just
been dismissed as military chief for allegedly running arms to
Senegal's Casamance separatists.
	   The CPLP is made up of Portugal, Brazil, Mozambique, Angola,
Cape Verde, Guinea Bissau, Sao Tome and Principe. ECOWAS has 16
members in the region.

Manchester United coasts to 2-0 win over Lodz
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Manchester, England (AP) _ Manchester United scored a
comfortable 2-0 win over Polish team LKS Lodz in the first leg of
Champions Cup second round qualifying at Old Trafford on Wednesday.
	   United opened the scoring in the 15th minute through a brilliant
solo effort in front of goal by Welsh star Ryan Giggs.
	   Manchester United took a 1-0 lead into halftime and continued to
dominate the attack for the remainder of the match until striker
Andy Cole headed-in the winner in the 80th minute.
	   Cole, who scored 25 goals for Manchester United last season,
brought the 50,000-strong crowd to its feet when he converted the
chance after the home side squandered several promising
opportunities earlier in the half.

U.N. conference urges greater emphasis by gov'ts on youth issues
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A U.N.-sponsored international
conference on youth policy ended Wednesday with approval of a
declaration urging governments to place youth issues at the center
of education, employment and health policies.
	   The declaration, approved unanimously at the end of a five-day
meeting, had met with some opposition from Vatican representatives
who complained it did not pay enough attention to parental
responsibilities, children and marriage, the Portuguese news agency
Lusa reported.
	   Iran's delegation was also hesitant because the document did not
mention the need to respect cultural and religious differences,
Lusa said.
	   Some 150 senior government officials attended the conference
including U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna
Shalala.
	   The declaration was to be presented to the United Nations
General Assembly before the end of the year. Delegates also agreed
to propose Aug. 12 as International Youth Day.
	   The conference was billed as a follow-up to the World Program of
Action for Youth, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1995.
	   The U.N. had complained that governments lacked the political
will to implement the Program, which identified priority issues for
youth policy from drug abuse to leisure-time activities.
	   When he inaugurated the conference Friday, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said young people were facing ever greater problems of
social exclusion, ethnic prejudice and unemployment.
	   According to the United Nations, one fifth of the global
population _ about 1.3 billion people - are defined as ``young''
people. For the U.N. that means aged between 15 and 24.

`Full monty' and `LOL': New directory words for the millennium
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REMOVES reference to ``pepper'' graf 9; ADDS new graf 10
giving description of ``full monty'' and ``road rage'': embargoed
until 2301 GMT Wednesday, time set by source
 &UR; By MARA BELLABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``Full monty'' and ``road rage'' made it. So did
``reality check'' and ``LOL'', the e-mail abbreviation for laughing
out loud.
	   It's OK to say ``snuck'' instead of ``sneaked.'' And a ``barn
burner'' is a very exciting event.
	   Language purists may groan, but researchers at Oxford University
Press _ creators of the authoritative multi-volume Oxford English
Dictionary _ insist it's time to formally welcome new phrases and
words into the English language.
	   The New Oxford Dictionary of English, published Thursday, does
just that, adding 2,000 words that have entered the language since
the 1970s.
	   The 350,000-word dictionary is the first written from scratch by
Oxford lexicographers in 70 years.
	   A team of 30 editors and 60 consultants from throughout the word
spent six years and 3 million pounds (dlrs 5 million) compiling the
book. They looked at every word, and fed 20 years worth of written
material into a computer system for analysis. That material could
be scanned in seconds to list a word's different meanings.
	   ``What this shows is how the words are really used _ not just
their formal meanings,'' Oxford press spokeswoman Helen McManners
said Wednesday.
	   The results are both new words and new twists on old words,
springing from pop culture, sports, politics, food and computing.
	   The North American stew and dumplings meal, a ``pot pie'', makes
an entrance. A ``Blairite'' is a follower of British Prime Minister
Tony Blair. Even the much-feared ``millennium bug'' computer
problem is included.
	   To want the ``full monty,'' the title of a recent British comedy
film, means to want the full amount, while ``road rage'' is a
violent anger caused by the stress and frustration of driving in
heavy traffic.

Champions Cup: Celtic wins 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Celtic players put a pre-match pay
dispute behind them as they beat Croatia Zagreb 1-0 in the first
leg of Champions Cup second round qualifying at Parkhead on
Wednesday.
	   The Scottish league titlist defended gamely until substitute
Darren Jackson scored the match winner in the 51st minute.
	   The Croats played an expansive style and created scoring
opportunities, hitting the upright and narrowly missing goal on
several occasions, but could not beat Celtics defense.
	   Three Celtics players had boycotted an official team engagement
Tuesday to protest win bonus payments offered by the club and were
in doubt for the Champions Cup game.
	   But the issue was resolved when players voted to donate the
disputed money to a local hospital.

Brickhouse eulogized as `voice of Chicago'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Many who gathered Wednesday to eulogize Jack
Brickhouse were still children when he started his Hall of Fame
broadcast career. For them, his voice meant summer, baseball and
youth.
	   Those who spoke at St. James Episcopal Church on Chicago's North
Side remembered the former Cubs announcer with stories, humor and
reverence. A picture of Brickhouse smiled over the gathering of
hundreds. The words he made a trademark _ ``Hey! Hey!'' _ were
spelled out nearby in a red and white bouquet.
	   ``Jack Brickhouse was part of Chicago's family,'' Mayor Richard
M. Daley said of the man who was the play-by-play announcer for
Cubs games for four decades starting in 1941. ``For millions of
Chicagoans, he was the voice of Chicago in our youth. ... He will
keep us forever young.''
	   Brickhouse died of cardiac arrest last Thursday at age 82. In
March, doctors removed a tumor from Brickhouse and found no other
cancer. On June 30, he returned to the Cubs' broadcast booth to
shout ``Hey! Hey!'' one last time.
	   Pete Vonachen, owner of the Peoria Chiefs in the Class A Midwest
League, reminisced about Brickhouse calling basketball games at
Bradley University and held his friend up as ``an icon, the crown
jewel of our community that shined forever.''
	   In addition to broadcasting for the Cubs, Brickhouse was the
play-by-play announcer for the Chicago White Sox from 1940-67 and
for the Chicago Bears for 24 years alongside Irv Kupcinet.
	   He also broadcast the early days of the Chicago Bulls, announced
New York Giants baseball games in 1946, Chicago Cardinals football
games in 1947, and even broadcast wrestling for nine years.
	   The Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York inducted
Brickhouse into the media wing in 1983. Four years earlier, on Aug.
5, 1979, he broadcast his 5,000th baseball game.
	   The pallbearers included former White Sox pitcher Billy Pierce
and former Cubs Billy Williams and Ron Santo. Former DePaul
basketball coach Ray Meyer was an honorary pallbearer.
	   Brickhouse was the second renowned Cubs sports broadcaster to
die this year. Harry Caray, his friend and successor in the Cubs
broadcasting booth, died Feb. 18 at age 83.

	   A Coruna, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Lazio defeated Real Madrid 6-5 in
a penalty shoot-out Wednesday to wrap up a summer tournament game
that saw Chilean World Cup star Marcelo Salas score in his debut
game for the Italian club.
	   The game went to penalties after the two sides were tied 2-2
after 90 minutes of play.
	   Salas, whose transfer from Argentina's River Plate was sealed
this week, scored on a pass in the 41st minute by fellow new
signing Ivan de La Pena, formerly of Spain's FC Barcelona.
	   Madrid, which finished the game with nine players after two
expulsions, took the lead with a goal by Spanish international
Fernando Morientes in the 15th minute. Seconds later Real's
defender Roberto Rojas was sent off for a foul on De La Pena.
	   Pavel Nedved drew Lazio level in the 35th minute while Salas put
the side ahead six minutes later.
	   Madrid was left with nine men seconds before the break when
Jaime Sanchez was expelled for a sliding back tackle on Salas.
	   But in the 49th, Brazilian Savio made it 2-2 in a goalmouth
scramble.
	   The game was part of the annual Teresa Herrera tournament staged
in this northwestern city. On Thursday, Spanish sides Deportivo de
La Coruna and Arrigo Sacchi's Atletico de Madrid face each other
with the winner playing Lazio on Friday in the tournament final.

	   A Coruna, Spain (AP) _ Italy's Lazio defeated Real Madrid 6-5 in
a penalty shoot-out Wednesday to wrap up a summer tournament game
that saw Chilean World Cup star Marcelo Salas score in his debut
game for the Italian club.
	   The game went to penalties after the two sides were tied 2-2
after 90 minutes of play.

Baggio stars in Ronaldo's absence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Italian international Roberto Baggio made a
triumphant debut with Inter Milan Wednesday as he scored one goal
and set up three others in a 4-0 rout of Latvia's Skonto Riga.
	   The 31-year-old forward proved an invaluable leader in the
absence of Inter's Brazilian star Ronaldo in the first leg of the
Champions Cup second round qualifying series.
	   Baggio set up first half goals by Ivan Zamorano, Diego Simeone
and Nicola Ventola and notched one for himself with a diagonal shot
in the 60th minute.
	   Zamorano, the Chilean striker, headed in the opening goal in the
fourth minute on a precise long distance pass from Baggio.
Argentine midfielder Simeone scored the second goal six minutes
later, again with a header off a cross from Baggio.
	   Baggio's deft corner kick found Ventola two meters from goal and
the former Bari forward headed in Inter's third goal before Baggio
scored his own.
	   Ronaldo is expected to make his return for Inter in the return
leg against Skonto on Aug. 26.
	   Bayern Munich scored three goals in six minutes in the second
half to beat Yugoslavia's league champion Obilic 4-0 in the
Champions Cup qualifier in Munuch.
	   Stefan Effenberg opened the flurry of goals in the 59th minute,
Brazilian striker Giovane Elber added the second in the 63rd and
two minutes later, Alexander Zickler made it 3-0.
	   Bayern's fourth goal came from Thorsten Fink in the 77th.
	   Obilic goalkeeper Nenad Lukic did well to save shots by
37-year-old veteran Lothar Matthaeus, Bayern's new Bosnian forward
Hasan Salihamidzic and Elber.
	   But the Belgrade team's defense collapsed after 59 minutes, when
Effenberg somehow managed to push the ball across the line from a
scramble in front of the Obilic goal. On the way into the net, the
ball bounced off Lukic's knee and hit another Belgrade defender
before rolling into the net.
	   Obilic was stunned by the goal and Elber headed in the second
four minutes later.
	   In the 65th, Zickler, a substitute who helped revive Bayern's
game along with bench colleague Carsten Jancker, scored on a
powerful header off an Effenberg cross.
	   Fink got the fourth with a strong right-foot drive into the low
far corner.
	   Obilic, which had two chances in the entire match, looks
unlikely to overcome the deficit in the second leg in Belgrade.
	   Manchester United scored a comfortable 2-0 win over Polish team
LKS Lodz at Old Trafford.
	   United opened the scoring in the 15th minute through a brilliant
solo effort in front of goal by Welsh star Ryan Giggs.
	   Manchester United took a 1-0 lead into halftime and continued to
dominate the attack for the remainder of the match until striker
Andy Cole headed-in the winner in the 80th minute.
	   Cole, who scored 25 goals for Manchester United last season,
brought the 50,000-strong crowd to its feet when he converted the
chance after the home side had squandered several promising
opportunities earlier in the half.
	   Sparta Prague scored in the first five minutes and then held out
Dynamo Kiev to record a shock 1-0 win at Kiev.
	   Dynamo Kiev, Champions Cup quarterfinalists last season, were
stunned into attack after Miroslav Baranek fired in an unexpected
goal for the Czech team.
	   Dynamo dominated for the remainder of the game but despite a
high percentage of the ball and the support of 15,000 Ukraine fans,
slumped to a home defeat.
	   The match was reduced to 10-a-side when Dynamo's Oleskandr
Khatshevick and Sparta's Vlastimil Svoboda were given red cards.
	   Turkish league champions Galatasary converted its home ground
advantage into points with a 2-1 win over Swiss team Grasshoppers
at Istanbul.
	   Galatasary opened the scoring in the 59th minute with a
successful penalty kick and then doubled the lead eight minutes
later when striker Hakan Sukur scored with a spectacular scissor
kick off a rebound.
	   Grasshoppers narrowed the gap with a penalty in the 85th minute
but ran out of time.
	   Danish team Brondby snatched a 2-0 upset victory over Kosice of
Slovakia in Bratislava.
	   The Danes took the lead in the 55th minute through Kim Daudaard
after moving the ball smartly through the midfield.
	   Jesper Thygesen notched the insurance goal in the last minute by
blasting in a shot from 14 meters.
	   Spartak Moscow scored the biggest win in the first leg of the
second round qualifying games, travelling to Sofia and thrashing
Bulgarian team Liteks Lovech 5-0.
	   The Russians blasted into action after an uneventful first half,
scoring all their goals in the last 35 minutes to take an almost
unbeatable lead into the return leg in Moscow.
	   In Scotland, Celtic players put a pre-match pay dispute behind
them as they beat Croatia Zagreb 1-0.
	   The Scottish league titlist defended gamely until substitute
Darren Jackson scored the match winner in the 51st minute.
	   The Croats played an expansive style and created scoring
opportunities, hitting the upright and narrowly missing goal on
several occasions, but could not beat Celtics defense.

Blast rocks Kenyans' image of Americans

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ For stunned Kenyans looking for someone to
come to the rescue, it was the Israelis rather than the Americans
who impressed them the most in the five days since the worst attack
ever on a U.S. diplomatic mission.
	   A rapid, adroit Israeli army rescue unit arrived less than 24
hours after a powerful bomb wrecked the U.S. Embassy and an
adjacent building last Friday. They began painstakingly working
their way through the rubble in a desperate search for survivors.
	   However, the first Americans Kenyans saw on the scene were armed
U.S. Marines who took up positions at the battered mission and
strung barbed wire around the site, sometimes blocking the way to
would-be rescuers.
	   ``It seems the Marines were more concerned with the security,
safety and secrecy of their premises than with the fate of many
victims buried in the rubble,'' said lawyer Karieko Tobiko, whose
office is a few blocks from the bomb site in downtown Nairobi.
	   The Israelis and Americans faced different pressures and
challenges. The Israelis were on a goodwill mission, focusing on
saving people and, perhaps, scoring some public relations points
for their often-criticized nation. After the rescue is over, they
can go home.
	   The Americans, however, had more to worry about as the victims,
caretakers of the injured and dead, guards of the crime site and
the investigators of the attacks. Their job has just begun and
could last for years.
	   Two days after the blast, a 64-member disaster assistance
response team from Fairfax, Virginia, arrived but the Israelis were
already on center stage, trying to reach dozens trapped in the
rubble of the four-story Ufundi Cooperative House.
	   Philip Katitu, a 24-year-old mortuary employee, was surprised
that the Israelis responded so quickly to someone else's emergency.
	   ``I would not expect Israel to respond faster than them (the
Americans),'' he said.
	   The Israeli unit has a reputation for being savvy about
attracting media attention for their work around the world. The
team traveled to Kenya with army photographers and TV cameramen who
shared their images with local and international media. Their
spokesmen also talked freely and frequently with the hundreds
journalists.
	   One of the Fairfax members said his team worked out of sight of
the general public, who only saw the Israelis and a group of half a
dozen French.
	   ``It certainly gave the impression the Americans didn't care for
the Kenyans' loss of life, and that is absolutely, without a doubt,
not the truth,'' team member Michael Reilley said.
	   No U.S. spokesman took the time to explain to the Kenyans that
the Marines were ordered to guard a crime site, not look for
survivors. No American has yet briefed the press about the
investigation into the attack or the criteria for evacuating the
injured on U.S. military planes for treatment elsewhere.
	   U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell went on television Wednesday
night and tried to explain to the Kenyan public why the American
response seemed slow and confused.
	   ``Our house was on fire,'' she said.
	   She acknowledged that most of the dead and injured were Kenyans,
a trauma for this East African nation.
	   ``This is a significant psychological event for this country,''
she said.
	   Bushnell also addressed complaints about the secrecy surrounding
the investigation, saying it was standard practice to refrain from
commenting on an ongoing inquiry.
	   ``This, I know, is going to be frustrating to people because
everybody wants information,'' she said.

Edmundo: Nike forced ailing Ronaldo to play in World Cup final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS new 13th graf with additional comment from Nike
spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Voicing what many Brazilians already
believe, midfielder Edmundo says it was a contract between the
Brazilian confederation and Nike that resulted in Ronaldo playing
in the World Cup final despite illness.
	   ``The Nike business is true,'' Edmundo said in a taped interview
published by Brazilian newspapers on Wednesday. ``There's a
contract that (says) Ronaldo must play every game for the full 90
minutes.''
	   Speculation about Ronaldo's appearance and performance has raged
since the final whistle on July 12 in Saint-Denis, France, where
the French ran over Brazil 3-0 to win the World Cup title.
	   The mystery started when Edmundo appeared in the starting lineup
instead of Ronaldo, who was listed among the subsitutes, issued
more than an hour before kickoff. Then, 15 minutes later, just as
inexplicably, a new starting lineup was issued with Ronaldo instead
of Edmundo.
	   An uninspired performance led to questions and revelations in
post-game interviews that Ronaldo had vomited earlier in the day
but was cleared by doctors to play.
	   Coach Mario Zagallo admitted ``Ronaldo shouldn't have played''
but then erupted into a tirade when someone questioned why he
re-inserted the 22-year-old striker into the starting 11.
	   At the time, Zagallo said he decided to start Ronaldo to restore
the confidence of the squad.
	   Ronaldo later said he had gone into convulsions before the game,
and rumors flew that he played under orders from above.
	   U.S. sportswear maker Nike, which paid more than dlrs 200
million to the CBF in 1996 as part of a 10-year sponsorship deal,
became an obvious target of the speculation.
	   During the week preceeding the start of the World Cup, some
players groused at having to appear at a Nike promotional event in
Paris, saying they were ordered by Nike to break off practice to
attend.
	   But a Nike official said the event was scheduled months before
the team's arrival and that it did not order training to be cut
short.
	   Nike again was forced to deny the new rumors, with an official
quoted in Wednesday's reports as saying it would be ``madness'' to
interfere in such a situation.
	   ``As far as Ronaldo and the rumor that we influenced him to play
despite being sick, that is absoluely false,'' said Dave Mingey, a
Nike spokesman. ``Without question, Zagallo and Ronaldo made that
decision alone. Nobody at Nike had any part of that decision.''
	   Of the 22 players on Brazil's World Cup roster, 11 were under
personal contracts to Nike. Chief among them was Ronaldo, who has a
lifetime contract with the company.
	   Edmundo said details of Nike's contract were worked out
personally by confederation President Ricardo Teixeira.
	   ``Nike is strong,'' Edmundo was quoted as saying. ``It
negotiated directly with the president. That means, the president
took a percentage.''
	   Teixeira declined to comment on the accusation. The Associated
Press tried to phone Ronaldo and Edmundo but was told neither was
available for comment.

Champions League: Benfica trounces Beitar 6-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's Benfica trounced Beitar
Jerusalem 6-0 in the Champions League second round qualifying first
leg Wednesday.
	   The Portuguese party included two goals from Welshman Mark
Pembridge, one from Englishman Brian Deane, two penalties
successfully converted by homeboys and an own goal scored by a
Beitar defender.
	   Pembridge slid the first goal home in the 24th minute off a
well-placed cross from Jose Carlos Sousa.
	   And it was Sousa's cross again, aided by some sloppy defending,
that gave Englishman Brian Deane the space to put Benfica 2-0 up.
	   After the break Beitar's defense fell apart and the home side
went 3-0 up with a successfully converted penalty by Jose Antonio
Calado in the 63rd.
	   Beitar's Amir Shela hammered another nail into his team's coffin
with an own goal in the 79th, Pembridge scored his second in the
81st and Benfica was five goals ahead.
	   A second penalty taken by Nuno Gomes sealed the final 6-0
scoreline in the 85th.

Detentions announced in embassy bombings; search for survivors end

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The blackened, shredded wreckage of a
vehicle that might have carried a bomb was pried off the U.S.
Embassy wall on Wednesday, while the last hope for survivors faded
with the body of a Kenyan woman named Rose being pulled from the
rubble.
	   And in Washington, a U.S. law enforcement official said two men
detained in Kenya ``are considered suspects'' in the bombing there.
U.S. President Bill Clinton called for a quick report on security
shortages at American embassies worldwide.
	   The two were described as natives of a country other than Kenya,
but their nationalities could not be determined immediately, the
official said on condition on anonymity.
	   The Kenyan government also announced it has detained several
people as part of its investigation into Friday's bombing, the
worst attack ever on a U.S. mission.
	   With American, French, Kenyan, and Israeli flags flying
half-staff at the bombing site, those left behind held a brief
ceremony. When it ended, U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell plucked
a red rose from the ground and made her way across the rubble to
the barbed wire now strung around the scorched and battered
embassy. Her shoulders shuddered as she wept.
	   ``When you get to the end and you don't have any more survivors,
it is quite devastating,'' said Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow.
	   The U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, were
hit by nearly simultaneous blasts that killed 247 people in Nairobi
_ including 12 Americans _ and 10 people in Tanzania. More than
5,500 others were injured.
	   While the rescue operation officially ended, the search for
clues leading to the killers was in full force Wednesday. Bushnell
said the embassy had been turned over to FBI investigators as a
crime scene.
	   At midday, they removed what could be a vital piece of evidence:
a vehicle plastered against the embassy wall by the force of the
blast. There is speculation that it might have carried the
explosives.
	   A bulldozer pulled it off the wall, then hauled it across the
street to a parking lot the FBI has turned into a crime lab for
bomb-blasted wrecks. A U.S. official, speaking in Washington on
condition of anonymity, said investigators believe the vehicle had
carried the bomb to the site.
	   Capt. Rhyl Jones, a British army demolition expert in Kenya who
has been helping the Americans, said, however, that it was too
early to know whether the bomb had been inside the vehicle.
	   FBI agents scurried behind the bulldozer Wednesday scooping up
the bits of debris-turned-evidence that dribbled from the shredded
wreckage.
	   American investigators here refuse to discuss their work. U.S.
officials say 175 FBI agents as well as other investigators are in
Kenya and in Tanzania.
	   In Nairobi, the five-day search for survivors came to an
emotional end after the last body _ that of Rose Wanjiku _ was
pulled at around 3 a.m. from what little remained of the Ufundi
Cooperative House next door to the embassy.
	   Rose was last heard from on Monday and the thought that she
might be saved spurred on the crack Israeli team leading the
search. But no one was brought out alive after Saturday.
	   ``Everybody was Rose, everybody they could have pulled out
alive,'' said Sparrow, the Red Cross spokesman.
	   Flags flew at half-staff on the ruins of the Ufundi at the
ceremony Wednesday to honor the dead, the injured and those who
saved them.
	   ``He who saves one soul, saves the world,'' said the commander
of the Israeli team, Col. Shalom Ben-Ari, quoting an old Jewish
saying.
	   The Ufundi collapsed when the bomb went off, trapping scores of
people inside, including students at a secretarial school.
	   ``They were innocents,'' said a weary ambulance driver,
Elizabeth Mwangi. ``You'd find their bodies still sitting at their
desks. Or piled up. It really gets to you.''
	   On her own solemn mission, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
arrived Wednesday night at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, to comfort
some of those injured in Kenya and accompany the bodies of 10
Americans back home. One of the 12 American bodies was flown back
earlier at the family's request, and the 12th was to be buried in
Kenya.
	   ``This is a very hard trip,'' she said. ``I am bringing home
very brave people and they deserve the support of the American
people.''
	   Meanwhile, there were few details on the detentions in Nairobi.
	   ``A number of persons have been detained in relation to this
incident and are providing useful leads into the circumstances
surrounding the blast,'' said a statement from the office of
President Daniel arap Moi.
	   There have been several unverified claims of responsibility for
the attacks, including one from a previously unknown Islamic group.
So far, none of the governments involved in the investigation has
said that a link has been established to any group. There also have
been threats against U.S. targets since the bombings.
	   At least four diplomatic missions _ in Malaysia, Yemen, Uganda
and Sudan _ were temporarily closed and security was tightened at
many others in Africa and the Middle East.
	   The United States government is offering a dlrs 2 million reward
for information leading to the capture of the embassy bombers.
	   On Friday, the U.S. Embassy planned a memorial service for its
34 dead Kenyan employees. Bushnell said three Kenyan employees of
the embassy were still missing. Two other Kenyans are also missing.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with men's 400m &QL;

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Reigning world champion Marion Jones
won the women's 100m meters Wednesday, keeping her season's record
intact, while Olympic champion Donovan Bailey may have brought his
to an abrupt end.
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season _ going
under 11 seconds 12 times in the process _ continued her dominance
of the women's field. Leaving the rest of the competitors in her
dust, Jones posted the sixth fastest time of the year, crossing in
10.77.
	   Bailey, meanwhile, left the future of his season in question
after injuring his thigh in the men's 100 meters.
	   The world record holder strained his hamstring about 60 meters
into the race, leaping into the air in agony. The Canadian lay on
the ground in evident pain for several minutes before being helped
off the field.
	   The 30-year-old sprinter was taken to hospital and went
``straight into therapy,'' said race organizers.
	   The race was eventually won by Nigeria's Seun Ogunkoya, with a
personal best of 9.96.
	   Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, who has run more sub-10-seconds
100m races than any other sprinter in history, was in the lane next
to Bailey, and finished third in 10.04.
	   Jones, who has run the nine fastest times in the 100m so far
this year, remains unbeaten in the event since September 1997.
	   While the time was enough to keep Jones in the race for the dlrs
1 million Golden League jackpot, it was insufficient to improve on
her personal best of 10.71, and no where near Florence
Griffith-Joyner's world record of 10.49.
	   Her compatriot Chryste Gaines, trailing by a substantial .27
seconds, finished second, followed by Zhanna Pintusevich of the
Ukraine was third in 11.07.
	   Jones has won 27 individual contests this year, posting one win
in 60, 14 in 100m, five at 200m, one at 400 and six in long jump.
	   The 22-year-old American also competed in the long jump later
Wednesday evening.
	   Zurich's fast track and dlrs 50,000 bonuses failed to produce
any of the world records it was expected to.
	   The Weltklasse, with a budget of 5.5 million Swiss francs (dlrs
3.68 million), traditionally attracts the top-flight competitors
from every discipline.
	   Last year the event saw three world records fall.
	   Though it was widely expected that double Olympic champion
Michael Johnson would finally break the 400m world record _ the
longest standing track record set by Butch Reynolds on the same
track a decade ago _ the American could only improve on his
season's best.
	   Crossing in 43.69, Johnson shaved off .07 off his best time this
year.
	   While the 30-year-old has claimed the 200m and 400m titles at
the 1995 world championships in Sweden, and doubled at the Olympics
in Atlanta _ shattering the 200m record in the process _ the 400m
record remains the one glaring omission on Johnson's brilliant
resume.
	   Ranked among the greatest track athletes of all time, Johnson,
has lost just two 400m races in the last decade.
	   Rounding into form after a slow start to the season caused by
nagging injuries, Johnson's 43.96 in Monaco last Saturday triggered
speculation that the American was poised to crack Reynold's record.
	   Alvin Harrison finished second behind his countryman in 44.19,
followed by another American Tyree Washington, third in 44.42.
	   In the men's 1,500m, Hachim El-Guerrouj posted the
second-fastest time ever to win the event in 3:26.45, narrowly
failing to break his own world record.
	   The Moroccan, with the aid of three hares enlisted to help him,
was expected to break his own record of 3:26.00 set in Rome last
month.
	   Kenya's Bernard Barmasai led a Kenyan sweep of the
	   3,000m steeplechase, winning in 8:01.98. Patrick Sang was second
in 8:08.03, followed by Wilson Boit Kipketer in 8:08.62.
	   In the men's 110m hurdles, Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the
United States recorded the best time of the season, clocking 12.98.
	   Johnson, the reigning world champion, edged compatriot Mark
Crear, .02 back. Reggie Torian complete the American sweep, placing
third in 13.11.
	   Maria Mutola of Mozambique also ran a season best in the women's
800 meters, crossing in 1:56.11. American Jearl Miles-Clark was
second, setting a new North American record of 1:56.43.
Miles-Clark, who held the previous record, improved her time by
massive .67.
	   Austria's Stephanie Graf was third in 1:57.97.
	   Japheth Kimutai of Kenya won the 800m, crossing in 1:42.87,
followed by Denmark's Wilson Kipketer, second in 1:43.18 and Kenyan
Patrick Ndururi, third in 1:43.21.

Embassy bombing focuses attention on mysterious arrests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Embassy Bombing
 &UR; By ARLINDA CAUSHOLLI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The bombings of two U.S. Embassies in
Africa have focused attention on the mysterious arrests of four
Egyptians reportedly spirited out of Albania by American agents.
	   One day before the blasts at U.S. Embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, the Arabic language newspaper al-Hayat published a letter
from the ``International Islamic Front for Jihad'' vowing revenge
against the United States for the arrests of several of its members
in Albania.
	   There is no known evidence indicating Islamic groups were
involved in the two bombings, which have drawn mixed reactions in
the Islamic world.
	   The letter was apparently referring to four Egyptians arrested
quietly in Tirana in June and July. Albanian sources, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said they were wanted on terrorist charges
in Egypt, and U.S. agents took them out of the country.
	   Egypt has made no public comment on the case nor confirmed that
the four are in its custody.
	   Albanian sources said the four were sought in the October 1990
assassination of Rifaat el-Mahgoub, the speaker of the Egyptian
parliament, and an abortive attempt several years later to blow up
the Khan Khalili public market in Cairo.
	   Three of the four had been working for the Islamic Revival
Foundation, a private charity which helps poor Muslims in Albania.
The Albanian sources said they suspect some foreign charity groups
may be a cover for illegal activities, including weapons and drug
smuggling.
	   Al-Hayat said the fourth person arrested was a man identified as
a member of the Jihad group founded last year by Ayman al-Zawahry,
an Egyptian believed to be living in Afghanistan.
	   Hezbollah and Hamas leaders have had different reactions to the
embassy bombings, which left 257 people dead.
	   A senior Shiite Muslim cleric widely thought to be the spiritual
guide of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah guerrilla group denounced the
bombings.
	   ``We reject these methods as a way of expressing opposition to
American policies,'' Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah
said Wednesday in Beirut, Lebanon.
	   ``We are against the killing of innocents... this is a crime,
regardless of the circumstances that led to it,'' Fadlallah was
quoted as saying by the state-run National News Agency.
	   However, the spiritual leader of the radical Islamic group Hamas
said Tuesday that although he does not know who was behind the twin
bombings, whoever was responsible acted in ``self-defense.''
	   ``I consider what happened self-defense by someone who was
seeking revenge for the injustice of American policy and the
destruction it has brought on their country,'' Sheik Ahmed Yassin
told The Associated Press in the Gaza Strip.
	   Yassin explicitly denied any Hamas involvement in the attacks
and said Hamas knew nothing of the bombers' identity.
	   Ely Karmon, an Israeli terrorism expert, told The Associated
Press that ``there are sufficient clues'' to lead to the suspicion
that the attacks could have been carried out by a coalition of
terror organizations, including the Jihad front.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said he doubts that a terrorist attack of such magnitude
could have been carried out without the assistance of a ``state or
an agency of a state.''

	   Her compatriot Chryste Gaines finished second, .27 back,
followed by Ukrainian Zhanna Pintusevich, third in 11.07.
	   It was a busy evening for Jones, who also won the women's long
jump, leaping 7.31 meters.
	   The 22-year-old has won 28 individual contests this year,
posting one win in 60m, 14 in 100m, five in 200m, one in 400m and
seven in long jump.

myself, everything has to come together.''

5,000m.
	   Winning in 12:54.08, the Ethiopian was 14.72 seconds off his own
world record.
	   ``I wanted to run under the world record but it wouldn't work,''
said Gebrselassie, who's already improved the 5,000m and 10,000m
world records this season. ``The last two kilometers were a little
difficult.''
	   In the men's 1,500m, Hicham El-Guerrouj posted the

breaking her own North American record. Running in 1:56.43,
Miles-Clark improved her time by massive .67.
	   Four athletes are still in contention for the dlrs 1 million
jackpot shared by those who remain unbeaten in certain events in
the six Golden League meets and the Grand Prix final in Moscow on
September 5: with Jones are El-Guerrouj, Gebrselassie and 400m
hurdler Bryan Bronson of the United States.

Laver moved out of intensive care unit; condition upgraded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Rod Laver, who had a moderate stroke July 27,
has been moved from the intensive care unit to a private room at
the UCLA Medical Center.
	   In addition, hospital spokeswoman Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster said
Laver's condition was upgraded from serious to fair.
	   Moster said doctors were hoping Laver would be moved to the
rehabilitation unit at the hospital within seven to 10 days.
	   Laver, who was 60 Sunday, suffered the stroke during a taped
television interview. He was moved out of the intensive care unit
July 31, but went back in several hours later when he developed a
fever.
	   Doctors treating Laver say he is not paralyzed, although he
continues having difficulty moving his right arm and right leg.
	   Laver, an Australian who lives in Newport Beach, is the only
player to win two tennis Grand Slams, as an amateur in 1962 and as
a pro in 1969.
	   During his career, he won four Wimbledon singles championships,
three Australian singles titles, two U.S. Open singles
championships and two French singles titles.

Yankee juggernaut rolls on with win over Twins

 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's early games; will be updated &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Yankees set a modern major league
record by taking a lead for the 41st consecutive game, rallying
from a two-run deficit to beat the Minnesota Twins 11-2 Wednesday.
	   David Cone recovered from early wildness to become the first
17-game winner of the season, Scott Brosius tied a career high with
five RBIs and Joe Girardi hit a go-ahead, two-run double in the
fourth inning as the Yankees (87-29) won their seventh straight and
reached .750 for the first time since July 16.
	   New York, which has swept 18 of 43 series this season, has won
10 of 11 games, outscoring opponents 101-27. The Yankees are on
pace to win 122, smashing the record of 116 set by the 1906 Chicago
Cubs.
	   Bernie Williams and Brosius hit seventh-inning homers for the
Yankees, who matched their season high with 18 hits and extended
their streak of games with homers to 14, their longest since a
16-gamer in 1994.
	   Cone (17-4) improved to 11-0 at home, beating the Twins for the
eighth time in 10 career decisions.
	   The Twins have lost 10 of 11.
 &UR; White Sox 2, Athletics 0 &QC; 
	   In Chicago, Scott Eyre didn't allow a hit for five innings in a
spot start and combined with three relievers on a two-hitter.
	   Eyre (2-7) was making his first start since June 17. He walked
one and struck out four before being pulled after 67 pitches. Keith
Foulke pitched two no-hit innings before Jason Giambi led off the
eighth with a single off Bob Howry for Oakland's first hit.
	   Bill Simas gave up a hit in the ninth and walked the tying run
before getting a fly ball and a double play for his 14th save.
	   Eyre started because a recent rainout had forced manager Jerry
Manuel to use Mike Sirotka and Jaime Navarro in a doubleheader
Saturday.
	   Jimmy Haynes (8-5) took the loss.
 &UR; Blue Jays 11, Mariners 5 &QC; 
	   In Toronto, Carlos Delgado's grand slam highlighted Toronto's
seven-run seventh inning.
	   Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez became the fourth youngest
player in major league history to reach 100 career homers in the
loss.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. failed to homer for the 11th straight game,
going 0-for-4 with a strikeout. He hasn't connected in his last 50
at-bats _ his longest drought of the season for the Mariners _ yet
still leads the AL with 41 home runs.
	   Nerio Rodgriuez (2-3) got the win despite giving up a go-ahead
homer to Rodriguez in the seventh.
	   Rodriguez, who turned 23 last month, trails Mel Ott, Tony
Conigliaro and Eddie Matthews for the youngest to 100 homers. Ott
was 22 years, 132 days old when he hit the mark in 1931.
	   Bobby Ayala (1-8) took the loss.
 &UR; Orioles 7, Devil Rays 0 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Scott Erickson pitched a five-hitter
and Eric Davis doubled to extend his club-record hitting streak to
27 games.
	   Mike Bordick had three RBIs and Rafael Palmeiro hit his 36th
homer to help Erickson (12-10) get his second shutout and
AL-leading eighth complete game this season.
	   The hitting streak for Davis, who returned to the lineup after
taking Tuesday night off, currently is the longest in the majors.
Davis went 1-for-4 and is tied with Kansas City's Jose Offerman for
the second longest this season behind Anaheim's Garret Anderson's
28.
	   The victory was the seventh in nine games for Baltimore, which
improved baseball's best record since the All-Star break to 24-7.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Henry Rodriguez homered twice and drove in
five runs, and Steve Trachsel pitched seven strong innings, as the
Chicago Cubs defeated the skidding San Francisco Giants 10-2
Wednesday.
	   Sammy Sosa went homerless for the Cubs, going 1-for-3 with a
single, two walks and two runs scored. Sosa has 46 homers, one
behind Mark McGwire for the major league lead.
	   Rodriguez hit a two-run shot in the fourth and added a three-run
blast, his 30th of the season, into the upper deck in right field
in the seventh. It was the 11th multi-homer game of his career and
third this season.
	   Scott Servais hit a two-run homer, his sixth, and Jeff Blauser
added a solo shot, his third, as the Cubs scored five runs on three
homers in the fourth off Kirk Rueter (12-8).
	   Chicago added five more in the seventh on Rodriguez's second
homer, an RBI single by Lance Johnson and an error.
	   Trachsel (12-6), who has won six of his last seven decisions,
allowed two runs on seven hits. He has allowed two earned runs or
fewer in 12 of his 24 starts this season.
	   With the win, the Cubs temporarily moved into a tie with the New
York Mets in the race for the NL wild-card spot. The Mets were to
play Wednesday night at St. Louis. The Giants, who have lost seven
of nine, fell three games behind the Cubs.

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Beneath four stories of corkscrewed steel
and ragged chunks of concrete, Rose Wanjiku Irungu huddles in a
hollow formed when a slab that could have crushed her instead came
to rest leaning against a large, sturdy safe.
	   A miracle. Providence. Blessed survival amidst unspeakable
carnage and destruction.
	   A terrorist bomb has blown apart her office building in an
attack apparently aimed at the adjacent U.S. Embassy, yet she has
escaped relatively unscathed.
	   But Rose's haven is a trap that, in the end, proves to be her
tomb.
	   And her death, determined only Wednesday when rescuers finally
claw their way to her side, saddens not just her nation, desperate
for a sign of hope after the deadly attack, but also a vast global
community that kept vigil for Rose through news reports of her
calls for help and tapping from the wreckage.
	   ``In a way, she symbolized everyone they were digging for,''
says Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow. ``Everybody was Rose,
everybody they could have pulled out alive.''
	   ___
	   Rose, 36, mother of three and a clerk at the Ufundi Co-operative
House, is at work Friday morning when the car bomb goes off.
Ricocheting shockwaves lift the four-story building off its
foundation and fling it into a heap.
	   Buried near Rose for the first 36 hours of her ordeal is Sammy
Ng'ang'a, a scrap metal dealer who is visiting a business associate
at Ufundi when the blast hits. He first knows she's there early
Saturday when she responds to Israeli rescuers calling for
survivors.
	   From his hospital bed, Ng'ang'a recalls how Rose requests water
and, when he tells her the men she hears are ``trying to save us,''
asks to be taken out first.
	   But the slabs of concrete braced with steel reinforcing bars
that have saved her also prevent rescuers from reaching her. An
Israeli trooper burrows through unstable rubble for hours to reach
Ng'ang'a Saturday night. He can't reach Rose.
	   As Ng'ang'a is pulled out, he calls out a farewell: ``They are
coming for you next.''
	   ___
	   Crews last hear Rose speak at 3 p.m. Sunday.
	   ``Please take me to a hospital,'' she pleads. ``I need to get to
a hospital.''
	   Bob Nasser, head of the Kenyan disaster team at the site, shouts
encouragement. ``I just told her to hold on, we're coming for her
... and she said, `Yes.' But now she's very weak.''
	   The Red Cross's Sparrow reports, ``Her face is burned, but she's
talking. During the past two days, she developed a relationship
with Ng'ang'a. ... They talked and kept each other's spirits up.''
	   Trying to reach Rose and any other survivors, the Israelis swarm
over the ruins with shrieking pneumatic drills, roaring blowtorches
and growling bulldozers. Several times a day, the crew calls for
silence and snakes a powerful microphone into the debris. Early
Monday, the microphone detects a soft chink-chink, concrete tapping
on concrete. Hopes soar it is Rose and she might still be saved.
	   But hours stretch on and nothing more is heard. Rescuers seek to
reassure themselves.
	   ``There's just no sound coming back,'' Sparrow says. ``This
happened before, when Rose went quiet and then spoke again. She may
be asleep. She may be unconscious. So you live in hope.''
	   ___
	   Nairobi's death toll eventually reaches 247. Ten others are dead
in the almost simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania.
	   Dozens of Kenyans are still missing Monday, and no one has
claimed Rose. No one knows who she is, or even her last name.
	   In those desperate hours, Rose's husband, Lawrence Irungu, is
frantically searching hospitals and morgues. He's heard it was his
wife's building blown to pieces and has left their children and his
photography studio in a small town northeast of Nairobi.
	   On Tuesday, he hears a woman named Rose is trapped _ and alive.
	   He races to the site.
	   ``I'm hoping she's still alive,'' Irungu says. ``That's my
prayers. ... I will stay here until I see the end of the
operation.''
	   His snapshot of Rose shows a healthy woman with full
magenta-lipsticked lips drawn back in a Mona Lisa smile. Her
shoulder-length hair, woven in dozens of tiny braids, is neatly
pulled back from a round, shining face.
	   ___
	   At 1:45 Tuesday afternoon, Rose's rescue seems imminent. Two
search dogs veer toward a hole in the heap of rubble, now shrunken
by more than half, and bark excitedly.
	   ``The throats of the Israeli team members went dry from
excitement. Everyone was sure that the dogs had detected a sign of
life,'' reports Israel's Yediot Ahronot newspaper.
	   But the hole is empty, and remaining tangles of concrete and
girders beyond prevent further penetration.
	   ___
	   At 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, the Israelis again call for silence.
	   The microphone goes deep but picks up no sound.
	   Twenty minutes later, a crane lifts the last slab barring access
to Rose.
	   That exposes a mound of small rubble _ jumbled concrete, wire,
cable and glass shards. Shoulder to shoulder, Kenyans and Israelis
use shovels, pickaxes and hands to pluck it off bit by bit,
exposing glimpses of a body.
	   At 3 a.m., they wearily remove the last layers of disaster from
the one victim the world hoped might be saved. Rose's body is
slipped into a white plastic bag and driven to the morgue.
	   Rose died less than 24 hours before rescuers got to her, says
Israeli Col. Udi Ben-Uri, commander of the rescue unit.
	   At 10 a.m., after dogs fail to find any sign of life, Ben-Uri
declares the five-day search for survivors over.
	   ___
	   The few feet that separated Rose and Sammy Ng'ang'a proved to be
the difference between life and death.
	   ``Rose was alive. Rose was responding. Rose was trying to
contact us,'' says Farid Abdulkadir of the Kenya Red Cross. ``Rose.
We had hope she would come out alive. But from that spot it was
only one person who came out alive and that is Ng'ang'a.
	   ``We are sad. That is what kept us going, her sound, her trying
to knock, her trying to communicate.''
	   Adds ambulance driver Elizabeth Mwangi, ``If we could have found
Rose alive, it would have made us feel like we'd done something in
the last few days.''

O'Meara trying to reconnect with Hogan at PGA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ The link to Ben Hogan took root 18
years ago when Mark O'Meara, a fresh-faced former U.S. Amateur
champion, turned pro in Hogan's office and signed on to play his
clubs.
	   The relationship lasted seven years and was invaluable.
	   When O'Meara struggled, as most young players do, he sought out
Hogan for help. His handwritten letters were always returned with a
phone call from Hogan, always an encouraging word.
	   ``There were several occasions where he took me aside, or I went
and watched him hit golf balls, and he'd watch me,'' O'Meara said
Wednesday. ``He is somebody who as a young person I didn't get to
see play, but the mystique and getting to know him over the years
... he was a big asset for me.''
	   The PGA Championship begins Thursday at Sahalee Country Club, a
Chinook Indian phrase for ``High, Heavenly Ground.'' Down every
fairway lined with towering firs and cedars, O'Meara will try to
reach heights where only Hogan has been before.
	   Not since Hogan won the Masters, U.S. Open and British Open in
1953 _ the only majors he played that year _ has anyone managed to
win three major championships in one season.
	   Since then, six players in nine seasons have come to the PGA
Championship with a chance to equal him. The closest anyone came
was Tom Watson in 1977, when he finished four strokes back in a tie
for sixth.
	   ``The odds are a little stacked against me,'' O'Meara said.
	   O'Meara made a 20-foot (6-meter) birdie putt on the 72nd hole to
win the Masters by one stroke over Fred Couples and David Duval. In
the British Open, he closed with a 68 and then beat Brian Watts in
a playoff at Royal Birkdale.
	   The odds of a trifecta may indeed be high. But then, who would
have thought five months ago that the next to chase Hogan's record
would be a 41-year-old career grinder who was 0-for-56 in majors as
a pro.
	   ``If you would have told me at the beginning of the year that I
would have the opportunity to win two of them, I would have jumped
and prayed for the chance,'' O'Meara said.
	   ``That doesn't stop me from going out there and trying to give
it my best,'' he said. ``And that's what I'll try to do. If I have
a chance come Sunday afternoon, hopefully I can dwell on what I've
learned from the Masters and British Open and use that to my
advantage.''
	   O'Meara isn't the only one trying make history at Sahalee.
	   Davis Love III has a chance to become the first repeat winner of
the PGA Championship since it went to stroke play in 1958, and the
first back-to-back winner since Denny Shute in 1937.
	   ``It would be a thrill to have a chance on Sunday,'' Love said.
	   What he and O'Meara have in common is the label they no longer
wear _ the best to never win a major.
	   That now falls to players like Colin Montgomerie and Scott Hoch,
and even to younger guys like Phil Mickelson, Duval and Jim Furyk.
	   Working in their favor is that nine of the past 10 PGA champions
were first-time winners of majors.
	   ``I don't particularly feel any pressure right now,'' Duval
said. ``If I have a couple more close calls, where it doesn't quite
work out my way, then I might start to feel a little more.''
	   Furyk hasn't won since 1996, but he's been in the top 10 in 24
events since then. He was fourth in the Masters and in the British
Open, and has finished in the top 10 in six of the last seven
majors.
	   ``You keep doing that and you're going to win a major,'' said
Payne Stewart, who won his first major in the 1989 PGA
Championship.
	   Love shed the label last year and understands its burden. He
wasn't sure if being ``one of the best to never win a major'' meant
he was a success or a failure. It was a double-edged sword, a
compliment and an insult.
	   ``When I work with a guy like (sports psychologist) Bob Rotella,
you try to be positive, positive, positive. And then the questions
you get are never, never, never,'' he said. ``I enjoyed the
challenge of getting past that
	   ``I think a bigger challenge now is trying to get more.''
	   That's one challenge O'Meara has already conquered.
	   When he won the British Open, he became the oldest player to win
two majors in a year. Three other players in their 40s have won
majors in the 1990s, but none of them won another.
	   O'Meara spent a lifetime reaching the pinnacle and found no
reason to stop with one green jacket.
	   Another major championship this week would put him in the
company of Hogan once again.

King dissolves Parliament for October elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ King Mswati III on Wednesday dissolved
the Swaziland Parliament to prepare for October elections.
	   Dressed in traditional attire, Mswati made the announcement at a
public meeting in Ludzidzini, the South African Press Association
reported.
	   Mswati's father, King Sobhuza II, outlawed all party activity in
1973. The tiny mountain realm of 1 million people has since lived
under a state of emergency that allows the king to rule by decree.
	   Many Swazis like the system, which brought a degree of stability
rare in southern Africa in the 1970s and 1980s. But others are
demanding to join a regional surge of democracy capped by Mandela's
election in 1994.
	   Opposition groups and the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions
have often demonstrated to press their demands for a new
constitution and political parties.
	   In 1996, Mswati appointed a committee to review constitutional
changes, but critics say the process is moving too slowly.

Study: Satellite temperature readings on global warming were wrong
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JANE E. ALLEN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Scientists who argue against global warming
often cite nearly 20 years of satellite readings showing slight
cooling of the atmosphere two miles (3.2 kilometers) up. But a new
study indicates those readings are incorrect.
	   The new findings, however, do nothing to settle the debate over
whether global warming is really occurring.
	   Scientists on both sides agree that Frank Wentz, a physicist and
chief executive of Remote Sensing Systems in Santa Rosa, pinpointed
the problem with the satellite temperature readings. But that's as
far as they agree.
	   They continue to debate how the temperatures should be revised
and what the revisions mean. No one is changing his or her overall
position.
	   Those who reject the notion that manmade warming of the Earth is
occurring say the revised temperatures make an insignificant
change. Those who believe that carbon dioxide and industrial gases
are heating the atmosphere say the revisions now show a slight
warming trend, in line with the warming of the Earth's surface.
	   In the study in Thursday's issue of the journal Nature, Wentz
found that the orbit of satellites that take temperature readings
decreases over time because of atmospheric drag on the spacecraft.
They drop a bit more than half a mile (about a kilometer) every
year, and twice that during some years.
	   As the satellite slows and drops, the onboard instrument
perceives the temperatures below it as cooling, Wentz found.
	   The perceived temperature change ``was just an artifact of the
altitude changing,'' he concluded.
	   When Wentz recalculated the readings from 1979 to 1995, he found
temperatures in the lower atmosphere are more in line with rising
temperatures at Earth's surface and rising temperatures just a few
miles (kilometers) higher in the atmosphere.
	   Before the correction, scientists were confounded because
temperatures in the lower troposphere, the region from the ground
to about two miles (3.2 kilometers) up, seemed to be cooling .09
degrees Fahrenheit (0.05 degrees Celsius) per decade, while the
middle to upper troposphere _ a region centered about four miles
(6.4 kilometers) up _ seemed to be warming .05 degrees Fahrenheit
(0.03 degrees Celsius) every decade.
	   But when Wentz and co-author Matthias Schabel took the falling
satellite effect into account, they found the lower troposphere was
warming 0.13 degrees Fahrenheit (0.07 Celsius) per decade.
	   In an accompanying commentary, Dian J. Gaffen of the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Air Resources
Laboratory in Silver Spring, Maryland, cautioned against ``making
too much of these new indications of warming'' because the
satellite data covers a short period and other factors could be at
work.
	   In the latest issue of the journal Science, James Hansen and
colleagues at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies wrote that
Wentz's work helps reconcile temperature trends that didn't make
sense.
	   With the correction, ``it's very hard for anyone to look at any
data and deny the reality of global warming. In a sense, it was the
last refuge of those who would deny that there's global warming,''
Hansen said.
	   Patrick Michaels, a professor of environmental sciences at the
University of Virginia in Charlottesville and a global warming
skeptic, isn't convinced.
	   Wentz ``came up with no real change that's appreciable'' in the
satellite data, he said, and temperature readings from instruments
on helium balloons also haven't found significant warming.
	   John Christy, a professor of atmospheric science at the
University of Alabama in Huntsville who did the original work with
the satellite data, said that when he corrected his data to account
for Wentz's findings and some other factors, he found only an
insignificant change _ ``no cooling, no warming.''

Jones wins 100m, Bailey injured, Johnson wins but misses record

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Reigning world champion Marion Jones
won the women's 100m at the Weltklasse meet Wednesday, keeping her
season's record intact, while Olympic champion Donovan Bailey may
have brought his to an abrupt end.
	   Jones, who remains unbeaten in the 100m this season _ going
under 11 seconds 12 times in the process _ continued her dominance
of the women's field. Leaving the rest of the competitors in her
dust, Jones posted the sixth fastest time of the year, crossing in
10.77.
	   Bailey, meanwhile, left the future of his season in question
after injuring his left leg in the men's 100m.
	   The world record holder strained his thigh about 60 meters into
the race, leaping into the air in agony. The Canadian lay on the
ground in evident pain for several minutes before being helped off
the field.
	   The 30-year-old sprinter was taken to hospital by ambulance.
	   Meet doctor Roland Biedert, who examined Bailey, said the
sprinter would be out ``from two-to-four weeks.''
	   The race was won by Nigeria's Seun Ogunkoya, with a personal
best of 9.96.
	   Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, who's run more sub-10-seconds 100m
races than any other sprinter in history, was in the lane next to
Bailey, and finished third in 10.04.
	   While Jones' performance was good enough to keep her in the race
for the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot, it was above her
personal best of 10.71, and no where near Florence
Griffith-Joyner's world record of 10.49.
	   But Jones wasn't discouraged.
	   ``I feel like I'm ready to run sub-10.70,'' said Jones, who's
run the nine fastest 100m times this year.
	   Her compatriot Chryste Gaines finished second, .27 back,
followed by Ukrainian Zhanna Pintusevich, third in 11.07.
	   It was a busy evening for Jones, who also won the women's long
jump, leaping 7.31 meters.
	   The 22-year-old has won 28 individual contests this year,
posting one win in 60m, 14 in 100m, five in 200m, one in 400m and
seven in long jump.
	   Zurich's fast track and dlrs 50,000 bonuses failed to produce
any of the world records it was expected to.
	   With a 5.5 million Swiss franc budget (dlrs 3.68 million), the
Weltklasse traditionally attracts the world's elite and leaves any
record vulnerable. Last year the event saw three world records
fall.
	   Though it was anticipated double Olympic champion Michael
Johnson would finally break the 400m world record _ the longest
standing track record, set by Butch Reynolds on the same track a
decade ago _ the American could only improve on his season's best.
	   Crossing in 43.69, Johnson shaved .07 off his season's best, but
was way off his personal best of 43.39 and nowhere near Reynolds'
43.29.
	   ``If I'd gone out today thinking about the world record, I
wouldn't have won the race,'' said Johnson, who said the only
record to count for him was the 200m. ``I can't just program
myself, everything has to come together.''
	   While the 30-year-old claimed the 200m and 400m titles at the
1995 world championships, and doubled at the Olympics in Atlanta _
shattering the 200m record in the process _ the 400m record remains
the one glaring omission on Johnson's brilliant resume.
	   Rounding into form after a slow start to the season caused by
nagging injuries, Johnson's 43.96 in Monaco last Saturday triggered
speculation he was poised to crack Reynold's record.
	   Americans Alvin Harrison and Tyree Washington finished second
and third in 44.19 and 44.42.
	   Haile Gebrselassie also failed to produce a world mark in the
5,000m.
	   Winning in 12:54.08, the Ethiopian was 14.72 seconds off his own
world record.
	   ``I wanted to run under the world record but it wouldn't work,''
said Gebrselassie, who's already improved the 5,000m and 10,000m
world records this season. ``The last two kilometers were a little
difficult.''
	   In the men's 1,500m, Hicham El-Guerrouj posted the
second-fastest time ever to win the event in 3:26.45, but failed to
break his own world record of 3:26.00 set in Rome last month.
	   Olympic champion Allen Johnson of the United States recorded a
season best in the men's 110m hurdles, clocking 12.98.
	   Mozambique's Maria Mutola also ran a season best in the women's
800m, crossing in 1:56.11. American Jearl Miles-Clark was second,
breaking her own North American record. Running in 1:56.43,
Miles-Clark improved her time by massive .67.
	   Four athletes are still in contention for the dlrs 1 million
jackpot shared by those who remain unbeaten in certain events in
the six Golden League meets and the Grand Prix final in Moscow on
September 5: with Jones are El-Guerrouj, Gebrselassie and 400m
hurdler Bryan Bronson of the United States.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _President Bill Clinton authorized emergency
leave for workers at the bomb-ruined U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania ``faced with a personal emergency because of the
bombings.''
	   Clinton said Wednesday the leaves should be granted without loss
of pay or regular vacation time and should apply both to federal
civilian employees and to Kenyan and Tanzanian citizens employed at
the two embassies.
	   The president also authorized the employees of federal
departments and agencies to donate unused annual leave to workers
``who were adversely affected by the bombings and who need
additional time off for recovery.''

Brazil welcomes new national coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazilian soccer players past and
present on Wednesday welcomed the appointment of new national team
coach Wanderlei Luxemburgo.
	   Luxemburgo, 47, who currently coaches Sao Paulo's Corinthians
currently, has the reputation for being a stern disciplinarian.
	   But he promised in his first press conference Tuesday that he
would not leave Brazil's passion for ``art soccer'' by the wayside.
	   Former striker Jairzinho, who won the World Cup with Brazil's
famous 1970 team, called Luxemburgo the ``ideal man for the job''.
	   ``He has modern concepts about the job and will definitely give
a new profile to Brazil's team,'' Jairzinho told Rio daily
newspaper O Dia.
	   Romario, the goal scoring star of Brazil's 1994 World Cup
victory, was equally optimistic about the new coach.
	   ``Wanderlei is great choice for me and for Brazil,'' said the
Flamengo striker who missed this year's Cup because of a leg
injury.
	   Athletico Madrid midfielder Juninho, also excluded from the Cup
because of injury, was also pleased.
	   ``He is a great coach who has already shown his quality,'' he
told the O Globo newspaper, referring to Luxemburgo's success at
club level with Palmeiras and Corinthians who currently leads the
Brazilian national championships.
	   Outgoing coach Mario Zagallo and his assistant Zico made
respectful comments in the Brazilian media when asked about
Luxemburgo.
	   It is not clear if either will play any role in the new coaching
staff.

Sampras on track to reclaim top ranking
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Wednesday's early play &QL; 
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Pete Sampras' plans for his 27th birthday
were as low-key as his 6-4, 6-2 victory on Wednesday over Martin
Damm of the Czech Republic.
	   After Sampras debuted in the second round of the dlrs 2.45
million ATP Championship, he planned some dinner, ``maybe a little
dessert to treat myself,'' then prepare for his next match.
	   ``It was a good start. I felt pretty strong out there,'' Sampras
said.
	   He broke Damm's serve only once in the first set, but that is
usually enough for Sampras. Getting two breaks in the second was
overkill.
	   ``He played well, he was holding his own in the first set,''
Sampras said.
	   Damm said his serve faltered slightly in the second set.
	   ``Against players like Pete, you have to go for it almost 100
percent. If you don't, you don't have a chance,'' Damm said.
	   Successfully defending his title here would assure Sampras of
returning to the No. 1 ranking next week. He could regain it just
by making the finals, if the match contained enough bonus points
for the ATP formula.
	   Certainly the reign of Marcelo Rios of Chile, who assumed the
top ranking on Monday, appeared doomed. He lost his first match in
straight sets Tuesday night.
	   The tournament lost three more seeds Wednesday, leaving just
seven of the original 16.
	   Jerome Golmard of France ousted the French Open champion,
fourth-seeded Carlos Moya of Spain, 6-4, 6-2; Tommy Haas of Germany
beat 12th-seeded Albert Costa of Spain 6-1, 6-3; and Scott Draper
of Australia defeated ninth-seeded Alex Corretja of Spain 6-3, 6-7
(5-7), 7-6 (7-5).
	   Moya said he knew he was in big trouble when he couldn't hold
his serve early in the second set.
	   ``After that, I was a little bit down and I knew I was not going
to win that match,'' Moya said.
	   ``He played better than me. I didn't have a good day, and I just
congratulate him.''
	   In other matches, Todd Martin defeated Thomas Muster of Austria
6-3, 6-4; third-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic beat Marcos
Ondruska of South Africa 6-2, 6-3; Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands
downed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 7-6 (7-5), 6-4; and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia beat Michael Chang 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
	   Also, fifth-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia beat Guillaume
Raoux of France 6-1, 6-3; Thomas Johansson of Sweden defeated Jeff
Tarango 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4); and 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of
Croati beat Mark Philippoussis of Australia, 6-3, 6-2.

Former British spy says he will try to enter Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Former British spy Richard Tomlinson
renewed attempts Wednesday to get into Australia, where he has
admitted trying to sell the story of his career to a publisher.
	   Tomlinson, 35, who worked for Britain's foreign intelligence
agency MI6 and has dual British and New Zealand citizenship, fled
to New Zealand after serving a four month prison sentence for
trying to sell his story.
	   At the request of Britain's Foreign Office, New Zealand courts
last week granted a temporary injunction against Tomlinson as he
arrived in Auckland.
	   Two days later, he was taken off a flight bound for Sydney,
Australia, by New Zealand authorities shortly before takeoff.
	   New Zealand police later went to his Auckland hotel room with a
search warrant and seized a number of items, including papers
relating to his trial in Britain, a mobile phone and a personal
stereo, Tomlinson told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television
Wednesday.
	   He said Wednesday he had lodged a visa application and would
again try to enter Australia.
	   ``I'm surprised to read reports in the Australian press that
Australian immigration had received a request two weeks ago not to
give me a visa,'' he told the ABC.
	   ``But I went to the Australian High Commission in Auckland today
and the consul there has assured me categorically there has been no
prior decision taken, that my case will be judged entirely on its
merits, there will be no kowtowing to London.''
	   Tomlinson said he wanted to come to Australia to visit his
brother, but that he is still considering publishing a book.
	   He said he was attracted to Australia because the Australian
courts in the 1980s allowed former British spy Peter Wright to
publish his book Spycatcher, despite objections from Britain.
	   ``The problem I face is that if I write a book, I won't be able

moral qualms against my own future.
	   ``I've already been to jail once I don't want to go back
again.''
	   A British Foreign Office spokesman said last week Tomlinson
could ``cause substantial harm to the operations of the Secret
Intelligence Service and in some cases put life and livelihoods at
risk.''

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The blackened, shredded wreckage of a
vehicle that might have carried a bomb was pried off the U.S.
Embassy wall on Wednesday, while the last hope for survivors faded
with the body of a Kenyan woman named Rose being pulled from the
rubble. And in Washington, a U.S. law enforcement official said two
men detained in Kenya ``are considered suspects'' in the bombing
there. U.S. President Bill Clinton called for a quick report on
security shortages at American embassies worldwide. The two were
described as natives of a country other than Kenya, but their
nationalities could not be determined immediately, the official
said on condition on anonymity. (EMBASSY-BOMBINGS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jewish groups, Swiss banks and lawyers for
Holocaust survivors reached a dlrs 1.2 billion settlement Wednesday
over claims to assets lost during World War II. The money will paid
out over four years for the life of all claims including dormant
account claims against two commercial banks _ UBS AG and the Credit
Suisse _ plus the Swiss National Bank, other Swiss banks, the Swiss
government and Swiss industry, said Marc Cohen, a lawyer for the
banks. Tens of thousands of Holocaust victims deposited money in
Swiss banks as the Nazis gained power in Europe, expecting to
retrieve it later. Jewish leaders on June 19 rejected an offer by
the Swiss banks to pay dlrs 600 million to settle the claims.
Jewish leaders claimed that was far less than the more than dlrs 1
billion the banks should be paying. (US-SWISS BANKS-NAZIS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by mortars and
machine guns captured a major ethnic Albanian stronghold in Kosovo
on Wednesday and attacked another, trapping thousands of civilians
and rebels. The state Tanjug news agency reported that the Serb
police Wednesday entered Glodjane, ``one of the strongest bases for
the Albanian terrorists.'' It said that the village near the
Albanian border was ``under full police control'' as of early
afternoon Wednesday. Tanjug said that in the fierce two-day
fighting for Glodjane, five Serb policemen and two Yugoslav army
soldiers were killed. The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic
Albanian control, reported that seven KLA fighters were killed and
49 wounded. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A Zambian envoy began an investigation
Wednesday into charges that Rwanda and Uganda are waging a war
against Congo as part of a rebellion to topple President Laurent
Kabila. Congo stepped up its rhetoric against its eastern and
northeastern neighbors, vowing to ``massacre'' rebels and their
Rwandan allies who were reportedly being airlifted by the hundreds
to a rebel-held military base about 350 kilometers (200 miles)
southwest of the capital. Both Rwanda and Uganda have dismissed
claims that they are involved in the 10-day-old Tutsi-led revolt,
but the accusations have helped to rally Kinshasa's population
behind an embattled Kabila. (CONGO)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Restrictions on arms inspectors make it
impossible to ensure that Iraq is not reviving its weapons
programs, the top U.N. weapons inspector said Wednesday, stepping
up pressure on the Security Council to address the latest crisis.
Richard Butler's letter to the Security Council, ``seeking
guidance,'' comes a day after his counterpart at the U.N. nuclear
agency made a similar request. Iraq froze out the inspectors last
week, after Butler said he could not certify that Iraq had met the
requirements to end eight years of debilitating sanctions, imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. (UN-IRAQ)

Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks posted sizable gains Wednesday, extending
Tuesday's late rebound, as bargain hunters continued to pick
through the wreckage of another selloff sparked by the financial
turmoil in Asia. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 90.11 points
_ or 1.1 percent _ to 8,552.96, wiping out most of the remaining

also recovered a chunk of the prior day's losses, with a steady

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks closed with gains in leading European
exchanges Wednesday after a mixed showing in Asia as edgy traders
looked for bargains following a global selloff Tuesday. On the
London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest market, the blue-chip
Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed with a gain
of just over one-half percentage point Wednesday. Frankfurt,
Germany's DAX index rose 1.9 percent and the Paris CAC 40 index
rose 2.6 percent. All three had been down Tuesday. In Russia,
stocks were unable to hold early gains and the major index finished
down 1.6 percent Wednesday. Because of worries that Russia's
economic problems will be aggravated by Asia's turmoil, shares
plummeted 9 percent in a stormy session Tuesday in which trading
was temporarily halted because of the steep losses. (STOCK MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In another blow to the government's efforts to
stabilize Russia's reeling economy, leaders of the
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament said Wednesday they
would not call a special session to implement an austerity program.
State Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said last week the legislature
would meet Aug. 19-20 to consider 17 draft laws. But deputy speaker
Sergei Baburin said following a meeting of parliamentary leaders
Wednesday that the bills ``are not of such super-importance that
they have to be considered urgently. They can wait until autumn.''
The laws would enact economic reforms demanded by the International
Monetary Fund and others in exchange for a dlrs 22.6 billion
bailout package. Parliament balked at enacting other reforms before
adjourning for its summer recess, forcing the government to impose
them by decree. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Cabinet approved a
blueprint Wednesday for a bigger national budget next year, with
expanded public works spending intended to help revive Japan's
economy. At an extraordinary meeting, the Cabinet endorsed
standards that government agencies must follow when making requests
for their 1999 budgets. The criteria would increase spending on
public projects by as much as 30 percent from the original 1998
budget and suspend a law designed to balance the budget while the
government focuses on restoring the economy's health. Under the
guidelines, the overall budget would increase about 11 percent to
49.4 trillion yen (dlrs 338 billion), Kyodo reported, quoting the
Finance Ministry. (JAPAN-BUDGET)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Seagram Co.'s profits more than doubled in its
fiscal fourth quarter, inflated by a dlrs 493 million gain from
selling the last of its shares in Time Warner Inc. Excluding that
windfall, Seagram's operating profits dropped as the Asian economic
crisis hammered the company's wine and spirits business. But the
results still topped Wall Street expectations, sending Seagram's
recently battered stock up 12 percent Wednesday. Seagram earned
dlrs 324 million, or 92 cents per share on a diluted basis, in the
quarter ended June 30. The Montreal-based company earned dlrs 148
million, or 40 cents per share, in the same period last year, which
included a dlrs 154 million gain from selling Time Warner shares.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The share of the Japanese auto market
controlled by U.S. and other foreign auto makers has fallen below
where it was when the United States and Japan went to the brink of
a trade war over the issue, the Clinton administration said
Wednesday. Releasing its latest review of the 1995 agreement, the
administration blamed Japan's economic troubles along with
foot-dragging by the government on implementation of the deal for
the decline in market-share. The report cited industry statistics
showing that the total foreign share of Japan's motor vehicle
market stood at 4.5 percent for the first five months of 1998, down
from 5.4 percent in 1997 and 6 percent in 1996. The foreign market
share had been 5.7 percent in 1995, the year the United States
threatened to block the import of Japanese luxury cars. (US-JAPAN

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Welsh actor Sir Anthony Hopkins, more famous as
Hannibal ``The Cannibal'' Lecter than as a nature lover, has
pledged a million pounds (dlrs 1.63 million) to help save 4,000
acres (1,620 hectares) of Mount Snowdon, Wales' highest mountain.
	   ``Snowdonia is one of the most beautiful places in the world and
Snowdon is the jewel that lies at its heart,'' Hopkins said
Wednesday. ``It must be cherished and protected.''
	   A farmer last month put his estate near the 3,560-foot
(1,085-meter) peak up for sale. The National Trust, a charity that
protects much of Britain's natural and historic heritage, has 93
more days to find the rest of the 3 million pound (dlrs 4.9
million) price tag before the land is put on the market.
	   ``The National Trust is dedicated to the preservation of this
land and its natural heritage,'' said Hopkins, who won an Academy
Award for his portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in ``Silence of the
Lambs.'' ``I know this and have seen it firsthand. I am very
pleased that I am able to offer this support.''
	   Hopkins, who was born in Port Talbot, Wales, is chairman of the
trust's Snowdonia Appeal, which raises money for protection of the
land it already owns there.

	   FAIRMOUNT, Indiana (AP) _ James Dean's tombstone is back where
it belongs.
	   Nearly a month after the actor's tombstone was stolen and found
dumped on a county road, workers reinstalled it Wednesday at Park
Cemetery in Fairmount, a farming community of 3,000 where Dean grew
up.
	   About a dozen people watched as the 400-pound (180-kilo),
rose-colored granite stone was set back onto its base, affixed with
two 24-inch (60-centimeter) metal rods and cement.
	   The tombstone was reported missing July 14 and was recovered two
days later.
	   Dean, who starred in ``East of Eden,'' ``Giant'' and ``Rebel
Without a Cause,'' was killed in a car crash in California on Sept.
30, 1955, at age 24. His grave draws thousands of visitors each
year.
	   Police have made no arrests in the theft. The original tombstone
was stolen in April 1983, recovered the next month, then stolen
again that August. The present stone replaced the original.

	   ROME (AP) _ On the day Italians traditionally wish upon falling
stars, a 19-year-old Roman was granted a wish she hadn't even
dreamed of: a chance to star in Dustin Hoffman's new film.
	   The American actor, who had just landed his yacht Illusion on
the tiny island of Stromboli, north of Sicily, reportedly saw the
woman at a nearby bar and exclaimed, ``I have seen my Renata.''
	   According to witness accounts published in Italian dailies
Wednesday, the 60-year-old actor invited the teen-ager, described
as a tall, thin brunette, to the table where he was sitting with
his wife and two of his children. Through a translator, Hoffman
reportedly asked Anna, who is a student in Rome and speaks no
English, whether she would be interested in playing the leading
role in a movie based on Ernest Hemmingway's 1950 novel, ``Across
the River and into the Trees.''
	   Anna, who has no acting experience, told reporters she was
thrilled by the offer and would send her photos and resume to
Hoffman's studio as he had instructed her. In accord with Italy's
new privacy laws, the newspapers did not give her last name.
	   On the Aug. 10 celebration of San Lorenzo, Italians usually go
to romantic, secluded areas to wish upon falling stars _ an
opportunity provided by the yearly Perseid meteor shower.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Photographs of the millions of flowers, poems and
notes laid outside the gates of Kensington Palace following the
death of Princess Diana have been gathered together for a book to
be launched this week.
	   ``Flowers in the Park,'' a 96-page paperback, is designed to be
a permanent record of the floral sea that covered acres (hectares)
of grass outside the princess' former home, where scores of
mourners kept a vigil during the period between her death in a
Paris car crash Aug. 31 and her funeral a week later.
	   Volunteers worked for three weeks to clear the bouquets after
her funeral and up to 15 tons (14 metric tons) of flowers left by
mourners at Kensington, Buckingham and St. James's palaces were
composted to regenerate the grass at Kensington Gardens, which was
worn away by the thousands of people who came to pay their respects
to the princess.
	   All proceeds from the book, which will be sold for 10 pounds
(dlrs 16) will go to the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fund,
which was set up in the weeks following her death to coordinate the
flood of spontaneous donations from the public.

Japan's June current account surplus rises 46 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Continuing over a year of increases, Japan's
broadest measure of trade rose 46 percent in June from a year ago,
the government announced Thursday.
	   Japan's current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal
factors, was at 1.444 trillion yen (dlrs 9.86 billion) in June, up
46.2 percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, higher than Tokyo-based economists had forecast,
marked the 15th consecutive monthly year-on-year increase in the
surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning surplus.
	   Also, the ministry announced that for the first six months of
the year through June, the surplus stood at 7.573 trillion yen
(dlrs 51.7 billion), up 52.9 percent from the same period last
year.

New government proposes budget cuts to revive ailing economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ New President Andres Pastrana's
government presented Congress with first details of a
deficit-cutting plan Wednesday touted as a recipe for reviving
Colombia's slumping but traditionally solid economy.
	   Interest rates, unemployment and the public debt soared during
the scandal-ridden government of President Ernesto Samper, who
raided the treasury to pay off political supporters with
pork-barrel projects. Colombia is now beset with its worst-ever
fiscal deficit and 16 percent unemployment.
	   On Tuesday, Finance Minister Juan Camilo Restrepo announced dlrs
730 million in cuts from the dlrs 32 billion budget and floated a
proposal to trim the national sales tax by 1 percent and beef up
tax enforcement in a country with one of the region's highest tax
evasion rates.
	   On Wednesday, he presented Congress with the plan, which seeks
by the end of next year to reduce the deficit to 2 percent of gross
domestic product from its current 3.7 percent. The budget deficit
now stands at nearly dlrs 4 billion.
	   Pastrana's austerity promises have earned widespread praise from
financial analysts, but the package will have to make it through a
legislature dominated by Samper's LiberE foreign investment, he says.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ National Guardsmen knocked down tents
and brought in at least one tank to intimidate Indians protesting
the construction of a power line near their homes in the Amazon
rain forest.
	   The guardsmen started destroying about 20 tents early Wednesday
while most of the Pemon Indians were asleep, said Jose Luis
Gonzalez of the Bolivar State Indian Federation. Later, guardsmen
arrived with two tanks at the site near El Dorado in southeast
Venezuela.
	   Pedro Zambrano, head of the National Guard in Bolivar, said just
one tent was knocked down and the cause was wind from a passing
truck. He said one tank was at the scene.
	   Discussions later in the day ended with an agreement under which
the Indians will allow all vehicles expect those involved with the
electricity line to pass through the highway, Zambrano said.
	   For the last two weeks, about 400 Indians have been partially
blocking traffic by placing logs on the only highway linking
Venezuela and Brazil. They say the 485-mile power line will damage
the environment in the Imataca rain forest by supplying electricity
to gold mining companies that want to set up operations there.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexicans living outside their country could
constitute a significant voter bloc in the 2000 presidential
elections, accounting for as much as 15 percent of the electorate,
local media reported Wednesday.
	   New laws approved this year give Mexicans living abroad _ mainly
in the United States _ the right to vote. Logistical problems with
registering them are still being worked out.
	   There could be as many as 7 million Mexicans of voting age
living abroad by 2000, Emilio Zebadua, a member of the Federal
Electoral Institute, told local media.
	   A survey by Mexican consulates estimates that 7.3 million
Mexicans currently live in the United States. The majority, 4.9
million, are considered legal residents, while 2.4 million are
undocumented.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ An average of one kidnapping, three rapes and
112 thefts occurred in Mexico City per day in the first half of
1998, Mexican media reported Wednesday.
	   The number of reported rapes increased by 14 percent between the
first and second quarters, while robberies were down by 7 percent
in the same period, according to a report issued by Mexico City
police.
	   Most troubling for city legislators was the increase in
kidnappings to an average of one per day. Legislators said the
actual number was probably higher, since many cases are not
reported to police.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A new storm system reached hurricane status
Wednesday in the Pacific Ocean far off Mexico's coast.
	   Georgette, located roughly 600 miles south-southwest of the tip
of the Baja California Peninsula, was moving northwest at 13 mph,
the U.S. Hurricane Center in Miami reported.
	   The storm was producing maximum sustained winds of 80 mph with
gusts to near 98 mph. It was expected to strengthen over the next
day before starting to weaken, the center said.
	   Mexico's National Meteorological System warned ships of strong
winds and high waves between the Pacific's Revillagigedo
Archipelago and the west coast of Nayarit and Michoacan states.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Bowing to public outcry, Nicaragua has
declared ``null and nonexistent'' an accord it signed last month
allowing armed Costa Rican civil guards to patrol the river
dividing the nations.
	   The government voided the agreement late Tuesday, deciding it
violated Nicaragua's sovereign control of the San Juan River, Vice
President Enrique Bolanos said Wednesday. The move also came due to
the ``popular clamor against the accord,'' he said.
	   Costa Rica's foreign minister, Roberto Rojas, called the
decision unfortunate and said Costa Rica planned to send Nicaragua
an ``energetic'' response.
	   Nicaraguan lawmakers and analysts criticized the accord, signed
July 30, as a surrender of the river. Under agreements signed in
1858 and 1888, Nicaragua has full sovereignty over the river while
Costa Rica has navigation rights on a stretch near where it empties
into the Caribbean.
	   ___
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Share prices on the Buenos Aires
Stock Exchange continued to drop Wednesday, as businessmen and
economists asked the government to cut back on spending.
	   The Merval index of leading shares fell 0.9 percent, compared to
a 4.3 percent drop on Tuesday.
	   ``Investors were calm but cautious today,'' said one Buenos
Aires analyst. ``There was none of yesterday's panic, but things
are far from being in good shape.''
	   Fiat Auto executive Cristiano Ratazzi counseled the government
to cut back on spending and control the fiscal deficit.
	   ``If we had an excellent fiscal situation, Argentina would be
one of the few countries in the world not to suffer the
consequences of the financial crisis,'' Ratazzi said.
	   Argentina's fiscal deficit equals 3.8 percent of its gross
domestic product.
	   Former Industry and Trade Secretary Roberto Lavagna warned that
the rate of growth might ``slow down to 2 percent in 1999''
compared to the present 5.5 percent.

Series of moderate earthquakes rocks northwestern Japan

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A series of moderate earthquakes hitting part of
northwestern Japan continued for a seventh day Thursday, though no
major damage or injuries have been reported.
	   Between last Friday and Thursday morning, a total of 2,419
earthquakes had been recorded, the Meteorological Agency said. But
only 64 were strong enough to be felt by humans, it said.
	   Many were about 10 kilometers (6 miles) underground in central
Nagano prefecture, 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest of Tokyo.
	   Nagano is the mountainous prefecture that hosted the Winter
Olympics in February.
	   The largest of the tremors, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.6,
hit Wednesday, the most active day so far with 977 quakes recorded.
	   ``We are cautiously watching the situation,'' an agency official
said Thursday morning. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The agency said there was no fear of tsunami, the huge ocean
waves caused by undersea earthquakes or volcanic activity.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.
	   Thousands of earthquakes over a short period of time are not
uncommon in Japan. According to the agency official, the same area
in Nagano experienced similar spates of seismic activity in 1990
and 1967.

China's propagandists busy spinning flood story

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Even by the skewed standards of Chinese
government propaganda, the story of the soldiers, the hornets and a
young villager's breast milk was bizarre.
	   State-run television aired footage of Xu Hongping baring her
breasts to squirt milk onto the soldiers' hornet stings, cleaning
the sores of the men fighting China's worst flooding since 1954.
	   The story is typical of how state-run media are glorifying flood
rescue efforts while underplaying the misery of a disaster that has
affected almost a fifth of China's population and killed more than
2,000 people.
	   The ruling Communist Party has seized on the floods to showcase
the sacrifices of the People's Liberation Army _ reviled by many
after they shot at pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989. The
soldiers are often shown plugging breaches, manning vital levees
and rescuing victims clinging to trees and rooftops.
	   For state media _ the only source of news for most Chinese _ and
their government censors, the theme of the floods has been of
officials, soldiers and common people toiling together against the
raging torrents.
	   Deaths are skirted over or ignored; setbacks in anti-flood
efforts, if reported, often are given a positive spin; the true
number of casualties is unknown. The government says ``more than''
2,000 dead, but provides no specifics.
	   In official reports, tales of heroism and sacrifice drown out
the protests of farmers whose houses and land deliberately were
flooded to safeguard cities downstream.
	   In a country as big and as heavily populated as China, counting
casualties does take time, particularly when the devastation is as
widespread as this year, with more than 17 million homes and tens
of thousands of miles (kilometers) of farmland inundated.
	   But the government has actively sought to keep bad news under
wraps, heavily policing badly hit areas and turning away foreign
and even some Chinese reporters. One Chinese reporter said police
stopped him from filming hundreds of bodies he saw bobbing on
floodwaters.
	   Chinese reporters are not expected to go out and get the most
newsworthy stories. Rather, they are under government orders to
provide uplifting coverage for the millions of people exhausted,
made homeless or left grieving by the weeks of floods.
	   ``Reporting too many negative things could create panic. ...It's
not beneficial to social stability,'' explained Guo Qingguang,
deputy director of the journalism school at Beijing's elite
People's University.
	   So, stories are plentiful such as the China Daily's ``Hero
becomes human sandbag,'' telling how Wang Zhangcheng, a physically
disabled man in his 60s, used his body to block a 1-meter (3-foot)
hole in a levee in Wuhan.
	   His bravery ``virtually saved the city,'' the official newspaper
said.
	   Or ``Zhu Rongji cries in Jiujiang,'' a Yangcheng Evening News
report about how China's usually impassive premier shed tears after
giving a pep talk to troops repairing a breached dike in Jiujiang,
a southeastern city of 500,000.
	   And the tale of Xu and her milk, with its message of a maternal
bond between ordinary Chinese and the army.
	   ``The soldiers have come to protect us,'' Xu told the TV crew.
``What I did was nothing.''
	   New coverage of the 2.9-million-member army saving civilians is
useful at a time when the military has been embarrassed by a
government crackdown on smuggling that has singled out its illegal
activities.
	   ``The first to arrive at the front line are the soldiers. This
is a fact,'' said Guo, the journalism professor. ``On the other
hand, this is also used to strengthen the relationship between the
army and the people.''

Four still in hunt as records stand at Golden League meet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEIR MOULSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Four athletes remain on course to
share in the Golden League jackpot after the Zurich international
track meet Wednesday.
	   But expectations that Michael Johnson and Haile Gebrselassie
would break the men's 400 and 5,000 meter records came to nothing
in the humid heat of the Letzigrund stadium.
	   A thigh injury to Olympic champion Donovan Bailey in the 100
meters further dampened the proceedings. The surprise winner was
Seun Ogunkoya of Nigeria.
	   The Canadian star was taken to hospital after pulling up injured
some 60 meters into the race. Race doctor Roland Biedert, who
treated Bailey, said he would likely be out of competition for
two-to-four weeks.
	   It was a successful night for a ``very exicted'' Marion Jones,
who took both the 100 meters and the long jump.
	   Reigning world champion Jones won the women's 100 meters in
10.77, keeping her season's record intact, and said she felt
``ready to run sub-10.70.''
	   She said she still has ``a long way to go in the long jump,'' in
which she leaped 7.31 meters.
	   Still with Jones in the Golden League chase are Morocco's Hicham
El Guerrouj, Gebrselassie and 400m hurdler Bryan Bronson of the
United States.
	   Nigeria's Charity Opara dropped out of contention, finishing
second to Germany's Grit Breuer in the women's 400m for her first
defeat in the Golden League series.
	   Records remained standing throughout the evening at an event
which has a reputation for breaking them. In contrast, three new
marks were set at last year's meet.
	   The 400m world record, the longest standing track record, was
set here 10 years ago by Butch Reynolds.
	   Michael Johnson ran his best time of the season, finishing in
43.69. It was far short of Reynolds' 43.29.
	   ``I'm aware of it, yes,'' Johnson said afterward. But ``it's not
my world record.''
	   ``I can't just program myself,'' the double Olympic champion
said, adding that the only record to count for him was the 200m.
	   Gebrselassie, who won in 12 minutes 54.08 seconds, admitted the
heat was a problem in the last half of the race. ``I wanted to run
under the world record but it would not work,'' he said.
	   The Ethiopian added that the Golden League format was ``a little
bit too much'' for long-distance runners.
	   ``How can you run every three days?'' he said. The last meeting
in the seven-race series took place in Monaco just four days
before.
	   Another record stayed intact as El-Guerrouj won the men's 1,500
meters in 3:26.4, failing to break his own record set last month in
Rome.
	   ``In the heat of the night it was almost impossible to attack
the world record,'' he said.
	   U.S. hurdler Allen Johnson said he had no problems with the
heat.
	   The Olympic and world champion, Johnson won the 110m hurdles in
12.98 seconds. He was optimistic about the remaining meetings and
said he was now at the right point of the season to ``get kicking
in.''
	   The dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot is shared by those who
remain unbeaten in certain events in the six Golden League meets
and the Grand Prix final in Moscow on September 5.

News Corp. profits up despite Fox TV New Channel losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch's global entertainment
and media company News Corp. said Thursday its net profit jumped to
U.S. dlrs 1 billion (1.68 billion Australian dollars) in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1998, despite losses at its startup Fox News
Channel.
	   Profits were partly buoyed by the worldwide earnings of the
blockbuster film ``Titanic.''
	   The net profit was up from U.S. dlrs 432 million (720 million
Australian dollars) a year earlier. The higher result is in line
with market expectations.
	   News Corp. also reported a 32 percent rise in sales to U.S. dlrs
11.3 billion (18.9 billion Australian dollars) and declared a final
dividend of 1.5 Australian cents a share.
	   News Corp. said its total operating income rose 56 percent to
U.S. dlrs 1.59 billion (2.65 billion Australian dollars) from U.S.
dlrs 1.02 billion (1.70 billion Australian dollars).
	   The rise was ``driven by strong double digit earnings gains in
all of the company's major operating segments with U.S. television,
both TV Stations and Fox Broadcasting, Filmed Entertainment, Free
Standing Inserts and HarperCollins all showing sizable increases,''
the company said.
	   The growth also reflects the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar,
it said.
	   News Corp. said growth in core businesses and acquired assets
offset losses from Fox News Channel.
	   Despite losses from the Fox News Channel, News Corp. said total
U.S. operating income climbed 47 percent to U.S. dlrs 774 million
(1.29 billion Australian dollars) from revenue gains of 21 percent.
That reflects growth in core businesses, along with contributions
from assets it has acquired, the company said.
	   The Filmed Entertainment arm, which produces movies, posted an
operating profit of U.S. dlrs 152.4 million (254 million Australian
dollars). This represents a rise of more than 140 percent from a
year earlier and partially reflects the success of the blockbuster
movie ``Titanic,'' which has attracted U.S. dlrs 1.08 billion (1.8
billion Australian dollars) in global box office receipts.
	   U.S. Television operating profits climbed 28 percent, with a
``very strong'' performance at Fox Television Stations and improved
results at the Fox Broadcasting Co.
	   During the year, Fox News Channel expanded its reach to 32
million subscribers from 22 million previously. Committed future
additions will push distribution to at least 40 million homes
within the next three years, News said.
	   Star TV, News Corp.'s Asian satellite television network,
expanded its position in major targeted markets and made progress
towards achieving financial targets. Higher advertising and
subscriber revenues contributed to total revenue growth of 57
percent, the company said.

War for hearts and minds rages in the Congo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos KIN101-05 &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ There are three war fronts in the Congo.
	   Rebels and government loyalists are battling in the east and
west for territory. But on the airwaves and in daily newspapers, a
war is also being waged for the hearts and minds of the people.
	   The rebels claim sweeping gains in their march toward Kinshasa;
the government says it is retaking lost ground and will drive all
the way to Kigali, the capital of its rival and neighbor, Rwanda.
Somewhere in between lies the truth.
	   Searching for answers, an envoy from Zambia began an
investigation Wednesday into charges by President Laurent Kabila
that Rwanda and Uganda are aiding rebels in a drive to topple
Congo's government. Both neighbors have denied Kabila's
accusations.
	   Zambian government minister Eric Siluwamba said he also hopes to
open a dialogue between Congo and Rwanda to help ease tensions
between the feuding nations.
	   Congo's relations with Rwanda have been deteriorating throughout
Kabila's 14 months of rule, and last month he expelled Rwandan
soldiers who helped him take power in the central African nation.
The expulsion prompted ethnic Tutsi rebels in eastern Congo, who
have close ties with Rwanda, to revolt last week.
	   Uganda and Rwanda were major backers of Kabila when he ousted
longtime dictator Mobutu Sese Seko last year. But they have been
angered by the Congolese president's failure to contain attacks on
their territory by renegade groups based in eastern Congo.
	   With the fighting in remote areas inaccessible to journalists,
independent confirmation of battlefield developments is next to
impossible. The public is largely at the mercy of state- and
rebel-controlled news.
	   Both sides claim to control the strategic town of Bukavu in the
east, and both say are advancing in the west near the Atlantic
coastline.
	   Rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekane in the eastern city of Goma
says he has 60,000 troops, the support of the people and an
unstoppable drive to oust Kabila.
	   For Kabila, the war of words may be as important to his survival
as the war on the ground. Increasingly criticized at home since he
took power, Kabila is maneuvering to win the support of the people
through patriotic appeals and nationalist fervor.
	   Using phrases like ``savage aggression'' and ``premeditated
attacks'' to characterize Rwanda, Kabila is painting a picture of
Congo as victim.
	   ``Rwandan leaders are holding Congo as a colony,'' Kabila says
in an often repeated broadcast on state television and radio.
``They now think of conquering this country to subjugate your
independence as a sovereign people.''
	   In Kinshasa, Kabila's words seem to be having the desired
effect.
	   Simmering anger at Kabila over economic stagnation and mass
unemployment, a crackdown on dissent and unfulfilled promises of
democracy seem to have been set aside, while the capital apparently
rallies to his support.
	   On a state television talk show, whose guests are a panel of
local police officers, one speaker describes Rwanda as ``a
disobedient dog.''
	   But for all Kabila's readiness to demonize Rwanda, the rebellion
may be traceable to his own ineffectiveness. Congo's continued
economic malaise and inequity have created widespread resentment in
the country. On top of that, he stands accused of doing little to
increase security in Congo's turbulent eastern border region.

Se Ri Pak says she's no Lopez, King
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LYTHAM ST. ANNES, England (AP) _ Se Ri Pak knows it will take a
long time before she becomes a Nancy Lopez or a Betsy King.
	   She couldn't have made a better start.
	   With four tournament wins including two majors in her rookie
season, the 20-year-old Korean has shown her rivals she could
become the new superstar of women's golf _ a female version of
Tiger Woods only even more successful.
	   At age 20, she has plenty of time to achieve the standards set
by Lopez and King and points out that her career as a pro has only
just started.
	   ``I hear people say that I am one of the top players. I'm not
thinking about that,'' she said Wednesday on the eve of the Women's
British Open.
	   ``I have just started. I want to play for a long, long time and
become like the great players, such as Nancy Lopez and Betsy King.
	   ``To do that I have to keep learning and learning. I watch the
top players to see how they play and how they deal with things. I
don't have pressure because I am still learning.''
	   In comparison with Lopez, she's just about at level par. Winner
of three majors, Lopez won 17 LPGA tournaments in her first two
years as a pro. King didn't start winning until she was seven years
into her pro career but then wo 31.
	   Pak's rivals are convinced they are up against someone who has a
big future.
	   Laura Davies, the first player to win dlrs 1 million in one
season on the U.S. Tour, recognizes that even the strong winds on
the tricky links course at Lytham St. Annes won't faze the young
Korean.
	   ``She's got the game to win anywhere,'' said big-hitting Laura
Davies, who was looking for her first British Open triumph since
1986. ``She's a good player and, if you are playing well, you can
do well in any conditions.
	   ``It's a tough course but she can go anywhere and play anywhere.
If you're as solid as she is and the wind's blowing I wouldn't have
thought she'd think it was a big deal.''
	   Australia's Karrie Webb, bidding to win the British Open for the
third time in four years and the defending titlist, acknowledged
Pak as the player to beat.
	   The Korean won the LPGA Championship and the U.S. Women's Open
and also collected the Jamie Kroger Classic and the Giant Eagle
Classic. Three of her titles came in a run of four events.
	   ``Obviously I'd try to match what she's done,'' said Webb. ``But
it's just a matter of putting it together at one time.''

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Se Ri Pak says fatigue and a sore shoulder
will keep her out of the Rainbow Foods LPGA tournament next week at
Rush Creek.
	   Pak, the winner this year of the Women's U.S. Open and the LPGA
Championship, withdrew Tuesday.
	   ``Pak wrote a letter to the LPGA saying she is very tired and
her shoulder is hurting,'' said tournament director Michael
Stearns. Pak is playing this week in the Women's British Open.
	   At the same time, Patty Sheehan, a member of the LPGA Hall of
Fame, who has not played in the Minnesota tournament, added her
name to the commitment list, Stearns said.
	   ``It's very disappointing that Pak won't be here, but getting
Patty Sheehan to play here for the first time in the nine years of
the tournament is a real bonus,'' Stearns said.

Japan's June current account surplus rises 46 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with value of imports, exports; ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Continuing over a year of increases, Japan's
broadest measure of trade rose 46 percent in June from a year ago,
the government announced Thursday.
	   Japan's current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal
factors, was at 1.444 trillion yen (dlrs 9.86 billion) in June, up
46.2 percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, higher than Tokyo-based economists had forecast,
marked the 15th consecutive monthly year-on-year increase in the
surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   The value of Japanese exports in June rose 4.3 percent to 4.17
trillion yen (dlrs 28.6 billion), while imports slumped 3.7 percent
to 2.8 trillion yen (dlrs 19.2 trillion).
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap the ballooning surplus.
	   The ministry said that the dramatic slide in the value of the
yen, which makes Japanese products cheaper abroad, contributed to
the rise in the surplus.
	   The government's economic stimulus package, which includes tax
cuts and public works spending, is expected to boost domestic
demand and trim the surplus in the future, the ministry said.
	   Also, the ministry announced that for the first six months of
the year through June, the surplus stood at 7.573 trillion yen
(dlrs 51.7 billion), up 52.9 percent from the same period last
year.
	   The finance ministry has said that while it doesn't forecast
large rises in the surplus over the long term, it will likely
continue to expand in the short term.

Schett defeats Catalina Cristea in soggy day's only match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WELLESLEY, Massachusetts (AP) _ Austrian Barbara Schett captured
the only match played Wednesday as rain soaked the BostonCup tennis
tournament at Babson College.
	   In all, seven singles and three doubles matches were postponed.
	   Schett, seeded seventh, defeated Catalina Cristea of Romania
6-0, 7-5.
	   ``I took the first set easily, but Catalina got her rhythm going
in the second set and I was very concerned,'' Schett said. ``I lost
a match a few weeks ago after winning the first set 6-0, and I was
afraid that might happen again today.''
	   Fourth-seeded Silvia Farina of Italy and Mary Joe Fernandez
resumed their match that had been suspended Tuesday due to rain and
lightning. But after they split sets _ Fernandez winning the first
6-1 and Farina the second 6-2 _ play was again suspended, this time
with Fernandez leading 5-3 in the third set.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ignoring cease-fire calls,
government forces are pressing their offensive against ethnic
Albanian rebels in southwestern Kosovo province, while aid agencies
race to stave off a humanitarian crisis among thousands displaced
by the fighting.
	   The government's Tanjug news agency said Serb police Wednesday
fought their way into the former rebel stronghold of Glodjane
following two days of fierce fighting in which five Serb policemen
and two Yugoslav army soldiers were killed.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, under ethnic Albanian control,
reported that seven fighters from the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army
were killed and 49 wounded in the fighting.
	   Meanwhile, Serb and Albanian sources reported fresh fighting in
the nearby village of Junik, one of the main bases for the KLA. The
village has been under a Serb siege and sporadic shelling for three
weeks.
	   Each side blamed the other for launching the attacks.
	   The rebels are fighting for independence for Kosovo, a province
of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia. Albanians form 90
percent of Kosovo's 2 million people.
	   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had promised European
Union envoys that his forces would not attack Junik, where some
1,000 KLA fighters and as many civilians are believed to be
trapped.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, speaking for the
EU, condemned the fighting around Junik and urged the Yugoslav
government to avoid actions that would worsen the ``already
unbearable humanitarian situation.''
	   On Wednesday, Serbian state television broadcast an interview
with what it said were two captured KLA fighters. The two men,
dressed in fatigues, said they had come from Switzerland, where
they were working, to Albania, where they obtained weapons in the
northern Albanian town of Tropoja.
	   The two also claimed other KLA recruiters traveled by way of
Italy, where they bribed police to allow them to cross Italian
territory without visas.
	   The latest fighting raged despite calls by the U.N. Security
Council for a cease-fire and warnings by NATO that military
intervention to halt the conflict remained at option.
	   But those calls appear to have lost their effectiveness since
they have been made repeatedly _ and ignored _ by the combatants
since Milosevic launched his crackdown against Albanian
secessionists five months ago.
	   In London, Isa Zymberi of the local Kosovo Information Office
told CNN-International that if the Americans and Europeans do not
move quickly to halt the fighting, ``very shortly we will see the
whole region ablaze.''
	   Zymberi was referring to fears that the fighting will spread to
other Balkan countries with large Albanian populations..
	   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that up to
240,000 people have been displaced by the fighting. Tens of
thousands are hiding in forests and hills of Kosovo, fearful of
reprisals if they return home.
	   On Wednesday, a senior Western diplomat, speaking on condition
of anonymity, warned that significant numbers of refugees must be
returned to their homes in time to harvest crops.
	   The harvest season begins in Kosovo in about three weeks and
unless significant numbers can return home by then, the diplomat
warned of a humanitarian disaster once winter begins in a few
months.

Bank of Japan says employment, consumer sentiment worsening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Employment conditions in Japan are worsening and
consumer confidence _ essential to Japan's economic recovery _ is
deteriorating further, the central bank said Thursday.
	   In another bleak assessment of the economy, the Bank of Japan
said in its monthly report that the ratio of job offers to seekers
has dropped to a historical low, and that incomes are falling as
well.
	   The BOJ also said that downward pressure on prices is
continuing, raising fears of a deflationary spiral. Falling prices
cut into company earnings, hurting income and employment conditions
and dampening consumer confidence further.
	   On Monday, Japan's Economic Planning Agency downgraded its
assessment for Japan's economy, saying that there was no hope in
sight for a recovery in domestic demand and that economic
conditions were ``increasingly severe.''

His own jet would help Davis Love III's back
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM COUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   REDMOND, Washington (AP) _ Davis Love III, the defending PGA
champion, would rather have his own jet, but he can't afford one
yet.
	   Love, 34, has had back trouble _ like a lot of the pros _ and he
thinks commercial airplane travel adds to his ailment. So he'd love
to plunk down a down payment on a plane.
	   Until then, he'll have to keep flying commercial.
	   ``Private planes are nice if you've got a big enough area to lay
down or walk around,'' he said Wednesday. ``But I've not in that
category yet.''
	   Love said that after he flew across the country from the Buick
Classic in Rye, New York to the U.S. Open in San Francisco in June,
he could hardly play the next day.
	   He wound up missing the cut for the U.S. Open.
	   Love did not play last week and broke up his trip to the West
Coast from Sea Island, Georgia, so his back would be all right this
week. He stopped off in Dallas and walked around for awhile.
	   ``This is a long trip,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; DALY DRILL: &LR;  John Daly doesn't plan to change anything about
his game. That means he won't keep his driver in his bag _ like
Tiger Woods plans to do _ at the PGA Championship this week.
	   Despite the Sahalee Country Club's narrow, tree-lined fairways,
Daly will be playing long ball from the tee when he thinks he needs
to hit bombs.
	   ``I love this course,'' he said. ``I'm going to try to make this
course suit my game. I think I've played well the last couple of
months. I just haven't been scoring.''
	   Daly missed the cut in five of his past 10 tournaments when he
arrived in Memphis, Tenn., two weeks ago for the FedEx St. Jude
Classic. He was 3-under on the front in the third round, but
finished with two straight double bogeys and stormed off the
course.
	   He exchanged scorecards with Loren Roberts, but didn't sign his
card and was disqualified.
	   ``If I hit my driver real well here, it's going to be a huge
plus. I'll continue to play aggressively,'' Daly said. ``That's the
only way I know how to play. It's kind of like going to the
blackjack table.''
	   Daly relishes challenges. His go-for-broke style will be tested
by the Sahalee Country Club's No. 11 ``Goal Post'' hole, so named
because players will be trying to hit 250 yards (227 meters) onto
the green between two large trees.
	   ``I didn't bring any footballs with me,'' he said with a grin.
``But it'll be fun. It's important to try to split the uprights.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; CALLAWAY STEEL: &LR;  Callaway Golf introduced its response to the
shallow-faced fairway woods that have become increasingly popular
in recent months _ the Big Bertha Steelhead.
	   It features a steel chip in the sole that gives it a low center
of gravity and allows it to keep the large clubface. It is designed
to replace the original Big Bertha War Bird and will be priced
around $250.
	   Colin Montgomerie first used the steel head while practicing at
Callaway headquarters before the U.S. Open.
	   ``If clubs go further and straighter, I'll put them in the
bag,'' Montgomerie said.
	   Callaway will also have a steel-headed driver. That won't be
available until October unless your name happens to be John Daly.
	   Daly asked Callaway to make him a driver with a 7-degree loft,
which he plans to use this week at Sahalee Country Club _ and use
often.
	   ``I hit driver on every hole and didn't miss a fairway,'' Daly
said. ``I gave my Biggest Big Bertha to some 8-year-old kid.
Goodbye, Titanium. Hello, steel.''
	   Daly estimated hitting the ball an extra 15 yards with the steel
club.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; GEIBERGER HISTORY: &LR;  Al and Brent Geiberger will make some
golfing history Thursday when they become the first father-son
tandem to play in the same PGA Championship.
	   ``It's going to be a fun time,'' said Brent, 30, after a
practice round and a long session on the putting green Wednesday.
``The last few days have been a thrill.''
	   Al, 60, who now lives in nearby Woodinville, was not at Sahalee
Wednesday. He was home resting for his first round.
	   ``He can still hold his own,'' Brent said of his father, who was
the first player in PGA Tour history to shoot a 59. ``He doesn't
play as much now, but he's had a lot of success on the Senior
Tour.''
	   Brent resides in Palm Desert, California, and doesn't get a
chance to see his dad that much now. But they were paired in a
practice round this week. They will be in separate threesomes
Thursday.
	   Al will be playing in his first PGA Championship since 1985,
while Brent joined the field as a member of the top 70 money
earners over a one-year period since last year's PGA Championship.
	   Al won 11 PGA Tour events and 10 Senior PGA Tour tournaments.
Brent's best round is a 64 on the Nike Tour. He's still looking for
his first victory on any tour.

Dominican officials arrest Cuban in supposed plot to assassinate
</HEADLINE>
Castro &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSE MONEGRO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominican authorities
arrested a Cuban exile for questioning in a supposed plot to
assassinate Fidel Castro during the Cuban leader's scheduled visit
here next week, officials said Wednesday.
	   But they gave conflicting reports of what happened to the
suspect that could not be reconciled immediately.
	   Immigration director Danilo Diaz told The Associated Press that
the man would be detained in the Dominican Republic and deported to
an unspecified country after Castro's Aug. 20-25 visit ends.
	   But Listin Diario, the leading Dominican newspaper, quoted Vice
Admiral Sigrid Pared Perez as saying the suspect already had been
deported _ to Spain because held a Spanish passport.
	   Pared Perez, chief of the Dominican Directorate of National
Investigations, said the man was arrested Sunday as he illegally
crossed from Haiti into the southern Dominican border town of
Jimani, according to the newspaper. The border is largely
unpatrolled and scores of people cross illegally every day, but
Dominican authorities have reported tightening up security since
receiving reports of anti-Castro plots.
	   Listin Diario reported that authorities confiscated several
Castro-related documents including his planned itinerary from the
suspect, who was not identified by name.
	   The itinerary had been agreed two days ago, but on Wednesday
Cuban officials changed it, according to another Dominican
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Pared Perez told reporters Wednesday that rumors of
assassination plots were part of a strategy by the anti-Castro
lobby to dissuade the communist leader from visiting.
	   Last week, the U.S. Embassy warned Dominican authorities that
Cuban exiles, presumably based in the United States, were plotting
to plant explosives on airplanes flying between the Dominican
Republic and Cuba. Air Cubana, the national airline, and the
Central American airline Lacsa, fly that route.
	   On Sunday, The Miami Herald reported that Federal Bureau of
Investigation agents had been tipped that Cuban exiles were
planning to kill the Cuban president during his Dominican visit.
	   The visit would follow a triumphant and unprecedented Caribbean
tour that took Castro to Jamaica, Barbados and Grenada, where he
was welcomed by some former enemies. It signaled a new era in
relations between Cuba and the Caribbean, capping 18 months of
rapprochement that took several Caribbean leaders to Havana.
	   Earlier this year, the Dominican Republic and Cuba ended 37
years of chilly relations by establishing diplomatic ties.
	   Castro is scheduled to attend a two-day summit of Caribbean
leaders in Santo Domingo and then spend three days on an official
visit that is supposed to include a visit to at least one
provincial town.

Kenya detains several people and U.S. says two are suspects

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan government has arrested several
people in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi and
U.S. law enforcement sources say two are considered suspects.
	   The arrests were the first in Kenya since Friday's bombing,
which killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000. Police in
Tanzania earlier this week said they detained 14 people in the
almost simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam.
That blast took 10 lives.
	   The hunt for the bombers has intensified, and President Daniel
arap Moi's office announced Wednesday night that ``a number of
persons have been detained ... and are providing useful leads into
the circumstances surrounding the bomb blast.''
	   A U.S. law enforcement source in Washington said the two
suspects in Kenya were from a country other than Kenya, but their
nationalities could not be determined immediately.
	   Some of the suspects in Dar es Salaam, meanwhile, ``may have had
a hand'' in the attack, said Tanzania's ambassador to Washington,
Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi.
	   There have been several unverified claims of responsibility for
the bombings, including one from a previously unknown Islamic
group.
	   At midday Wednesday, a bulldozer removed what could be a vital
piece of evidence: a vehicle plastered against the embassy wall by
the force of the blast and which may have carried the explosives.
	   Along with other mangled vehicles, the blackened, shredded
wreckage was hauled across the street to a parking lot the U.S. FBI
has turned into a crime lab for bomb-blasted wrecks.
	   According to Kenya Television Network, a black pipe was found at
the site, and a source suggested it could have detonator of the car
bomb.
	   U.S. officials say 175 FBI agents and other investigators are in
Kenya and in Tanzania.
	   At an emotional ceremony Wednesday evening before a symbolic
small pyramid of concrete rubble, the rescue officially ended.
Those who spent five days trying to save lives honored the dead.
	   Several wreaths were laid against the concrete pyramid, on which
Bushnell scattered roses. And after the ceremony, U.S. Ambassador
Prudence Bushnell, her lip stitched and hand bandaged from bomb
injuries, walked to the barbed wire coil surrounding the embassy
holding a single rose. She wept, her shoulders shuddering.
	   Perhaps the heaviest death to bear was that of Rose, a woman
whose whispers and pleas from a deep, dark corner of twisted steel
and concrete touched the hearts of millions around the world. She
was last heard on Monday.
	   On Wednesday rescuers shifted peeled away a wall of concrete
that had prevented her rescue and her husband's quiet vigil of hope
at the site ended. Her death was for many rescuers the death of
hope.
	   The commander of the Israeli rescue team, Col. Shalom Ben-Ari,
quoted an old Jewish saying to sum up the feelings of rescuers who
had pulled out some people alive: ``He who saves one soul, saves
the world.''
	   Kenya remains a grief-stricken nation, and the long-term aid
effort to help the victims is just beginning.
	   ``Now is the time for the world to show that it cares for the
victims, and we are talking about thousands of families and family
members all over Kenya who have lost their bread-winners,'' said
Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   ``Who will feed these families? Who will pay the school fees of
their children? Who will look after their elderly?'' she asked.
	   The opposition Safina party, headed by paleontologist Richard
Leakey, called on the U.S. government to meet its ``moral
obligation'' and pay the medical expenses of those injured and pay
for rebuilding.
	   Damage to buildings alone is estimated at dlrs 330 million.

Bank of Japan says employment, consumer sentiment worsening

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details of report &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Employment conditions in Japan are worsening and
consumer confidence _ essential to Japan's economic recovery _ is
deteriorating further, the central bank said Thursday.
	   In another bleak assessment of the economy, the Bank of Japan
said in its monthly report that the ratio of job offers to seekers
has dropped to a historical low, and that incomes are falling as
well.
	   The BOJ also said that downward pressure on prices is
continuing, raising fears of a deflationary spiral. Falling prices
cut into company earnings, hurting income and employment conditions
and dampening consumer confidence further.
	   ``Consumer sentiment seems to be turning cautious again,'' the
BOJ said.
	   The central bank also cast doubt on the effectiveness of the
government's 16 trillion yen (dlrs 112 billion) economic stimulus
package announced in April, which included public works spending
and special income tax cuts.
	   ``Given the current considerably low level of economic
activities, the positive influence of the package on private demand
will likely be limited, and the economy's immediate transition to a
self-sustained recovery is hardly expected,'' the report said.
	   The bank said that declines in corporate and housing investment
have led to ``substantial cutbacks'' in industrial output, but that
inventories have fallen only slightly.
	   Corporate capital investment during the April-June quarter fell
by a large margin after suffering a 5.1 percent drop in the
January-March quarter.
	   On Monday, Japan's Economic Planning Agency downgraded its
assessment for the economy, saying there was no hope in sight for a
recovery in domestic demand and describing economic conditions as
``increasingly severe.''

Puerto Rico's lower legislature approves statehood referendum

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rico's House of
Representatives on Wednesday approved holding a local referendum
aimed at making the Caribbean island the 51st U.S. state.
	   The bill, which passed by a 35-16 vote, goes to Puerto Rico's
Senate Thursday. If it is approved there _ as seems assured _ it is
to be signed into law by pro-statehood Gov. Pedro Rossello on
Friday.
	   According to the plan, Puerto Ricans on Dec. 13 will choose
between statehood, independence, independence with a vaguely
defined ``free association'' with the United States, or continuing
their unusual `commonwealth'' arrangement.
	   The United States, which has controlled Puerto Rico for 100
years, is not bound to honor the decision, however.
	   Under commonwealth, worked out in 1952, Puerto Ricans are U.S.
citizens; they pay no federal taxes but are eligible for federal
aid; they cannot vote for president unless they live on the
mainland; and their sole representative in Congress has no vote.
	   Rossello has forged ahead with his crusade for statehood despite
lackluster public support and a reluctance by the U.S. Congress _
which has jurisdiction over the island _ to go along.
	   In March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed _ by a single
vote _ a bill allowing for a status referendum on the island. But
the bill is being held up in the U.S. Senate.
	   Many question the wisdom of making a U.S. state of a place where
the dominant language is Spanish and the people feel they are a
distinct nation.
	   And polls show Puerto Ricans themselves are about evenly divided
between statehood and commonwealth _ as they were in a 1993
referendum narrowly won by commonwealth _ with a small minority
favoring independence.

News Corp. profits up despite Fox TV New Channel losses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS fourth quarter revenues and earnings in new 4th and 5th
grafs; picks up 4th graf prev, ``News Corp. also ...'' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch's global entertainment
and media company News Corp. said Thursday its net profit jumped to
U.S. dlrs 1 billion (1.68 billion Australian dollars) in the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1998, despite losses at its startup Fox News
Channel.
	   Profits were partly buoyed by the worldwide earnings of the
blockbuster film ``Titanic.''
	   Net profit rose from U.S. dlrs 432 million (720 million
Australian dollars) a year earlier. The higher result was in line
with market expectations.
	   Fourth quarter revenues rose to U.S. dlrs 1.92 billion (3.2
billion Australian dollars) from the same quarter in 1997, when
they were U.S. dlrs 1.65 billion (2.75 billion Australian dollars).
	   Last-quarter earnings increased U.S. dlrs 140 million (233
million Australian dollars), compared with a loss of U.S. dlrs 143
million (238 million Australian dollars) the year before.
	   News Corp. also reported a 32 percent rise in sales to U.S. dlrs
11.3 billion (18.9 billion Australian dollars) and declared a final
dividend of 1.5 Australian cents a share.
	   News Corp. said its total operating income rose 56 percent to
U.S. dlrs 1.59 billion (2.65 billion Australian dollars) from U.S.
dlrs 1.02 billion (1.70 billion Australian dollars).
	   The rise was ``driven by strong double digit earnings gains in
all of the company's major operating segments with U.S. television,
both TV Stations and Fox Broadcasting, Filmed Entertainment, Free
Standing Inserts and HarperCollins all showing sizable increases,''
the company said.
	   The growth also reflects the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar,
it said.
	   News Corp. said growth in core businesses and acquired assets
offset losses from Fox News Channel.
	   Despite losses from the Fox News Channel, News Corp. said total
U.S. operating income climbed 47 percent to U.S. dlrs 774 million
(1.29 billion Australian dollars) from revenue gains of 21 percent.
That reflects growth in core businesses, along with contributions
from assets it has acquired, the company said.
	   The Filmed Entertainment arm, which produces movies, posted an
operating profit of U.S. dlrs 152.4 million (254 million Australian
dollars). This represents a rise of more than 140 percent from a
year earlier and partially reflects the success of the blockbuster
movie ``Titanic,'' which has attracted U.S. dlrs 1.08 billion (1.8
billion Australian dollars) in global box office receipts.
	   U.S. Television operating profits climbed 28 percent, with a
``very strong'' performance at Fox Television Stations and improved
results at the Fox Broadcasting Co.
	   During the year, Fox News Channel expanded its reach to 32
million subscribers from 22 million previously. Committed future
additions will push distribution to at least 40 million homes
within the next three years, News said.
	   Star TV, News Corp.'s Asian satellite television network,
expanded its position in major targeted markets and made progress
towards achieving financial targets. Higher advertising and
subscriber revenues contributed to total revenue growth of 57
percent, the company said.

For outspoken Palestinian minister, quitting's not fading away

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Boxes of books and documents are
piled on the plush-carpeted floor. The tasteful framed artworks _
silkscreens, cave drawings _ have been taken down from the walls,
leaving only neatly drilled holes.
	   Hanan Ashrawi, probably the world's best-known Palestinian
woman, is moving out of her government office. But she's not about
to disappear from public life.
	   Ashrawi, who quit her Palestinian Cabinet post last week in a
high-profile rebuke to Yasser Arafat over corruption, says her
departure leaves her with all the more freedom to speak her mind.
	   That's not something she's ever been shy about anyway.
	   In an interview Wednesday at her office in the Ministry of
Higher Education, which she was preparing to vacate by week's end,
Ashrawi talked frankly of the faltering Mideast peace process, the
male-dominated Palestinian power structure, the rise of what she
sees as a cynical new political culture in the Palestinian lands.
	   ``It's time for us to begin the practice of genuine democracy,''
she said crisply. ``This still hasn't happened.''
	   It's been seven years since this former professor of English
literature stepped onto the world stage as the articulate and
acerbic spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation set up with the
launching of the Mideast peace process.
	   At the time, the Palestinians' popular image overseas was drawn
from decades of guerrilla struggle and street rebellion: snapshots
of menacing masked hijackers, desperate refugees, keffiyeh-clad
youths hurling stones.
	   Ashrawi changed all that. Cosmopolitan and confident, with an
intellectual bearing and a mischievous spark, she put a face and
voice to a much-publicized but little-understood cause.
	   Today, she places the blame for the breakdown of the peace
process squarely on the government of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, but also believes the United States betrayed
the Palestinians by extracting major concessions from them and then
failing to sell the deal to Israel.
	   The Palestinians, however, have undercut their own position with
a lack of accountability in government, she said. Ashrawi quit
Arafat's government a day after he announced a long-delayed
reshuffle of his Cabinet that retained three ministers accused of
financial misconduct and mismanagement.
	   Few Palestinian political figures dare to openly criticize
Arafat, but Ashrawi didn't hesitate. Because of the failure to
crack down on corruption, ``there is a crisis of confidence, a
cloud of suspicion and doubt'' surrounding his leadership, she
said.
	   This isn't the first time Ashrawi has been a thorn in Arafat's
side. After her successful turn as the PLO's spokeswoman, she
formed an independent human rights group that was often sharply
critical of his government.
	   For all her accomplishments, Ashrawi always has been something
of an outsider. She is a Christian in a predominantly Muslim
society, an intellectual among old-line fighters, a woman in a
man's world.
	   Despite that _ or perhaps because of it _ she never has been
afraid to go her own way. She was among the first Palestinians to
seek a dialogue with Israelis at a time when mainstream opinion on
both sides firmly rejected the other side's right to a state.
	   Ashrawi is not universally beloved. She has never tried to
cultivate a common touch; she wouldn't dream of appearing in public
unless immaculately dressed, carefully coifed, elaborately
bejeweled.
	   In the past, her popularity abroad and her accessibility to
Western media created jealousies in the upper echelons of the
Palestinian leadership.
	   A 51-year-old mother of two daughters, married to an
artist-photographer, Ashrawi said stepping back from the day-to-day
responsibilities of running a ministry might give her the chance to
return to projects like a long-abandoned novel.
	   She still holds a seat in the Palestinian legislature, which she
pledged to use as a forum. Her constituency is Jerusalem, whose
disputed status has been a focal point of recent struggles between
Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Her departure leaves Arafat with only one female Cabinet
minister, one to whom he has ties of blood loyalty: Intissar
al-Wazir, widow of Arafat's closest comrade-in-arms, Khalil
al-Wazir, known as Abu Jihad. He was assassinated in 1988.
	   Ashrawi said she regretted her departure meant diminishing the
already tiny pool of Palestinian women in influential government
jobs.
	   ``I don't like tokenism _ I refuse to be used,'' she said. ``But
we need to use the skills of everyone, men and women ... That's
when we will be able to move toward what we want.''

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Kenyan government has arrested several
people in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi and
U.S. law enforcement sources say two are considered suspects.
	   The arrests were the first in Kenya since Friday's bombing,
which killed 247 people and injured more than 5,000. Police in
Tanzania earlier this week said they detained 14 people in the
almost simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam.
That blast took 10 lives.
	   The hunt for the bombers has intensified, and President Daniel
arap Moi's office announced Wednesday night that ``a number of
persons have been detained ... and are providing useful leads into
the circumstances surrounding the bomb blast.''
	   A U.S. law enforcement source in Washington said the two
suspects in Kenya were from a country other than Kenya, but their
nationalities could not be determined immediately.
	   Some of the suspects in Dar es Salaam, meanwhile, ``may have had
a hand'' in the attack, said Tanzania's ambassador to Washington,
Mustafa Salim Nyang'anyi.
	   There have been several unverified claims of responsibility for
the bombings, including one from a previously unknown Islamic
group.
	   At midday Wednesday, a bulldozer removed what could be a vital
piece of evidence: a vehicle plastered against the embassy wall by
the force of the blast and which may have carried the explosives.
	   Along with other mangled vehicles, the blackened, shredded
wreckage was hauled across the street to a parking lot the U.S. FBI
has turned into a crime lab for bomb-blasted wrecks.
	   According to Kenya Television Network, a black pipe was found at
the site, and a source suggested it could have detonator of the car
bomb.
	   U.S. officials say 175 FBI agents and other investigators are in
Kenya and in Tanzania.
	   At an emotional ceremony Wednesday evening before a symbolic
small pyramid of concrete rubble, the rescue officially ended.
Those who spent five days trying to save lives honored the dead.
	   Several wreaths were laid against the concrete pyramid, on which
U.S. Ambassador Prudence Bushnell scattered roses. And after the
ceremony, Bushnell, her lip stitched and hand bandaged from bomb
injuries, walked to the barbed wire coil surrounding the embassy
holding a single rose. She wept, her shoulders shuddering.
	   Perhaps the heaviest death to bear was that of Rose, a woman
whose whispers and pleas from a deep, dark corner of twisted steel
and concrete touched the hearts of millions around the world. She
was last heard on Monday.
	   On Wednesday rescuers shifted peeled away a wall of concrete
that had prevented her rescue and her husband's quiet vigil of hope
at the site ended. Her death was for many rescuers the death of
hope.
	   The commander of the Israeli rescue team, Col. Shalom Ben-Ari,
quoted an old Jewish saying to sum up the feelings of rescuers who
had pulled out some people alive: ``He who saves one soul, saves
the world.''
	   Kenya remains a grief-stricken nation, and the long-term aid
effort to help the victims is just beginning.
	   ``Now is the time for the world to show that it cares for the
victims, and we are talking about thousands of families and family
members all over Kenya who have lost their bread-winners,'' said
Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   ``Who will feed these families? Who will pay the school fees of
their children? Who will look after their elderly?'' she asked.
	   The opposition Safina party, headed by paleontologist Richard
Leakey, called on the U.S. government to meet its ``moral
obligation'' and pay the medical expenses of those injured and pay
for rebuilding.
	   Damage to buildings alone is estimated at dlrs 330 million.

Scientists aiming to recreate extinct zebras

<TEXT>
	   THE KAROO, South Africa (AP) _ Cresting a rise on the bumpy game
park road, the Land-Rover momentarily startles a herd of seven
odd-looking zebras.
	   ``There they are! Wonderful, wonderful!'' exclaimed park ranger
Theresa Huber, cutting the engine so as not to scare off the
skittish creatures munching on grass and leaves in the semi-desert
Karoo National Park.
	   The strange zebras, with only faint stripes on the hind quarters
and a brownish tinge, have not been seen in this vast, arid region
in the middle of South Africa for more than 100 years.
	   Known as quaggas (pronounced KWOK-ka) the animals were hunted to
extinction at the end of the 19th century. The last true quagga, a
scrawny-looking mare, died in a Dutch zoo on Aug. 12, 1883.
	   South African scientists hope to resurrect the quagga by
breeding zebras with similar characteristics in the color and
extent of their striping.
	   In March, 11 animals from the breeding program were released
into the Karoo, where millions once roamed.
	   German-born taxidermist Reinhold Rau came up with the idea to
resurrect the quagga after remounting a stuffed specimen at the
South African Museum in Cape Town.
	   While removing the skin, Rau discovered dried blood and muscle
tissue _ material that preserved DNA, the genetic blueprint for
life.
	   DNA analysis eventually proved that quaggas were a subspecies of
the plains zebra, not a separate species. This meant quagga genes
could still lurk in plains zebras.
	   Using funds raised privately from donations, Rau scoured game
reserves in South Africa and neighboring Namibia for plains zebra
that looked most like quaggas.
	   In 1987, selective breeding began, aiming to concentrate the
quagga genes in successive generations. The program now has 53
animals, and many are starting to look more and more like quaggas.
	   Sitting in a laboratory at the South African Museum, Rau says he
is driven by a desire to put right a terrible wrong.
	   ``The quagga became extinct through man's ignorance and greed.
It wasn't a natural occurrence,'' he said in a clipped German
accent. ``It is our moral duty to rectify that mistake.''
	   On the lab wall is a poster with rows of pictures of the 24
known stuffed quagga specimens. They are graded according to
striping and color.
	   Rau believes some of the animals in the program could now be
compared to examples on the poster. But he shies away from saying
he has created a true quagga.
	   ``We are aiming for the center of the range. We will call
offspring a quagga when they reach the middle of that range (on the
poster),'' he said.
	   The brightest hope is Louis, the scheme's first
second-generation foal. Rau believes full quaggas will emerge by
the fourth generation.
	   Critics say it is impossible to know whether animals produced
are true quaggas, since they were never studied by modern science.
Aside from color and stripes, no other defining quagga
characteristics, such as behavioral patterns or diet, were ever
noted and may have been lost to history.
	   Scientists involved in the scheme accept the point, but argue
that _ with no living specimens to examine _ it is futile to worry
about questions that can't be answered.
	   ``It is almost irrelevant,'' said Professor Eric Harley, a
geneticist at the University of Cape Town who works on the project.
	   ``If we get an individual that matches (coloration and
striping), then we can say it is a quagga, because that is the only
way we can now define them.''
	   Scientists are divided about why the quagga developed its
unusual coat.
	   Many believe the quagga evolved camouflage to match the dusty,
sun-burned plains and mountains of the Karoo and avoid predators
who would easily spot a black and white animal.
	   Others believe zebra stripes help avoid the disease-carrying
tsetse fly, which cannot see objects broken up by patterns. The
Karoo is too dry for the tsetse fly and so the quagga may simply
have begun to shed stripes.
	   The quagga was shaped by its desolate, but beautiful Karoo
environment. Rau says putting animals from the program back into
their natural home was an important step.
	   ``For the first time quaggas in the making are treading that
ground again,'' he said.

	   LITTLE ROCK, Arkansas (AP) _ In a faraway village, children
carry special lamps on their heads to fields of castor, groundnut,
cotton and millet. They use the lamps to attract moths that grew
from redheaded hairy caterpillars, which are devastating the
village crops.
	   The moths hit the solar-powered lamps, fall into a
kerosene-water mix and die. The children of Mandonigudam in
southern India sing as they stroll into the fields to set out the
lamps. They sing of how they are saving the crops.
	   In Costa Rica, villagers in Horquetas celebrate the coming of
electricity with a dance _ complete with lights and recorded music.
The electricity comes from a biomass system, fueled by wood
residues.
	   John Kadyszewski, an engineer with Arkansas-based Winrock
International, can tell many stories like these. He wonders why
electric companies haven't tapped into this market of 2 billion
people who are without power when alternative technology, like the
lanterns, is both profitable and feasible.
	   ``This would be a viable operation for them once they become
aware of this market,'' he says. Rural residents want electricity
and are willing to pay for it, he says.
	   Kadyszewski has studied the effects of new technology on
communities for some 20 years. For the last 10, he has researched
and done field work specifically on bringing electricity to
developing countries through nontraditional technology _
solar-powered and geothermal systems, micro-turbines powered by
stream water, wind-powered turbines, and small biomass systems that
run off wood, animal and crop wastes.
	   Instead of taking electricity by wire from power plants to
customers, companies can save the expense of setting up traditional
power grids and use smaller systems in remote rural areas,
Kadyszewski says.
	   ``Thousands and thousands of minipower stations serving units as
small as a single family that draw electricity from a wide variety
of renewable, non-polluting power sources can be set up around the
world,'' he says.
	   Idaho Power Co. of Boise is one utility venturing into this
area. Dennis Lopez, a company spokesman, says the 2 billion people
without power are spending about a third of their income already
for make-do substitutes like candles, kerosene and dry-cell
batteries.
	   ``It's an incredible market, if you look at it strictly from a
business standpoint,'' Lopez says.
	   Idaho Power's subsidiary, Applied Power Corporation in Lacey,
Washington, has provided a solar-powered system to communities in
the Sahara. Last year it won a contract to provide solar panels to
a village in Brazil.
	   Idaho Power looked at the prospect of putting solar-energy
systems on the 32,000 islands of Indonesia before that country fell
on hard times. It now is looking at other prospects in South
America, Lopez says.
	   Winrock International was formed in 1985 with the merger of
three agricultural development and research organizations. The
oldest of the three was John D. Rockefeller's Agricultural
Development Council, which he formed in 1953.
	   Winrock works with governments and private businesses worldwide
to bring economic development to rural areas. It has an annual
operating budget of about dlrs 35 million and is funded by public
and private money.
	   The nonprofit organization sits atop Petit Jean Mountain in
central Arkansas on 250 acres (100 hectares) which once were part
of the cattle ranch of the late Arkansas Gov. Winthrop Rockefeller,
a son of industrialist John D. Rockefeller.
	   Kadyszewski says Winrock tries to remove obstacles left over
from traditional ways of doing business. For instance, governments
can remove duties on alternative technology or give utility
companies wanting to service off-grid rural residents a tax break.
	   ``It can go from being wildly profitable to a loser if the
government changes one policy,'' he says.
	   But once a system is in place, it boosts a community's standard
of living. Eventually, residents have more income and can even be
considered candidates for on-grid systems since they can better
afford the cost of the more expensive technology.
	   In Indonesia, a typical family of onion farmers devotes 16 hours
a day carrying water by hand to irrigate their fields. That's more
than 1,000 hours of labor spent to irrigate a single crop in a
season, Kadyszewski says. Small wind-power systems to operate water
pumps reduce that time to 100 hours.
	   Kadyszewski recalls that, with the new system, one Indonesian
father was then able to send his older son to school because he
didn't need him to carry water all day.

	   Calling the security inadequate, Ambassador Prudence Bushnell
had several times requested a new embassy in Nairobi, Assistant

	   Kennedy said State Department officials shared her concern but
that ``unfortunately we lacked the money to respond.''

the site, and a source suggested it could have detonated the car
bomb.
	   U.S. officials say 175 FBI agents and other investigators are in
Kenya and in Tanzania.
	   At an emotional ceremony Wednesday evening before a symbolic
small pyramid of concrete rubble, the rescue officially ended.
Those who spent five days trying to save lives honored the dead.
	   Several wreaths were laid against the concrete pyramid, on which
Bushnell scattered roses. And after the ceremony, Bushnell, her lip
stitched and hand bandaged from bomb injuries, walked to the barbed
wire coil surrounding the embassy holding a single rose. She wept,
her shoulders shuddering.
	   Perhaps the heaviest death to bear was that of Rose Wanjiku
Irungu, a woman whose whispers and pleas from a deep, dark corner
of twisted steel and concrete touched the hearts of millions around
the world. She was last heard on Monday.
	   On Wednesday rescuers shifted peeled away a wall of concrete
that had prevented her rescue and her husband's quiet vigil of hope
at the site ended. Her death was for many rescuers the death of
hope.
	   The commander of the Israeli rescue team, Col. Shalom Ben-Ari,
quoted an old Jewish saying to sum up the feelings of rescuers who
had pulled out some people alive: ``He who saves one soul, saves
the world.''
	   Kenya remains a grief-stricken nation, and the long-term aid
effort to help the victims is just beginning.
	   ``Now is the time for the world to show that it cares for the
victims, and we are talking about thousands of families and family
members all over Kenya who have lost their bread-winners,'' said
Red Cross spokeswoman Nina Galbe.
	   ``Who will feed these families? Who will pay the school fees of
their children? Who will look after their elderly?'' she asked.
	   The opposition Safina party, headed by paleontologist Richard
Leakey, called on the U.S. government to meet its ``moral
obligation'' and pay the medical expenses of those injured and pay
for rebuilding.
	   Damage to buildings alone is estimated at dlrs 330 million.

Born addicted to hard drugs, babies get special care at Kent

	   KENT, Washington (AP) _ For tiny Anastasia, babyhood has been
hell.
	   But at this moment, in a quiet, dimly lit room, the infant with
big brown eyes and a mop of black hair may be experiencing a little
bit of heaven.
	   Born addicted to the cocaine that held her mother in thrall, the
5-week-old baby is being cradled and fed by Kristine Weisz, an aide
at the Pediatric Interim Care Center housed in a one-story red
brick building in this south Seattle suburb.
	   Ms. Weisz knows just what to do to ease Anastasia's frightful
trembling, headaches and stomach cramps _ all symptoms of cocaine
withdrawal.
	   She keeps the baby tightly swaddled in a blanket to reduce the
trembling, with her legs bent forward to quiet the stomach cramps.
There are no bright lights or loud noises to jangle Anastasia's
fragile nerves.
	   There are no coos, no smooches, no bounces on the knee for this
baby. That will come later, much later _ after she is returned to
her mother or placed in foster care, as about half the center's
babies are.
	   Even simple affection can be physically and mentally painful to
a tiny recovering addict.
	   ``Sometimes you can't even look at these babies when you feed
them,'' Ms. Weisz says. ``It's too stimulating.''
	   Cocaine-addicted babies often refuse to eat, though their bodies
crave nourishment. So Ms. Weisz patiently coaxes Anastasia to suck
on her bottle, knowing that if she doesn't eat now, she will not
thrive later on.
	   Heroin-addicted babies pose the opposite problem. Ravenously
hungry, they will eat too much if allowed. The work lies in
conforting them between feedings.
	   Anastasia is one of a dozen newborns at the care center, each
born with a raging addiction passed on in the womb.
	   Some come into the world hooked on heroin, some on cocaine, some
on methamphetamine. Some are born addicted to more than one drug,
and some also have been damaged by alcohol. The different drugs
demand different treatments. When the mother has combined drugs,
treatment becomes especially tricky.
	   This center, the only one of its kind in this northwestern
American state, has treated about 800 drug-addicted infants since
its founding in 1990. Legislative researchers estimate there are
between 7,500 and 10,000 such infants born in the state each year.
	   ``What we're doing here represents a drop in the bucket,'' says
the center's director, Barbara Drennen.
	   There is a crying need for more care centers and for changes in
the law to ensure that drug-addicted newborns are identified so
they can receive proper care, she added.
	   Chicago has a similar operation, the Maryville Center, said Dr.
Ira J. Chasnoff, an expert there on drug-addicted babies. There
aren't many such facilities, he said: ``We need more of them.''
	   ``People say these are throwaway babies, that there's nothing we
can do for them,'' Drennen said.
	   ``That's just wrong. We can treat them and we can do something
for them. These are not throwaway babies.''
	   She and her colleague, Barbara Richards, started the facility
with operating funds from the legislature and help from then-Gov.
Booth Gardner. The center, with a budget of about dlrs 600,000 a
year, relies on the state for funding, along with private and
corporate donations.
	   The parents of most of its tiny patients come from middle-class
backgrounds, Ms. Richards says.
	   ``You've heard it before, but the truth is we pay now or pay
later,'' Drennen said.
	   ``If we let it happen, these are children who are going to be a
huge burden on society for their entire lives. These are the
children who are going to fill up our prisons.''
	   Sharing a room with Anastasia are month-old Jessica, and
3-week-old Allen, both born to cocaine-using mothers. Tightly
swaddled and just fed, Allen hardly stirs. Jessica has just had her
bath, which is always painful for these babies because of the
stimulation. She is wailing as she waits to be fed by Erin
Thompson.
	   This is Ms. Thompson's first day on staff after two years as a
volunteer. ``I'm here because I've fallen in love with the
babies,'' she says.
	   The two Barbaras tiptoe into the ``darkroom,'' where new
arrivals are brought. In the dim light, a 2-week-old baby boy lies
swaddled _ a victim not only of his mother's drug use but of
physical abuse.
	   Down the hall, gently rocked by an aide, is Qymani _ his
mother's second drug-affected baby to be treated here, Ms. Richards
noted.
	   ``This is common,'' she said. In 1996, the last time the center
gathered statistics on its patients, about 75 percent of the babies
had at least one older sibling who was treated here as well.
	   Moving to another room, Ms. Drennen gently picks up 2-week-old
Kristen, whose mother was addicted to methamphetamine. The baby has
no muscle control and lies like a limp rag in her arms. This
classic symptom of infant meth addiction makes her hard to feed,
though she is emaciated and desperately needs nutrition.
	   Meth babies ``have a blank, flat effect, almost as if they're
not there,'' Ms. Richards said.
	   And their parents are especially difficult, she added _
``violent, aggressive, paranoid.''
	   The staff tries to get parents involved and also trains foster
parents, with mixed results.
	   ``A lot of these babies come back to us because either the
families or the foster parents can't handle it,'' Ms. Drennen said.

Study: Doctors ignore guidelines on euthanasia, suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Doctors who help patients end their lives
frequently fail to consult with other physicians and sometimes
don't even involve the patient in the decision, a new study found.
	   The study, published in Wednesday's edition of The Journal of
the American Medical Association, reported that of 355 cancer
specialists surveyed, only 10.7 percent reported a case of either
euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.
	   Euthanasia _ where a doctor ends a patient's life _ is illegal;
Oregon is the only state that allows physician-assisted suicide.
	   Supporters of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide have
proposed three primary safeguards for terminally ill patients: The
patient must initiate and repeat the request; the patient must be
evaluated by another physician; and the patient must be in extreme
physical pain.
	   Slightly more than a third of the doctors who reported a case
said they adhered to all three guidelines. But in 15.3 percent of
the cases, the patients were never involved in the decision, a
finding Rita Marker, executive director of the International
Anti-Euthanasia Task Force, called ``obscene.''
	   In those cases, the families had asked to end the patients'
lives, which the authors of the study characterized as ``most
worrisome.''
	   More than 60 percent of doctors who had a case said they did not
consult with another physician, the report said.
	   The report also found that in nearly every instance _ 97.4
percent _ the patients were in unremitting pain or unable to care
for themselves.
	   ``Oncologists often look at someone in severe pain and say
'There's nothing more I can do' when in fact if that doctor cannot
do anything, he or she should find one who can,'' Marker said.
	   The study found several doctors who did not actually administer
a lethal dose of medication but left instructions for their nurses
to do so.
	   Brian Clarridge, one of the author's of the report, said it was
difficult to pin down the actual prevalence of euthanasia and
physician-assisted suicide. But he said the number of actual cases
is ``probably not high.''

 &UR; Recent catches in Lake Superior confirm fears of round goby
invasion
	   DULUTH, Minnesota (AP) _ Scientists fear recent catches of round
gobies in a Lake Superior harbor signal an invasion of the
aggressive, foreign fish.
	   In recent weeks, two youths, have caught more than 100 of the
European fish _ the largest count in the western Great Lakes so
far.
	   It follows a report in July by researchers who found nine gobies
in the Duluth-Superior harbor, and other reports of the fish by
anglers.
	   That could mean the fish aren't just coming in the ballast of
freighters from other ports, but are reproducing in the harbor.
	   ``It's indicative of a major infestation in the Duluth-Superior
Harbor,'' said Doug Jensen, exotic species coordinator for
Minnesota Sea Grant at the University of Minnesota-Duluth.
	   Gobies reproduce younger and faster than native species,
allowing them to overwhelm an ecosystem in a matter of years.

 &UR; Gradual decline of heart failure deaths in U.S.
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Heart failure deaths among older Americans,
especially among blacks, have been declining since 1988, according
to a study released this month by the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
	   In 1988, heart failure killed 117 per 100,000 people age 65 or
older. In 1995, the last year for which statistics are available,
heart failure killed 108 per 100,000 people over 65.
	   Since 1988, the rate of death from heart failure fell 3 percent
for black men and 2 percent for black women. Deaths among white men
fell nearly 2 percent and 0.5 percent for white women.
	   The rates had been rising through the 1980s. The 1988 rates
represented a 31 percent increase over the 1980 figures, 89 of
every 100,000.
	   CDC epidemiologist Jan Croft said she did not know why the rate
rose between 1980 and 1988.
	   About 5 million Americans have heart failure, 70 percent of whom
are at least 60 years old. It's the No. 1 reason older adults are
hospitalized.
	   Experts credited drugs introduced in the late '80s, called
angiotensin-converting enzyme _ or ACE _ inhibitors, in part for
the decline between 1988 and 1995. They also credited improved
tracking by doctors of high-risk individuals and early intervention
after heart attacks.
	   The CDC report said the sharper decline among blacks seen in the
1995 figures may be because of better access to medical care and
improved control of high blood pressure, the primary cause of heart
failure among black adults.
	   Heart failure is caused by the heart becoming too weak to pump
enough blood through the body, most often when high blood pressure
weakens the entire heart muscle or heart attacks weaken sections of
it.
	   There is no cure _ just drugs to help a damaged heart limp
along.
	   Dr. David A. Meyerson, a cardiologist and spokesman for the
American Heart Association, said people are still having heart
problems, but they are surviving longer.
	   ``We are on the right track _ we have more strategies than ever
before to help people live better, more active and productive lives
with congestive heart failure,'' he said.

	   VLORA, Albania (AP) _ Starring glumly at the dinghies lined up
at seaside, the young Kosovo Albanian refugee sighed as he
contemplated another risky flight to unknown territory, another
attempt to find a new home.
	   More than 30 other refugees from the war-torn Serbian province
were waiting with him to try a nighttime dash across the Adriatic
Sea to Italy, then perhaps onward to relatives in Germany or
Switzerland.
	   ``We were refugees,'' said 34-year-old Jakup Gashi, standing
next to his 5-year-old son in this northwestern Albanian coastal
town. ``Now we are becoming illegal.''
	   For the more than 13,000 ethnic Albanians who fled the fighting
in Kosovo and crossed the mountains into Albania this year,
Europe's poorest country has proven a difficult refuge.
	   About 6,000 remain in the town of Bajram Curri near the Kosovo
border, with others staying with families in nearby Tropoja. But
with a steady influx of refugees continuing and Albania's resources
stretched to the breaking point, refugees are increasingly being
encouraged to move on, some even evicted.
	   ``That's the only choice we can make,'' Gashi said of moving on.
``Albania is a poor country. It can't offer us anything. Is better
to ask the help of our friends in other countries.''
	   According to the smugglers who organize and accompany the
refugees to Italy, more than 2,000 Kosovo refugees have crossed the
Adriatic and hundreds of others are ready to pay the dlrs 260-270
for the crossing.
	   Twenty to 25 dinghies leave Vlora every night, many carrying
Kosovars or Turks. But not all make it _ Italian boat patrols have
intercepted and turned back dozens of boats carrying more than
1,500 refugees in the past month.
	   Authorities turn a blind eye to the clandestine traffic leaving
Vlora, where people have become used to the refugees and the sight
of mothers grasping a child's hand in one hand and a small bag in
the other.
	   ``Albania does not have the conditions to guarantee a good life
for them,'' said Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga. ``They
have no house, no work.''
	   The situation also is troubled for roughly 35,000 other Kosovo
refugees who have flooded Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes
up Yugoslavia. Already Montenegro is struggling to cope with some
30,000 Bosnian refugees who left during the 1992-95 war there and
are still unable to return to their homes.
	   Humanitarian organizations and the Albanian government are still
sending food and medical supplies for the refugees in Bajram Curri.
But many are moving on to cities elsewhere in Albania after being
packed 15 or 20 to a small house.
	   ``I hated to leave that house in Tropoja, the family was very
kind to us,'' said Fate Ahmeti, 28. ``But we were a lot of
Kosovars. And the food was not sufficient.''
	   Her husband, who's still in Kosovo fighting for the secessionist
Kosovo Liberation Army, sent her money to take her and their two
children to Italy.
	   Meanwhile, ordinary Albanians sympathize with their brethren's
cause, but most are preoccupied with their own difficult lives and
some are tired of hearing about the Kosovars.
	   ``It's difficult to live here, even for us,'' said Mithat
Domnori, a Tirana ice-cream vendor. ``Leaving from Vlora to join
their relatives is a good idea.''
	   The government, while it supports the ethnic Albanians, would
like them to stay in the north so it will be easier for them to
ultimately leave the country and return home.
	   ``The government has created favorable conditions for the people
who left their homes in Kosovo,'' said Mentor Nazarko, political
adviser to President Rexhep Meidani. ``It is doing all it can.''

Maligned computer diskette still popular
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID E. KALISH &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ When the computer industry talks about killing
the floppy, personal computer users like George Velez get upset.
	   ``I'd be handicapped,'' says the ticket-office manager at Circle
Line Cruises, who uses the 3.5-inch (9-cms) disks for storing memos
and letters and transferring the documents from work to home.
	   Computer makers' hopes to phase out the timeworn diskette are
running head-on into folks like Velez.
	   Never mind the 1.44-megabyte medium is too puny to store many
new computer games and bulky data files. And external storage
devices such as Iomega's Zip drive sport many times the capacity.
	   In the latest insult, the medium gets the boot this weekend when
Apple starts selling its bold vision of computing's future _ the
iMac, a futuristic-looking Macintosh that lacks a floppy drive.
	   Despite a growing push to phase out the computer staple, most
users still swear by the inexpensive, convenient method for storing
and exchanging files with friends and co-workers. Emerging
alternatives, such as recordable CD-ROMs, are still too expensive
for most consumers.
	   About 2.3 billion diskettes were sold worldwide last year,
according to Magnetic Media Information Services, a Tokyo-based
research firm. The number will drop to well under 2 billion this
year. But experts say it's a slow fade for floppies.
	   Even as new machines sport drives for running high-capacity
digital video disks _ sort of souped-up CD-ROMs that hold the
equivalent of several full-length movies _ PCs continue to include
built-in floppy drives.
	   The more gradual approach clashes with Apple's radical shift in
the Macintosh it starts selling on Saturday.
	   Apple, arguing that the 3.5-inch (9-cms) floppy is a dying
medium, says most iMac buyers will add external drives or transfer
files via e-mail.
	   Others said the snub to floppies may make it tough for Apple
boss Steve Jobs to reach beyond its main customers _ graphics and
publishing professionals _ to those who mainly do simple word
processing. An add-on drive could add dlrs 90 to the cost of the
dlrs 1,300 machine.
	   ``We can say Mr. Jobs is not up to speed on users' convenience
when it comes to storage,'' said James Porter, president of
Disk/Trend Inc., a market research firm based in Mountain View,
California, specializing in the disk-drive industry.
	   It won't be the first time Jobs has shown a daring attitude
toward storage. The original Macintosh computer he introduced
didn't include a hard disk drive. It later was added.

MetroStars down Crew 3-1

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Jim Rooney scored the
tiebreaking goal on a header in the 75th minute as the New York-New
Jersey MetroStars beat the Columbus Crew 3-1 on Wednesday night.
	   The victory enabled the MetroStars, 4-1 in their last five games
to improve to 13-10, to hold onto second place in the Major League
Soccer's Eastern Conference with 35 points.
	   Columbus (10-12), which could have taken over second place with
a victory in regulation time, is third with 30 points.
	   Rooney scored the winning goal when he nodded in Eduardo
Hurtado's cross from the right side of the box. Rooney's header,
his eighth goal of the season, went under goalkeeper Juergen
Sommer's hand.
	   After missing on several good chances in the early moments of
the second half, the MetroStars opened the scoring in the 58th
minute on Marcelo Vega's first goal of the season.
	   Vega took a pass from Rooney at the left side of the box, eluded
two defenders and ripped a shot that clipped off the far post and
into the net.
	   Columbus' Jeff Cunningham tied it in 69th minute, just four
minutes after entering the game as a substitute.
	   Cunningham took a looping pass from Andy Williams in the box and
volleyed it over goalkeeper Tony Meola's head.
	   Miles Joseph made it 3-1 in the 88th minute.

Sampras on track to reclaim top ranking

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Pete Sampras' plans for his 27th birthday
were as low-key as his 6-4, 6-2 victory on Wednesday over Martin
Damm of the Czech Republic.
	   After Sampras debuted in the second round of the dlrs 2.45
million ATP Championship, he planned some dinner, ``maybe a little
dessert to treat myself,'' then prepare for his next match.
	   ``It was a good start. I felt pretty strong out there,'' Sampras
said.
	   He broke Damm's serve only once in the first set, but that is
usually enough for Sampras. Getting two breaks in the second was
overkill.
	   ``He played well, he was holding his own in the first set,''
Sampras said.
	   Damm said his serve faltered slightly in the second set.
	   ``Against players like Pete, you have to go for it almost 100
percent. If you don't, you don't have a chance,'' Damm said.
	   Successfully defending his title here would assure Sampras of
returning to the No. 1 ranking next week. He could regain it just
by making the finals, if the match contained enough bonus points
for the ATP formula.
	   Certainly the reign of Marcelo Rios of Chile, who assumed the
top ranking on Monday, appeared doomed. He lost his first match in
straight sets Tuesday night.
	   The tournament lost four more seeds Wednesday, leaving just six
of the original 16.
	   Richard Krajicek of Netherlands, the No. 8 seed, beat Andrei
Medvedev of Ukraine 6-3, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3. But 11th-seeded Andre
Agassi was eliminated by Vince Spadea 6-2, 0-6, 7-6 (7-2).
	   Agassi seemed to have the match in his pocket after breaking
Spadea's service in the ninth game of the final set. All he had to
do was hold serve.
	   ``I just didn't put the match away,'' Agassi said. ``I missed an
easy forehand, then a backhand ... and he played solid from
there.''
	   Spadea, who has never broken into the top 50 in the world
rankings, said the victory over a player with Agassi's reputation
was the kind that ``gets you over the edge.''
	   ``He's playing some of his best tennis. But I knew I had some
good tennis in me,'' Spadea said. ``It's a big thrill to beat a
player like that.''
	   Jerome Golmard of France ousted the French Open champion,
fourth-seeded Carlos Moya of Spain, 6-4, 6-2; Tommy Haas of Germany
beat 12th-seeded Albert Costa of Spain 6-1, 6-3; and Scott Draper
of Australia defeated ninth-seeded Alex Corretja of Spain 6-3, 6-7
(5-7), 7-6 (7-5).
	   Moya said he knew he was in big trouble when he couldn't hold
serve early in the second set.
	   ``After that, I was a little bit down and I knew I was not going
to win that match,'' Moya said.
	   ``He played better than me. I didn't have a good day, and I just
congratulate him.''
	   In other matches, Todd Martin defeated Thomas Muster of Austria
6-3, 6-4; third-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic beat Marcos
Ondruska of South Africa 6-2, 6-3; Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands
downed Wayne Ferreira of South Africa 7-6 (7-5), 6-4; and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia beat Michael Chang 6-3, 4-6, 6-4.
	   Also, fifth-seeded Patrick Rafter of Australia beat Guillaume
Raoux of France 6-1, 6-3; Thomas Johansson of Sweden defeated Jeff
Tarango 5-7, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4); and 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of
Croati beat Mark Philippoussis of Australia, 6-3, 6-2.

Daring plan: Government pins re-election hopes to new taxes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with reaction and details after formal release of
plan at 0600 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on
Thursday launches a plan to overhaul Australia's tax system, in the
process setting the framework for his government's strategy for
looming national elections.
	   The plan has as its centerpiece a broad-based 10 percent
consumption tax, which was overwhelmingly rejected in 1993 by
Australian voters who shunned the campaign of Howard's conservative
predecessors.
	   To sweeten the new tax deal, it is expected to also include
personal income tax cuts and streamlined social security payments.
	   Most European governments have had similar taxes since the
1970s, and neighboring New Zealand introduced one in 1986.
	   Public reaction to the package is considered crucial because of
the timing of national elections, which Howard can call at any time
but which must be held by May next year.
	   Many political analysts expect elections in October, following a
government funded U.S. dlrs 6 million (10 million Australian
dollars) TV ad campaign to promote the new tax package.
	   The opposition Labor Party has called that promotion a
taxpayer-funded political boondoggle for Howard's re-election
campaign.
	   ``It is above all a great investment of faith and hope in the
future of our country,'' Howard told reporters as he arrived at
Parliament House.
	   The government's goal was to give Australia a stronger, more
secure, more optimistic move into the 21st century, he said.
	   ``This is generational tax reform,'' Howard said.
	   Howard and other tax proponents say it makes tax cheating and
avoidance impossible, minimizes tax distortions on a wide range of
goods, and lifts the tax burden on exports.
	   But skeptics say it will be inflationary, boosting all prices 10
percent; is unfair to the poor, who have less discretionary income
than the rich; and that pensioners and others on fixed incomes will
see little benefit from tax cuts.
	   A recent poll found some 85 percent of voters surveyed feared
future governments might increase the consumption tax above the
introductory 10 percent to raise more revenues.
	   Howard's government, which saw its popularity slump to a 2
1/2-year low two months ago at 34 percent, 11 points behind Labor,
has rebounded.
	   A new Newspoll published earlier this week showed Howard's
conservative coalition has risen to tie the Labor Party in
popularity at 39 percent each, with the right-ring populist One
Nation party polling 11 percent.
	   The rebound in the polls for Howard's party is another sign he
will choose an early election date, in October, rather than wait.
	   One thing all pollsters, pundits and analysts agree on is that
the re-election of Howard's government depends on widespread public
acceptance of the new consumption tax.
	   That is a risky strategy. In 1993, conservative leader John
Hewson lost the supposedly ``unloseable'' election after the highly
unpopular Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating picked holes in his tax
reform plan, also based on a consumption tax, and raised voters'
fears about it.
	   That defeat so crushed the conservatives that Howard said in May
1995, ``There's no way that a goods-and-services tax will ever be
part of our policy. Never, never. It's dead. It was killed off by
those voters at the last election.''
	   But Howard subsequently said his remarks meant the tax would
never be party policy unless voters approved it at an election, and
resurrected the idea last year.

Seles sweeps past Paulus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANHATTAN BEACH, California (AP) _ Defending champion Monica
Seles, ailing back and all, beat Barbara Paulus of Austria 6-1, 6-2
on Wednesday in the second round ofthe Acura Classic women's tennis
tournament.
	   Seles lost only eight points on her serve throughout the match.
	   ``My back is a lot better,'' she said. ``The heat today helped.
I played solid tennis. With Barbara, it's hard to know what she'll
do because she hits heavy topspin from either side of the court.''
	   Seles received treatment after the tournament at La Costa last
week where she lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Lindsay
Davenport.
	   Third-seed French Open champion Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain
pulled out a 4-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory over tenacious Ai Sugiyama of
Japan. The 2 1/2-hour match was decided on the final point when
Sugiyama, serving to get even at 5-5, netted a backhand at 30-40.
In the final tally, Sanchez-Vicario won only two more points than
Sugiyama.
	   Fifth seed Nathalie Tauziat of France defeated countrywoman and
doubles partner Alexandra Fusai 6-3, 6-3.
	   ``I had my chances in the first set and I guess I lost my
concentration,'' Sanchez Vicario said. ``There were some close
games, but I played well at the end and that's all that matters.''
	   First-round play was completed as Elena Tartarkova of the
Ukraine beat Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia 4-6, 6-3, 6-3. Tartarkova
replaced Mary Pierce, who withdrew because of a strained groin
muscle before last Sunday's final at La Costa.

Ruiz leads men's platform, Sorgi leads women's 3-meter springboard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ Puerto Rican native Mark Ruiz, a 19-year-old
resident of Orlando, Florida, took the lead in the men's platform
competition in the U.S. National Diving Championships Wednesday
night.
	   Ruiz, who turned down scholarship offers from Southern Cal,
Tennessee and Texas in order to train for the 2000 Olympics in
Sydney, Australia, took the lead on his final dive of the
quarterfinals at the Georgia Tech Aquatic Center. He led throughout
the four-dive semifinals and finished with 600.81 points.
	   The men's platform finals will be held Sunday afternoon.
	   Ruiz's last effort of the quarterfinals, a back dive with 1 1/2
somersaults and 3 1/2 twists, earned 76.8 points. His best effort
in the semis was his final dive, a forward 1 1/2 somersault with
one twist that was awarded 49.77 points.
	   ``I'm just looking at it as a warm-up,'' said Ruiz, who moved to
the United States at age 13. ``The finals are going to be a really
good contest.''
	   David Pichler, who finished sixth in the platform in the 1996
Olympics, finished third in the semis with 575.82 points. The Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, resident moved into first after his fifth
effort of the quarterfinals, a back tuck dive with 3 1/2
somersaults.
	   After wresting the lead from Kevin McMahon, Pichler, a
29-year-old interior landscaper, fell to third entering the semis
when he scored a 63.24 on his next dive, a reverse tuck with 3 1/2
somersaults.
	   ``I've been taking it easy, not competing much in '98,'' Pichler
said. ``My back and shoulder have been giving me some problems, but
I know it's all in the number of dives I make (in practice). I'm
ready to make another run for the Olympics.''
	   McMahon, 25, goes into the finals in second place with 597.12
points, a total he said was a personal best.
	   ``I tried a new approach,'' the Los Angeles resident said. ``I
sat in the hotel before I came over and tried to figure what I
needed to average (in the quarterfinals and semifinals). I wanted
to get around 600 points.''
	   In the women's 3-meter springboard semifinals Wednesday
afternoon, 16-year-old Erica Sorgi took a 1.23-point lead over
University of Texas sophomore Laura Wilkinson.
	   The women's 3-meter final will be held Saturday.
	   Sorgi is seeking her first gold medal in a major 3-meter
springboard competition since taking first in the world
championship team trials last year in Athens, Georgia. She took
second earlier this year in the Cinergy-PSI Championships at
Indianapolis and was fifth in the Goodwill Games last month at New
York.
	   Wilkinson, the platform gold medalist in the Goodwill Games and
last year's NCAA Championships, finished third in her only other
national 3-meter competition this year, at Indianapolis. She was
eighth in the Goodwill Games.
	   Other than trying to qualify for the World Diving Cup in January
at Wellington, New Zealand, Wilkinson said she is taking this event
in stride.
	   ``I don't really feel a lot of pressure,'' she said. ``My dives
were all pretty much the same _ nothing special. I just landed on
my head.''

Leon 1, Firpo 1; Leon advances on penalties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Angel David Comizzo stopped three of five
penalty kicks to give Leon of Mexico a 3-2 tiebreaker victory over
Firpo of El Salvador Wednesday night in the quarterfinals of the
CONCACAF Champions Cup.
	   Firpo forward Nidelson de Mello tied the game at 1-1 in the 79th
minute, but Comizzo made diving saves on Celio Rodriguez, Wilfredo
Iraheta Sanabria and Pedro Vasquez in the penalty kick tiebreaker.
	   Leon, playing the entire second half down a man, scored its goal
on Sigifredo Mercado's penalty kick in the 27th minute.
	   Mercado shot wide left in the first round of the tiebreaker, but
the next three Leon shooters _ Alberto Garcia, Roberto Medina and
Sergio Martinez _ all scored.
	   There were eight cautions issued in a physical first half,
including a red card ejection to Leon defender Edgardo Fabian
Pratola.
	   The annual CONCACAF Champions Cup features the top teams from
last season in the top leagues of North and Central America and the
Caribbean.
	   Leon, the 1997-98 Mexican League runner-up, will face D.C.
United, the Major League Soccer champion in 1996 and '97, in a
semifinal Friday.
	   Costa Rican referee Olger Mejia was busy handing out cards in
Wednesday's quarterfinal. There were six yellow cards issued during
an 18-minute first-half stretch.
	   The penalty kick came after Firpo defender Mauricio Dos Santos
tackled Jesus Mendoza in the penalty area.
	   Pratola was ejected after colliding with de Mello in the 46th
minute.
	   Wednesday's second game featured a quarterfinal between
Deportivo Alajuelense of Costa Rica and Toluca of Mexico.

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stock prices rebound
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stocks, late morning bond and currency
prices; ADDS quotes from finance official, stock trader in 5th-6th
grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early
Thursday, lifted by renewed concern about the Russian currency.
Tokyo stock prices posted a slight rebound.
	   The dollar bought 146.37 yen in late morning trading, up 0.45
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but below its late New York rate
of 146.44 yen overnight.
	   The U.S. currency's strength against the yen came after it
gained ground overnight against the German mark in New York trading
amid concern about a possible devaluation of the Russian ruble.
	   The dollar's advance in Tokyo was capped, however, by a remark
from the Japanese Finance Ministry's vice minister for
international affairs, Eisuke Sakakibara, who hinted Japan would
intervene to prop up the yen, traders said.
	   ``August and September are a turning point for the Japanese
economy,'' Sakakibara told a small group of reporters early
Thursday. ``We are waiting for an opportunity for (yen) supportive
intervention.''
	   ``The dollar's upside is limited because of those comments,''
said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of foreign exchange at ABN
AMRO Bank in Tokyo.
	   Some traders dismissed the impact of any intervention, however,
noting the slight prospects for a rapid recovery in Japanese
economic fundamentals.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange share prices rose moderately on
improved sentiment stemming from gains on Wall Street Wednesday and
relative stability overnight in the yen's movement against the
dollar, traders said.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,552.96 points on
Wednesday, up 90.11.
	   In Tokyo, the benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose a
modest 44.26 points, or 0.29 percent, to 15,423.23 as of midday. On
Wednesday, the average closed down 28.02 points, or 0.18 percent.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 2.91 points, or 0.25 percent, to 1,182.91. The
TOPIX closed down 6.88 points, or 0.58 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.190 percent compared with Wednesday's
finish of 1.185 percent. Its price fell to 111.83 yen, down from
111.87 yen the previous day.

McEnroe sharp in win over Glickstein
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PURCHASE, New York (AP) _ Second-seeded John McEnroe defeated
Shlomo Glickstein of Israel 6-4, 6-0 Wednesday to advance to the
quarterfinals of the dlrs 200,000 Citibank Champions senior tennis
tournament.
	   Earlier, Sweden's Mikael Pernfors ousted Guillermo Vilas 6-2,
6-4; John Lloyd of Britain stopped Eddie Dibbs 6-3, 6-4 and
Ecuador's Andres Gomez defeated Gene Mayer 7-5, 6-4.
	   McEnroe looked sharp against Glickstein and controlled play
throughout. He is looking to break Jimmy Connors' streak of four
straight wins in the Nuveen Tour's biggest regular-season event.
	   In the quarterfinals, McEnroe will play Pernfors, while Lloyd
will take on the top-seeded Connors, who has been hobbled by a foot
injury.

Tourists cancel reservations as quakes hit northwestern Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECASTS to UPDATE with tourist cancellations, number of
earthquakes, other details, quotes; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By KOZO MIZOGUCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tourists began canceling hotel reservations
Thursday at a scenic resort in northwestern Japan as a series of
moderate earthquakes shook the area, officials said.
	   ``People are calling to cancel, saying they are afraid of a
possible big earthquake,'' said Kenroku Hayakawa of Shimizuya
Hotel, a major hotel in Kamikochi, located in Nagano prefecture, or
state.
	   Hayakawa said 25 people had canceled by Thursday morning at his
hotel, which can an accommodate 97 guests.
	   Between last Friday and Thursday morning, a total of 2,490
earthquakes had been recorded in the area, the Meteorological
Agency said. But only 67 were strong enough to be felt by humans,
it said.
	   No major damage or injuries have been reported.
	   The largest of the tremors, with a preliminary magnitude of 4.6,
hit Wednesday, the most active day so far with 977 quakes recorded.
	   ``We are cautiously watching the situation,'' an agency official
said Thursday morning. He refused to comment on whether a big
earthquake was possible, saying only that such concentrated seismic
activity is not unusual. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Many of the tremors were a shallow 10 kilometers (6 miles)
underground in central Nagano, 210 kilometers (130 miles) northwest
of Tokyo. Nagano is the mountainous prefecture that hosted the
Winter Olympics in February.
	   The agency said there was no fear of tsunami, the huge ocean
waves caused by undersea earthquakes or volcanic activity, from the
latest series of tremors.
	   Television footage showed some goods at shops falling from
shelves onto the floor. Some mountain paths in the area were also
reported destroyed by landslides caused by the magnitude 4.6 tremor
Wednesday.
	   Hideaki Shimizu, front desk manager at the Gosenjaku Hotel in
Kamikochi, said six people canceled their bookings for Thursday.
``Several guests arriving before Wednesday's main earthquake have
left earlier than scheduled out in fear of the shaking,'' Shimizu
said.
	   ``We cannot say its 100 percent safe for guests now,'' Shimizu
said. His hotel can accommodate 80 visitors.
	   The cancellations come at the peak of Japan's summer vacation
season when many travelers seek to escape the heat and humidity of
cities like Tokyo and Osaka for cooler mountain climates.
	   About 15,000 people a day visit Kamikochi, a scenic valley at
the foot of the northern Japan Alps during the summer, according to
a local tourism cooperative.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.
	   According to the agency official, the same area in Nagano
experienced a similar spates of seismic activity in 1990 and 1967.

Ailing American comfortable in hospital after Antarctic evacuation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) _ An American sick with
appendicitis is resting comfortably in a hospital Thursday after an
emergency airlift evacuation from McMurdo base in Antarctica.
	   A New Zealand medical team was sent south from Christchurch on a
C-130 Hercules transport plane Wednesday to make the unusual
seven-hour winter flight. Regular weekly flights to McMurdo were
not due to resume until next week.
	   A U.S. team was unavailable Wednesday and a delay could have
been risky, Operation Deep Freeze commander Col. Rich Saburro said.
	   The manager of the U.S. Antarctic Program at McMurdo Station,
Jerry Ness, developed acute appendicitis and had to be taken from
the ice for medical treatment. His hometown was not immediately
available.
	   The New Zealand air force said the Antarctic rescue mission was
the first time a New Zealand Hercules had flown to Antarctica in
winter.
	   The mission was classified as moderate to high risk for the crew
because of the extreme winter conditions _ a landing in darkness on
a packed snow-and-ice runway at temperatures of minus 13 Fahrenheit
(-25 Celsius).
	   However, Flight Lt. Glenn Gowthorpe said the crew encountered no
problems and returned ``safe and sound,''
	   The aircraft spent 66 minutes on the ice completing a ``hot
refuel,'' Gowthorpe said.
	   During that procedure the engines are kept running to prevent
any part of the aircraft freezing.
	   The Hercules arrived 22 minutes early at 1 a.m. Thursday at
Christchurch International Airport with the help of an Antarctic
tail wind, he said.
	   An Operation Deep Freeze spokesman said Ness had been in stable
condition when the medical team reached him and there had been no
need to operate on him in Antarctica or during the flight.

Riots in two Indonesian towns ahead of independence day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Soldiers fired warning shots after
hundreds of people looted several shops and burned a discotheque
and motorcycles in western Java island, newspapers reported
Thursday.
	   The riots in two towns Wednesday came as the government sought
to quell rumors that unrest will break out in Jakarta on Aug. 17,
Indonesia's independence day. Thousands of soldiers are being
deployed in the capital.
	   Many people fear any demonstrations planned on that day will
degenerate into deadly riots like those in May that helped oust
President Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   Millions of Indonesians are enduring the worst economic hardship
in three decades and riots over price increases have erupted in
cities and many small towns this year.
	   In Labuan, 95 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Jakarta, mobs
looted three shops Wednesday after a customer argued with a
storekeeper over the price of cigarettes, the Kompas newspaper
reported.
	   The same day, a crowd in the nearby town of Serang burned a
hotel discotheque suspected of harboring prostitutes and ransacked
hotel rooms.
	   Rioters also burned three motorcycles and attacked a military
car, Merdeka newspaper reported. Soldiers fired warning shots to
scare off the mob, but there were no arrests or reports of
injuries.
	   Crowds last month attacked more than a dozen discotheques in the
resort town of Puncak near Jakarta, alleging they were dens of
prostitution and drugdealing.
	   Prostitution is forbidden in predominately Muslim Indonesia, but
it is widely condoned in hotels and nightclubs.

Singapore PM urges quick implementation of AFTA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong has
urged for earlier implementation of free trade area in Southeast
Asia, saying this would help restore economic confidence in the
area.
	   The Association of Southeast Asian Nations plans to set up the
ASEAN Free Trade Area by 2003 in Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand,
the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei. The remaining members
Vietnam, Myanmar, and Laos are to join the program by 2008.
	   ``Advancing the AFTA timetable will send a powerful signal to
international investors of the determination of ASEAN countries to
open their economies to trade and investments,'' Goh said late
Wednesday in a meeting with his Laos counterpart Sisavath
Keobounphanh.
	   ``To restore confidence in the ASEAN economies, the realization
of AFTA has become even more urgent,'' Goh added. He did not offer
any details.
	   Goh reiterated that the region, struck by the serious economic
crisis for more than a year, ``could turn the financial crisis to
advantage, by confronting difficult economic issues and introducing
much-needed measures to reform and strenghten our economic and
legal framework.''
	   Also Wednesday, Laos and Singapore signed an agreement
abolishing visa requirements for diplomats and officials.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Flood warnings were issued for
populous southern coastal regions Thursday as a storm front that
left 14 people dead in central South Korea drifted southward.
	   The latest deaths brought to 195 the number killed in eight days
of floods and mudslides triggered by torrential rains in the
central and northern parts of the nation.
	   Property damage has been estimated at up to dlrs 2 billion.
	   A week earlier, flash floods raging down mountain valleys at the
southern tip of the Korean Peninsula killed 67 campers and left 29
missing.
	   As the frontal system moved south Wednesday, storms flooded
Boun, Sangju and three other counties in central South Korea. More
than 5,000 homes there were inundated, forcing 18,000 people,
mostly farmers, to run to higher ground, officials said.
	   On Thursday, the rains threatened the southern coastal regions,
including Pusan, the nation's second largest city. Weather reports
predicted up to 13 centimeters (5.2 inches) of rain in the region.
	   A flood warning was issued for millions of people living along
the rapidly rising Nakdong River, which flows through the
southeastern corner of the peninsula.

Fergie to host TV chat show, newspaper says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, is
to switch to the other side of the interviewer's microphone to host
her own talk show series on a European satellite television
station, The Sun tabloid newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Fergie, divorced from Prince Andrew, will present 10 one-hour
shows in a SKY TV series called ``Surviving Life,'' in which she
will lead audience-participation discussions on problems, the
newspaper said.
	   A spokeswoman for SKY TV, which is owned by Sun proprietor
Rupert Murdoch, would not confirm the deal but said the station
planned to make a statement on the duchess later on Thursday.
	   The morning talk shows will begin to air on SKY TV on October 5,
the newspaper said, adding that the duchess is to be paid 5,000
pounds (dlrs 8,200) per show and plans to donate all her fees to
charities featured in the programs.
	   Rival tabloid The Mirror quoted an unnamed ``insider'' as saying
that the series might be sold worldwide.
	   ``Having been through so much in her own life, Sarah has a
unique ability to connect with other people by sharing
experiences,'' The Sun quoted SKY TV boss, Elisabeth Murdoch, as
saying.
	   The newspaper said the Fergie filmed a pilot for the series two
months ago after impressing TV chiefs with audience reaction to her
television appearances in the United States.
	   She is the spokeswoman for Weight Watchers and has appeared as a
guest in the studios of Oprah Winfrey, Jay Leno, and Larry King.
She has recently started interviewing celebrities for Hello!
magazine, a European celebrity weekly.
	   SKY has taken an option to make 20 more shows at the same price,
the newspaper said.
	   ``This is a new venture for me and I'm looking forward to the
challenge,'' The Sun quoted the duchess as saying. ``Surviving Life
will be about people and the real problems they face in life
today.''
	   The Sun quoted an unnamed TV source as saying: ``The duchess has
insisted the content of the program deals with serious social
issues.''

Singapore bourse hits new 10-year low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's stock market fell to its lowest
level in more than 10 years Thursday, with the benchmark Straits
Times Industrials Index skidding 1.9 percent, or 19.02 points, to
976.75.
	   The last time the index closed below this level was in May 1988.
	   The drift below the psychologically important support level of
1000 began on Tuesday, when markets opened after a Monday state
holiday.
	   The index has plummeted more than 35 percent since the start of
the year, when it stood at 1529.84 points.
	   Fears continued on the market that China might devalue the yuan
if regional currencies continue to come under pressure. This could
spark another round of currency crisis, market observers said.
	   An institutional sales trader at a European broking house told
Dow Jones Newswires that if Japan doesn't intervene to support the
yen by the end of the month, Singapore's main index could fall to
900.
	   The weaker regional currencies, led by the Japanese yen, have
weighed on the local bourse, dealers said.
	   The U.S. dollar bought 146.33 Japanese yen Thursday morning, up
from 146.26 yen in late New York trading Wednesday and 145.90 yen
in late Asian trading Wednesday.

Robbers kill U.S. Peace Corps volunteer, nine others in central
</HEADLINE>
Philippines &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Robbers apparently under the
influence of drugs shot drivers on a road in the central
Philippines, killing 10 people, including a U.S. Peace Corps
volunteer, police said Thursday.
	   The five robbers shot the victims in the head or neck and then
took their belongings in the attack in Sara in Iloilo province
Wednesday night, police Chief Superintendent Ricardo de Leon said.
	   Six of the victims were forced out of their vehicles, lined up
on the side of the road and shot, a radio news report said, quoting
witnesses.
	   Police and U.S. Embassy officials identified the Peace Corps
volunteer as Robert Bock of New York State. His hometown was not
immediately available. Police said Bock, who was on the way to a
meeting with a former town mayor, was shot inside a van.
	   De Leon said the men attacked at least four vehicles passing on
the road. The father of the group's leader tried to stop them but
was also fired on by the group, he said. The father was not
injured.
	   After the attack, the men went to a nearby village and opened
fire on a house without causing injuries, police said.
	   ``They went on a rampage apparently because of drugs,'' police
Chief Inspector Camilo Cascola said.
	   Police said the suspects belong to a kidnapping and robbery gang
operating in metropolitan Manila and some central provinces.
	   Iloilo is 460 kilometers (285 miles) south of Manila.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Fabian Estay and Jose Manuel Abundis scored as
Toluca of Mexico defeated Deportivo Alajuelense of Costa Rica 2-0
in the quarterfinals of the CONCACAF Champions Cup.
	   Estay scored in the 73rd minute off his own rebound Wednesday
night, and Abundis drove a header home in the 91st minute.
	   In another quarterfinal, Angel David Comizzo stopped three of
five penalty kicks to give Leon of Mexico a 3-2 penalty-kick margin
over Firpo of El Salvador after the teams had played to a 1-1 tie.
	   Leon led 1-0 on Sigifredo Mercado's penalty kick in the 27th
minute. Nidelson de Mello tied the game in the 79th minute.
	   Comizzo made diving saves on Celio Rodriguez, Wilfredo Iraheta
Sanabria and Pedro Vasquez in the tiebreaker.
	   Mercado shot wide left in the first round of the tiebreaker, but
Alberto Garcia, Roberto Medina and Sergio Martinez then scored.
	   The annual CONCACAF Champions Cup features the top teams from
last season in the top leagues of North and Central America and the
Caribbean.
	   Leon, the 1997-98 Mexican League runner-up, will face D.C.
United, the Major League Soccer champion in 1996 and '97, in a
semifinal Friday.
	   The other Friday semifinal pits Toluca, the 1998 Mexican league
champion, against Costa Rican League champion Deportivo Saprissa.

Howard hopes new tax will mirror effects in New Zealand
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Tax
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ An economic boom and a surge in
voter popularity for the government followed the introduction 12
years ago of a consumption tax in New Zealand. Australian Prime
Minister John Howard hopes for the same reaction to his plan,
launched Thursday.
	   The consumption tax, also known as a goods and services tax, is
the centerpiece of Howard's plan to overhaul the Australian tax
system. Though it jacks up prices on virtually all items by 10
percent, the revenue raised will be enough to let Howard to offer
voters the election sweetener of big income tax cuts.
	   In New Zealand, the then Labor government on Oct. 1, 1986
introduced a goods services tax at the rate of 10 percent, the same
as the one proposed by Howard.
	   Introduced mid-term, before national elections in 1987, the tax
was popular enough to be a significant factor in Labor increasing
its majority in Parliament, the first time an incumbent had
increased its numbers since 1938.
	   Economist Gary Morgan said New Zealanders feared the goods and
services at first but later warmed to it, partly because of an
economic boom which followed and lower direct taxes.
	   ``Many opposed GST before it was introduced. Afterwards they
loved it because of the economic boom it created in 1987, which
made some people rich, and also because of the personal tax cuts''
it delivered, Morgan told The Associated Press on Thursday.
	   The spending boom produced more revenue than the government had
expected, more than compensating for the cost of the tax cuts and
boosting the fiscal accounts ``out of sight,'' Morgan said.
	   ``It broadened the tax base, and cut the burden on personal tax.
It also brought a lot of tax dodgers into the system, and
significantly reduced the size of the hidden economy,'' Morgan
said.
	   Twelve years on, economists characterize it as efficient, robust
and a major contributor to reform of the overall tax system.
	   The consumption tax rate was raised in 1989 to 12.5 percent.
	   Countries as diverse as Canada and Fiji have studied the New
Zealand system, some introducing it, but often with a modified and
larger list of exempt goods and transactions.

	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ An economic boom and a surge in
voter popularity for the government followed the introduction 12
years ago of a consumption tax in New Zealand. Australian Prime
Minister John Howard will be hoping for the same reaction to his
plan, launched Thursday.
	   The consumption tax, also known as a goods and services tax, is
the centerpiece of Howard's plan to overhaul the Australian tax
system. Though it jacks up prices on virtually all items by 10
percent, the revenue raised will be enough to let Howard to offer
voters the election sweetener of big income tax cuts.
	   In New Zealand, the then Labor government on Oct. 1, 1986
introduced a goods services tax at the rate of 10 percent, the same
as the one proposed by Howard.
	   Introduced mid-term, before national elections in 1987, the tax
was popular enough to be a significant factor in Labor increasing
its majority in Parliament, the first time an incumbent had
increased its numbers since 1938.
	   Economist Gareth Morgan said New Zealanders feared the goods and
services at first but later warmed to it, partly because of an
economic boom which followed and lower direct taxes.
	   ``Many opposed GST before it was introduced. Afterwards they
loved it because of the economic boom it created in 1987, which
made some people rich, and also because of the personal tax cuts''
it delivered, Morgan told The Associated Press on Thursday.
	   The spending boom produced more revenue than the government had
expected, more than compensating for the cost of the tax cuts and
boosting the fiscal accounts ``out of sight,'' Morgan said.
	   ``It broadened the tax base, and cut the burden on personal tax.
It also brought a lot of tax dodgers into the system, and
significantly reduced the size of the hidden economy,'' Morgan
said.
	   Twelve years on, economists characterize it as efficient, robust
and a major contributor to reform of the overall tax system.
	   The consumption tax rate was raised in 1989 to 12.5 percent.
	   Countries as diverse as Canada and Fiji have studied the New
Zealand system, some introducing it, but often with a modified and
larger list of exempt goods and transactions.

Krayzelburg sets American record in winning 200-meter backstroke
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRESNO, California (AP) _ Lenny Krayzelburg broke his own
American record in winning the 200-meter backstroke at the U.S.
Championships on Wednesday.
	   Krayzelburg's time of 1:57.38 broke the mark he set exactly one
year ago by almost a half of a second.
	   ``I felt it was going to take an American record to win
tonight,'' said Krayzelburg, who was second after the preliminaries
earlier in the day.
	   Brad Bridgewater, who had the fastest qualifying time, finished
second in the final.
	   Krayzelburg was ahead of world record pace for the first 150
meters before slowing.
	   ``I need to start working on my final 50,'' he said.
	   Jenny Thompson, the five-time Olympic gold medalist and
five-time world champion, won the 100 freestyle in 55.53. It was
Thompson's 19th individual national title.
	   ``There were a lot of messy aspects to that swim,'' Thompson
said. ``I had trouble with my start and then I got water in my
goggles. I did go out well but I couldn't see what was going on
around me because of the goggles.''
	   Jason Lezak was a surprise winner in the men's 100 freestyle.
Coming into the meet, Lezak had never reached the finals at
previous nationals, and he broke 50 seconds for the first time with
a winning time of 49.93.
	   ``It just fell together tonight for me,'' Lezak said. ``The only
major race that I won before today was my (collegiate) conference
title.''
	   Tom Wilkens nipped teammate Kurt Grote in the 200 breaststroke.
Wilkens won in 2:12.39 with Grote placing second in 2:12.66. The
two are teammates on the Santa Clara Swim Club and Grote was the
defending champion and world champion in the event.
	   Kristy Kowal won the women's 200 breaststroke in 2:27.68.
Natalie Coughlin, a 15-year-old high school junior from Concord,
California, won the 200 backstroke in 2:13.66.
	   Molly Freedman won the women's 200 butterfly in 2:12.02 and Tom
Malchow won the men's 200 butterfly in 1:56.75.

Philippine government expects subdued second quarter economic
</HEADLINE>
growth &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ With no improvement in agricultural
production, economic growth in the Philippines in the second
quarter is expected to have remained subdued, the government's
chief economic planner said.
	   Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla said
agricultural production, which declined 3 percent in the first
three months of the year, did not improve in the second quarter
according to preliminary data.
	   Gross national product growth in the first quarter shrank to 2.5
percent from 5.6 percent in the year-earlier period because of a
drought caused by the El Nino weather condition and the regional
financial crisis.
	   The second-quarter GNP data is due later this month. Medalla
declined to say whether he thought GNP growth would be higher or
lower than in the first quarter.
	   Still, the economy is still on track to achieve GNP growth of 2
percent to 3 percent this year, beating the outlook for most other
crisis-hit Southeast Asian economies, he said in a briefing
Wednesday night.
	   ``We will not have a recession, but only lower growth,'' he
said, adding that exports remain robust and domestic consumption is
still relatively strong.
	   The government's optimism for 1998's GNP performance is not
shared by the International Monetary Fund, however, which is
predicting GNP growth of only around 1 percent.
	   Medalla refused to discuss the government's evident annoyance at
the central bank's decision to raise its key overnight interbank
rates to repel a speculative attack on the peso earlier this week.
	   Some government senior officials fear the move could cause other
interest rates to rise, which would hurt the country's recovery
prospects.
	   The central bank raised its overnight lending and borrowing
rates by 5 percentage points this week, but has pledged the
increase is only temporary to brake the peso's fall.
	   Fears of a devaluation of the Chinese yuan and losses in the
Japanese yen triggered heavy dollar buying on the Manila currency
market, sending the U.S. currency on Monday to a seven-month high
of 44.79 pesos.
	   Currency traders said pressure on the peso eased Wednesday, due
primarily to a rebound in the yen, although the higher interbank
rates also helped.
	   Medalla said the central bank's action was convincing proof of
the monetary authority's independence, a fact that should be
applauded by international investors.
	   The overnight borrowing rate, the central bank's main tool to
control domestic liquidity, was raised to 18 percent from 13
percent, and the overnight lending rate to 20 percent from 15
percent.
