<HEADLINE> EU Backs New German Candidate for IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance ministers
agreed on Monday to nominate Horst Koehler as a new German
candidate for the top job of the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Koehler currently runs the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development and the bank channels international aid funds to the
former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
"There was a consensus among all the European Union finance
ministers for the German candidate and I hope it will be endorsed
also by other countries outside Europe," said Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country holds the rotating
presidency of the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Germany came forth with Horst Koehler to replace Caio Koch-
Weser in the race for the managing director of IMF. The United
States opposed Koch-Weser on the ground that the German deputy
finance minister was not well qualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
The new German candidate is respected in Europe for his role in
the preparation for the creation of the single currency euro.
</P>
<P>
The post of IMF managing director is customarily held by a
European while an American takes charge of the World Bank. But
Stanley Fischer of the United States has joined Japanese Eisuke
Sakakibara in the race for the IMF managing director.
</P>
<P>
Political pundits of EU-U.S. relations here predicted that
rejection of a second German nominee would somewhat strain the
trans-Atlantic ties, especially that with Germany.

<HEADLINE> Tribal Fight Kills 10 People in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Ten people were killed at the
weekend during a fight in a village in Isiolo District, Kenya's
Eastern Province, between Somali and Boran tribesmen, said Isiolo
District officer Helen Kiilu on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that eight of those killed were Somalis and two
were Borans as the fight took place in Mlango village on Friday
night when cattle rustlers raided a Somali homestead.
</P>
<P>
Five other people were seriously injured during the fighting
and were admitted to the Isiolo District Hospital, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kiilu, she had led a security team in pursuit of
the rustlers and they had recovered 20 head of cattle, 25 donkeys
and a number of camels.
</P>
<P>
There have been hostilities between the two communities because
of cattle thefts, the officer said, adding the security patrols
had been stepped up.
</P>
<P>
She blamed the skirmishes on the invasion by hundreds of
pastoralists from Garissa, Wajir and Mandera districts in
neighboring North Eastern Province in search of pasture for their
animals.

<HEADLINE> PLC Speaker Sets Terms for Success of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the Palestinian
Legislative Council (PLC) Ahmed Qureia on Tuesday spelled out three
terms that should be met to help the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks succeed.
</P>
<P>
Those three terms are setting a time-table for the
implementation of the signed accords, taking trust-building
measures and sustaining hope, the Palestinian news agency WAFA
reported.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Australian ambassador to Israel Richard
Ragbi in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Qureia, also known as Abu
Ala, called on Israel to implement its signed accords with the
Palestinians so as to build trust and security for the Palestinians
and Israelis alike.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli governments under Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres
fulfilled their commitments to the agreements they had signed with
the Palestinian side, Abu Ala said, voicing hope that the
government led by Prime Minister Ehud Barak would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side had met all its obligations, he noted,
stressing that September 13 will stand as a definite and final
deadline for the final peace talks.
</P>
<P>
By that time the Palestinians will declare an independent state
with Jerusalem as its capital with or without an agreement with
Israel, said the speaker.
</P>
<P>
However, "The Palestinian people and government prefer that the
move comes through an agreement," he added.
</P>
<P>
A fair solution to the Palestinian question must recognize
definitely the right of the Palestinian refugees to return to their
homeland in line with U.N. resolution 194, the necessity of
Israel's withdrawal to the June 4, 1967 border lines, and
dismantlement of all Jewish settlements, he added.
</P>
<P>
These are the minimum demands by all the Palestinians, he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Denies Agreement on 3rd Israeli Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Erekat told reporters that such agreement can not be reached
unless the two sides signed a final deal on the Israeli pullout
from the 6.1 percent of the West Bank territories.
</P>
<P>
Israeli T.V Channel 1 reported that Israel and the Palestinians
agreed on the third phase withdrawal maps, under which three
villages near Jerusalem namely Anata in the east, Butunia in the
north and Abedia in the south will be transferred to total
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
The three villages are now located in Area B in which Israel
controls security and Palestinians exercise civil administration.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli channel said that the Palestinians accepted the maps
after Israel agreed to make some amendments on the redeployment
plan,
pointing out that it was the first time to consult with the
Palestinian side on the Israeli redeployment lines.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the third phase redeployment would be also
considered during Washington talks together with the final status.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli mini-cabinet meeting on Wednesday is expected to
discuss the third phase redeployment plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed by Israeli Prime
Minster Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat last
September, Israeli troops should withdraw from 6.1 percent of the
West Bank before January 20, the third stage of their total
pullout.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel broke its promise for sharp differences between
the two sides over the definition of the transferred areas.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Cyprus Envoy: Direct Talks On Cyprus Unlikely in Near Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy for the Cyprus
problem Alvaro De Soto Tuesday ruled out the possibility for
direct talks between the two communities on Cyprus in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after talks with Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou in Athens, De Soto said that direct negotiations
between Cyprus president Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash were not foreseen in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the two sides to make compromises to
help seek a solution to the protracted problem.
</P>
<P>
The envoy added that the U.N.-sponsored proximity talks
between the two sides could bring results and prepare the ground
for the solution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, along with Greece, has insisted that the Cyprus
problem must be resolved on the basis of the establishment of a
bizonal,bicommunal federation in line with U.N. resolutions, but
the Turkish Cypriot leader denktash has refused to have face-to-
face talks with Clerides unless his illegally-declared northern
Cyprus be recognized internationally as a prelude to reunification
in the form of a two-state confederation.
</P>
<P>
So far, the two communities on the divided island have held
two rounds of proximity talks in New York and Geneva respectively,
and the third such talks is expected to take place in New York in
May.

<HEADLINE> Inflation May Surpass 2.0 Percent in Euro Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said on
Tuesday that the inflation rate in the euro zone may have
surpassed the 2-percent ceiling set by the European Central Bank
in the beginning months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, attributed the rise of inflation to the price hikes of
petroleum products and the depreciation of the single currency
against the United States dollars.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that the inflation may have surpassed "a
little but temporarily" the 2.0-percent mark in the euro zone at
the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Whether inflation keeps rising will have to depend, according
to the commission, on the evolution of euro and the level of
retail prices.
</P>
<P>
The European Union recommends to its member states that the
annual inflation rate be kept at 1.5 percent to be fit for the EU'
s economic and monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation for the 11-nation euro zone, however, went
up from 1.7 percent last December to 2.0 percent this January
while inflation also went up in the union, from 1.7 percent last
December to 1.8 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was expected to up a little bit in February and March
in the euro zone.

<HEADLINE> New Wild Blaze Erupts in Southern Ethiopia: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A new forest fire erupted
last weekend in Nechsar Game Park, some 500 kilometers south of
Addis Ababa, the Monitor newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The latest wild blaze, the third of its kind in south of
Ethiopia within one month, is threatening wild animals including
zebra, gazelle and hartebeest, a horse-like antelope with short
curved horns which is found only in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The fires might be ignited by local inhabitants while clearing
bushland for cultivation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the fire in Nechsar Game Park, forest fires in Bale
and Borena regions, also in southern part of Ethiopia, have been
raging for about one month.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency said earlier that fires in the two
regions were nearly under control following weeks of efforts by
tens of thousands of people who have been doing everything they
can to put out the fires.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters from South Africa, and fire-fighting experts from
Germany and the United States have joined Ethiopians' battle
against forest fires that reportedly have engulfed some 70,000
hectares of natural forest.

LUANDA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is to resume its all-round
cooperation with Angola in the political, economic and cultural
areas, said Cuban Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque at a press
conference here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Roque who arrived here on Monday, the two
countries signed an agreement on diplomatic cooperation during his
visit.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the foreign ministers of the two countries
will meet at least once every year to exchange views and
co-ordinate each other' s positions.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries will also sign agreements on
economic and trade cooperation at a high-level meeting scheduled
for next month in Havana, the capital of Cuba, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cuba and Angola had been in good relations up to the early
1990s. But after the cold war, their relations have cooled down.
</P>
<P>
Rogue was here to brief the African country on its preparatory
work for the summit of G-77 plus China scheduled for April 10-14

<HEADLINE> Iran, Azerbaijan Need Work for Closer Ties: Iranian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran and Azerbaijan, as two
neighbors, should remove the obstacles and work for closer ties,
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with his Azerbaijani
counterpart Vilayat Guliyev, according to the official Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries enjoy longstanding cultural,
historical and religious similarities, and their government have
the responsibility to pave the way for better relations.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Iran gives priority to expansion of relations with
neighboring countries including Azerbaijan, hoping the talks
between the two sides would serve to prepare the ground for
constructive cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On the status of the Caspian Sea, Kharrazi said Iran favors the
existing legal regime, under which the sea belongs to the five
littoral states -- Iran, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and
Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
If the littoral states of the Caspian, believed to be a giant
deposit of oil and gas, want to divide it, the sea should be
divided equally among them, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He said expert studies indicated that laying oil pipeline
through Iran is the safest and most economical to transfer energy
resources to the world market. The U.S., which has been hostile to
the regime in Tehran, supported projects of pipelining through
countries other than Iran, as well as Russia.
</P>
<P>
Economic factors will eventually outweigh political
considerations, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
On regional security, he said Iran supported peaceful and
honorable solution to the Nargono-Karabakh crisis and welcomed
direct talks between the presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia, and
is ready to help in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan and Armenia fought over Nargono-Karabakh, an enclave
inside Azerbaijan populated by Armenians. The two former Soviet
republics reached a cease-fire agreement in 1994, but tensions
remain as peace talks have failed to solve the issue.
</P>
<P>
Guliyev, who arrived here Monday, said Azerbaijan is willing to
foster cooperation with Iran. "There is no problem that cannot be
solved," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated Iran's stance in supporting Azerbaijan's
territorial integrity and its humanitarian assistance to the
refugees. "No security plan will work in the Caucasian region in
absence of Iran," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Baku wants Iran to continue its positive role in the
security arrangement in the Caucasus and settlement of the Nargono-
Karabakh crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Azerbaijani foreign minister called for the completion of
the Caspian Sea legal regime through unanimous agreement of the
five littoral states, adding the environment should be protected
and its civilian nature should be honored.
</P>
<P>
He also said Baku favors Iran's participation in development and
economic projects in Azerbaijan and extended an invitation to
Kharrazi to visit Azerbaijan.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has agreed to finance the
construction of two health centers in the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the first of its kind, was inked here Tuesday by
Cyprus Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Andreas Pirishis
and Representative of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in
Nicosia Samir Abu Ghazali.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement is a "tangible manifestation of
Cyprus' solidarity with the Palestinian people," said Pirishis
after the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus will continue to offer every possible assistance
to the Palestinian people so as to contribute to safeguarding peace
in the region and welfare of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Ghazali expressed confidence that the two sides
will further carry on cooperation and that more agreements will
follow.
</P>
<P>
He added that relations between the two peoples were established
through "common struggles."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people are to accord Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides a warm welcome when he visits the Palestinian self-rule
areas at the end of this month "as they recognize and appreciate

<HEADLINE> Jordan Welcomes Resumption of Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
on Tuesday hailed the decision by Israeli and Palestinian leaders
to resume their stalled peace talks as a major step forward in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He expressed welcome while meeting with visiting Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who arrived here earlier in the day to brief
the monarch on the outcome of his three meetings with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak last week.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat had agreed to resume the peace talks in
Washington later this month after the Muslim Eid al-Adha, or the
Feast of Sacrifice, to pave the way for a framework agreement,
which the two sides failed to seal on February 13 as originally
planned.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to honor a September 13 deadline to reach a
final peace agreement as stipulated by the Sharm el Sheikh
memorandum signed last September between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visit is part of regular consultations between the two
sides over the peace process, as Jordan has been a major peace
broker between Israel and its Arab neighers after it signed a peace
treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, King Abdullah reaffirmed his persistent
support for the rights of the Palestinians, including the
establishment of an independent state on their own soil with
Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a solution to the Palestinian issue is the
cornerstone of achieving a just, durable and comprehensive peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Israel, Syria and Lebanon to resume their
peace talks which are also an important part of the peace process
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks broke off again in January after Israel
refused to give an advance commitment to return in full the Golan
Heights, which it captured from Syria during the 1967 Middle East
war.
</P>
<P>
Israel has not resumed its peace talks with Lebanon, where Syria
has been a major power broker, after their negotiations collapsed
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left here for home Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Ethiopia to Expand Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said on Tuesday that his country is willing to improve relations
with Ethiopia in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the pledge while meeting with visiting Ethiopian
Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Mehmet Kececiler said, during his talks
with Mesfin in the day, the two sides agreed to work together in
such fields as textile, construction, small-and-medium-sized
enterprises, tourism, agriculture and water management.
</P>
<P>
There is no political problem between the two countries, which
enjoy vast economic and commercial potential due to their rich
natural, cultural and geographical resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a Cooperation Agreement on Trade, Economy
and Technics under which a Joint Economic Commission (JEC) was set
up, said the state minister.
</P>
<P>
Kececiler said that he will visit Ethiopia in June as the co-
chairman of the JEC. He called for speeding up the negotiations on
reaching agreements on reciprocal encouragement and protection of
investments and on prevention of double taxation.
</P>
<P>
Hailing Turkey's policy of opening to Africa, Mesfin expressed
the hope that the two sides would sign cooperation agreements
during JEC meetings in June.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Arrow-2 Missile System Operational </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALRM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Officially declaring its newly
developed Arrow-2 missile defense system operational on Tuesday,
Israel became the first country in the world to have the capacity
to defend itself against ballistic missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
The roll-out ceremony of the system was held at the Air Force's
missile test base in central Israel, where the Israel Aircraft
Industries, the project's prime contractor, presented three
batteries of this system to Air Force Chief Eitan Ben-Eliyahu for
deployment.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow-2 system will definitely help enhance Israel's defense
capability in the years to come, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said
here while commenting on the operation of the system.
</P>
<P>
The Arrow-2 system, a U.S.-Israel joint venture including
missiles, launchers, radar and the control and command system, cost
1.3 billion U.S. dollars to develop. By 2010, the total investment
in the project will reach 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The system is quite capable of dealing with Scud and Scud-
derived ballistic missiles in the arsenals of Syria, Iran and Iraq.
Its early warning and fire-control system is designed to pick up
and track incoming missiles from a distance of 500 kilometers,
while its control and command system can guide the launches of the
interceptors and is capable of dealing with up to 14 intercepts at
a time.
</P>
<P>
However, the system can not protect against Iran's advanced
Shehab-3 ballistic missiles, Israel's high-level officials of the
defense establishment have warned.
</P>
<P>
But when more advanced models of the Iranian ballistic missiles
become operational, the Arrow-2 system can be improved to provide
sufficient response, they added.
</P>
<P>
Iran has long been suspected by Israel and the United States of
buying long-range missle technology from other countries for the 1,
300-kilometer Shehab-3 missiles it tested in July 1998. The missile
is capable of striking Israel, Saudi Arabia and U.S. forces in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Drives Back U.S., British Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi air defense artillery drove
back the U.S. and British warplanes overflying northern and
southern Iraq on Tuesday, an Iraqi military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency (INA), the
spokesman said that at 14:30 (1130 GMT), the U.S. and British
warplanes, in 11 formations, made 18 armed sorties from Saudi
Airbia and six from Kuwait airspace over the southern provinces of
Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar,Qadissiyah, Wasit, Muthana and Najaf.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi anti-warplane missile system challenged the hostile
planes and forced them to flee back to their bases in Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.S. and Britain launched the four-night air strikes
against Iraq in December 1998, their warplanes have made a total of
19,547 armed sorties, among which 16,037 were from Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes attacked civilian installations in
southern Iraq last Saturday and injured eight people, the INA
reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British aircraft use bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
to mount their patrols of the southern no-fly zone which was set up
after the 1991 Gulf War, with the so-called aim of protecting the
region's Shiite Muslims from being attacked by the Iraqi government
troops.
</P>
<P>
A similar no-fly zone was imposed over northern Iraq to protect
the Kurdish community there as claimed.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the no-fly zones, which are not
directly covered by any U.N. resolution and have been the sites of
almost daily skirmishes since the air war the last December.

<HEADLINE> EU, U.S. Strike Draft Data Protection Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and the
United States said Tuesday that they had reached a draft personal
data protection accord after some two years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to recommend the package to our respective
authorities," said John Mogg, a senior EU official in charge of
internal market affairs.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a joint press conference with United
States Undersecretary of Commerce David Aaron.
</P>
<P>
The draft accord has now to be ratified, on the part of the
European Union, by the European council of ministers and the
European Parliament before it enters into force.
</P>
<P>
The European Union began to bar companies from exchanging
personal information via computer networks with firms in countries
that do not adequately protect the privacy of that information.
The United States has so far not enacted broad privacy protection
laws.
</P>
<P>
Some had feared that the different practices in the European
Union and the United States could bar European-based companies
from sending personal data to the United States and thus spark
another trade dispute between the two.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has assessed the data protection practice of
Switzerland and Hungary and is expected to announce the Swiss and
Hungarian laws concerning data protection as adequate for the
transfer of personal information through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc has also started to assess the data
protection practices and laws of Canada, New Zealand, Australia
and Japan.

<HEADLINE> Russia Asks West to Help Stop Kosovo Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov has urged major industrial nations to help prevent
clashes in Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, from engulfing southern
Serbia, Sergei Lavrov, the Russian permanent representative to the
United Nations, said.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov told a news conference here late on Monday that Ivanov,
in a letter to his seven counterparts in the Group of Eight (G-8)
countries, said the world community must take "the situation
seriously" and make sure NATO-led international peace-keepers in
Kosovo do "not allow provocations."
</P>
<P>
Ivanov warned of a repetition of last year's dreadful events,
when efforts to reach a peace agreement between Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians and the Yugoslav Government failed.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Eight, which drafted an accord at the end of the
78-day NATO bombings in June last year, includes Britain, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov warned that Kosovo was "drifting towards independence"
despite U.N. resolutions. This trend encouraged extremists of all
sorts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Yugoslavia was notified of actions in Kosovo
but not really consulted.
</P>
<P>
Lavrov said that the United Nations complained about a
shortage of international police but left those from Russia
waiting at home for eight months.
</P>
<P>
Moscow had offered 119 "special police" last July, gave them
special training and provided them with manuals, Lavrov said,
adding that they were then told by the United Nations to wait
until premises to house them could be found.
</P>
<P>
"They were never called. Here we are in March and we still
haven't heard," he said. "When you train a unit and it is ready to
go and for eight months nothing happens, it is not good for the
morale of that unit."

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia to Resume Council Meetings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and Russia are scheduled to resume on Wednesday their
regular council meetings at the headquarters of the western
military alliance.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first NATO-Russia council meeting since NATO
started to bomb the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia last March. The
bombing soured the bilateral relations between the former Cold War
foes until February this year when NATO Secretary General George
Robertson visited Moscow.
</P>
<P>
NATO and Russia had improved relations after they signed a
fundamental act in October 1997 and the Russians had been
contacting and consulting with NATO officials on issues of common
concern during their council meetings.
</P>
<P>
Issues to be discussed during Wednesday's council meeting are
expected to include disarmament of conventional and nuclear
weapons, according to sources of the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also expected to dwell upon such topics as
the NATO new strategic concept and the Russian new security
concept.
</P>
<P>
NATO adopted its new strategic concept last April in Washington
while celebrating its 50th anniversary while Russia adopted a new
security concept in January this year.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Sees Progress in Standby Arrangements for Peacekeeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. report said on
Tuesday that six more Member States joined the United Nations
standby arrangements for peacekeeping last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 87 Member States had joined the standby arrangements
for peacekeeping as at December 31,1999, raising the total to some
147,500 personnel, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said a total of 65 of these 87 Member States had
now provided information on the specific capabilities they were
prepared to offer, and 43 of these 65 Member States had been able
to complete the standby arrangements planning data sheet with
detailed technical information on their contribution.
</P>
<P>
The total of 147,500 personnel included both grouped personnel
and individuals, with contributions varying in size and capability
from infantry battalions to medical specialists and election
monitors, covering a whole range of components envisaged for multi-
functional peacekeeping operations, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that however, as the bulk of resources
consists of infantry, there continued to be a need for additional
resources to complement maneuver units with the necessary logistic
support and this was essentially important in the areas of
strategic sealift/airlift, multi-role logistics, road transport
and transport utility aircraft, the so-called"force multipliers"
for a peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The standby arrangements for peacekeeping are to have a precise
understanding of the forces and other capabilities a Member State
will have available, at a given state of readiness, should it
agree to contribute to a peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Such resources may include military units, individual civilian
and military specialists, specialized services, equipment and
other capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The key element in the system of standby arrangements is the
bilateral exchange of detailed information to facilitate planning
and preparation, for both the participating Member State and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The information provided to the Secretariat is stored in a
database and is used only by personnel at Headquarters, on a "need-
to-know" basis.

<HEADLINE> Canadian PM Says No Intention of Stepping Aside </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has said he has no intention of stepping aside before the
next election, which must be called before the spring of 2002.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's reiteration of leading the Liberal Party into the
next federal election came as the party's three beckbenchers said
Monday that their constituents want the prime minister to make way
for Paul Martin, the finance minister and heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton MP Stan Keys, Sudbury MP Diane Marleau and Montreal MP
Nick Discepola said the prevailing view in their ridings is that
Chretien has done a good job but "it's time to pass the torch."
</P>
<P>
In response, Chretien reaffirmed, "I'm the leader of the
Liberal party" and "have a mandate -- 91 percent of the Liberals
in a convention two years ago," the National Post newspaper said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The conflict of intention within the ruling Liberal Party broke
into open as the Liberal national convention gets under way
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chretien was reported to have handily won delegates support in
an obligatory post-election vote two years ago, at the last
biennial convention.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Surge in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The country's retail sales
rose 1.1 percent to seasonally adjusted 265.7 billion U.S. dollars
in February, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1.1 percent advance in retail sales marked the strongest
pace since a 1.9 percent rise in December and was bigger than the
0.9 percent increase many analysts were expecting.In January,
retail sales increased by just 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The advance came despite rising interest rates, a jump in oil
prices and stock market volatility -- factors that could have
tempered spending.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates four times since
June, totaling a full percentage point. Even though those actions
have made borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses,
those higher rates have failed to significantly slow the economy
to a pace that can be sustained without sparking inflation.
</P>
<P>
Given that, most analysts expect the Fed will boost rates again
when they meet next week.
</P>
<P>
The big gain in total retail sales in February was led by a 1.8
percent increase in sales at grocery stores, which fell 5 percent
in January. After eating food stockpiled to counter any problems
with the Y2K computer changeover, consumers flocked to grocery
stores last month after staying away in January, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Sales of new cars and trucks, meanwhile, rose a solid 1.4
percent, following a strong 3 percent gain the month before. The
auto industry reported a record 17 million cars and light trucks
sold in 1999 and is projecting robust sales for this year.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile autos category, retail sales went up by
1 percent, stronger than the 0.7 percent gain many analysts
predicted. That followed a 0.5 percent drop in January.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline sales rose by a big 4.3 percent in February,
reflecting higher prices at the pump. That was the largest jump
since a 5 percent gain in April. In January, gas sales fell by 0.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> House Agrees to Arm Swiss Peacekeeping Soldiers Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's House of
Representatives has approved a proposal to allow Swiss soldiers to
carry weapons on peacekeeping missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives voted Tuesday for the proposal by
84 votes to 49, with 30 abstentions, according to Swiss Radio
International. The reform is part of a wider overhaul of
Switzerland's military laws.
</P>
<P>
The ruling paves the way for the bill to go before the Senate.
If approved there, opponents of the reforms will almost certainly
force a nationwide vote on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The president and defence minister, Adolf Ogi, has long
advocated arming Swiss soldiers on missions abroad. Since last
October, the cabinet has been pressing parliament to approve a
change in the law to make this possible.
</P>
<P>
But the issue arouses strong emotions, because it goes to the
very heart of Swiss neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are around 200 unarmed Swiss military
personnel taking part in peacekeeping missions in Kosovo and
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- For the first time in more than
three decades, Britain has overtaken France to become the world's
fourth largest economy, according to the figures released by
Eurostat recently.
</P>
<P>
The EU's statistical agency showed Britain's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew to 1.348 trillion euros in 1999, ahead of
France which recorded an output of 1.347 trillion euros.
</P>
<P>
Britain last boasted a larger economy than its neighbor in 1967,
a position it lost after the devaluation of the pound during that
year.
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1996 Britain even lagged behind Italy in sixth
place in the global economy league table. In 1998, Britain's GDP
was 1.253 trillion euros, lagging France's 1.297 trillion euros.
</P>
<P>
The British Treasury cautioned that figures comparing the size
of economies are volatile and said it had no intention of "crowing
" about Britain's climb in the global league table.
</P>
<P>
"We still want to close the productivity gap with Europe which
remains substantial even with France," a Treasury spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> FDA Grants AstraZeneca Priority Review For NOLVADEX </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) has granted a six-month priority review to
AstraZeneca's cancer drug NOLVADEX for the adjuvant treatment of
ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in women.
</P>
<P>
AstraZeneca said Tuesday it filed a supplemental new drug
application with the FDA for the DCIS indication in December 1999.
Currently, there is no medication approved by the FDA for the
adjuvant treatment of DCIS.
</P>
<P>
DCIS accounts for nearly 20 percent of all newly diagnosed
breast cancer cases. It is a non-invasive breast cancer involving
only the cells lining milk ducts in the breast with no evidence
that the disease has spread outside of these ducts.
</P>
<P>
Until the 1980s, DCIS was treated by mastectomy. Today,options
also include lumpectomy, or the preferred method of lumpectomy
plus radiation therapy, according to AstraZeneca.
</P>
<P>
"If approved for this indication, NOLVADEX's effectiveness will
have been demonstrated across several stages of the breast cancer
continuum from risk reduction in women at high risk to advanced
breast cancer", said Gerard Kennealey, Vice President of Medical
Oncology.

natural disasters linked to climate change.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made available here Tuesday, the conservation
organization urged governments contributing most to the build-up
of global warming gases such carbon dioxide to accept they must
compensate those suffering from its effects.
</P>
<P>
The call comes one week after the dramatic floods in Mozambique
that left thousands stranded, and days after the nine atolls of
the small Pacific island nation Tuvalu were swept over by extreme
high tides.
</P>
<P>
"These are not isolated incidents, and are very likely to occur
more often in a warmer world," said Jennifer Morgan, Director of
WWF's Climate Change Campaign. "Governments have to accept that if
they are not prepared to take domestic measures to reduce their
carbon dioxide emissions, they will have to pay the price."
</P>
<P>
According to WWF, a number of industrialized country
governments already compensate their own citizens for unusual
extreme weather events, and have started to implement climate
adaptation measures at home. But none as yet accepts its
responsibility towards developing countries.
</P>
<P>
None of the western industrialized nations that are responsible
for the bulk of global carbon dioxide emissions has neither
ratified the Kyoto Protocol, agreed upon in December 1997, nor
enacted adequate domestic measures to reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto Protocol requires industrialized nations to reduce
their output of global warming gases five percent below their 1990
levels over the period 2008-2012.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Designs Emergency Plan for Displaced Landmines in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) and the National Institute for Mine
Clearance (IND) in Mozambique Tuesday announced an emergency plan
in response to the problem of landmines displaced by the severe
flooding in the southern African country, UNDP officials said here.
</P>
<P>
The first step of the three months is to identify densely
populated areas at risk of the displaced landmines. Teams of
deminers will be redirected from their regular tasks to collect
data on minefields affected by the floods, and to promote mine
awareness among people in camps for the displaced population.
</P>
<P>
A special team of experts on unexploded ordnance will also be
dispatched to determine the effect of the floods on other
explosives. UNDP and IND will design a new mine action program for
Mozambique, based on the new circumstances caused by the flooding.
</P>
<P>
"The flooding has changed the whole basis for our demining
work in the affected areas," said UNDP Resident Representative
Emmannuel de Casterle.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, mines that were previously marked have been
washed away. Areas that were safe, located downstream from
minefields may now be littered with mines. "They could be one
kilometer downstream, or perhaps 20 kilometers, we just don't know,
" de Casterle said.
</P>
<P>
In Moamba in southern Mozambique, deminers are already
clearing land where the water has receded in order to allow for
reconstruction of a power line and a bridge that was destroyed by
flooding of the Incomati River.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that there are still between one and two
million landmines in Mozambique, hit by the worst floods in 30
years. Last year, 12 people were killed and 48 injured by the
explosives. The landmines were planted during a two-decade civil
war, which ended in 1992.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Peace not Dead, Says Trimble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Pro-British Protestant leader
David Trimble said on Tuesday that high hurdles had to be cleared
to bring lasting peace to Northern Ireland, but the process was
far from dead.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the peace process is ended," the Reuters quoted
Trimble as saying before leading a delegation from his Ulster
Unionist Party to Washington for a series of meetings.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to see how the problems are going to be
resolved when republicans haven't moved," he said. "But we're
going to get out of it."
</P>
<P>
With gloomy signals abounding ahead of the Washington talks,
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson said on Monday there"
had better be some serious discussions to make the visit and
meetings worthwhile".
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein, the IRA's political ally, has warned that the
chances of a resolution this week were "negligible".
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and his right-hand man, Martin
McGuinness, leave for Washington on Wednesday, as will Mandelson
and Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern.
</P>
<P>
Ahern and British Prime Minister Tony Blair -- both key players
in the quest for a political solution -- are set to take the
temperature of the peace process in a phone call on March 20,
after the parties return from Washington.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will meet face-to-face for further talks later
next week at the European Union summit in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
A big issue for the Dublin government is the presence of
British security forces just over the border, particularly in
republican strongholds.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Brian Cowen said on Tuesday the peace
process would be given a shot of life if Britain pulled troops
from border areas -- a move Mandelson has already ruled out.
</P>
<P>
John Hume, a moderate Catholic politician who shared the Nobel
Peace Prize with Trimble for their peace efforts, voiced his
exasperation with the state of the process, saying that after the
Washington trip it was time for "direct dialogue".

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Calls for Adequate Sanitation facilities for All Children  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Tuesday urged leaders and experts
attending the World Water Forum to provide all children with
access to adequate sanitation facilities and hand-washing
materials and facilities.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said that inadequate sanitation facilities and poor
hygiene are global problems that directly contribute to the spread
of preventable diseases. It noted that a lack of separate
facilities for boys and girls often contributes to girls dropping
out of school.
</P>
<P>
"Some 2.4 billion people, nearly half of humanity, are
consigned to life in almost medieval conditions because of unclean
or nonexistent sanitation facilities," UNICEF Executive Director,
Carol Bellamy, said.
</P>
<P>
 "Children have a right to the highest quality health, as
enshrined in the Convention of Rights of The Child. Access to
clean, functioning a safe sanitation facilities is integral to
that right because good sanitation safeguards not only our health
but our human dignity." she said.
</P>
<P>
"Lack of sanitation is simply a public health disaster and an
affront to human dignity," Bellamy added. " The health and lives
of more than half the world's children are at risk due to poor
sanitation systems. It confronts them everywhere. It is vital that
local and national decision-makers take this into account."
</P>
<P>
The 2nd World Water Forum, taking place from March 17-22 in
The Hague, is intended to generate political commitment to improve
water management. As part of its participation, UNICEF is
sponsoring two sessions: the Sanitation Taboo and Global
Environmental sanitation Initiative.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF is an active player in the Global Environmental
Sanitation Initiative, which seeks to raise global awareness and
extend sanitation coverage of all.

<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Media Giant To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 8-billion-dollar cash and stock deal will create a media
giant with the nation's third largest newspaper group, television
stations in the three biggest U.S. markets -- New York, Los
Angeles and Chicago, as well as valuable Internet properties, the
news release said.
</P>
<P>
The combined company will be based in Chicago, keep the Tribune
name, and John Madigan, chairman of Tribune Co., would head the
new company, the Chicago Tribune said Wednesday, adding that it
does not expect any layoffs from the deal.
</P>
<P>
The 116-year-old Los Angeles-based Times Mirror publishes five
metropolitan and two suburban daily newspapers, including The
Baltimore Sun, The Hartford Courant, and The (Stanford) Advocate
and Greenwich Time, serving Connecticut's affluent Fairfield
County.
</P>
<P>
The transaction will mark the end of Times Mirror as a company.
The Chandler family, which owns a majority of the company's voting
shares, has pledged to approve the deal, The Los Angeles Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following completion of the merger, Tribune Company will have
11 daily newspapers, 22 television stations and four radio
stations. The combined company will be one of the largest
providers of interactive news and information services in the U.S.
and the largest multi-media company in four of the nation's five
most populous states--California, New York, Illinois and Florida.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the deal would likely spark speculation about
consolidation in the newspaper business, as so-called "old media"
companies and "new media" Internet companies look for ways to
marry content and Web distribution to reach more consumers.
</P>
<P>
The deal, approved by Times Mirror directors late Sunday, still
must be approved by shareholders and is subject to federal review.
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale follows five years of dramatic changes at
Times Mirror under the stewardship of its chief executive, Mark H.
Willes. After arriving from General Mills in spring 1995, he
closed The (Baltimore) Evening Sun and New York Newsday and sold
off assets that substantially trimmed the company.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street rewarded those moves. The company's stock went from
23.25 dollars in June 1995 to a high of 72.62 dollars in November
1999. Willes pledged even more growth, particularly in the highly
competitive Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
But over the past 18 months, circulation growth was
disappointing and profits lower than expected. By Friday, the
stock had fallen to 47.94 dollars, a 52-week low.

UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. team will leave
this evening for a visit to Cambodia for the negotiations on the
trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the team, led by Hans Corell, Under Secretary-

</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Cambodia have been at odds over who
would be in control of a tribunal to try the former Khmer Rouge
leaders.
</P>
<P>
U.N. legal experts are concerned that Cambodia's legal system
is too weak to guarantee justice on its own.
</P>
<P>
This will be the final round of negotiations and an agreement
with the Cambodia's Government is expected to be reached to ensure
a credible trial that meets minimum international standard.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Calls for Curbing Small Arms Flows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
Tuesday urged the international community to support African
countries' efforts in curbing the proliferation and trafficking of
small arms.
</P>
<P>
"We can not succeed in this endeavor without the support and
cooperation of the international community," he told the Great
Lakes Region and Horn of Africa Conference on the Proliferation of
Small Arms.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, we have to work together to tighten the
controls on sources of financing that sustain illicit arms flows,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Moi called on the participants from nine other African
countries to develop co-ordinated regional programs for effective
controls on legal arms possession, arms transfer by civilians,
disarmament of ex-combatants, retrieval and destruction of surplus
stocks of arms including confiscated illicit weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Great transparency, information exchange and consultation
among countries of the region will be crucial in the efforts to
limit arms flows," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moi called on the participants to consider establishing
national commissions on small arms to enhance the capacity of the
region to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
The four-day regional conference, which started on Sunday, is
expected to come up with a comprehensive agenda to address the
complex challenges facing the region.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and senior officials from Rwanda, Tanzania,
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eritrea, Uganda, the Sudan,
Ethiopia,
Burundi, Djibouti and Kenya attended the conference.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will establish
an African Renaissance and International Cooperation Fund (ARICF)
aimed at assisting other countries on the continent, said Foreign
Affairs Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
She told South African National Assembly that this will allow
the country to play its new role meaningfully and effectively
"within our modest means".
</P>
<P>
Dlamini-Zuma said she will table the ARICF bill in the second
quarter of the parliament's session.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Affairs Department officials earlier said
the fund will also be established to assist the department's work
in a range of areas to promote development, peace and stability in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The fund has an initial amount of 200 million rand (about 33
million U.S. dollars), made up of the remnants of the department's
apartheid-era slush fund.
</P>
<P>
It will be topped up by additional resources from the Finance
Department, and possibly even donations from the private sector,
Dlamini- Zuma said.

JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Tuesday assured Mozambican flood victims that South

<P>
NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Criminal Investigations
Department (CID) of Rwanda has managed to recover about 300 fire
arms from the public, Rwanda News Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted CID sources as saying that the arms have
mainly been recovered from three sources, the first of which is a
group of 30 people who had registered guns and had been authorized
to own them for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
The second source, also the biggest, is demobilized soldiers
who went a way with the guns they had when they were still serving
in the army, while the third source is local leaders who possess
arms from their areas of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, about 200 guns had been recovered in the capital city
of Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Most of these weapons were voluntarily relinquished to the
authorities following the call by the Ministry of Defense to do
so.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on arms possessed by members of the public has
followed reports of insecurity in the country in which an advisor
to President Pasteur Bizimungu was murdered in cold blood.

<HEADLINE> 49 Iraqi Prisoners in Kuwait: Kuwaiti Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said on Tuesday that
there are 49 Iraqi prisoners serving sentences in Kuwaiti central
jail.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Sulaiman Majid Al-Shaheen
said the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) is aware of
their presence and conditions in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuwait is "fully committed to the international laws
regarding the human rights issues and the right of the prisoners to
contact their relatives."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is providing the access to the ICRC to carry the letters
of the Iraqi and other countries' prisoners to their families
wherever they might be, he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
An ICRC regional official said there are over 40 Iraqi detainees
in the Kuwaiti Central Prison and over 2,400 letters were sent from
them to their relatives in Iraq through the ICRC in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kuwaiti minister blamed an Iraqi weekly for
trying to give the world a false impression that there are a large
number of Iraqi prisoners in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The Nabdh Ash-Sharbab weekly said the Iraqi Red Crescent
received 687 letters from Iraqi prisoners in Kuwait in the last two
months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi weekly "is trying to manipulate the facts by saying
that the large number of letters is due to the fact that there are
a large number of Iraqi prisoners in Kuwait," Al-Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Iraq are locked in a dispute over the issue of
prisoners of war (POWs). Kuwait insists that Iraq is still keeping
over 600 Kuwaiti and third country nationals since the 1991 Gulf
war. But Baghdad denied the Kuwaiti claim.
</P>
<P>
A thaw in relations between the two Arab foes can only come
after a breakthrough over the POWs issue, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Maintain Defense Spending at 6 Percent of GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore will maintain its
defense spending at six percent of GDP to ensure the Singapore
Armed Forces(SAF) stands ready to meet any security challenges,
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defense Tony Tan
Keng Yam told the parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a debate over defense spending in the parliament
which began sitting a week ago for debate on the national budget
for the fiscal year 2000, Tony Tan said: "It has long been our
policy to cap the defense spending at six percent of GDP and
maintain this in a steady manner."
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to maintain a suitable level of defense
spending each year to ensure that the SAF stands ready to meet any
security challenges," he added.
</P>
<P>
On SAF role in the past 35 years since its founding, Tony Tan
said that "the SAF has safeguarded our security and given
Singapore more room to adopt policies and take actions which best
serve our interests."
</P>
<P>
He told the parliament that the establishment of the Defense
Science and Technology Agency, which will come into being
Wednesday, will enable Singapore to respond more quickly and
flexibly to technological changes, as well as to transcend
manpower limitations by leveraging on external engineering
expertise from either local or overseas organization.
</P>
<P>
He also called upon all Singaporeans to joint force under the
concept of Total Defense to erect an effective deterrence and to
enhance Singapore's capabilities to deal with a range of non-
conventional threats, such as terrorism, piracy and cyber-attacks.
</P>
<P>
The SAF commands a force of 50,000 soldiers comprising regulars
and full-time National Servicemen and 300,000 Operationally Ready
National Servicemen (NSmen).

<HEADLINE> Itinerary of Clinton's Visit to Bangladesh Yet to Be Finalized: Foreign Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The itinerary of U.S. President
Clinton's day-long visit to Bangladesh on March 20 is yet to be
finalized, Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary C.M. Shafi Sami told a
press briefing at the Foreign Office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reasons for the delay, Sami noted the different
attitudes of both sides toward the itinerary. "While we want to
keep as many programs as possible, the Americans want only those
the president can afford during his short stay here," Sami said.
</P>
<P>
Except the civic reception which has been dropped, discussions
on all other programs proposed by Bangladesh are still continuing,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It was said that the itinerary would take a concrete shape
Tuesday by a foreign ministry spokesman after senior officials of
Bangladesh and the United States held two rounds of talks on the
itinerary of Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on defense cooperation between Dhaka and
Washington which was anticipated earlier by local newspapers to

Forces Agreement (SOFA) has been rejected by Bangladesh, so the
question of discussing it does not arise.

<P>
SOFA and Humanitarian Assistance Need Assessment (HANA),
proposed by the United States, will provide legal cover for the
movement of U.S. armed force personnel and military hardware and
supplies to Bangladesh in times of emergencies if signed by
Bangladeshi government.

<P>
The Foreign Secretary regarded Clinton's visit as "a

importance the United States attaches to Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> S.Lankan President Committed to Peace Despite Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga said here Tuesday night that she was committed to
achieving peace in the war-torn island country despite recent
terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
In her first press conference after winning the second term
last December, President Kumaratunga said the government has
embarked plans to adopt a new constitution to resolve the long-
running ethnic war with separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The president said that the final solution to the Tamil problem
is through a new constitution that guarantees the rights of Tamil
people and devolves extensive power to them.
</P>
<P>
"We only hope ... the LTTE will understand that continued,
unending violence cannot solve the Tamil people's problem," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest violence occurred last Friday evening in eastern
Colombo where eight LTTE suicide bombers failed in their attempt
to target Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte who was in
charge of Sri Lanka's war effort against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year-old war between
majority Sinhalese-dominated government troops and the LTTE rebels
who want to carve out a separate homeland for minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Sri Lanka saw a series of suicide bombings
and bus bombings. President Kumaratunga herself narrowly escaped
assassination last December in a suicide bombing which killed 26
people.

<HEADLINE> Belarussian Parliament Approves Yermoshin as Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Belarussian parliament Tuesday
approved Vladimir Yermoshin as prime minister by a vote of 103
against 95 with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is now at a point where market mechanisms have not
kicked in, while state regulation is not working properly,
Yermoshin told the parliament before the voting, cited by the
Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the national economy will not stabilize any
time soon "without a rational and balanced crediting and monetary
policy, without bringing inflation down to five percent monthly or
a balanced pricing policy," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank must purchase hard currency on the domestic
market and create sufficient gold and currency reserves by issuing
preference securities, Yermoshin told the assembly deputies.
Production expenses must be cut and the quality of products
improved so as to make them more competitive, especially on
foreign markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Minsk will expand the cooperation with international
financial organizations, such as the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister was born in 1942 in Pronsk in Russia's
Ryazan region. He graduated from Novocherkassk Polytechnic in 1964
and from the Academy of Civil Aviation in Leningrad in 1989. He
worked as an engineer and chief technologist in Minsk since 1965,
and later as deputy director of an aircraft building plant.
</P>
<P>
Yermoshin was elected chairman of a Minsk district legislature
in 1990. He became deputy chairman of the Minsk city legislature
in charge of municipal services, energy and construction in 1991
and has chaired the Minsk legislature since 1995. Yermoshin also
serves as a member of the upper house of the Belarussian
parliament.
</P>
<P>
He was nominated prime minister by Belarussian President
Alexander Lukashenko on February 18.

ATHENS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Greek equity prices Tuesday
plunged to their lowest levels since last August, with the general
index on the Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) dropping 6.60 percent to
4,542.65 points.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE/ASE 20 index ended at 2,577.96 points, down 6.18
percent, while the FTSE/ASE 40 index ended 7.01 percent lower at

Turnover was a low 165 billion drachmas (about 482 million U.S.
dollars) and decliners led advancers by 329 to eight with another
four issues unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Economy and Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou
Tuesday attributed the continuing decline in the stock market to
political elements during the country's pre-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The participants believed that efforts to link the stock
market with politics were the reason for the current negative
climate in the market, the minister said after a meeting with
heads of the country's banks, ASE and the Capital Market Committee.
</P>
<P>
He urged all those not participating in the bourse's
procedures to let it operate unhindered, and called on retail
investors to remain confident on the country's economic course.

<HEADLINE> Nepalese Minister Resigns As Pressure Mounts on PM to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Nepalese Minister for Commerce
and Parliamentary Affairs Ram Krishna Tamrakar resigned Tuesday,
and his resignation has been accepted by King Birendra, a palace
announcement said.
</P>
<P>
 Tamrakar's quit came when ruling Nepali Congress Party
lawmakers Tuesday stepped up pressure on Prime Minister Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai after he reneged on his promise to step down by
Monday.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the governing party lawmakers, blaming
Bhattarai for inept administration, deteriorating law and order,
filed a fresh petition asking the prime minister to quit
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Bhattarai, 76, became prime minister last May after the Nepali
Congress won 113 seats in the 205-seat lower house of parliament,
but 69 party legislators revolted against his leadership last
month.
</P>
<P>
 The 69 members of parliament late Tuesday registered a no-
confidence motion against Bhattarai at the Nepali Congress
Parliamentary Party, and the motion is expected to be considered
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in three weeks that the disgruntled
legislators have staged open rebellion against the prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Foundation Set Up to Help Insurance Policy Holders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Insurance policy holders in the
port city of Xiamen in east China's Fujian Province will have less
to worry about in disputes with their underwriters thanks to a
foundation that was established here today.
</P>
<P>
The foundation was set up with one million yuan (about 120,000
U.S. dollars) of funding.
</P>
<P>
At the foundation's launching ceremony, the Xiamen branch of
the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC) announced new
business terms favorable to its clients.
</P>
<P>
Under these terms, when clients believe the branch has not
given them sufficient compensation after suffering losses, they
can seek justice from the Xiamen Arbitration Committee.
</P>
<P>
If the committee rules that the clients are correct in disputes
with the branch, the branch is then obliged to pay unconditionally
within seven days.
</P>
<P>
If the clients lose, the Xiamen branch will shoulder part of
the arbitration costs.
</P>
<P>
The foundation, the first of its kind in China, has been set up
in line with international practices by which clients have greater
guarantees for their legal rights, said Zhao Yiping who heads the
PICC branch.
</P>
<P>
Initially, the foundation will mainly help clients who have
their cars and family property insured.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the establishment of such a foundation will
help insurance policy holders receive compensation more easily and
promptly.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Calls for Write-off of Mozambique's Foreign Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The southern African leaders on
Tuesday appealed to the international community to cancel all
foreign debts owed by Mozambique to enable it to channel all
available resources to the reconstruction of infrastructure
destroyed by a month-long flood.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in the final communique issued at the
end the one-day extraordinary summit of the heads of state and
government of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
held in the Mozambican capital Maputo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the summit was to review the impact of the
floods caused by cyclone weather conditions on the countries of
SADC, particularly on Mozambique. The prevailing emergency
situation in the affected countries was also reviewed, the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
The summit expressed the need for the establishment of a
regional institutional mechanism for disaster preparedness and
management which would respond timely to similar situations.
</P>
<P>
This mechanism would also be responsible for mobilizing
resources that would be used to obviate the effects of disasters
whenever they occur.
</P>
<P>
The summit called on the international community to provide
long term support to such mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The summit also adopted additional measures to support the
affected population and to strengthen the regional coordination
mechanism in order to trigger off the reconstruction of
Mozambique and other counties affected in the region.
</P>
<P>
The leaders expressed deep sorrow and regret at the loss of
hundreds of lives as a result of the floods.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that some two million people were affected not
only in Mozambique, but also in South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe,
Zambia and Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
The summit expressed concern at the massive destruction of the
crops as well as livestock and damage to infrastructure such as
schools and hospitals, water supply systems, power lines, railway
lines, roads, bridges and telecommunication networks.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by the presidents of Botswana, Malawi,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania and Zambia as well as
the representatives of Lesotho, Swaziland, Angola, Zimbabwe and
Mauritius.

OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian House of Commons
Monday began voting on a bill aimed at making separation attempts
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Members of the parliament are expected to spend about 30
straight hours in the process of voting 411 amendments to the
draft legislation, which was tabled last December by the ruling
Liberal government.
</P>
<P>
The Bloc Quebecois, the only party uniformly opposed to the
bill, has proposed 403 amendments while the other three opposition
parties added eight more to stall the legislation.
</P>
<P>
The roll-call voting will last until Wednesday morning as every
MP rises in turn for a total of 411 times to signify their vote.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed Clarity Bill, the Liberal government's Bill C-20
enshrines into law a 1998 Supreme Court decision that found Quebec
must win a clear majority from a clearly-worded question before it
can separate from Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We need a clear question and a clear majority," said Prime
Minister Jean Chretien last December.
</P>
<P>
The Clarity Bill immediately met with a counter-attack from
Quebec separatists who unveiled legislation in Quebec City
reaffirming their right to declare independence in the fashion it

<HEADLINE> Japan's Three Big Banks to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's three major banks, Sanwa
Bank, Tokai Bank and Asahi Bank Tuesday announced an agreement to
integrate their operations next year under a joint holding company
to create Japan's second largest bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the three banks will become wholly owned
subsidiaries of the holding company in April 2001 and they
envisage integrating their wholesale, international and investment
banking businesses within two years.
</P>
<P>
After integrating their operations, the alliance would have
combined assets of 106.6 trillion yen (about 1010.4 billion
dollars), second in scale in Japan to the 135 trillion yen (1279.6
billion dollars) of the Mizuho Financial Group to be created this
fall by Fuji Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank and the Industrial Bank of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
It will be the world's third largest banking group, following
the Mizuho group and Deutsche Bank of Germany, which will be
formed in July through a merger of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank.
</P>
<P>
Tokai Bank's Ogasawara will assume the presidency of the new
joint holding company, while Sanwa Bank President Kaneo Muromachi
and Asahi Bank's Ito will jointly chair its board, the banks said.
</P>
<P>
Asahi, Tokai and Sanwa Banks have strong regional footings in
the Tokyo metropolitan area, including the Chubu region centering
on Nagoya in central Japan and the Kansai area surrounding Osaka
in western Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tokai and Asahi announced comprehensive business collaboration
in September 1998 and unveiled in October 1999 a plan to set up a
joint holding company to become a major multi-regional bank group,
which have drawn Sanwa's interest.
</P>
<P>
With the merger of the three banks, Japan's major commercial
banks with nationwide networks will be consolidated into four
groups --Mizuho, the Sanwa-Tokai-Asahi group, a bank to be created
by Sumitomo Bank and Sakura Bank, and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.

</P>
<P>
That competition in both taekwondo and boxing is done by weight
categories has somewhat leveled the playing field, according to
the PTA chief, enabling Filipinos to overcome whatever
disadvantages they may have against their opponents in terms of
height or size.
</P>
<P>
"I would prefer that taekwondo win the country's first Olympic
gold but as a Filipino, it really doesn't matter which sport does
it first. The important thing is we win a gold medal in the Games,
" Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
"Together with fellow jins Eva Marie Ditan and Jasmine Strachan,
Geisler and Cruz are currently in deep training in Seoul under a
Korean coach who is a former world champion," Aventajado said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Amateur Boxing Association of the Philippines
president Manny lopez said his group is working to qualify "a
minimum of five and a maximum of seven" fighters in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Three Filipino pugs are so far assured of Olympic berths, and
Lopez is confident they can clinch a few more spots in next month'
s King's Cup in Bangkok, the final Olympic qualifying tournament
for Asians.
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to duplicate, if not surpass the silver medal
performance of Onyok Velasco in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics," he
said.

<HEADLINE> PAL Posts 2.46 Mln U.S. Dollars Profit in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) will
celebrates its 59th anniversary Wednesday with an upbeat report of
a 98.3-million-peso (2.46 million U.S. dollars) net income for
January 2000.
</P>
<P>
The figure is marginally higher than its rehabilitation plan
target for the month, and helps ensure that the flag carrier stays
on course to end its fiscal year on March 31 with a better-than-
projected bottom-line, the PAL said Tuesday in a report.
</P>
<P>
The anniversary celebration Wednesday marks PAL's first year of
operating under a strict, 10-year rehabilitation program
supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
Exactly a year ago, the airline submitted to the SEC an amended
rehabilitation plan under which its 2.2 billion dollars debt is
being restructured. The document has since served as the blueprint
for PAL's recovery.
</P>
<P>
PAL's January profit of 98.3 million pesos was 1 million pesos
(25,000 dollars) better than the budget estimate of 97.3 million
pesos (2.43 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
January was the second month in a row for the PAL to surpass
its net income target, indicating improved operating and financial
performance vis-a-vis its rehabilitation plan benchmarks, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
In December 1999, the airline posted a profit of 240.4 million
pesos (6 million dollars), overshooting its goal of 182 million
pesos (4.55 million dollars) for the month.
</P>
<P>
However, the outlook for the fiscal year ending March 31
remained unpredictable as the price of aviation fuel -- the single
biggest item in PAL's expenditure list -- continued its upward
trend, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The airline's rehabilitation plan projects a net loss of 16.4
million U.S.dollars for the 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In last fiscal year ending March 1999, the PAL posted 10.18
billion (254.5 million dollars) pesos in losses.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Lahore Process "Re-energized": U.S. Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
favors the Lahore peace process between India and Pakistan to be "
re-energized" and the Kashmir issue addressed between the
leadership of both countries "at the highest level," U.S.
ambassador to India Richard Celeste said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Lahore process as a "solid base" for India and
Pakistan to move forward to resolve differences, Celeste said that
Clinton, who is expected to come here for a five-day visit next
week, looks forward to that process being re-energized.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the way to address the Kashmir issue is between the
leadership of India and Pakistan taking into account the interest
of the people of Kashmir," said the U.S. ambassador. "We believe
this should be addressed at the highest level."
</P>
<P>
Washington had strongly supported Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee's initiative when he went to Lahore, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that differences exist between India and
the United States in their perceptions on the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman said
here Tuesday that India's position on the Kashmir issue is "well
known" and reiterated that "there is no role of any kind for a
third party."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Clinton's decision to take a brief stopover in
Pakistan following his India visit, the U.S. ambassador said: "We
have a long time relationship of friendship with the people of
Pakistan and the U.S. has important interests and concerns at
stake there."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's India visit would seek to amplify Vajpayee's
description of India and the U.S. as "natural allies" during his
visit to New York in September, 1998, said Celeste, adding that
the two sides have to explore how this could be translated into
mutual action.

<HEADLINE> Second TV Station Operational in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The second privately owned TV
station came into the air on Monday night in the Somali capital of
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The Somali Television Network (STN) was opened by a group of
Somali businessmen living in and outside the country without a
central administration within a week after the first TV station
called HornAfrique with six channels.
</P>
<P>
The people of Mogadishu can now enjoy watching the STN which
has 22 channels, one Somali speaking channel and the rest in
English, Arabic and French.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the HornAfrique television, the STN has the BBC World,
two Indian channels, one sport, a cartoon network for the
children and a religious channel.
</P>
<P>
The director of the STN, Abdurahman Robleh Ulayareh, told
journalists in his headquarters on Monday night said they mean
business and will give their spectators a great deal of variety.
</P>
<P>
Many of Mogadishu citizens are now considering taking out a
subscription for the new television, which is much cheaper than
HornAfrique.
</P>
<P>
According to Omar Hassan Abdi, the program director of the STN,
the Somali channel will be on the air for six hours beginning from
6:00 p.m. until mid night, while the rest of the channels will be
running 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
The Somali channel of the STN mainly concentrates on the
cultural events, songs, poetry and interviews with Somali artists
and traditional leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We think we can help our country get through the civil strive
through our efforts in encouraging the peace talks and holding
constructive political debates," said Abdi.

<HEADLINE> EU Anti-Muffler Law to Be in Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said on
Tuesday that its law against aircraft engine mufflers would be in
force on May 4, despite a U.S. challenge.
</P>
<P>
The law bans from 2002 all non-EU aircraft fitted with the
noise-reducing device.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc decided to limit the use of older aircraft
that use engine mufflers or hush kit to reduce noise, saying that
while reducing noise pollution, the mufflers were not effective in
controlling air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans also believed that the mufflers cannot reduce
noise sufficiently and merely prolong the life of old-type
aircraft which should have been taken out of service altogether.
</P>
<P>
The United States had insisted that the EU withdraw the noise
muffler law or suspend it, while the EU argued it would suspend
the law on guarantees that the United States was serious about
agreeing to new international noise pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
The United States took the EU law on hush kit as discriminating
against American airlines that re-sell aircraft with mufflers in
Europe and against hush kit makers that are all based in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said earlier that it had planned
to file a complaint on the EU muffler law with the International
Civil Aviation Organization.

<HEADLINE> EU Steps up De-mining Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) decided
on Tuesday to step up its anti-personnel landmine program of de-
mining and mine destruction in the next six years.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, mapped out its action against anti-personnel landmines and
promised at least another 180 million euro (about 174.6 million U.
S. dollars) for the period of 2000 to 2006.
</P>
<P>
The EU, planning to eliminate landmines world-wide within the
next 10-15 years, tried to improve the overall efficiency of its
mine actions so as to reinforce the EU's capacity to contribute to
the achievement of the objectives under the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of
Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction that came into force
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Christopher Patten, EU external relations commissioner, said
that anti-personnel landmines continue to produce appalling
casualties in many parts of the world and constitute serious
obstacles to economic, security and social development.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective is to do away with the scourge of landmines
world-wide within the next 10 to 15 years at the latest," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU started in 1992 to support activities of de-mining and
mine destruction, and provide assistance to mine victims as well
as research and development of technology in countries that have
suffered from the landmine problem.

<HEADLINE> Migrant Workers Keen on Science and Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Shude and his wife, who
came from a village years ago and now run a grocery store in
southern Beijing, buy and read newspapers every day this week to
catch the latest information about the ongoing National People's
Congress (NPC) and Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the couple has been concerned about
government affairs since they came to the city six years ago from
their hometown in Hubei Province in central China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is most interested in the government's attempt to "
rejuvenate the nation by relying on science and education."
Though he only went to elementary school, Zhang fully understands
the importance of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"When I came here six years ago, all I wanted was to make a
living in this big city," he said, "but now I am seeking some new
and science-oriented products for my store, because there are
about a dozen groceries nearby selling almost the same things."
</P>
<P>
Along with Zhang, over 1.69 million farmers have left their
fields to work in Beijing, a city of more than 10 million. Like
migrant birds, they work in the city, return to their hometown
during the Spring Festival, and then go back to work again.
</P>
<P>
This group of migrant birds appeared a decade or so ago when
the economy started to boom and the gap between city and
countryside began to widen. In the past few years, tens of
millions of farmers, mostly young, have joined this group to seek
their fortune in the cities.
</P>
<P>
Though differing each from the other, these birds basically
have two points in common: most of them come from very
underdeveloped areas, especially the rural areas in central and
western China; and they are almost all poorly educated.

<HEADLINE> Recreation Becomes a Big Tax Payer in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Recreation centers across China
turned over more than two billion yuan (241 million U.S. dollars)
in taxes to the state last year, according to a national
conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
China now has 179,000 recreation centers employing more than
one million people.
</P>
<P>
Recreation is now gaining an ever larger share of the country's
service industry, and its workforce and capital account for 70
percent of China's cultural market, said Liu Shengli, an official
with the Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
This development is expected to play a vital role in increasing
domestic demand and boosting cultural development in the future,
he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the country still intends to take effective measures
to rectify the recreation market, with special concern about
growing pornography and gambling services.
</P>
<P>
A work team composed of public security, industry and commerce,
and cultural departments has been set up in each province and
autonomous region to institute unified management of recreation
centers, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang Celebrates Corban Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Muslims in
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China, gathered today
at a government-organized party to celebrate the Corban Festival,
one of the most important Islamic holidays.
</P>
<P>
The Corban Festival falls on the tenth day of the last month of
the Hui (Chinese Muslim) calendar.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenyue, deputy secretary of the regional committee of the
Communist Party of China, extended festival greetings to all
Muslims on behalf of the local government.
</P>
<P>
"People of all nationalities in Xinjiang scored new
achievements in economic reforms and the modernization, despite
many natural disasters last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The central government's decision to accelerate the development
of western China offers a rare historical opportunity for Xinjiang
's development, and people of Xinjiang should seize this
opportunity to make the region more prosperous, he added.

<P>
The latest information from Beijing's statistical department
shows that of the 2.16 million new arrivals in the city, some 1.64
million, or 76 percent, have only a secondary school education or
less. Experts believe that most of them will have trouble finding
work in the high-tech era.
</P>
<P>
Officials with Beijing's public security authorities said that
only 950,000 work licenses will be issued to migrant workers this
year, and those who are not licensed will be considered illegal if
they do work in Beijing. More than one million of them have to
leave Beijing, even though some once helped to construct the newly
transformed Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Facing job pressure, the migrant birds, unlike a decade ago,
are eager to arm themselves with new knowledge.
</P>
<P>
"You can only depend on yourself, and many of us have started
to learn practical skills, such as foreign languages, computer,
and even law," said Ren Guangkuo, a young migrant woman in her
early 20s from northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yadong, who is in charge of rural affairs in the Ministry
of Labor and Social Security, said that professional training is
the key for migrant workers to meet the needs in cities.
</P>
<P>
An official document, titled "Suggestions for Rural Labors
Working Away From Their Hometowns" issued by the ministry early
this year, calls for more efforts to help migrant workers raise
the level of work skills and abilities by reinforcing professional
education, with new technology and practical skills as the main
content.
</P>
<P>
The government will set up a system offering training program
for those young high school graduates in the provinces who expect
to work in the cities, Wang said.

<P>
Also, the adaptability and competitiveness of Chinese
enterprises were greatly enhanced during the financial crisis, he
added.
</P>
<P>
However, just as China's Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Shi Guangsheng pointed out yesterday in a press
conference, factors affecting and restricting China's foreign
trade still exist, including uncertainties, aggravated trade
protectionism, and a still delicate and fragile situation for
economic growth in the Asian countries hit by the recent financial
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that 3 percent growth in foreign trade is attainable
this year, but it will take hard work to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
However, it should be noted that the average monthly export
volume of the first two months was no more than the average
monthly volume of the last six months of 1999, which stood at
about 17 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts explain that foreign trade volume in January and
February is usually low due to the Chinese Spring Festival. "But
this year was an exception, which is pleasing," according to one
analyst.

<HEADLINE> Iran Regrets Extension of U.S. Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday expressed regret
over the recent U.S. decision to renew economic sanctions against
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The decision was in contradiction with recent remarks of some U.
S. officials and proved a lack of sincerity on the part of the U.S.
government toward Iran, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi
said.
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that the sanctions had inflicted the
greatest damage to U.S. companies and firms, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has reportedly extended a ban on
American oil contracts with Iran, accusing Tehran of continuing to
support international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions introduced in 1995 bar U.S. companies from
investing in Iran's oil and natural gas industry, and aim to halt
all U.S. exports to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The decision to extend the restrictions came less than a month
after reformists in Iran won an overwhelming victory over their
conservative opponents in parliamentary elections, a development
welcomed by western countries including the U.S..
</P>
<P>
After the elections, U.S. officials have repeated their desire
to hold direct talks with Iran. There has been speculation that the
sanctions might be relaxed as an overture to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. newspaper also reported that the United States might
consider lifting a ban on Iran's three major non-oil exports -
carpets, pistachios and caviar.
</P>
<P>
Iran has welcomed possible U.S. overtures, but insists that the
U.S. must take concrete steps to prove its sincerity in improving
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two countries severed diplomatic relations 20 years ago
following the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by radical
students in the heyday of the Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> Israel not to Transfer Anata Village to PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Israel will not transfer the
Anata village close to Jerusalem to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) in a third troop redeployment in the West Bank
under the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal, said Prime Minister's Office
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Israeli Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh will submit Tuesday
the revised maps of the 6.1 percent of the West Bank territories
that Israel plans to hand over to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the map included three villages close to
the Jerusalem, including Anata which lies to the northeast of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The other two Palestinian villages that Barak agreed to transfer
to the PNA are Ubeidiya and Beitunia.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak decided not to transfer
the Anata village to the Palestinians, the office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The unity of Jerusalem remains the top priority to the
government, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the villages was a compromise between
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who had earlier demanded three
other villages near East Jerusalem, and Barak.
</P>
<P>
Beitunia is a neighborhood near the West Bank city of Ramallah
and Ubeidiya is located to the southeast of Jerusalem and to the
northeast of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Barak is scheduled to present the maps to the security cabinet
for approval on Wednesday.

barriers on food imports, the EU will apply a tax of 15 to 20
percent on Turkey's duty-free food products.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government is prohibiting the importation of 19,000

domestic meat producers will suffer financial hardship.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey earned about 43 billion liras (74 million
dollars) from trade of Iraqi diesel over the last five months in
violation of the United Nations sanctions on Iraq.
</P>

CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's new housing sales in the private sector in
1999 reached 15,920 units, 3 percent more than the figure for 1998,
said the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CBS said that half of the sales were finalized within seven
months after the houses were built. But on average, it now takes
longer to sell a new apartment. The average time between the start
of construction and the sales stretched to 10.2 months in 1999,
compared with 9.8 months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel spends proportionally more on research and
development than all other developed countries except Sweden and
Japan, according to figures issued Monday by the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
The latest data for international comparisons is for 1997, and
is based on the percentage of research and development expenditures
in the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Israel was tied with Finland for third place, with an
expenditure of 2.8 percent of GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's industrial output remained flat in the
last quarter of 1999, indicating that the economic recovery in the
country may not be all that strong, said the Manufacturers
Association Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The output for the last quarter showed no change from the third
quarter, and it increased by only 1.3 percent on an annualized
rate, the association added.
</P>
<P>
But in the second half of 1999, the industrial output rose
significantly at an annualized rate of 4.9 percent. Industrial
exports during this period, excluding diamonds, increased 8 percent
in real terms. The industrial export recovery in the second half of
the year was mainly due to growth in high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's unemployment rate reached 13.5 percent during
the current Iranian calendar year (ending on March 19), up about 1
percent compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
Those aged between 20 and 24 years are at the top of the list of
the unemployed, according to Abbas-Ali Zali, head of Iran's
Statistics Organization.
</P>
<P>
He added that 90.38 percent of the job-hunters are literate and
some 7.59 percent of the total number of the unemployed have
received higher education.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iranian President Mohammed Khatami on Monday
inaugurated a methanol plant in the country's southern Bushehr
Province, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The plant, which has an annual production capacity of 660,000
tons, sprawls over an area of four hectares and took 48 months to
complete.
</P>
<P>
It was built by Iranian specialists at a cost of more than 300
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: Philippines to Be Declared Polio-free This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Children's Fund (
UNICEF) Executive Director Carol Bellamy said here Tuesday that
the Philippines is likely to be declared a "polio-free country"
this year.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF head who ended her three-day Manila visit Tuesday
cited the enormous progress the Philippines has made in helping
rid the country of the polio menace that threatened its children
population for decades.
</P>
<P>
Citing UNICEF reports, Bellamy said that in the last decade the
country has made progress towards polio eradication and is likely
to be certified "polio-free" country this year.
</P>
<P>
She said the Philippines has been a great partner of UNICEF in
the last 50 years which has made possible many achievements for
children.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy also cited related achievements made by the government
in maintaining and protecting Filipino children.
</P>
<P>
These includes, she said, reducing infant mortality rate to 35
per 1,000 live births, which surpassed the 50 per 1,000 live
births target set by the UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
She also noted that all hospitals and maternity facilities in
the country have been certified baby-friendly.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, the issue of moderate malnutrition remains a
challenge and affects the child's ability to learn. The problem
needs the response from both the government and the family, she
said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Invited to Take Part in Slovokia's Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian entrepreneurs are
invited to take part in the process of privatization in Slovakia,
visiting Slovak Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are still in the process of privatization, we need foreign
investments, and the participation of Malaysian companies are
definitely welcome," he told a press conference at the end of his
two-day official visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak foreign minister said foreign investors are welcome
to take part in Slovakia's privatization process, particularly in
the fields of telecommunication and banking sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the purpose of his first official visit here was to
revive the relations and cooperation between the two countries. So
his talks with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and other
senior government officials focused mainly on how the two
countries could strengthen concrete bilateral relations, besides
exchanging views on international issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Both sides discussed the possible cooperation in the field of
tourism and arms producing industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he discussed with them the possible three agreements --
on trade, on investment protection and promotion and on avoidance
of double taxation -- between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was generally recommended that the economic and
trade ministers of the two countries exchange visits to promote
economic cooperation which is beneficial to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his satisfaction over the results of the visit, he
said the visit further consolidated the foundation of bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Mahathir could visit Slovakia, to whom he
extended the invitation on behalf of his prime minister.
</P>
<P>
To a question on what kind of cooperation in the field of arms
producing industry could be, he said that besides the possible
export of arms by Slovakia to Malaysia, the cooperation could be
joint ventures in arms production and Slovakia's involvement in
maintenance of weapons Malaysia bought from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Kukan leaves here late Tuesday night for Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Workers to Get 10 Percent Wage Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Some one million national
government workers will get their 10 percent salary increase for
January to March by the end of the month, the Philippine
government said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Benjamin Diokno of the Department of Budget and
Management said he has signed a directive to start releasing the
Notice of Cash Allocation to government agencies.
</P>
<P>
"The total amount is 3 billion peso (75 million U.S. dollars).
This will cover the salary differential of government workers from
January 1 to March 31," Diokno said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country's one million government employees
will get their three months' salary differential by March 31.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada assured government workers
last year he would grant them a 10 percent across-the-board salary
increase to replace the amelioration pay.
</P>
<P>
He said the amelioration pay benefited only employees of
agencies with forced savings and has short-term benefits while the
10 percent across-the-board increase would be granted to all
national government employees and has long-term benefits.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Diokno said local government units can also grant a
similar 10 percent across-the-board increase to their employees
since their internal revenue allotments have also been increased.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Unemployment Rate Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The economic upturn brought
down Singapore's unemployment rate to 2.9 percent for December
1999 from the 4.4 percent at the end of 1998 with the total
unemployment contracting to 63,100 people from 88,700 a year
earlier, according to data released by the Manpower Research and
Statistics Department of the Ministry of Manpower.
</P>
<P>
The data shows that total employment in 1999 expanded by 39,876,
a sharp reversal from a net loss of 23,384 jobs in 1998, while
retrenchment dropped by half to 14,622 from a record high of 29,
086 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It also shows that the number of job vacancies as at December
1999 totaled 21,965, a marked increase of 74 percent over the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
But unemployment and job openings are still some way from the
pre-crisis levels of about 2 percent and 40,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
It attributes the sharp recovery in Singapore's labor market to
the strong economic recovery growing at 5.4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The data expects a better employment outlook for 2000 on
account that sustained improvement in economic conditions will
have a favorable impact on the labor market.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Crashed Plane Pulled Out of Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The wreckage of the
Sudanese cargo plane which plunged into Lake Victoria last month
has been pulled out without causing environmental damage, the
Guardian newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The debris of the ill-fated aircraft had been ferried to
Tanzania's northwest town of Mwanza. And the 4,000 liters of fuel
in the plane's tanks had also been safely discharged and kept in
containers, the Mwanza Airport Manager Deogratias Malongo told the
paper on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Only the plane's tail still remains in the lake and it is hoped
that it will be removed very soon, said the manager.
</P>
<P>
Malongo said the uphill task to retrieve the plane, a Boeing
707 owned by Trans Arabia Air Transport of Khartoum, Sudan, had
been done by a Mombasa-based company.
</P>
<P>
An option to cut the ill-fated plane in pieces was taken after
initial retrieval attempts by local companies in the Mwanza
municipality were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
The task began after Lloyd's Aviation, a London-based aviation
insurance company that supervised the removal of the wreckage, had
secured a green light from the Tanzania Airport Authority, after
it had put in place precautionary measures against environmental
degradation.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd's Aviation had assured Tanzania Airports Authority that
there would not be any environmental damage during the retrieval
of the damaged aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The plane crash-landed on the lake about four kilometers away
from the runway of Mwanza airport on February 3. All five crew
members escaped unhurt.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has killed over
127,000 house crows over the past three years, the Guardian
newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wildlife Conservation Society of Tanzania
(WCST), since it began an operation to control the spread of the
black house crows in 1997, over 32,000 birds were killed in Dar es
Salaam and 95,000 more killed in Zanzibar by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
WCST chief conservationist Paul Nnyiti said that there are
nearly 100 traps in various spots in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He added that WCST had decided to put up traps throughout the
city to amplify the fight against the birds which have proved to
be aggressive predators of local birds and domestic poultry.
</P>
<P>
The offensive birds were introduced to East Africa in the
latter part of 19th century and have since then become a major
pest in coastal cities like Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar, creating
an abnormality in the ecosystem.

renowned social scientists and the country's former Chairman of

Almost all Nigeria's major newspapers on Tuesday carried
articles mourning the passing away of the forerunner of the
democratic and anti- corruption crusade in the Africa's most
populous country.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper quoted Awa's family as saying in Lagos
that the great man passed away at a hospital in the United Sates,
where he had been accepting treatment for some time.
</P>
<P>
Awa graduated from several universities in the U.S. and
Britain, and later taught in almost every major universities in
Nigeria as professor of Political Science.

1989 Constituent Assembly polls.
</P>
<P>
A highly principled man, he was reluctant to cooperate with the
 corruptive military regime and was removed from the post on
March, 1989. But the short period of office earned him fame as an
democratic and anti- corruption forerunner, according to the
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, he suggested that corruption should be tamed through
the enactment of a law declaring corrupted officers will be
sentenced to no less than 15 years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
He was enthusiastic supporter of the anti-corruption bill
President Olusegun Obasanjo submitted to the National Assembly
immediately after taking office last May.

MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- An American player for a
Philippine professional basketball team will be deported for
showing disrespect to the Philippine national flag and anthem,
immigration chief Rufus Rodriguez said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Matthew Mitchell Gaerlan of San Antonio, Texas, will not be
allowed to re-enter the country and his name will be blacklisted,
Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
Gaerlan, a player for the Cebu Gems in the Manila Basketball

national anthem while the Philippine anthem was being played
during a flag ceremony October 19 at Cebu's Mactan International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Gaerlan ignored an airport information officer's effort to stop
him.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez described the move as "gross disrespect to the
Filipino flag and the national anthem."
</P>
<P>
Although Gaerlan later apologized, but the immigration bureau
decided to deport him "to send a message that foreigners here
should behave."
</P>
<P>
However, Gaerlan will not immediately be deported because his
lawyer has appealed the decision to President Joseph Estrada,
Rodriguez said.

<HEADLINE> China Has Good Beginning in Foreign Trade (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Following the release of official
foreign trade statistics for the first two months of this year,
the chances of China reaching the year's target of a 3 percent
increase is considered good.
</P>
<P>
A news release by the General Administration of Customs (GAC)
yesterday revealed that China's foreign trade volume in January
and February totaled 60.3 billion U.S. dollars, surging 47.1
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports in January and February reached 31.6 billion U.S.
dollars, up 41.2 percent, while imports stood at 28.7 billion U.S.
dollars, up 54.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The two months had the highest exports growth rate since the
beginning of the Asian financial crisis, and export value for both
months hits all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
Along with the rapid increase in the export volume of
engineering and textile products, China's exports to its top ten
trading partners also grew, those to Hong Kong and South Korea, in
particular, both rising by over fifty percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts argue that China's foreign trade in the first two
months has inherited the strong momentum of the recovery of the
last six months last year, and that these achievements are not
surprising.
</P>
<P>
Researcher Li Jian, a specialist on China's foreign trade, said
that the most important reason is the accelerated economic
recovery in Asia, as Asian countries have gradually come out of
the financial crisis and their foreign trade is increasing.

<P>
Asia has been the traditional major export market for China,
and China's exports to Asia took up about 60 percent of the total
before the crisis erupted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the global economy had no wide recession as expected,
but rather rose steadily, and international market demand rose
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
In China, the economy continues to develop and state-owned-
enterprises are improving, as many enterprises and foreign-trade
companies have significantly enhanced their capability in
preparation for international competition. At the same time, the
country continues to adopt positive financial policies, which in
turn are helping improve the domestic environment for foreign
trade.
</P>
<P>
A series of policies aimed at stimulating foreign trade issued
by the Chinese government have been successful, and were directly
responsible for rescuing the country's foreign trade out of a
relatively short down period.
</P>
<P>
Looking at this year's foreign trade situation, Li said he is
confident of achieving the goal of a 3 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
"China's foreign trade environment is further improving," he
said, noting that "the global economy is growing steadily, Asia is
further recovering, and, particularly, China is accelerating the
process in its bid to enter the World Trade Organization."

<HEADLINE> New Measures for Improving Education in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will spend
800 million yuan to stimulate education in the western region of
the country this year, an official from the Ministry of Education
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry already has listed ten measures to support
education development in the west, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The central government will provide more funding for developing
primary school education in the west after a total investment of 1.
6 billion yuan for improving compulsory education there over the
last two years, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The immense western territory covers Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu,
Qinghai, Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, Ningxia Hui, Xinjiang Uygur
and Tibet autonomous regions, and Chongqing Municipality, with a
total area of 5.4 million square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to step up development in
the western region of the country for an overall growth of the
national economy after the rapid development in the eastern and
southern coastal areas in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will also help west China to improve
school facilities with World Bank loans and donations from
international organizations. One hundred schools in eastern China
have been selected to work with 100 schools in the west to improve
their education level.
</P>
<P>
Long-distance education and training of middle and primary
school leaders in west China are also listed high on the agenda of
the ministry, which has allocated 80 million yuan to support long-
distance education in the west this year.
</P>
<P>
Scholars and experts are encouraged to work in west China, and
the ministry will give them preferential treatment, the official
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has to tap its own advantages in order to remain
invincible in tense international competition, the president said,
pointing to a comprehensive utilization of resources, markets,
technologies, intellectual resources and mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the eastern and western China each has its own
favorable factors, Jiang said the question is to map out
development strategies in a true-to-fact manner in a bid to use
fully the existing advantages and turn potential advantages into
genuine ones.
</P>
<P>
He urged leading officials to follow the Party's hard-working
and down-to-earth style in a united effort to lead the masses of
people in doing a good job in implementing economic strategic
restructuring, scientific, technological and set-up innovations,
state-owned enterprise reform, and carrying out the develop-the-
west strategy, as well as advancing both material and socialist
ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
"Facing the advent of booming modern economy-oriented hi-techs,
no progress simply means retrogress. So, we must seize the chance
to speed development, and try our utmost to catch up," Jiang said,
calling for more intensified efforts for developing hi-techs and
attaining leaps and bounds in technological progress.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, "We should give full scope to the
superiority of Communist Party leadership and socialist system,
and consciously advance the process in which China's productive
forces and relations of production will be made to adapt to and
help each other."
</P>
<P>
At no time can the central status of economic development be
wavered and, if other social undertakings are not grasped well
simultaneously, economic growth will, in turn, be affected and
undermined, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for further endeavors to be made on education
concerning patriotism, collectivism, socialism, and hard work, so
as to perform continuous, new feats in the new century.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Britain to Cooperate in Fighting Terrorism, Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Sadettin Tantan, Turkish minister
of interior, said on Tuesday that Turkey and Britain will sign a
Security Cooperation Agreement, an important step for jointly
fighting terrorism and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Tantan, who is on a three-day official visit to Britain, made
the remarks following talks with his British counterpart Jack
Straw, the Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He defined the first day contacts as "very productive," adding
that the Security and Cooperation Agreement has come to the stage
of signature thanks to the determined attitude of the British
government.
</P>
<P>
Tantan hailed successful joint efforts made by Turkey and
several other countries in combating crimes such as drug
trafficking, terrorism, and human smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"crossborder crimes can not be prevented with the unilateral
efforts of the countries. There are situations which make Britain
uneasy. Success of Turkey in struggle against drug and terrorism
provided a confidence atmosphere. Such agreements will increase
mutual confidence and cooperation," the Turkish minister said.
</P>
<P>
As for claims that Turkish mafia was reponsible for 80 percent
of the heroin smuggled into Britain, Tantan said that "successful
struggle of Turkish security teams on drug trafficking is known. We
are launching initiatives with Britain. It is known that Turkish
police and customs with their British counterparts have common
works."
</P>
<P>
Tantan said that the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) was
discussed during his meeting with Straw, adding that PKK's
terrorist activities have been illegally supported in the world.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish
state in the southeast of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The British home secretary briefed him on a legal preparation
regarding fighting against terrorism at home and abroad, Tantan
said, adding that this legal preparation is expected to be approved
in British parliament in the coming autumn.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Gets USAID Help to Upgrade Hotel Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian Hotel Association
(JHA) has signed an agreement with the U.S. Agency for
International Development (USAID) to upgrade hotel services in the
desert kingdom as part of its efforts to increase tourism revenues.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed on Monday, was part of a 15-million-U.S.-
dollar USAID-funded package to help Jordan's small-and-medium-size
enterprises through technical aid and consulting services over four
years, sources with the JHA said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
JHA President Michael Nazzal said the program was aimed at
developing the tourism work force and providing proper statistics
for the tourism industry to promote the image of the kingdom in
various countries.
</P>
<P>
The program will help the JHA get computers, know-hows and
softwares to build up an internet site to connect itself with its
counterparts in the world to benefit from their experiences.
</P>
<P>
The hotel upgrading program is also expected to create more job
opportunities in the kingdom, where government figures put the
unemployment rate at 14 percent though independent estimates stood
at as high as 27 percent.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israel Bombs South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes on Tuesday
shelled targets in south Lebanon to retaliate Lebanese guerrillas'
attacks on Israeli positions in the Israeli-occupied zone earlier
in the morning.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said Israeli warplanes fired two
missiles on areas west of Nabatyre which faces the central sector
of the so-called "security zone" in retaliation for Hezbollah's
attacks earlier Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has
claimed responsibilities for launching 46 missiles on Israeli
positions in the "security zone" Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports of casualties after Israeli
raids.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Israeli planes bombed suspected Hezbollah outposts in
south Lebanon and targets, near the Syrian border, of the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (People's Front) and Fatah
Uprising, both Syria-based Palestinian factions opposed to
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also on Monday, a Lebanese soldier and a civilian were killed in
Israeli shelling from the "security zone."
</P>
<P>
Israel's intensified bombardment came three days after an Arab
foreign ministers' conference was held in Beirut. A resolution of
the conference harshly denounced Israel's aggression and attacks on
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Though Israel has decided to bring its troops out of south
Lebanon by July, Hezbollah has not slacked in its attacks.
</P>
<P>
Syria, which is seeking the full return of the Golan Heights
seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war, insists on simultaneity
in ending Israeli occupation of Syrian and Lebanese lands.

<HEADLINE> Manila Dismisses Coup Plot Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
dismissed Tuesday reports that some members of the Armed Forces
are allegedly planning to mount a coup against the Estrada
administration.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said his office has
received no report about the supposed coup plot, even as he
pointed out that there is no sign of discontent in the military.
</P>
<P>
"We continue monitoring the situation internally and externally.
But there are no indications of any movement or any kind of
activity of this nature," Aguirre said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
As such, he said, there is no need to run a loyalty check on
the members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), which he
said is a professional organization.
</P>
<P>
"We don't plan to run a loyalty check. When our people take
their oaths, the presumption is that they are loyal to the
Constitution and the government," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AFP Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes dismissed as "
baseless" rumors that the military is plotting to mount a power
grab, pointing out that the country's soldiers are all in high
spirits, and are committed to fulfillng their mandate to serve the
people.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that the AFP will take a firm stand
against anyone who would be reported, confirmed and convicted of
involvement in any unlawful attempt to unseat the president and
threaten the stability of the government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of
National Defense also said ongoing reforms in the AFP have
rendered baseless any attempt to mount a power grab.

<HEADLINE> China to Build World Peace Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China is to build a World Peace
Park in Lushun, a naval port in the northeast familiar with the
ravages of war.
</P>
<P>
The main attraction of the 400,000 sq m park will be a forest
of steles on which are written peace prayers penned by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and presidents and prime ministers of
the world's 120-plus countries.
</P>
<P>
In June 1998, the World Congress of Poets (WCP) invited world
leaders to pray for peace in writing on behalf of their people.
Then the idea to develop a peace park in China came from Yan Yi, a
Chinese poet and also the WCP vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
Lushun, located at the southern tip of Liaodong Peninsula, and
also the point where the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea meet, was
one of the world's five largest naval ports and has witnessed
repeated wars in history.
</P>
<P>
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) set up China's first modern naval
force there in the early 18th century. The area was then occupied
by Japanese troops during the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895).
Russian troops gained control in 1895, and Japan reclaimed and
held the area for more than 40 years after Japan defeated Russia
in battle in 1904.
</P>
<P>
"The people here endured great suffering in the past, so they
know more clearly the meaning of peace than the others," said Mu
Guosheng, a local official in Lushun.
</P>
<P>
Gao Zhi, who is in charge of the park project, said that the
them park will be designed in the shape of the five continents.
Diverse architecture specific to each country will be incorporated
to reflect unique cultures.
</P>
<P>
Construction on the 150 million yuan (about 18 million U.S.
dollars) park is expected to be completed at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Lushun, part of Dalian City, has a population of 200,000. It
was opened partially to the public in July, 1996, after 40 years
of being closed for military reasons.
</P>
<P>
Numerous tourism sites are nearby, including the mass grove
where over 20,000 Lushun people massacred by the Japanese
intruders in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 are buried; and
ruins of prisons built by the Japanese and Russian armies.

</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey is eyeing the Far East, Middle East, Balkans, and
Caucasus markets which it neglected for a long time.
</P>

The target is to sell more goods and to increase investments.
Turkish ministers and businessmen have visited countries in the
regions while Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit is visit to India within
the framework.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Interior Minister Sadettin Tantan, who paid an
official visit to Britain, said Monday that Turkey will change its
Passport Law in order to harmonize with the European Union (EU)
standards.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will abolish Green Passport, meant for high officials,

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- There will be no withdrawal from any part of the Golan
Heights before Syria has normalized relations with Israel, Prime
Minister Ehud Barak was quoted as saying Monday.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee that it is apparent that peace with Syria would only be
along the lines of Israel's cold peace with Egypt, but even this
would be a "substantial change and would reduce the dangers facing
Israel."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak wants United States President Bill Clinton to renew
his "nuclear pledge" when the strategic relationship with Israel is
reviewed after the signing of a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Clinton promised during the government of former prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to preserve Israel's strategic deterrence
capabilities, and to ensure that any U.S. initiative to limit arms
would be coordinated with Israel so as not to infringe on its
deterrence capabilities. Barak's office wants Clinton to sign a
letter similar to the one sent to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) will take full
control of three villages close to Jerusalem in the final stage of
the second Israeli pull-back from the West Bank. Barak will present
an amended map to the security cabinet Wednesday for approval.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of revisions have been made to the final map at the
request of the PNA. The original map was approved by the cabinet
last month, but rejected by PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The coalition managed to fend off a Likud-initiated no-
confidence motion Monday by a vote of 48 to 42, despite the revolt
by several coalition members.
</P>
<P>
The motion was raised in response to Education Minister Yossi
Sarid's suggestion to introduce the poems of Palestinian national
poet Mahmoud Darwish into the high school curriculum. 12 Knesset
members from the coalition parties voted in support of the motion.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash said Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides was "deceiving the
world" when he called for direct talks between the Turkish and
Greek Cypriots,  the English-language Turkish Daily News (TDN)
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the TDN published Monday, Clerides said
that European Union membership for Cyprus and Turkey will help the
two sides find a solution to the decades-old Cyprus dispute.
</P>
<P>
However, Denktash refuted in a following-day interview with TDN
that the Greek Cypriot leader should stop deceiving the world and
his people if he really wants a settlement on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
northern part and the Greek Cypriots-controlled southern part since
1974 when Turkey staged a military intervention in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

A total of 30,000 Turkish troops are now stationed in the
northern part.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations-sponsored reunification talks were deadlocked
due to the insistence of the Turkish Cypriots for the recognition
of their northern breakaway state, which was only recognized by
Ankara, and their rejection of related Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of improvements in relations between Greece
and Turkey, the two sides of Cyprus held two rounds of indirect
talks in New York in December and Geneva in February. A new round
of talks is due to open in New York on May 23.
</P>
<P>
Denktash said the EU candidacy of Turkey granted at the EU
Helsinki summit in December provided the Turkish Cypriots with an
opportunity to better explain the realities of Cyprus to the world,
adding that EU membership of Cyprus should come after a settlement
on the island, together with Turkish membership.
</P>
<P>
Denktash disputed Clerides' position that "we cannot have two
states first and then create a new state" by saying that, as the
Greek Cypriots refuse to concede to the realities on the island, a
settlement of the Cyprus problem is not discernible.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Turkish Cypriots declared that any solution of the
Cyprus problem should be secured in a form of confederation on a
two-state basis. The idea was rejected by Nicosia as well as the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Denktash stressed that Greek Cypriots should know that even if
the Cyprus problem is ever resolved, they will not be able to
return to their former property in the north.

<HEADLINE> FAO Rings Alarming Bell on Mongolia's Food Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The worst winter in 30 years has
reportedly killed several hundred thousand livestock in Mongolia,
seriously threatening the livelihood and food security of a
quarter of the country's 2.7 million population.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Tuesday by the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional Office for Asia and the
Pacific said that 1.5 million livestock have already died and many
more are likely to be lost in the coming weeks as harsh conditions
persist.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia has an area of about 1.6 million square kilometers
where some 30 million livestock are being raised.
</P>
<P>
The livestock sector plays an important part in Mongolia's
economy, providing the main source of household income and foreign
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
FAO said Mongolia's food situation, amongst vulnerable groups
including women and children, could deteriorate appreciably in the
next few months particularly as essential winter food reserves of
dried meat, milk and diary products, become depleted.
</P>
<P>
"Already there is evidence of the most vulnerable sectors of
the nomadic population migrating to towns in search of employment.
This will exacerbate existing food supply problems in some areas,"
FAO said in the press release.
</P>
<P>
FAO noted that the Mongolian government has appealed for
international assistance, including food, clothes, medicines and
fodder for the surviving livestock.

<HEADLINE> Israel Welcomes Swiss Offer to Host Mideast Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy has welcomed Switzerland's offer to host a tri-party summit
between Israel, Syria and the United States on the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
After talks on Monday with his Swiss counterpart Joseph Deiss,
Levy told reporters that Switzerland was well suited to such a
role, adding that the proposed meeting "is possible as far as
Israel is concerned."
</P>
<P>
"There is no place more suited to such a meeting than
Switzerland," said Levy. "After all, this country is traditionally
well-versed and accustomed to encouraging peace throughout the
world."
</P>
<P>
The offer to host a three-way peace summit in Switzerland was
first made by Deiss during his trip to the Middle East region
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the relations between Switzerland and Israel seem to
be on the mend, following the meeting between the two countries'
foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The relationship has been strained for a number of years,
largely over issues relating to the Holocaust.

<P>
GENEVA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's second largest bank,
Credit Suisse, made record profits of 5.2 billion Swiss francs (
about 3.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, up 70 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth in profits was particularly marked by the
performance of its First Boston unit in Russia. The First Boston
unit's net profit for 1999 was 1.3 billion dollars, in contrast to
a 151-million-dollar loss in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The Credit Suisse group's impressive results came just a week
after Switzerland's largest bank, UBS, announced that it had
doubled profits to 6.3 billion francs (about 3.7 billion U.S.
dollars).

<HEADLINE> PNA to Get Three Villages Near Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) will take full control of three villages close to
Jerusalem as part of Israel's upcoming pullout from another 6.1
percent of the West Bank, a Palestinian source confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of Ubeidiya, Anata and Beitunia, instead of Al-Ram,
Al-Azahria and Abu Dis as demanded by the Palestinians, was a
compromise between Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Barak refused to include Al-Ram, Al-Azahria and Abu Dis in the
upcoming withdrawal mandated in the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal
signed last September in Egypt on the ground that the three
villages close to the Jerusalem municipal border.
</P>
<P>
Abu Dis, Israel refused to transfer right now, has often been
suggested by Israelis as a possible capital of a future Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
Anata, east of Jerusalem, Beitunia to the north and Ubeidiya to
the south are now under Palestinian administrative rule.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of the three villages is part of a revised map
about the overdue withdrawal, which should have taken place on
January 20. Barak is scheduled to present the map to the security
cabinet for approval on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Wants U.S. to Renew "Nuclear Pledge" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak wants U.S. President Bill Clinton to renew his "nuclear
pledge" when the strategic U.S.-Israel relationship is renewed
after the signing of a peace agreement between Israel and Syria, a
local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When the former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in
office, Clinton sent a letter to him, promising that Israel's
strategic deterrence capabilities would be preserved and any U.S.
initiative to limit arms be coordinated with Israel, Ha'aretz
reported.
</P>
<P>
Under a plan formulated by the prime minister's bureau, Clinton
will sign a similar letter addressed to Barak.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton-Netanyahu letter is defined as an appendix to the
agreement on anti-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in
the Middle East and cooperation on strategic matters, signed
between the two countries shortly after the Wye memorandum was
reached between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
After one-week-long talks in the United States, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Netanyahu signed the Wye accord on October
23, 1998 at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal obliged the Palestinian side to confiscate
illegal arms and stop anti-Israel incitement, while requiring
Israel to stage three-stage troop redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton-Netanyahu letter also reaffirms the U.S. commitment
to the 1969 agreement between the U.S. and Israel, whereby
Washington promises to avoid putting pressure on Israel in the
nuclear area so long as Israel pledges to continue with its
ambiguous nuclear facade and not to declare it is a nuclear power.

<HEADLINE> Over 2 Million Muslim Pilgrims Start Journey of Faith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- About 2.3 million Muslim
pilgrims from around the world Tuesday morning are proceeding from
the holy city of Mecca to the ritual site of Mina, both in Saudi
Arabia, at the start of Hajj, one of Islam's holiest rituals.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims, of which some 1.3 million are from the outside of
Saudi Arabia, are making the 11-kilometer journey on foot.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz said Sunday
that this year's pilgrims are 19 percent more than last year's some
2 million. They are from over 100 countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's mass journey is considered a great challenge to Saudi
traffic police, as all the pilgrims must reach Mina before the noon
prayers.
</P>
<P>
Policemen are using helicopters and sophisticated remote
communication systems to monitor the moving crowds in order to
facilitate the procession.
</P>
<P>
The ritual in Mina is called the Day of Al-Tarwiya, a word used
in the days of the Prophet Mohammad for stocking enough water for
the journey to Mount Arafat and the Valley of Mozdalifa.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims on Wednesday will start to climb Mount Arafat,
where the Prophet Mohammad gave his last sermon 14 centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
At Mount Arafat, the mass recitation of prayers marks the climax
of the Hajj pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday evening, the pilgrims will begin to return to Mina
after a series of rituals in the Valley of Mozdalifa.
</P>
<P>
The pilgrims will spend their night in Mina in the 40,000 fire-
proof tents erected by the Saudi government with a total cost of 2.
4 billion riyals (640 million U.S. dollars). Saudi officials have
said the tents can accommodate more than 2 million pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports reaching here, a majority of the
pilgrims flocked to Mecca in the past several days.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia appeared to have made better precautions for the
pilgrimage season. Thousands of cleaners are on duty on the street,
while medical teams are on alert in case of emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authority also warned against the use of liquefied
petroleum gas for cooking to avoid accidents in the tent areas. A
tent fire caused by cooking in 1997 killed over 350 pilgrims and
injured 1,600 others.
</P>
<P>
Saudi officials said there have been no major incidents so far
similar to those that have marred the Hajj rituals in previous
years.
</P>
<P>
There has been no political tension reported this time after
Iraqi planes flied in several batches of old and women pilgrims.
The issue was taken to the United Nations last year as Baghdad is
at present under an international embargo because of its invasion
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to the Saudi interior minister, nearly 10,000 Iraqi
pilgrims had arrived in Mecca till Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Navy Ship Misses Target in War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Navy admitted
Tuesday that one of its participating ships in the Philippines-U.S.
war games last month twice missed its target during live firing
exercises at Tabones Island in the northern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In his report to Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, Navy chief
Vice Admiral Luisito Fernandez said that of the four ships that
fire their 3"50 guns three hit their targets.
</P>
<P>
However, Fernandez said another ship, BRP Rizal, fired six
rounds of high explosive 3"50 ammunition on Tabones Island off
Zambales province on February 26 and may have missed its target
twice.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Presidential Commission on the Visiting Forces
Agreement which monitored the 35-day Philippines-U.S. military
maneuvers, claimed that some shells of the ship had hit the
fishing village of Talisan and forced some villagers to flee away
home.
</P>
<P>
This prompted the Navy to conduct an investigation during which
experts found a unexploded shell in the fishing village but it was
old and rusty World War II anti-aircraft shell and not the one
used during the exercise.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said the Navy is pursuing a deeper investigation.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 servicemen from the Philippines and United States
conducted a joint military exercise from January 28 to March 3 in
the country. One Filipino soldier was killed and three civilians
were injured in the war games.

<HEADLINE> EU Withholds 6 Million Euro Aid to Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will not
disburse six million euro (6.188 million U.S. dollars) aid to
Zambia until it further reduces tariffs, an EU official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Mail weekly newspaper on Monday quoted
Information Manager of the EU Delegation in Lusaka, Joan Pilcher,
as saying that EU is still committed to supporting the regional
economic integration of Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
He said EU is ready to release the aid to offset the expected
loss of revenue to the country resulting from the introduction of
the Free Trade Area within COMESA member states by the end of
October.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has cut its tariffs by 60 percent instead of required
100 percent under the COMESA program of the zero tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Holds Olympics Logo Contest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A contest to design the logo for
Bangkok's bid for the Olympic Games in 2008 started Tuesday in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, president of the
committee preparing for the bidding, said that aim of "Bangkok
2008" logo contest, which lasts till March 22, is to get the whole
community involved in the Olympic movement.
</P>
<P>
The bidding committee will announce the winning design on March
29. The winner will get 100,000 baht (2,645 U.S. dollars) as
prize.
</P>
<P>
Once the logo is chosen, Bangkok is expected to launch a
nationwide promotion campaign to create public awareness of the
city's efforts to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
However, it is widely believed that Bangkok is still a step
behind other bidders, including Beijing, Osaka, Toronto and Paris,
which have already gone ahead with their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The bidding committee, consisting of several key figures from
sports bodies, the Olympic Committee of Thailand and the Bangkok
Metropolitan Administration, will set up several sub-committees
for infrastructure, programs, Olympic village, environment, legal,
security, finance and administration later this week.
</P>
<P>
So far, the committee's main concern was to answer 22 questions
asked by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) about public
motivation, political and public support, general infrastructure,
sport facilities, logistics, experience and financing.
</P>
<P>
The answers must be submitted to the IOC before June 20. The
five
finalists among ten cities will be announced between August and
September.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Urged to Honor Commitment on Tibet, FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China today demanded that the U.S.
Senate honor the United States's commitment on Tibet and
immediately stop all acts that interfere in China's internal
affairs by taking advantage of the Tibet issue.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi made the remarks in
response to a question on the U.S. Senate's March 9 resolution
designating March 10, 2000 as National Day of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Sun said the document "wantonly distorted the historical facts
on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and randomly attacked and
humiliated China."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people express their strong
resentment and firm opposition against such a resolution," Sun
said, as in adopting the resolution the U.S. Senate "disregards
the facts and basic norms of international relations and grossly
interferes in China's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Tibet is part of the Chinese territory and
the Tibet issue is purely an internal matter for China, which
allows no foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has for a long time recognized that Tibet
is part of the Chinese territory and not supported "independence
of Tibet", which constitutes a binding international commitment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"China strongly demands that the U.S. Senate honor the
commitment and immediately stops all its acts of interfering in
China's internal affairs by taking advantage of the Tibet issue,"
he stressed.

Sun said the document "wantonly distorted the historical facts
on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and randomly attacked and
humiliated China."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people express their strong
resentment and firm opposition against such a resolution," Sun
said, as in adopting the resolution the U.S. Senate "disregards
the facts and basic norms of international relations and grossly
interferes in China's internal affairs."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman today urged the United States to stop using human
rights to interfere in China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's response to reports that the U.S.

Human Rights Commission session in Geneva, the spokesman said the
U.S. should immediately stop its erroneous decision to advance
such an anti-China move.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also noted at the conference that China welcomes
the progress made in negotiations between the Red Cross societies
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Red Cross societies of DPRK and Japan
concluded their one-day meeting in Beijing Monday night and issued
a joint statement, which says that the two sides reached
agreements on and discussed details of such previously-covered
issues as the home-visit of Japanese spouses living in DPRK, the
investigations into the whereabouts of missing Japanese, and
Koreans missing before the year 1945.
</P>
<P>
Sun also announced at the press conference that Vice President
of the Republic of the Philippines Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo will
visit China from March 22 to 27, and a delegation of the State
Great Hural of Mongolia led by its Chairman Radnaasumberel

<HEADLINE> Famous-Brand Products Counterfeited in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A disturbingly high number of
famous-brand and high-quality products are being counterfeited in
China, causing serious losses to the manufacturers of top-flight
goods.
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey conducted by the State Bureau of Quality and
Technical Supervision, a total of 283 enterprises claimed their
products have been illegally duplicated and their brandnames used
without permission.
</P>
<P>
The fake products appeared in over 650 varieties of items
including clothing, pesticide, fertilizer, food, pharmaceuticals,
cigarettes, liquor, construction materials and cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
Most of the pirating cases are reported in Zhejiang, Guangdong,
Hebei, Hunan, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei, Guangxi, Fujian,
Sichuan and other provinces and regions, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 160 Chinese famous-brand enterprises lost a total of 9.
575 billion yuan (about 1.15 billion US dollars) of production
value to phony products. And 11 export enterprises lost foreign
exchange of 8.3 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises have to train special personnel and earmark
funds to clamp down on the fake goods. The survey showed that
there are on average seven to eight professionals in each
enterprise responsible for scouting out counterfeit goods. And the
enterprises will spend an average of 1.33 million yuan every year
in the search.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision has
launched a three-year campaign to control the fakes and support
high-quality goods.

<HEADLINE> China Focuses Strike on Fake Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- In the next three years, China's
campaign against fake and shoddy products will focus on ten top
offenders, including chemical fertilizers, construction materials,
food and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision will
launch frequent comprehensive checks of the ten types of products
in the coming three years in order to stem the sales of inferior
goods endangering the national economy and people's health.
</P>
<P>
The strike will also target wholesale markets notorious for
selling phony products, including Yiwu, known as a City of Small
Commodities in Zhejiang, the Xingfa Square in Guangzhou, capital
of Guangdong, the Huazhong Food Market in Zhengzhou, the capital
of Henan, and a steel market in Nanning of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
The bureau also listed 30 areas in 16 provinces and autonomous
regions across China where the clampdown will be tightest,
including areas where fake liquors are made and sold ,and
counterfeit versions of famous-brand cigarettes are produced.
</P>
<P>
China will smash the criminal gangs producing fake and shoddy
products in these regions, said Zhu Mingxian, deputy director of
the bureau.
</P>
<P>
Investigation into counterfeiting cases involving high
financial losses and causing deaths or injuries will be priority
on the bureau's working agenda.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislator Urges Balanced East-West Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li made the call at a plenary meeting of Hubei delegation to
the Ninth NPC, in session here since March 5.
</P>
<P>
Since the initiation of reform and opening-up in the late 1970s,
all parts of China have scored marked economic growth. But
regional economic development remains imbalanced with the west
lagging behind the east due to its weak economic foundation, said
Li.
</P>
<P>
The government push to invigorate the west will facilitate rare
opportunities for all parts of the nation, he said, urging the
western areas to spare no efforts in accelerating local economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the poor areas in the east to seize the
opportunities for bettering their life.
</P>
<P>
Late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping once proposed a two-step
strategy to achieve balanced east-west development: while the east
should make full use of their advantages and take a lead in
becoming developed, they should support the central and western
regions to speed up local development at the century-end.
</P>
<P>
Now China has the basic conditions to jump-start its west-
development strategy and spur the development of the resource-rich,
economically backward central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed his appreciation of the contributions made by
central Hubei Province to the Three Gorges Project. He urged Hubei
to make the best of the opportunities created by the multi-billion-
dollar program to dam China's longest river Yangtze, and do a good
job in economic restructuring, urban construction and tourism.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Paper Calls For Overhaul of Arab Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Kuwaiti newspaper
on Tuesday voiced hope that Arab countries would opt for a complete
settlement with Israel and put economic interests on top of
political affairs if an Arab summit is convened in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders must realize it is time for this transformation and
must look for a better future based on mutual respect for each
other's sovereignty, said the English language daily, Arab Times,
in a front-page opinion published in the name of its Editor-in-
Chief.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper said that "given the current and future
prospects of the Arab world, we don't see the light at the end of a
tunnel despite the inevitable changes taking place around us, such
as the globalization and the market liberalization."
</P>
<P>
Giant economic blocs have emerged elsewhere in the world, it
said, but the Arabs are lagging far behind in terms of
modernization.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, "disunity very much prevails among the Arab
states. The hungry rulers are more concerned about staying in power
even if their reign shows the country is at a standstill," the
article noted, without detailing.
</P>
<P>
It hoped that the holding of an Arab summit would usher in a new
era away from old disputes, bullying and putting up internal fronts
to confront each other.
</P>
<P>
The summit should focus on Arab economic integration, bolstering
commercial exchange, setting up a common Arab market, as well as
free transfer of Arab manpower among Arab countries, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts made in recent years by some Arab leaders to bring
together all the Arab heads of states have borne no results as some
key Arab states insist any Arab summit be preceded by "good and
sufficient preparations."
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti paper was not optimistic that a possible summit will
achieve the suggested objective, mainly because of the internal
conditions of some countries.

<P>
"SPC and SPP did a better job last year and their reports were
also true to fact, a sign that the NPC Standing Committee has
considerably strengthened its function for supervision," said
Tsang Hin-Chi, a NPC deputy from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
As shown in their reports, the two law enforcement departments
had taken effective improvement measures concerning issues raised
by NPC deputies, and reported good results by putting themselves
under NPC's supervision wholeheartedly, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, China's political life has obviously
featured openness and supervision. Open administration, open trial,
open prosecution, open village affairs, open factory affairs and
accounts, for example, are all aimed to have better supervision by
people in general.
</P>
<P>
NPC, the nation's supreme organ of state power, and local
people' congresses are entitled to the right for supervision over
governments, courts and procuratorates in their work and law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee chairman Li Peng, China's top legislator,
defined clearly in his work report that continued endeavors must
be done to intensify supervision in this regard in a bid to
guarantee correct implementation of laws and improve their work.
</P>
<P>
"Power without supervision will lead to abuses of power for
personal gains, destruction of state laws and even corruption. So,
to strengthen the supervision system is a sound guarantee for
political democracy and social justice," said Chen Miaozhen, a NPC
deputy from Jieyang city of southern Guangdong Province.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies on Ethnical Cultural Protection in West Revitalization (2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the accelerated growth of the west, an archaeologists from
Xinjiang noted, work is in full swing to protect ancient
architectures with ethnic styles and ethnic handicraft mills in
the beautiful city of Kashi in Xinjiang's far west, which was a
very important town on the ancient silk road.
</P>
<P>
Losang Jamcan, mayor of the capital city of Lhasa in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, said there is no need to worry about cultural
impact from the east in the growth of the western region, as the
effort to protect ethnic cultural traditions is a long-term policy
and has been implemented with great success.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, both the central government and the local
government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region have invested more
than 300 million yuan (36 million US dollars) on renovating
lamaseries and other local Tibetan Buddhist temples. At present,
there are more than 1,700 lamaseries and monasteries, an increase
of 300 over 1995. As for Qoikang Monastery, preparations are being
beefed up for its application to be listed into the World Culture
Heritage .
</P>
<P>
Wang Yushun, commissioner of the Aba Tibetan and Qiang
Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province, said that the large-
scale development in China's west will result in a tourist boom.
He called for more attention to be paid to protecting local
ethnical cultures with individualities of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some old, backward customs and practices will
possibly fade away or even disappear. And some experts hold this
phenomena constitutes a kind of outcome in social progress for the
mankind and a sort of the inter-mingling of cultures. The advanced
ethnic groups, said one of the a NPC deputy from Uighur ethnic
group, prefer, to some extent, inter-mingling in their cultures so
as to facilitate its own cultural development.

"I find that governments at various levels have begun to pay
much more attention to the supervisory function of NPC deputies.
Now, we have a stronger voice. As NPC deputies, we should dare to
take any pressure upon ourselves and brave risks," said Chen, who
has been a NPC deputy for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Zeng Xiaoxian, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
Jilin Provincial People's Congress, is another example. He never
dreamed of exercising the right for supervision 18 years ago when
he first came to Beijing to attend an annual NPC session.
</P>
<P>
"I was told to do two things well: to participate in the
meeting attentively; and recount what I have learned here about
the central policies to people back home," Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
Deputies attribute the great change to incessant improvement in
building the socialist legal system and enhancement of the legal
awareness of the broad masses, according to Cheng Xiangqing,
director of a research unit of the General Office under the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
NPC and its Standing Committee have approved 370 laws and
regulations over the past 21 years since the reform and opening-up
drive began in the late 1970s. And the road to supervision was
devious, from holding tongues in the beginning to "support-instead-
of-supervision" in the second stage, up to the present stage of
strict supervision over governments, courts and procuratorates in
their work and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the NPC Standing Committee passed two
resolutions on economic and budget supervision, and examined
another resolution concerning supervision over trial and
prosecution, to further improve the supervision mechanism.

Proposals, complaints and advice submitted to last year's NPC
annual session have been given proper answers and explanations,
with all issues having been resolved or being dealt with, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Supervision by NPC is only part of the country's supervisory
system. Critical reports by mass media also have a role, as some
of their reports have made local officials lose positions, and
even receive penalty according to law.
</P>
<P>
In addition, wider-ranging supervision by the general public
has become "antiseptics" of the Party and governments. Statistics
show that the masses provide 80 percent of the clues that lead to
prosecutions of officials at all levels.
</P>
<P>
However, supervision falls far short of the expectations of the
masses. "Exposed major cases involving leading officials have
shown that the prevalent "power-for-money" transactions are
largely attributable to a weak supervision mechanism," said NPC
deputy Liu Qingning from Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south
China.
</P>
<P>
Media supervision is vulnerable to legal disputes as no law has
ever clearly defined the function. And often times, relevant
reporters and media are retaliated for this. Therefore, many
deputies suggest a law on media supervision be enacted in a bid to
safeguard the legal rights and interests of journalists.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji said in his report that active measures
should be taken to promote open administration and encourage
people to supervise governments and officials. And SPC president
Xiao Yang and SPP procurator-general Han Zhubin echoed the call in
their work reports.
</P>
<P>
A supervision system that covers all aspects of political,
economic and social life and guarantees democracy is taking shape
in China, as the process of governing state affairs according to
law is accelerating and the enactment of a supervision law is in
the pipeline, NPC deputies said.

<HEADLINE> Launch of "Homebanking System" Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China has claimed initial success
in the launch of a homebanking system in central China's Hunan
Province, which allows clients to receive banking services at home
or in any other places.
</P>
<P>
Jointly developed by the Hunan Branch of the Bank of China and
Hunan Telecom, the homebanking system provides a variety of
banking services including financial information accessing,
account management, home shopping and bills settlement, funds
transferring, loan application, and foreign exchange trading,
according to Zhang Xiufa, director of the Hunan Postal and
Telecommunications Administration and also a deputy to the Ninth
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Users of the electronic system have exceeded 100,000 so far,
and the bank is expecting to make more than 30 million yuan in
annual profit from the new system, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Homebanking was first launched in Hong Kong in May 1998, by the
Hong Kong-based Bank of China Group.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said electronic banking has huge potential in China due
to its low input and high profitability. "Homebanking is also very
safe since it has strong backing from digital technologies," he
added.

<HEADLINE> SW Province Attracts Professionals With Generous Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Yunnan, an underdeveloped multi-
ethnical province in southwest China, has adopted preferential
policies to attract scientists and well-trained professionals to
work there, with a maximum bonus of three million yuan for anyone
making outstanding contributions to progress in science and
technology and to local economic development.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in an interview by Wang Shikun, director of
the provincial personnel bureau, who is here attending the ongoing
session of the National People's Congress (NPC) as an NPC deputy.
"The biggest gap between the eastern part and the western part of
the country is a talent gap," Wang quoted Ling Hu'an, secretary of
the provincial committee of the Communist Party of China, as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the province has allocated a special area in
the Kunming Hi-Tech Development Zone for returned students who
have studied abroad. Returned scientists will enjoy the same
preferential policies as overseas investors. Some of them will be
provided with subsidies and housing.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, these people are also encouraged to invest in
local projects with their patent rights, inventions, knowhows and
funds, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan, which shares a 4,000 km-long border with Vietnam, Laos
and Myanmar, is known for its abundant mineral, biological, water
and tourism resources. The provincial government plans to build
Yunnan into a developed region with an environment-friendly
economy, a rich multi-ethnic culture, and an international
transport hub linking the rest of China with Southeast Asia and
South Asia.

NAIROBI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The East African Community (EAC),
which comprises Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, has set up a security
committee to curb the proliferation of small arms in the region,
EAC secretary-general Francis Muthaura has said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's local newspapers Tuesday quoted Muthaura as saying that
the flow of illegal arms into the region has contributed to the
rising rate of violent crimes and conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura on Monday told the ongoing Great Lakes Region and Horn
of Africa conference on proliferation of small arms held here that
the region has been permeated with small arms arising from current
and past conflicts.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the illegal arms trade must be curbed to spur
economic growth in the region, saying illegal arms had deterred
development as resources were being diverted to finance wars at
the expense of economic investment.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts had retarded development in many eastern
African countries, making them some of the poorest in the world,
he added.

YICHANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hubei Province
has worked steadily for the past ten years to plant trees and
improve the ecological environment in the Three Gorges area at the
middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Yichang, a city in the region, has successfully controlled soil
erosion, reducing the soil-erosion area to half the amount of ten
years ago and decreasing soil-erosion volume from 4,000 to 1,800
tons, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The city has planted six million mu (about 400,000 hectares) of
trees in the Three Gorges area since the local government launched
a forestation drive in the gorge zone at the end of 1980s.
</P>
<P>
A forestry official with the provincial government said many
forest areas in Hubei have shifted their economic focus from
reliance on the timber industry to improvement of the environment.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Shennongjia forest zone and Enshi Tujia-Miao
prefecture in the Three Gorges area have banned deforesting
activities and planted seven million mu (about 467,000 hectares)
of trees. As a result, the forest coverage in the area has
increased by six million mu or ten percent in the past 20 years.

SHIJIAZHUANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- With nearly 10 percent of
its population suffering from high blood pressure, north China's
Hebei Province has set up a prevention center to control the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The province has reported a higher incidence rate of
hypertension than most others in China, which is attributed to the
unbalanced diet high in salt.

A survey shows that people in Hebei take in 14-15 grams of salt
a day. Vegetables preserved in an especially salty solution are
often used at breakfast in this region.

<P>
High blood pressure triggers the fatal cardiac disease.
</P>
<P>
Liu Lisheng, chairman of the World High Blood Pressure
Association, said at the opening ceremony of the center that the
occurrence of cardiac disease in China has steadily risen in the
past 30 years. Death from heart disease claims 30 percent of the
country's total mortality rate.

<HEADLINE> Autonomous Region Making Headway in Poverty Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
in southwest China has made remarkable achievements in poverty
eradication by using overseas funds, said Yang Caishou, a deputy
to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) and director of the
regional poverty relief office.
</P>
<P>
By 1999, investment from the World Bank totaled 113 million U.S.
dollars, involving 900,000 impoverished people in 12 counties, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A 1.5-million-yuan UNDP project, started in 1998, aims to help
five counties develop crop cultivation and live-stock and poultry
breeding . By now, 3.57 million yuan of loans for production has
been injected into assisting 17,300 farmers of 3,479 households,
Yang said.
</P>
<P>
The region also started an anti-poverty project financed with
13.84 million yuan of free aid by the Australian government, a 12-
million-yuan relocation project in Nandan county funded by a Hong
Kong organization, and 10 projects involving 4.34 million yuan of
aid from Japan.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate poverty through education was another practice. A
Hong Kong fund has initiated a four-year (1997-2000) education
program in seven counties, with 300,000 yuan of investment each
year. And the UNESCO has also granted 230,000 yuan for a poverty
relief project through education, the NPC deputy said.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded poverty alleviation projects have not only
helped increase local investment but also brought new expertise in
this field, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The region had 15 million impoverished people in 1984,
accounting for one-tenth of the national total. But now, it has
reduced its poor population to 1.69 million. During the period,
the central and local governments have committed 7.5 billion yuan
for poverty-relief programs, he said.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Five Hydropower Stations Along Yangtze Tributary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest
China plans to kick start an ambitious hydropower development
program with an investment of 8 billion yuan (about 964 million US
dollars) along the Hanjiang River, the largest tributary of the
Yangtze, China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
Five hydropower stations to be erected along the Hanjiang River
are expected to bring the total annual power output along the
river up to seven billion kwh, according to Cheng Andong, governor
of Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
There are currently two hydropower plants along the river, with
a combined generating capacity of one million kw.
</P>
<P>
Hanjiang River originates in the area of Hanzhong City in
central Shaanxi, and joins the Yangtze at Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province. The stored hydropower capacity
along the 700-kilometer tributary in Shaanxi is projected at 4.7
million kw, with the usable capacity reaching 2.8 million kw.
</P>
<P>
So far, feasibility studies and preliminary designing for the
four hydropower plants have been completed and are now in the
process of being submitted to the relevant departments for
approval. And a special development company has also been set up
with an aim to implement the program through multiple financing.
</P>
<P>
The project is a viable one, according to Shan Lun, a noted
water conservancy expert and an academician from the Chinese
Academy of Engineering, who cited two figures to back up his
endorsement of the project: the program requires only 18,000
residents to be relocated and some 930 ha of arable land to be
inundated.
</P>
<P>
A full exploitation of hydropower resources along the Hanjiang
River will help solve energy imbalance problem in Shaanxi Province,
which mainly use thermal energy, and clean energy is preferred to
ease pressure on local environment, Shan Lun said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The presidium of the ongoing 3rd

third meeting today.
</P>
<P>
The presidium at the meeting decided to distribute the

of the NPC Standing Committee, a draft legislation law, and two
draft resolutions respectively on the work reports of the Supreme
People's Court and Supreme People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Wang Weicheng, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, delivered a
report at the meeting on the results of the examination of the
draft legislation law. He said the NPC deputies have agreed after
examining the draft law that enacting a legislation law will
standardize law-making and improve the quality of legislation, and
such a law is of great significance to promoting socialist
democracy and building a country ruled by law.
</P>
<P>
The deputies also said the draft legislation law, which has
been drafted, reviewed and modified for a long period of time, is
workable and suggested the NPC full session adopt the draft law,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the opinions and suggestions by the NPC deputies,
the NPC Law Committee has submitted a report to revise the draft
legislation law, which adds into the draft articles stipulating
that all laws and regulations of all kinds shouldn't contravene
the Constitution, and that NPC Standing Committee's explanation on
law have the same power as laws.
</P>
<P>
The legislation law, once enacted, will take effect as of July
1 this year, instead of the date of issuance, according to the
report by the NPC Law Committee.
</P>
<P>
He Chunlin, deputy secretary-general of the NPC session, also
delivered a report on bills and proposals handling, in which he
said the NPC session had received a total of 916 bills by 18:00 p.
m., March 10.
</P>
<P>
The bills concern deepening reform, open policy implementation,
promoting the rule of law in China and consolidating the socialist
democratic and legal system, expanding domestic demand,
implementing the government-initiated strategy of developing the
west and accelerating economic development in central and western
China, facilitating the reunification of the motherland, and
maintaining social stability, among other things.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat of the NPC session has suggested 195 of the
bills be handed over to related special committees of the NPC for
reviewing, and the rest of the bills be handled by related
departments and government organs.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Excited by Results of Chile Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During her three days in Santiago, Clark attended the
inauguration ceremony of new Chilean President Ricardo Lagos, had
formal meetings with the new Chilean president, the presidents of
Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay, and with Mexico's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
In a government press release Tuesday, the prime minister said
that Lagos was well disposed to closer economic relations with New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"Chile, Uruguay and Argentina were all impressed with the
technology lead New Zealand has in primary industries and that
there seems to be potential for more joint ventures to the
advantage of both countries," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Brazil presents the biggest economic opportunities and
challenges for New Zealand. While we work closely with Brazil on
agricultural trade issues and disarmament and environmental issues,
we are barely scratching the surface in promoting trade and
investment between our two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I hope in this term of government to see a New Zealand embassy
based in Brasilia," she said.
</P>
<P>
"A major reason for going to Chile was to ensure that New
Zealand's interest in stronger relations with the continent was
registered with the presidents of Chile, Argentina, Uruguay and
Brazil. This mission was successfully accomplished," the New
Zealand prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"In the coming months the government will be finalizing a new
strategy for strengthening New Zealand's relations with Latin
America," Clark said.

<HEADLINE> Former Malaysian Police Chief Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former Inspector-
General of Police Abdul Rahim Noor Tuesday pleaded guilty to a
lesser charge of assaulting former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
When his trial began Tuesday morning, the prosecution amended
the charge against him from one under Section 325 of the Penal
Code which carries a maximum jail term of seven years and a fine
at the discretion of the court on conviction to Section 323 which
carries a jail term of up to one year and a fine of up to 2,000
ringgit (526 U.S. dollars) or both.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year old Rahim had pleaded not guilty to the earlier
charge, but changed his plea to guilty when the charge was amended
by Deputy Public Prosecutor Salehuddin Saidin.
</P>
<P>
Rahim, who resigned as the police chief on January 8 last year,
confessed to assaulting Anwar before a Royal Commission of Inquiry
set up to investigate injuries sustained by Anwar while under
detention in a lock-up at the federal police headquarters here on
September 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rahim told the inquiry he assaulted Anwar under provocation
after Anwar allegedly called him "bapa anjing" (father of dogs).
</P>
<P>
The deputy public prosecutor Tuesday told Sessions Court judge
Akhtar Tahir that a jail sentence on Rahim was necessary to
restore the people's confidence in the country's judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The court has to pass a custodial sentence to reflect the
seriousness of the offense and to serve as a deterrent to others
from committing a similar offense, Salehuddin said, adding a mere
fine was not justified for the offense committed by the former
police chief.
</P>
<P>
The Sessions Court here will pass sentence on the former police
chief Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> NZ People Urged to Improve Race Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealanders are being urged
to take action for better race relations as March 21, United
Nations International Day for the Elimination of Racial
Discrimination, is approaching.
</P>
<P>
The day was designated last year as New Zealand's Race Unity
Day on which every person is asked to begin to double their
efforts to combat racism in all its forms and in all places.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Race Relations Conciliator, Rajen Prasad, issued a
statement Tuesday, saying "There are many important changes taking
place in New Zealand. It is more common today to belong to
communities comprising many different cultures. We also live at a
time when almost every continent in the world has examples of
serious race conflict. A number of well known cases have developed
into violence and war.
</P>
<P>
"We need to take note of these facts and work consistently to
eliminate any risk of race conflicts occurring or escalating in
New Zealand. Race Unity Day provides an opportunity to take some
steps towards this goal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prasad said he is encouraging people to learn a little more
about each other and to start a dialogue with a person, who is not
known to them and from a different culture.
</P>
<P>
"The most important actions against racism and for promoting
cross cultural understanding are taken personally by individuals
and families. I urge all New Zealanders to take a small step
towards a society free of racism, discrimination and prejudice on
this day and then to maintain the impetus throughout the year in
any way they can," the senior New Zealand official on race
relations said.

<HEADLINE> Former Secretaries of State Back Clinton for China PNTR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Six former U.S. secretaries of
state have joined President Bill Clinton in his stepped-up
campaign to gain an early Congressional approval of Permanent
Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for China.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Alexander Haig, George
Shultz, James Baker III, Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren
Christopher stressed that granting China PNTR is "in our own
national interest."
</P>
<P>
"It is in our long-term interest and that of others in the
international community to develop a relationship with China that
is stable and predictable," they said.
</P>
<P>
Current Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who announced
the release of the letter in Washington on Monday, said
implementing the WTO agreement signed by the United States and
China last November would "dramatically lower import barriers for
American goods and services."
</P>
<P>
"Like my predecessors, I believe there are clear and compelling
reasons to grant (China) permanent normal trade relations, and
that's why I view this as a foreign policy priority," Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton presented to Congress last week a bill calling for
giving China PNTR at an early date. The move has won widespread
support from both the business and political circles in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes First Anti-Virus Software for Windows 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Computer Associates (China)
Software Company today published China's first anti-virus software
named KILL 2000 for Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
The company cooperated with China InfoWorld newspaper and
Software World Magazine to carry its free software to their
readers with their InfoCD and PC Worker compact disc.
</P>
<P>
The new software's virus-scanning efficiency is about 30
percent faster than common anti-virus software.
</P>
<P>
When handling real-time system supervision, the software also
uses less system resources -- about 1,800 K bytes of EMS memory
compared to the common software's 3,000 K. This greatly increases
the computer's operation speed and allows more programs to work
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
Through the special websites on the Internet, computer users
can get free upgraded versions of the anti-virus software from
time to time.
</P>
<P>
The company has extended the original domestic computer virus
detecting network to cover 40 countries by cooperating with the U.
S. software corporation Computer Associates.

<HEADLINE> Employment Relations Bill Tabled in NZ Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government
tabled in Parliament here on Tuesday its Employment Relations Bill
containing a raft of measures to strengthen the position of unions
in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
The law will repeal the Employment Contracts Act, which was
worked out nine years ago by a former government with the National
Party as the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
The present government under the ruling Labor Party argues that
the Employment Contracts Act stripped too much power from workers
by outlawing strikes and lockouts during the first 40-days of wage
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the Employment Relations Bill, unions will have the legal
right to enter a workplace on union business, and there can be two
paid stop-work meetings a year. Union representatives will get up
to five days paid union education leave a year.
</P>
<P>
The Bill will give every worker the right to choose between an
individual contract and a collective agreement negotiated by a
union.
</P>
<P>
It has been set down for debate in Parliament on Thursday.
Members of the public will have five-to-six-weeks to make
submissions on the bill, with the government intending to pass the
legislation in July.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- About 800 government officials
and Internet tycoons from 30 countries across the world gathered
in George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, Monday to examine
the framework for the worldwide net and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The two-day 2000 Global Internet Summit, with the theme "
Industries, Governments, Consumers and the Internet," will examine
how the Internet is creating novel forms of self-governance as
they adapt to the global market, legal, societal and cultural
demands.
</P>
<P>
It will also examine the role of government in promoting the
development of the Internet, and major hindrances to its growth.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted James S. Gilmore, governor of the
Commonwealth of Virginia, as outlining several principals that
will contribute to the growth of the Internet in his address at
the conference opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Internet was developed for all people, not for the
privileged, Gilmore said. Governments and industries should take
firm steps in combating cyber-terrorism. The governor also said
people should think new and different in the wired world.
</P>
<P>
Fairfax Country is among the top five regions in the United
States with the highest number of Internet host computers.

TOKYO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Spain won a berth in the Olympic
field hockey tournament after beating Argentina 6-3 in the
qualifying tournament at Osaka, Japan, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine team led 3-1 midway through the second half and

pull off the win.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish team took the lead when Pep Sanchez scored off a
penalty corner in the sixth minute.

<P>
However, the Argentine team draw level shortly before half-time
and then scored two more goals soon after resumption.
</P>
<P>
Then the Spanish team, silver medalists at the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics, staged a brilliant comeback. Pol Amat and Eduard Tubau

final whistle.
</P>
<P>
Now with 10 points to their credit and the last match against

<HEADLINE> Oil Price Hike to Slow Down Thai Growth: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices based on the average
crude oil price of 29 U.S. dollars per barrel and the exchange
rate of 38 baht to the dollar are expected to slow down the
economic growth rate in Thailand to 3.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Thailand's National Economic and Social
Development Board predicted a 4.4 percent gross domestic product
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The inflation, as a result, would increase to 2.59 percent from
an earlier forecast two percent, Deputy Prime Minister and
Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi was quoted by the Bangkok
Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economic ministers and senior officials met on
Monday to work out measures to ease the impact of the oil price
rise.
</P>
<P>
The National Energy Policy Committee approved broad measures to
cushion the impact of rising oil prices, including lowering diesel
prices for certain sectors and increasing the use of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen will be able to enjoy to the end of this year a 160-
million-baht (4.3-million-dollar) government fund to subsidize the
diesel price.
</P>
<P>
Farmers who have bank accounts in the Bank for Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives will continue to be able to buy oil at a
price 15 satang (0.4 cents) per liter lower than the market price.
</P>
<P>
Small- and medium-sized enterprises will also benefit from the
diesel price reduction.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to encourage the use of natural gas, the
signing of a contract to buy natural gas from Myanmar will be
hastened and the laying of gas pipelines around Bangkok and nearby
provinces will be speeded up.
</P>
<P>
Motorists and industrial plants will also be encouraged to take
energy-saving measures.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Targets 535,000 Tourist Arrivals in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Among the targets for this year are increasing tourist arrivals
to 535,000 and bringing in 369 million U.S. dollars of foreign
exchange as well as creating 116,000 direct and indirect
employment opportunities through tourism.
</P>
<P>
To increase tourist figures, the sources said the ministry is
to launch a 10 million-dollar tourism campaign to sell and promote
the country's varied attractions in the world tourism market.
</P>
<P>
The government last week approved 5 million dollars for the
campaign. The balance is to be contributed by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The government will also appoint a special marketing Advisory
Committee to draw up an extensive marketing strategy to boost the
country's image and market Sri Lanka as an attractive tourist
destination, the sources pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The promotional campaign will cover major tourist generating
market such as the European countries, India, Japan and South East
Asia, they added.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka registered a 17 percent rise in tourist arrivals last
year to 446,000. Earnings in the same year reached 200 million U.S.
dollars, making tourism the third largest foreign exchange source
for the island country.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Stunned for Second Straight Week at Indian Wells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- After looking almost
superhuman early in the season, Andre Agassi has looked human the
last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
An error-prone Agassi suffered his second straight first-round
loss today as Hicham Arazi of Morocco upset the top-seeded
American 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 at the $4.95 million Tennis Masters Series
of Indian Wells in California.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia coasted in his first-
round match, crushing Vincent Spadea 6-1, 6-1 in 52 minutes to
earn his first career match win this event and keep the American
winless in six matches this season.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, top seed Martina Hingis of Switzerland and
second seed Lindsay Davenport of the United States each moved a
step closer to a possible showdown in the final by storming into
the quarters.
</P>
<P>
Hingis vanquished 10th seed Barbara Schett of Austria 6-1, 6-1
as she seeks her second title here in three years.
</P>
<P>
Davenport continued her blistering start to 2000, dumping ninth
seed Julie Halard-Decugis of France 6-2, 6-1 to reach the round of
eight.
</P>
<P>
Williams, who rallied to defeat Italy's Rita Grande in three
sets on Sunday, was stretched to the limit by the 16-year-old
Clijsters in the third round of the U.S. Open en route to her
first Grand Slam triumph last summer.
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who suffered a humiliating loss last week in Scottsdale,
Arizona for his first defeat in 2000, continued his problems early
against Arazi. The American committed 27 unforced errors in the
first set and was down a break in the second before roaring back
to level the match.
</P>
<P>
Agassi declined to speak to the media following his defeat.
</P>
<P>
For the women, fifth seed Mary Pierce of France and seventh
seed Monica Seles of the United States also won their fourth-round
matches.

<HEADLINE> 3 U.S. Soldiers to Be Charged in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary
Orlando Mercado said Tuesday that charges will be filed against
three visiting American Navy soldiers who allegedly mauled a
Filipino taxi driver in the central island of Cebu.
</P>
<P>
"These are acts which we cannot condone," said Mercado who
vowed to help speed up the filing of criminal cases against the U.
S. servicemen who were part of the 500 American contingents aboard
the visiting warship USS Blue Ridge which arrived in Cebu on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said in a statement that the three soldiers, Michael
Keys,Jonny Earl Lowerly and Shannon Towers, will be charged of
physical injuries, malicious mischief and damage to property.
</P>
<P>
Taxi driver Marcelo Batestil said the three mauled him Sunday
as he pleaded before them to pay their taxi bill worth 900 pesos (
22.5 U.S.dollars) which they refused to give.
</P>
<P>
"These Americans are clearly under the Visiting Forces
Agreement(VFA). They will be arrested upon issuance of arrest
warrants," said Mercado as he stressed that he has talked about
the matter to Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that American servicemen will be charged
in a Philippine court following the ratification of the VFA by
Philippine Senate in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
The VFA provides immunity to American servicemen while they are
on duty for military exercises or port calls.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. servicemen who are off duty, like the three, are
not immune from Philippine laws although they are still covered by
the VFA.
</P>
<P>
Elmer Cato, a member of the presidential commission on the VFA,
said the U.S. navy have expressed "disappointment" over the
incident and "apologized" for the misbehavior of its servicemen.
</P>
<P>
According to Cato, the U.S. navy turned in the three sailors to
the Cebu police investigators for questioning on Monday and
assured they"would produce the sailors to the courts whenever
necessary."

<HEADLINE> Abbot-Cum-Lawmaker Advocates Rights for Buddhist Temples (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The development of religions is closely linked with economic
and social progress, Shi said, adding "Social stability and
economic prosperity are solid guarantees for the development of
temples and monasteries in China."
</P>
<P>
As a deputy to China's top legislature, the abbot has been
trying every means to protect the rights and interests of Chinese
Buddhists. In 1998, at the First Session of the Ninth NPC, Shi
sponsored a bill against those who had used temple names in
pursuit of ill profits. At the current session, the monk has put
forward a proposal to regulate religious activities and initiate a
registration system of religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
"What I hate most are those who are engaged in illegal
activities in the name of religion, like the notorious Falun Gong,
" Shi said, blaming the cult organization for cheating the people
and hurting the rights and interests of the religious circles.
</P>
<P>
The Buddhist lawmaker also lashed out at those overseas people
who had wantonly accused China of having no religious freedom. "
They know nothing about religious matters in China. They should
visit China and the Shaolin Temple," he said, noting that China is
en route to a nation governed by law and the situation is becoming
more favorable for the development of religions.
</P>
<P>
According to the abbot, the Shaolin Temple, a key cultural
heritage protected by the state, is in its prime time and its 100-
plus monks are strictly following Buddhist doctrines.
</P>
<P>
The temple is well linked to the rest parts of the world. In
recent years, the abbot has been traveling extensively and meeting
religious and charity people, leaving his footprints in over 30
foreign countries including the United States, the United Kingdom,
Japan and Canada.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Five Hydropower Stations Along Yangtze Tributary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province in northwest
China plans to kick start an ambitious hydropower development
program with an investment of 8 billion yuan (964 million US
dollars) along the Hanjiang River, the largest tributary of the
Yangtze, China's longest river.
</P>
<P>
Five hydropower stations to be erected along the Hanjiang River
are expected to bring the total annual power output along the
river up to seven billion kwh, according to Cheng Andong, governor
of Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
There are currently two hydropower plants along the river, with
a combined generating capacity of one million kw.
</P>
<P>
Hanjiang River originates in the area of Hanzhong City in
central Shaanxi, and joins the Yangtze at Huhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province. The stored hydropower capacity
along the 700-kilometer tributary in Shaanxi is projected at 4.7
million kw, with the usable capacity reaching 2.8 kw.
</P>
<P>
So far, Feasibility studies and preliminary designing for the
four hydropower plants have been completed and are now in the
process of being submitted to the relevant departments for
approval. And a special development company has also been set up
with an aim to implement the program through multiple financing.
</P>
<P>
The project is a viable one, according to Shan Lun, a noted
water conservancy expert and an academician from the Chinese
Academy of engineering, who cited two figures to back up his
endorsement of the project: the program requires only 18,000
residents to be relocated and some 930 ha of arable land to be
inundated.
</P>
<P>
A full exploitation of hydropower resources along the Hanjiang
River will help solve energy imbalance problem in Shaanxi Province,
which mainly use thermal energy, and clean energy is preferred to
ease pressure on local environment, Shan Lun said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Proposal Law on E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Believing that China has the
largest potential to develop e-commerce, a group of deputies have
raised a proposal on the issue to the National People's Congress,
the top legislature, which is convening its annual session here
from March 5-15.
</P>
<P>
The bill is the brainchild of 30 NPC deputies led by Zhang
Zhongli, a vice chairman of Shanghai Federation of Social
Scientists, who suggest that a law on e-commerce be enacted as
early as possible so as to create a sound environment for the
development of the sector under the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
China is a new-comer to e-commerce which has been booming
around the world along with a fast development of electronic
networking technology. The number of Chinese surfers is expanding
at an explosive speed and reached 8.9 million by the end of last
year, creating an increasingly larger market for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, China now has over 600 e-shops
which are being joined by two more competitors a day on average.
</P>
<P>
For Lu Guanqiu, chairman of the board of directors of the
Zhejiang Universal Joint Group, e-commerce is of great importance
for his company whose products are mostly exported to the United
States and European nations where on-line sale has been popular.
</P>
<P>
Dong Weiping, an NPC deputy and general manager of the Hangzhou
Baida Group Co., Ltd., said her company is to focus on developing
e-commerce. The group, which is located in Hangzhou, the capital
of eastern Zhejiang Province, is one of the earliest in the
country to adopt a modern corporate system and is one of the Top
100 listed companies in China. "E-trading is quick, accurate and
helpful to improve the all-round quality of enterprises," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dong complained that the country is still slow in developing an
electronic banking system and lacks relevant laws. China's e-
commerce would develop faster if these problems are resolved, she
noted.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials in charge of the matter, a
large-scale government-backed networking project is under way and
relevant government departments are working on a general framework
for the development of e-commerce.

<P>
Among the nearly 3,000 deputies of the NPC, in its annual
session since March 5, Shi is unique for his Buddhist clothing and
vegetarian diet at a Beijing hotel. Frequent meetings have not
stopped him from doing religious services regularly, including
meditation and sutra readings.
</P>
<P>
"Buddhists have always kept themselves apace with social
progress, and these modern tools are making me well informed of
what's going on in my temple and the outside world," said the
abbot, who kept counting the beads with his hands, a Buddhist way
of meditation, which almost concealed his skillfulness as an
expert Internet surfer.
</P>
<P>
Shaolin Temple was built in 495 by Emperor Xiaowen of the North
Wei Dynasty (386-534) for an Indian monk who then founded the Chan,
one of the largest sect of the Chinese Buddhism. Every year,
Shaolin receives more than one million pilgrims and learners of
its Shaolin Kungfu, a most famous school of Chinese martial arts.
Shaolin Kungfu has been spread to other parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Chief Warns of Poor Preparation of Shuttlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) chief Wismoyo Arismunandar has reminded national
shuttlers of the dangers of poor preparation, warning them that it
might make the nation's gold target in the Sydney Olympic Games
unattainable.
</P>
<P>
Wismoyo was commenting on the shuttlers' failure in the All
England badminton championship over the weekend, which Indonesia
returned home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
He said in his opinion Indonesian shuttlers were not physically
and mentally prepared and their motivation to be champions was
lacking.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese shuttlers and the other winners were better
prepared than us. They were motivated to win. They were
enthusiastic. We have to learn from them. We have to boost our
physical stamina, mental abilities and motivation to win," Wismoyo
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He called on the shuttlers to learn from their failure, and use
it to revive their motivation for the Olympics. He said that he
would invite Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) officials
for an evaluation.
</P>
<P>
"The failure must stimulate the shuttlers to try their best in
the Olympics. They may lose at the All England, but they have to
show the world that they can win in the Olympics," he said, adding
he was still optimistic that national shuttlers could dominate the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Separately, PBSI training director Christian Hadinata said
Indonesia could only predict its gold chances in the Olympics
after the Thomas and Uber Cup championships in Malaysia in May.
</P>
<P>
"We have to win the Thomas Cup, particularly our men's doubles,
because they are our big hope. They have to be champions if we
want to show the badminton world that we still exist," he said.

Federation Council approved staging 33 events instead of 30 in the
2001 SEA Games to be hosted by Malaysia, Indonesia's National
Sports Council Secretary-General Rudolf S. Warouw said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Warouw, who just returned from the council meeting in Kuala
Lumpur, said that Indonesia had asked to include judo, rowing and
canoeing, softball and traditional boat racing in the biennial
event, but the latter received little support from participating
countries.
</P>
<P>
"The decision was reached through voting on March 11. Eight
countries wanted judo to be included and seven countries voted for
canoeing. However, only two countries, Indonesia and the
Philippines, voted for softball and three countries, Indonesia,
Myanmar and Vietnam, voted for traditional boat races. A proposal
needs support from at least five countries to be approved," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 30 sports are archery, badminton, basketball, billiards and
snooker, boxing, cycling, equestrian, fencing, golf, gymnastics,
hockey, karate-do, lawn bowls, netball, pencak silat, petanque,
sepak takraw, shooting, soccer, squash, swimming (including diving,
synchronized swimming and water polo), table tennis, taekwondo,
tennis, ten pin bowling, track and field, volleyball,
weightlifting, wushu and yachting.
</P>
<P>
Warouw said that the president of the Malaysian Olympics
Council Tunku Imran ibni Tuanku Jafar would discuss the
possibility of adding the events with the Malaysian government.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the three sports will be officially acknowledged by the
Malaysian government, so it will stage competition in 33 sports.
Imran will discuss it with his government. The decision should be
accepted because the proposal comes from the SEA Games federation,
" Warouw said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Malaysian Olympics Council would announce the
official sports for SEA Games 2001 in two months at the latest.
</P>
<P>
Warouw added that Vietnam was selected by the federation for
the first time to host the 2003 SEA Games.

<HEADLINE> Legislation Law to Promote Law Making in Ethnic Minority Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Deputies to the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) from ethnic minority areas say adoption of
a draft Legislation Law, or law on law-making, will accelerate
legislation in China's autonomous regions inhabited dominantly by
ethnic minority people.
</P>
<P>
The law on law-making is expected to improve the quality of
legislation in ethnic minority areas, facilitate implementing the
strategy of developing China's west in a big way and promote
economic development in ethnic minority regions, according to
deputies when discussing the draft law in group discussions.
</P>
<P>
Ma Changyi, an NPC deputy from Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
expressed appreciation for the fact that the legislation law
stipulates that ethnic minority autonomous regions have the right
to formulate autonomy-related regulations and separate regulations.
</P>
<P>
This allows ethnic minority regions to formulate regulations of
their own to ensure social and economic development and
effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of ethnic
minority people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He held that the legislation law will play a very important
role in maintaining stability and prosperity in ethnic minority
autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Amudun Niyaz, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
People's Congress of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said the
draft Legislation Law contains stipulations on limits for the
power of laws, autonomy-related regulations and separate
regulations, procedures for the enactment of laws and regulations
and rules for their application.
</P>
<P>
He said that when Xinjiang enacts laws and regulations on
agriculture, reducing farmers' financial burden and market
activities, the autonomous region will make sure that they agree
with actual conditions in Xinjiang, as is required by the law on
law-making.
</P>
<P>
He said that, in future legislation, Xinjiang will try to avoid
the tendency of copying state laws and regulations but will
formulate its own regulations on separate, specific issues. He
said he strongly objects to seeking regional and departmental
interests at the expense of state interests.
</P>
<P>
Qiyingcheng, an NPC deputy of Mongolian nationality, said that,
since the legislation law is to standardize all law-making
activities and involves the basic rights of all the Chinese people,
it is very important to ethnic minority people in the country.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of ethnic minority people are illiterates
when it comes to laws and regulations, he said. It happens that
irregularities in some administrative and local regulations harm
the interests of ethnic minority people. "The law on law-making
will change this," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has five ethnic minority autonomous regions, 30 ethnic
minority autonomous prefectures and 120 ethnic minority autonomous
counties with more than 100 million ethnic minority people.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Undergoing Examination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Until now we have not received any report from the team of
doctors as to whether or not there will be a follow-up examination.
There can be no decision on what steps can be taken until a
definitive report on Soeharto's health is submitted to us,"
Attorney General Marzuki Darusman was quoted by national
newspapers Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether his office had imposed a deadline for the doctors
to submit the report, Marzuki said: "There has been no time limit
set by the Attorney General's Office."
</P>
<P>
Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon said Soeharto underwent
the medical examination on his own initiative.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying that Soeharto had
always wanted to cooperate, but due to technical reasons he did
not show up for previously scheduled medical examinations.
</P>
<P>
Tampubolon previously said that on earlier occasions, Soeharto'
s lawyers and medical team had not been notified by the Attorney
General's Office about the scheduled medical examinations.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 78, is under investigation for alleged corruption
during his 32 years in power. But efforts by the Attorney General'
s Office to question him have failed, as Soeharto's lawyers have
claimed the former president is too ill to be questioned.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Elimination Drive in Gansu Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 million people
living under the poverty line in northwest China's Gansu Province
now have ample food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The number of the needy in Gansu has dropped from 12.54 million
in 1982 to 1.22 million last year, said Xu Jin, director of the
Gansu Provincial Poverty Elimination Office.
</P>
<P>
Dingxi Prefecture, the poorest area in Gansu, has built the
largest potato production and processing base in northwest China.
Last year the base turned out 3.7 billion kg of potatoes and each
farmer earned at least 600 yuan from potato production. All local
residents have seen increased earnings.
</P>
<P>
Xu attributed the drop in the impoverished population to the
spread of water-conservation technology and the relocation of poor
farmers in barren areas to fertile land.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 570,000 farmers in the poor
mountainous areas of Gansu had left their ancestral homeland and
settled in newly-built villages in Hexi Corridor, which is
economically better-off.
</P>
<P>
Tang Zhanshun, one of those re-settled, said he has built six
brick-and-tile houses and added household necessities, a color TV
and a VCR since he moved to Hexi Corridor eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has allocated 2.67 billion yuan to
build a resettlement center for housing 200,000. An estimated one
million poor farmers will improve their living standards by
resettlement in the coming years, said a local official.

<HEADLINE> Women Major Victims of Family Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Women continue to be the major
victims of family violence in Qingdao, a major port city of east
China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the Qingdao Family Violence Injury Testimony
Center, over 90 percent of the complaints it received in the past
two years were from women and over 60 percent of them were between
30 to 40 years old.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 170 women from whom the center has taken testimony
since it was established in April, 1998 were beaten by their
husbands who had low income and little or no education.
</P>
<P>
It attributed the increase in violence against women to "deep-
rooted male chauvinism" among some Chinese men.
</P>
<P>
The actual scale of violence could be much higher because many
women are too ashamed to report their situations, according to
experts on family violence.
</P>
<P>
They said the gap between the rich and poor, the increasing
number of women lay-offs and extramarital affairs were the three
major reasons for family violence.
</P>
<P>
The fabric of Chinese society has been altered enormously in
the last 20 years, especially in urban and coastal cities, and
these changes have taken their toll on many families, the experts
noted.
</P>
<P>
In major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, hotlines and
emergency aid centers have been set up to protect victims of
family violence.

<HEADLINE> NBA Hits Sonics, Raptors with $100,000 Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- This time, the NBA followed
through on its threat and slapped both the Seattle SuperSonics and
Toronto Raptors with $100,000 fines for their coaches' refusal to
wear microphones during Sunday's nationally televised game between
the teams.
</P>
<P>
To protest a controversial unilateral mandate imposed by the
league, coaches Paul Westphal of the SuperSonics and Butch Carter
of the Raptors decided not to wear microphones during Sunday's
game at Key Arena.
</P>
<P>
Their actions came a week after Miami Heat coach Pat Riley
refused to wear a microphone for a televised game. The league made
an exception in Riley's case, claiming it did not give the coach
enough advance notice, but warned that the next coach to refuse to
wear a microphone would subject his team to a $100,000 penalty.
</P>
<P>
The NBA followed through on its threat after both Westphal and
Carter snubbed commissioner David Stern's mandate. Westphal called
the practice "a serious mistake" and added he would pay the fine
out of his own pocket.
</P>
<P>
"I've been asked to choose between compromising the competitive
integrity of the game or seeing my team ownership fined $100,000,"
Westphal said on Sunday. "I cannot accept that this great league
would want to force such a choice. I will not wear the wire while
coaching."
</P>
<P>
Carter consulted with general manager Glen Grunwald, who told
him to wear the microphone. But he also spoke with players Charles
Oakley and Antonio Davis, who told him not to wear it.
</P>
<P>
"I can't afford to lose the respect of my players," Carter said.
"If I have to, I'll pay the fine myself."
</P>
<P>
Jeff Van Gundy of the New York Knicks, who has railed against
the league's microphone edict, is the next coach on the spot. He
has been told to wear a microphone for the Knicks' home game
against the Houston Rockets Tuesday night on TNT.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on NBC, Stern spoke about the need to increase
coverage in the Internet era and said the Coaches Association was
making a big mistake "trying to push back the clock."
</P>
<P>
Westphal read and released a statement prior to Sunday's game
and took no questions afterward. While conceding that Stern has
done a great job of promoting the league, Westphal said wearing a
microphone "seriously impedes my ability to compete."
</P>
<P>
"To be absolutely clear, after all the legal battles are over,
if the league office prevails, I will be the one to write out the
check for $100,000 from my own personal account," Westphal said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The microphones are not live and coaches can turn them off in
sensitive situations, as long as they leave them on for the
majority of the game. Technicians check the dialogue for offensive
material, then replay the coach's conversations.
</P>
<P>
Coaches who have agreed to wear the microphone include Larry
Brown of Philadelphia and Flip Saunders of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
Beginning April, the NBA also wants to put cameras in practices
and locker rooms, areas where access previously was limited to
media and only for certain periods.
</P>
<P>
NBA Players Association executive director Billy Hunter labeled
that notion "intrusive and discomforting" while union president
and Knicks center Patrick Ewing simply called it "wrong".
</P>
<P>
Hunter also said the cameras are a fundamental change in
working conditions, which he pointed out must be agreed to in
collective bargaining.
</P>
<P>
The idea of increasing access comes as Nielsen ratings for NBA
telecasts have sagged since the retirement of superstar Michael
Jordan. This season's ratings are even lower than those of last
season, when the NBA was coming back from a lockout.

WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Lakers center
Shaquille O'Neal, who erupted for a career-high 61 points last
Monday, today was named NBA Player of the Week for the period

<HEADLINE> Zuma: 2006 Soccer World Cup Could Boost S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The social and economic
benefits of staging the 2006 soccer world cup would be just the
type of boost needed to complete the transformation and
integration of South African society, South African Deputy
President Jacob Zuma said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet in honor of the soccer world governing
body FIFA's technical inspection group in Cape Town, he said that
when South Africa said it was ready to host the 2006 world cup, "
we are not merely boasting".
</P>
<P>
"We are not making promises that we cannot meet. It is the
conviction of all soccer loving South Africans, and all Africans,
fully matched by what our country has to offer, that..... indeed
Africa's time has come."
</P>
<P>
Zuma said he was sure that the technical group's stay in South
Africa had clarified in their minds the reality about the negative
image "which some of our competitors have been trying to portray
of our country".
</P>
<P>
"I know that your contact with ordinary people and soccer
lovers has set the record straight in this regard. As South
Africans, we are proud that we can host our guests with confidence
and dignity. Our international track record speaks for itself,"
Zuma said.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa sought no special treatment.
</P>
<P>
"Rather, we seek a partnership with the global football
community -- because we deserve it. We seek a partnership that
extends beyond the borders of South Africa, encompassing all of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This partnership will be sealed by the footballing nations of
the world agreeing that the 2006 world cup must be hosted in
Africa. For us, this is not only a call for South Africa," said
Zuma.
</P>
<P>
"When we state the case for South Africa to you and to the
footballing world, we do so for our entire continent. We urge you
to 'hear Africa's call'."

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accidents Kill 50 in Four Days in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 50 people were killed
and 115 others injured in over 50 traffic accidents in the first
four days of the nine-day Feast of Sacrifice across Turkey, the
Anatolia News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The heavy death toll is mainly caused by heavy-duty vehicles,
such as vans and trucks, that were allowed to use the roads during
the holiday which began on Saturday, after the lifting of a 10-
year-long ban, said the report.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of Turkish Traffic Safety Foundation Atilay
Yesil complained that the decision to lift the ban on heavy-duty
vehicles had not been discussed enough.
</P>
<P>
In defending the decision, Interior Minister Saadettin Tantan
claimed that the ban on commercial transport during the holidays
had rendered huge financial and business losses. But he did not
give the exact figures.
</P>
<P>
He added that as statistics on traffic accidents in the last few
years showed, heavy-duty vehicles were not solely responsible for
those accidents.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Should Work Hard for EU Membership: Gama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime
Gama said on Tuesday that Turkey and the European Union had to work
hard to prepare Turkey for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Greece on Monday, Gama, whose country holds the
EU's rotating presidency, came to Ankara to discuss bilateral
relations between Turkey and Portugal as well as Turco-EU
relations.
</P>
<P>
He met with his Turkish counterpart Ismail Cem and was also
received by Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit during the day.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that he believes this visit will improve the
relations between Turkey and Portugal within the framework of the
EU.
</P>
<P>
Gama said that after his country became the EU term president,
it started to work together with Turkey for a "road map" and an "
agenda" within the framework of Turkey's EU candidacy.
</P>
<P>
Prior to meeting with Cem, Gama told reporters that they were
working on the acceleration of Turkey's EU membership bid.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work together since Turkey is facing Europe as a
candidate member of the EU, and we must pay attention to all the
items that can make the pact a success," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was accepted as a candidate at the EU Helsinki summit
last December. Cem said that Gama's visit would lay the groundwork
for the Turco-EU Partnership Council meeting which will be held in
April in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Gama was expected to leave in the evening after wrapping up his
visit.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Resumes Ambassadorial-Level Ties With Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt resumed ties with Sudan at
the ambassadorial level here Tuesday as its new ambassador Mohammed
Asem Ibrahim presented his credentials to Sudanese President Omar
el-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that he would try his best to remove the
remaining obstacles on further development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt withdrew its ambassador from Khartoum in 1996 after an
abortive assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Abeba. Cairo suspected
that Khartoum masterminded the murder.
</P>
<P>
Ties between the two countries thawed after Bashir sidelined
Hassan al-Turabi, who was seen as the Islamist ideologue behind the
government.
</P>
<P>
Bashir underlined the importance of coordination and cooperation
between the two countries particularly with regard to the issues of
peace and reconciliation in Sudan, gripped in a 17-year civil war.
The ambassador reiterated his country's opposition to the secession
of south Sudan, warning it "will inevitably make other ethnic
groups demand secession and Sudan's map will then be torn apart."
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Othman also
met with the new Egypt's ambassador. They discussed the ways to
enhance bilateral ties and cooperation.

The transfer of Ubeidiya, Anata and Beitunia, instead of Al-Ram,

level here Tuesday as its new ambassador Mohammed Asem Ibrahim
presented his credentials to Sudanese President Omar el-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that he would try his best to remove the
remaining obstacles on further development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Egypt withdrew its ambassador from Khartoum in 1996 after an
abortive assassination attempt against Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Abeba. Cairo suspected
that Khartoum masterminded the murder. (Sudan-Egypt-Ties)

<HEADLINE> Canadian Scientists Announce New Cancer Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists Tuesday
announced new findings that may lead to a breakthrough in the
treatment of up to 60 percent of cancers.
</P>
<P>
The Cancer Agency of the province of British Columbia and
Kinetek Pharmaceuticals told a news conference in Vancouver that
they had discovered a faulty genetic switch that helps turn
healthy human cells into invasive, cancerous killers.
</P>
<P>
The faulty switch is caused by a growth factor that is
hyperactive in 60 percent of cancers, including prostate, breast
and ovarian cancers, as well as brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
The growth factor, known as ILK, is a protein that functions as
a "master switch" in cell's communications networks. The switch is
normally turned on for brief periods during cell development and
growth.
</P>
<P>
But in cancerous cells ILK is turned on and on because of a
gene mutation. It makes the cells invasive and triggers production
of blood vessels needed to keep tumors alive.
</P>
<P>
By using small molecule drugs isolated at the Vancouver-based
Kinetek Pharmaceuticals, Canadian scientists succeeded in turning
ILK off in mice and in cancerous human cells in the test tube.
</P>
<P>
They also induce cell death and prevent the spread and growth
of blood vessels that feed tumors, according to their research
paper on the work published Tuesday in the proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Kinetek Pharmaceuticals says it has developed several potential
drug candidates to inhibit ILK, return its activity level to
normal and restore proper functioning of the growth factor
signaling pathways.
</P>
<P>
The inhibitors appear to have been well tolerated by healthy
cells, unlike chemotheraph or radiation, although further research
is needed to prove that the ILK suppressers are safe and effective,
Canadian scientists say.
</P>
<P>
They hope to move their findings to trials in humans in 18
months to two years.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Bans carrying Weapons. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Colombian authorities announced
Tuesday that starting from Tuesday at 18:00 hours and up to next
Friday at 18:00 hours, weapons are banned in Bogota and
Cundinamarca.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken due to the country-wide strike coming
this Friday, announced by the main trade unions, said head of the
13th army brigade colonel Jose Domingo Garcia.
</P>
<P>
"Authorities will confiscate weapons when violating army
orders", even though people carrying them may have license permits,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Excluded of this measure are people in charge of public
security, national organizations of security, army forces and law
officers.
</P>
<P>
Banning will be enforced in Bogota, capital of the
Cundinamarca district.
</P>
<P>
Authorization will be granted to personnel belonging to
security companies legally constituted and the diplomatic body,
appropriately accredited by the Colombian state, Garcia said.

<HEADLINE> British Army Rejects "Troops Out" Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the British Army
Tuesday dismissed claims that nothing has been done to reduce the
security presence in Northern Ireland as agreed in the Good Friday
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said troop levels on the ground were at their
lowest level since 1970 and a third of the province's bases had
been closed down.
</P>
<P>
The army's response followed calls by Irish Foreign Minister
Brian Cowen for a reduction of the military presence in sensitive
areas such as south Armagh.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Irish national television RTE, Cowen said such
a move would take away any reason that dissident republican
paramilitaries might have for continuing violence.
</P>
<P>
"If you want to decommission the mind set, you've got to be
prepared to show that politics works on the ground, in those areas,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The Army spokesman said it was "outrageous" and "ludicrous" to
suggest there had not been changes.
</P>
<P>
Routine army patrols are down by three-quarters since the
signing of the Good Friday Agreement and in two-thirds of the
province the RUC operated without routine army support, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A total 34 out of 105 bases -- including two battalion and
three major company bases -- had been shut together with two
patrol bases and a dozen permanent vehicle check points.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in April 1998,
18 bases have been closed down or demolished, and all border
patrol bases and all permanent vehicle check-points have been
closed or demolished.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush to Seal Nominations in U.S. Primaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and Texas Governor George W. Bush are expected to lock up their
parties' presidential nominations as six states held primaries
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Former President Bush and his wife voted for their son in their
home state of Texas. "It gets down to family and how lucky we are,
" said the father.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gore got a chance to vote for himself Tuesday. The
Democratic vice president and his wife, Tipper, voted at a school
in his hometown of Carthage, Tennessee State.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Texas and Tennessee, Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Oklahoma also voted Tuesday. The six states will
award 341 Republican and 566 Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
After voting in Carthage, Gore headed for Florida, a state he
is targeting even though the governor is Bush's brother, Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Bush won primaries on Super Tuesday on March 7, when
contests were held in 16 states and became de facto presidential
candidates after their rivals, former Senator Bill Bradley and
Senator McCain, were forced to drop out of the race.
</P>
<P>
Before Tuesday's vote, Bush had 701 of the 1,034 delegates
needed to win the Republican presidential nomination, and Gore had
1,921 of the 2,170 required to nominate the presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
A lock on the delegates necessary for the Republican nomination
was mathematically possible Tuesday for Bush, while Gore seemed
sure to go over the top in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
Both men are now focused on the coming general election battle
which is expected to be tough and bitter.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Hold Open Debate on Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
is scheduled to hold an open debate on Angola on Wednesday morning
as some of African nations brace for a counter-attack on a U.N.
report on how the rebel National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA) has been able to circumvent U.N. sanctions by
illegally selling gems for weapons.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Security Council, Anwarul Chowdhury of
Bangladesh, told the press that the open Council meeting will
attract foreign ministers of Angola, Togo, Burkina Faso, South
Africa and Belgium.
</P>
<P>
The report, compiled by the U.N. Sanction Committee headed by
Robert Fowler of Canada, spells out how UNITA has been able to
sidestep U.N. sanctions by buying weapons, mainly from Bulgaria,
having them shipped to African nations and paying for them with
diamonds from mines it controls.
</P>
<P>
Primarily, the report accuses President Blaise Compaoro of
Burkina Faso, President Gnassingbe Eyadema of Togo and the late
Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko of having personally received
diamonds for having helped UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi with arms
and fuel shipments in violations of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Burkina Faso, Togo, Rwanda and Bulgaria have denied the
allegations. Togo is to host a summit of the Organization of
African Unity in July.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council imposed an arms and fuel embargo on UNITA
in 1993, a year before the United Nations brokered a peace
agreement between the rebels and government. In 1998, six months
before the peace agreement collapsed, the Council expanded the
measures to include a ban on rebel diamond exports, which are
estimated to have supplied the group with up to 4 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Togolese Foreign Minister Joseph Koffingoh denied Monday that
any weapons or diamonds were every shipped through the country,
saying the only help Togo gave to Angola was to accept refugees,
which it was doing on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister of Burkina Faso, Issouf Ouedraogo, denied
the U.N. allegations against his president and said his U.N.
ambassador would make a full statement when the Security Council
holds an open meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report found that Burkina Faso was a major transit center
of arms and fuel, and that Ouagadougu was a "particularly favored
safe haven" for diamond transactions because the president's
office would send an escort to the airport to protect the UNITA
official carrying the gems.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria emerged as the key provider of weapons to UNITA in
1997, and Bulgarian authorities "had reason to believe" that
certificate supplied by African countries to buy the guns weren't
genuine, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, Bulgaria was also reported to slam the report
allegation as groundless.

Ambulance teams took 23 casualties, including the fatally
injured person, from the coach.
</P>
<P>
Four were said to be seriously injured -- one of whom was flown

<HEADLINE> British Queen Names World's Largest Yacht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The queen, dressed in a long purple coat and matching hat,
climbed a red-carpeted gangplank to board the vessel that looks
more like an aircraft or space ship than a traditional boat.
</P>
<P>
"I name this yacht Team Philips. God bless her and all who sail
in her," she said before a crowd of about 3,000 people on the
banks of the River Thames in London.
</P>
<P>
The 120-foot (37 meters) carbon-fibre vessel can move at speeds
of up to 40 knots and has two masts, each 135 feet (41 meters)
tall -- the height of 10 double-decker buses.
</P>
<P>
The crew plans to set out in April to break the Jules Verne
round-the-world record of 71 days, 14 hours, 18 minutes and eight
seconds set by French skipper Olivier de Kersauson on Sport Elec
in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
But that voyage is just a warm-up for the competition known as
"The Race", a circumnavigation beginning in Barcelona on December
31 in which the world's biggest and fastest yachts will sail
through the gale-swept southern oceans.
</P>
<P>
Goss said the main goal of the first trip would be to prepare
for The Race.
</P>
<P>
"We have a major chance at the Jules Verne record but we are
not going to break the boat to set it," he said.
</P>
<P>
After five years in the making, the crew of six was able to
make their first assessment this week of how the yacht felt on the
water.
</P>
<P>
The team said they were getting along well, an important
consideration as they will spend months together in the catamaran'
s six-foot (two meters) tall, 10-foot (three meters) wide central
pod.
</P>
<P>
The two hulls, reached from the pod by climbing over a mesh
trampoline, will be used primarily for storage but can also be
lived in if the boat capsizes.
</P>
<P>
Catamarans are known for their speed but are virtually
impossible to right if they flip over.

UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday sent condolences to the families of the victims
of Ukraine's mine explosion.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 mine workers lost their lives in an explosion in
the Barakov mine in Ukraine Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst accident in recent history in Ukraine's coal

The secretary-general has learned of the tragic accident, a
statement issued by his spokesman office said.
</P>
<P>
"He wishes to convey his sympathies to the government of people
of Ukraine, and his deepest condolences to the facilities of the
deceased," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, condolences poured in from
abroad. The Ukrainian government donated 1.82 million U.S. dollars
to the families of dead miners, and television newscasts repeated
the numbers of bank accounts set up for donations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Congressional Staffers Criticize Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON. march 14 (Xinhua) -- Five U.S. congressional
staffers Tuesday released a report, criticizing U.S.- sponsored
sanctions against Iraq, saying Iraq's people are being
systematically damaged by their isolation from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The report was the result of a travel last August, 1999, by the
five staffers from offices of Democrat and independent House
members. It was the first such congressional visit since the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
At the release the report, one of the five staffers said that
they were shocked at the sanction-caused deprivation they saw in
the hospitals and medical centers.
</P>
<P>
"Ceiling tiles were falling down. The hospital we visited didn'
t have incubators or air conditioners ... in part due to sanctions,
" said delegation member Danielle LeClair.
</P>
<P>
The report was seeking to build support in Congress for
pending legislation to lift sanctions against Iraq, imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The group said they learned of the severe drain being felt in
the medical, economic and intellectual sectors of Iraqi society.
</P>
<P>
"The oil-for-food program funds are barely enough for Iraqis'
urgent and immediate physical needs, with nothing made available
for intellectual needs," the report said. "The result is complete
intellectual deprivation."
</P>
<P>
One result of the isolation is seen in the younger political
class in Iraq, which is emerging as even more extreme force than
the current leadership class led by President Saddam Hussein and
his Ba'ath Party, they said.
</P>
<P>
"It is from these younger Ba'ath figures that pressure on
Saddam Hussein is emerging from the right, challenging his 'too
accommodating' stance toward the U.N. and the West," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. oil-for-food program has been criticized, especially
in recent months, since it was in place in 1996, as unworkable and
inadequate to provide Iraqi civilians with an acceptable quality
of life.

LIMA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Andean Community nations (ACN) said
Tuesday all this block economies will register growth this year,
contrasting with 1999's contraction.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia and Peru will grow four percent, Colombia a little over
two percent and Ecuador and Venezuela over one percent, affirmed
ACN in its report "Perspectives for Year 2000".
</P>
<P>
ACN countries will register this year an average growth of 2.3
percent and an inflation of 13.3 percent, almost two points below
1999's.
</P>
<P>
However, the economy of the ACN decreased 4.8 percent in 1999
due to the recession experienced in most countries through the
Asian crisis impact and external financial turbulence.
</P>
<P>
Andean economic recovery coincides with similar perspectives in
other regions.
</P>
<P>
"For Latin America is foreseen a notable growth of 0.1 percent
in 1999 to almost 4 percent in year 2000, while developing nations
will increase their growth more than one point, situating
themselves at 4.8 percent at the year's end," said ACN.
</P>
<P>
At close of January 2000, net international reserves of
central bank for the total of Andean countries registered an
increase of 433 million dollars in relation to December 1999.

<HEADLINE> Adams's Deadline Remark Sparks Unionist Anger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's Unionist
politicians Tuesday condemned Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams for
saying the decommissioning deadline set out in the Good Friday
Agreement no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in west Belfast before he left for talks in Washington,
Adams said the May 22 deadline for the decommissioning of all
paramilitary weapons was unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Ulster Unionist spokesman Michael McGimpsey refuted the claims
by the Sinn Fein leader.
</P>
<P>
"The May 22 is the only firm date that was agreed by all
participants who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement. For Mr.
Adams now to be stating that this date no longer exists is
ridiculous," he said.
</P>
<P>
The comments by the Sinn Fein leader have sparked a furor as
representatives from the British and Irish governments and the
most of the political parties in the province headed to the United
States for St Patrick's Day celebrations on March 17.
</P>
<P>
They will be discussing ways to break the deadlock in the peace
process which has stalled since the political institutions were
suspended last month over the decommissioning issue.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he did not believe there would be a breakthrough
this week and would prefer to stay in Belfast for the St Patrick's
Day celebrations. He said he was only going to America out of a "
sense of duty."

<HEADLINE> Simitis Urges Greeks to Grant Government Fresh Mandate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- With the official dissolution of
the country's parliament in light of next month's general
elections, Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis Tuesday called on
Greeks to grant a fresh mandate to its government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a message after President Costis Stephanopoulos
signed a presidential decree dissolving the parliament, Simitis
said that Greece successfully concluded a great national effort
and succeeded in its participation on an equal footing at the
central nucleus of decision-making of the European Union
concerning Athens' accession to the economic and monetary union (
EMU).
</P>
<P>
Greece's aim was to build on solid institutions a society of
solidarity and cohesion, a society of knowledge and culture, to
formulate a net of social security for every Greek citizen, to
combat unemployment, social disenfranchising and crime, to secure
a new era of rebirth in rural areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The critical issue for succeeding in all these aims would be
the country's course following Athens' entry into the EMU, he said,
adding that the day after would depend on the great negotiations
and for this negotiation, Greece must be politically all-powerful.
</P>
<P>
"This means that the people should have given a fresh mandate
to its government. This is what the interest of Greece demands.
For this reason I requested from President Stephanopoulos to call
early elections," the premier noted.
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Greece's main opposition New Democracy (ND) leader
Costas Karamanlis said in a statement Tuesday that the ND would
pursue policies for balanced development and a more humane society
if it won the April 9 elections.
</P>
<P>
 This will be the 10th parliamentary elections since the
restoration of democracy in Greece in 1974 after a seven-year
military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
 The last elections in Greece were held in 1996, with the
ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement led by Simitis obtaining 41.
49 percent of the votes and getting 162 seats in the 300-member
parliament.

on the trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the 7-member team will be led by Hans Corell,

of the U.N. Department of Political Affairs; Daphna Shraga, a
senior officer in the U.N. office of Legal Affairs; and Mark
Quarterman, an officer in the Department of Political Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and Cambodia have been at odds over who would
be in control of a tribunal to try the former Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
U.N. legal experts are concerned that Cambodia's legal system
is too weak to guarantee justice on its own.
</P>
<P>
This will be the final round of negotiations and an agreement
with the Cambodian government is expected to be reached to ensure
a credible trial that meets minimum international standard.

<HEADLINE> Panama Not to Ask Foreigners to Watch Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Panama will not ask foreign forces
to watch its air space, in spite of the low funds National Air
Service (SAN) counts with, the countries Interior and Justice
Minister Wenston Spadafor was quoted Tuesday by local press.
</P>
<P>
The Minister emphasized there won't be any foreign forces to
protect Panama air space nor foreign soldiers helping in matters
of national security.
</P>
<P>
Spadafora said that currently this air faction has built five
aircraft still in very poor condition, far below the 22 of old
Panama Air Force (FAP), SAN's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The situation became worse after U.S. army took away
sophisticated radar equipment used to guard and protect Panama
air space from drug trafficker flights, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the exit of U.S. troops from Panama, U.S. administration
has offered help for 18 million dollars to buy necessary equipment
to fight drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
International drug traffickers use Panama's land, water and air
ways for drug traffic intended for other countries like Mexico,
United States, etc..
</P>
<P>
According to data from this country's Judicial Technical Police,
diverse organizations including SAN, seized a total of 65,337

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Battle Against Bush Fire to Continue: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's efforts to put out
bush fires in Bale and Borena regions are expected to continue for
weeks before the blaze is completely snuffed out.
</P>
<P>
Tamirue Habte, an official of the Agriculture Ministry charged
with the task of controlling the fires, told Xinhua in a telephone
interview on Monday that the ground and aerial battles against
forest fires had been continuing since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The forest fires are ebbing away following the ground and
aerial fire- fighting operations," he said, noting that South
Africa and its professional fire fighters have made considerable
contributions to the operations.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the direct involvement of the aerial operation
by 25 South African fire fighters, South Africa has provided
Ethiopia with a spotter plane for locating fire spots and
commanding the anti-fire operation in the air, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fire-fighting experts from Germany and the United States are
also helping the country fight the wild fires, which have
destroyed at least 70,000 hectares of forest and coffee
plantations, Tamirue said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the future operations, the official said as the
range of the blaze is so big, the aerial operation against the
wild fires are expected to last for about 20 days while the ground
one might take more time.
</P>
<P>
More than 70,000 Ethiopians, including soldiers, farmers and
universities students, were reportedly battling against the wild
fires since mid February.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans to Solve Sticky Delta Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is working out a
comprehensive master plan for sorting out the trouble-making Niger
delta, a senior government official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dan Chuke, minister for Special Projects in the Presidency,
told a press conference in the country's capital Abuja that the
master plan would emphasize the region's transportation, power and
water supply, health services, education and manpower development.
</P>
<P>
Niger delta accounts for most of Nigeria's oil production of
2.8 million barrels per day, yet it is one of the country's
poorest areas, Chuke said.
</P>
<P>
The region has also been scenes of unrests, powered by
unemployed youths protesting against pollution by oil firms and
alleged marginalization by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Nigerian federal government had to twice sent in
troops to stop the rampant violence in the area, which claimed
hundreds of lives.
</P>
<P>
Soon after taking over from the military regime last May,
President Olusegun Obasanjo sent a bill to the country's top
legislature, proposing the setting up of a special commission to
take care of the development of the troubled area.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility to carry out the master plan is expected to
rest upon the proposed commission, to be financed by Nigeria's
federal government, foreign oil firms and local states in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The long-delayed bill is expected to be passed soon, according
to Nigerian newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Summers Urges PNTR as U.S. Releases Trade Agreement With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary
Lawrence H. Summers said Tuesday it will bring about "enormous" "
commercial advantages" for the United States if the U.S. Congress
passes the legislation President Bill Clinton sent last week
advocating Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China.
</P>
<P>
"This vote is not about whether China will enter the WTO,"
because "after China completes its agreements with other countries,
it will join the WTO," Summers told a meeting of the Electronics
Industry Association here in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Summers' speech coincided with the release Tuesday of the full
text of the trade agreement signed by the United States and China
last November, which paved the way for China's entry into the WTO.
The Clinton administration's new move is apparently to press
Congress to adopt the proposed legislation for China PNTR.
</P>
<P>
Summers said that in order to benefit from China's entry into
the world trading bloc, the United States must first grant it the
same permanent normal trading status that it has already granted
to every other country with whom the U.S. shares the benefits of
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"There is no disadvantage to the United States in passing the
PNTR legislation," he said. "All that PNTR does is ensure that
America enjoys the benefits that every other country will obtain."
</P>
<P>
The passage of PNTR for China, Summers said, would allow the
United States secure "unprecedented new access to what could
ultimately become the largest market in the world" as a result of
the agreement concluded by the two sides last fall.
</P>
<P>
"China has come a long way since the beginnings of market
reforms a little over 20 years ago. Its economy has grown by more
than 350 percent in real terms. It has risen to being the eleventh
largest trading nation in the world. And the number of Chinese
with access to a television has risen 100 fold, to one billion,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the WTO, Summers said, will result in "a
more rapid process of market opening and reform of its economy"
and the United States has "an enormous economic and broader stake
in supporting that decision."
</P>
<P>
He also argued that bringing China into the community of
nations "is a policy that supports our deepest national security
interests."
</P>
<P>
"If the next quarter century in Asia is to be as successful as
the last, it will be crucial that China define its greatness in a
constructive way and that it fit into the global economic system,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to media reports, Commerce Secretary
William Daley told a group of wheat dealers Monday that he
believes the legislation for China PNTR can get through Congress
if the vote is cast in May.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, in a speech to the electronic
business leaders Monday, also called on the high-tech companies to
exert their influence to turn around those who are opposed to
China PNTR.
</P>
<P>
Hastert stressed that granting China trade status proves
crucial for the electronic industry because the failure of this
will lead to the full occupation of China's enormous market by
multinational corporations from Europe, Japan and Hong Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The technology heavy Nasdaq
composite plunged on profit-taking for the second day Tuesday as
the United States and Britain agreed to share data for the human
genetic mapping, and the Dow Jones industrial average also fell.
</P>
<P>
At the close session, the Nasdaq index fell 200.61 at 4,706.63,
expanding its loss of 141.38 points Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Dow index fell
135.89 at 9,811.24 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 24.47
at 1,359.15.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite tumbled after the United States and
Britain agreed to share data for a project to decode the human
genetic pattern. The agreement prompted investors to sell shares
of several U.S. biotech companies for profit-taking because these
companies will stop plans to sell genetic data to drugmakers and
researchers following the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Biotech stocks has led the Nasdaq index this year and their
stunning gains left them vulnerable to profit-taking. The Nasdaq
composite rose 24 percent as of last Friday's session this year.
</P>
<P>
The tumbling in tech stocks also dragged the Dow index lower
despite the rise in some of the Dow components. American Express
rose and J.P. Morgan also saored on its report that business has
been robust in the first two months of the year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 6.18 at 588.43 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 3.35 at 1,015.51. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 17.15 at 572.99.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,705 down, 1,298 up and 481
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Main Highway Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A rebel group blocked Tuesday the
highway between Bogota and Medellin, the two main Colombian
cities where traffic was stopped, military authorities announced.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberation Army (ELN) placed across the highway
three trucks, blew up the pedestrians post in the Cocorno district
and planted mines to stop military forces.
</P>
<P>
The army is in control of a great part of the zone and
recommended travelers to keep away from using the blocked highway
made by the ELN that has done it for the second time this month.
</P>
<P>
The head military forces of the center of the country, General
Arcesio Barrero, said Tuesday that the army and police forces will
beat the plan of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
for the next coming Thursday to block the access to the main
cities.
</P>
<P>
The FARC will use the protest call for the working classes,
for a halt of taxi drivers, buses and urban transports.
</P>
<P>
The FARC are the main insurgent Colombian forces, the ELN, the
second and People's Liberation Army (EPL), the third.
</P>
<P>
General Barrero said the army and the police forces adopted a
series of restrictive measures to control the main country's
highways.

<HEADLINE> China to Host Forum on Sino-African Cooperation in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China announced here
Tuesday that it will host the Forum on Sino-African Cooperation in
October in order to boost the cooperation between China and
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese
permanent representative to the United Nations, took the floor at
the meeting of the open-ended Ad Hoc Working Group on the Question
of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has invited the foreign ministers and
trade ministers of African countries to attend the Forum on Sino-
African Cooperation to be held in China this October, which will
enable us to review past experiences, both success and failures,
and work together on the basis of equality to identify specific
ways to enhance Sino-African cooperation in the new situation we
face," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a fresh effort of ours in the new century to
strengthen cooperation with African countries and promote common
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The unremitting efforts by African nations in the past many
years to pull themselves out of difficulty have scored partial
achievements, but on the whole they are lagging farther and
farther behind the development level of the whole world and much
still remained to be done before they are able to gear up with the
situation characterized by economic globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community should also extend a stronger
helping hand to African countries," he said. "To the continent of
Africa, which has a very poor economic basis, a favorable external
economic environment and international cooperation on development
are the overriding priorities."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, efforts must be made in this direction by the
international community so that all can have a share of the big
cake of globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The question of Africa has been a long-standing priority in
the field of development for the United Nations and "there have
been many inter-governmental multilateral or bilateral initiatives
in this regard, but few have been fully implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Under such circumstances, the first things crying out to be
done are the implementation of existing initiatives and the
strengthened monitoring and coordination by the U.N. in this
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We share the view that the international community should
center its work on Africa's development around the eradication of
poverty, the cancellation of debts, financing for development and
the refugee crisis," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The Ad Hoc Working Group was mainly mandated to monitor and
implement recommendations by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in
his report to the General Assembly and the Security Council in
April 1998 as well as the agreed conclusions on development for
Africa reached at the U.N. Economic and Social Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his report, has shed light on the causes of
conflicts and promotion of durable peace and sustainable
development in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Albright Says Essential for Controlling India's Nuclear Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Tuesday that progress on controlling
India's nuclear weapons was essential to building better relations
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We must accept that significant progress in this area is
necessary before India and the United States can realize fully the
vast potential of our relationship," she said in a speech to the
Asia Society.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of President Bill Clinton's visit to South Asia,
Albright made clear that U.S. concern over a potential nuclear
conflict in the region was paramount.
</P>
<P>
"Our approach to nonproliferation is global. We cannot abandon
it simply because we desire an improved relationship," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said India's nuclear tests in 1998 "were a historic
mistake."
</P>
<P>
While India has the right to decide how to take care of its own
security, Albright said, "We do regard proliferation -- anywhere --
as our number one security concern."
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to discuss how to pursue security
requirements without contributing to a costly and destabilizing
arms race," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Washington would persist in trying "to reconcile
to the greatest extent possible our nonproliferation concerns with
India's appreciation of its security requirements." Dialogue
concerning the issues would go on during, and after, Clinton's
visit, she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright will join Clinton in India after attending a two-day
conference on Europe in Venice, Italy. She is not expected to
accompany the president to Pakistan but fly to Geneva after his
India's trip.
</P>
<P>
Albright said Clinton was going to Pakistan because the United
States has important and urgent interest there, especially
controlling the spread of dangerous weapons technology.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Oneworld global airline
alliance Tuesday confirmed that the Calgary-based Canadian
Airlines would withdraw from the group on June 1.
</P>
<P>
The once No. 2 carrier of Canada was taken over in January by
the Montreal-based Air Canada, which is part of the rival Star
alliance.
</P>
<P>
A news release from Calcary quoted American Airlines of
Oneworld as regretting Canadian's departure, saying the global
alliance would "remain focused on providing enhanced benefits and
services" as the world's "premier airline network."
</P>
<P>
The global group, which recently set up a management office in
Vancouver, vowed to continue its 64 daily flights to seven
Canadian cities.
</P>
<P>
Oneworld was created last February with Canadian Airlines as
one of its founding members, along with American Airlines, British
Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways and Qantas.
</P>
<P>
Canadian's withdrawal comes as a result of months of battling
between Oneworld and Star alliance, which is composed of SAS
Airlines, Thai Airlines, Varig, Ansett Australia and Air New
Zealand, in addition to Canada's No. 1 carrier, Air Canada.

MEXICO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Twenty three human skeletons were
found in a well in the northeast of Guatemala, an organization of

The bones have not been identified, but they belong to farmers
assassinated by the army in 1981, the Group of Mutual Support

including 626 made by the army and 32 by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
On December 29 ,1996, the government and the guerrillas signed

Guatemala renewed talks Tuesday to put an end to their land
differences at a meeting of technical nature.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Organization of American States (OAS)
Cesar Gaviria Trujillo attended the meeting as a witness.
</P>
<P>
Reports coming here from Washington said the meeting at the OAS

of its territory even though there's been an accord for over a
century.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Guatemala's delegation complained about the

delegation, as this official was expelled from Guatemala last week
for meddling in this country's internal affairs.

<HEADLINE> Frustrations Common Among North American Online Consumers -- Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 14 (Xinhua) -- While Internet users in the
United States and Canada are rapidly becoming online shoppers,
purchase failures, security fears and service frustrations are
rampant, according to an e-commerce study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The study, which was conducted by U.S. research firm Boston
Consulting Group (BCG), found that more than half of Internet
users have shopped for and 51 percent have purchased, goods or
services online. The typical online purchaser completed 10
transactions and spent 460 U.S. dollars over the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Yet 28 percent of all attempted online purchases failed, and
four out of five consumers who have purchased online experienced
at least one failed purchased attempt over the same period. These
failures resulted from technical problems consumers encountered
with the sites, difficulties in finding products and logistical
and delivery problems after sale.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on research with 12,000 consumers in the U.S.
and Canada conducted during the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
BCG's study identified three waves of online adopters,
distinguished by the length of their time online as well as their
distinctive activities and purchasing patterns.
</P>
<P>
The first wave of online consumers, the pioneers, are the 23.2
million users who have been online for three years or more and now
comprise 29 percent of the online population. The 39.6 million "
early followers" have been online for more than one but less than
three years and represent almost half of the current online
population. The most recent consumers who have made the leap only
in the last year represent 18 million users or 22 percent of the
online population.
</P>
<P>
All three waves of online consumers view the Internet as more
about communication than commerce. Over 80 percent of all Internet
users went online originally for communication purposes, while
only two percent said they were motivated to go online to shop.
</P>
<P>
Among both new and experienced Internet consumers, BCG said,
anxiety over credit card security was the main barrier to
purchasing online. Purchase process breakdowns were also a major
irritant, as well as a deterrent to further online shopping.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain to Share Human Genetic Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a joint statement, Clinton and Blair said the study of the
human genetic blueprint was "one of the most significant
scientific projects of all time" and raw fundamental data on the
human genome should be "made freely available scientists
everywhere."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain would share raw fundamental data on the
human genome, the statement said, urging private companies to
follow the lead of government laboratories. The study could serve
as the foundation for developing new medical cures and preventions.
</P>
<P>
"To realize the full promise of this research, raw fundamental
data on the human genome, including the human DNA sequence and its
variations, should be made freely available to scientists
everywhere," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
"Unencumbered access to this information will promote
discoveries that will reduce the burden of disease, improve health
around the world and enhance the quality of life for all humankind,
" it added.
</P>
<P>
"Intellectual property protection for gene-based inventions
will also play an important role in stimulating the development of
important new health care projects."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Blair welcomed the decision by scientists working
on the human genome project to release raw fundamental information
about the human DNA sequence and its variants rapidly into public
domain.
