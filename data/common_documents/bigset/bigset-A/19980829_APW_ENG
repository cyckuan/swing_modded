	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sloshing through mud, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Saturday inspected areas devastated by flooding, stopping
by a home for the handicapped where five people were killed by a
mudslide.
	   Heavy rains that began earlier in the week continued in Tokyo
and nearby areas in eastern Japan, causing rivers to swell and
flooding thousands of homes.
	   Police said at least 13 people have died and 32 people injured
nationwide, as of early Saturday, in damage caused by the heavy
downpour brought on by Tropical Storm Rex.
	   Search efforts continued Saturday for three people still missing
after a river burst its banks Thursday in Tochigi Prefecture
(state) 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo.
	   Nearly 8,000 homes have been flooded, destroyed or partly
destroyed, police said. Mudslides totaled 575, while 19 bridges
have been swept away, they said.
	   Thousands of people have been evacuated throughout the
disaster-struck regions.
	   Obuchi arrived in the morning in Fukushima Prefecture (state),
175 kilometers (110 miles) north of Tokyo, and was expected to
visit Tochigi in the afternoon.
	   He was shown on nationwide TV news shaking hands with people who
had fled their homes and telling them, ``Keep strong.''
	   The Central Meteorological Agency said Tropical Storm Rex was
expected to hit the eastern coast of Japan over the weekend or
early next week.
	   As of noon Saturday, Rex, packing winds of up to 126 kph (80
mph), was slowly moving northeasterly from out in the Pacific
Ocean, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tokyo, it said.
	   The agency warned of additional mudslides as well as thunder and
lightning, strong winds and hail in affected areas.
	   Ibaraki Prefecture, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, was expected to have 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain
Saturday.
	   The rains have filled roads with mud and smashed rice stalks in
fields. TV news showed people fleeing on boats from homes so buried
in murky water that only rooftops showed.
	   Elsewhere, people waded through kneehigh waters, and in coastal
areas, waves tossed docked boats.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's devastating summer floods have spread to
Tibet, killing at least 53 people, destroying homes, and pushing
the remote region's major rivers to record highs, state media said
Saturday.
	   With more torrential rains forecast, flood fighters were told to
prepare for new flood surges on Tibet's rivers.
	   The Himalayan region's government allocated 1 million yuan (dlrs
120,000) in emergency funds to repair old dikes and dangerous
embankments and pay for flood fighting patrols that were working
round the clock, the China Daily said.
	   Flooding in the last two months has hit 40 of Tibet's more than
70 counties, affecting more than 80,000 people, destroying more
than 2,000 houses, killed more than 4,000 livestock animals and
inundated 13,300 hectares (32,851 acres) of farmland, the newspaper
said. The 53 people killed died in heavy floods and mudslides, it
said.
	   Some 100,000 civilians and soldiers have been fortifying dikes
in the region, plugging breaches and evacuating flood victims, the
newspaper said. Water levels on Tibet's Yarlung Zangbo and Lhasa
rivers have risen to record highs, it said.
	   While water levels on major Tibetan rivers began to fall Friday,
they remained near danger lines and were expected to rise again as
the latest forecast rainstorms bore down.
	   Meanwhile, millions of soldiers and civilians who have been
fighting devastating floods along the Yangtze River in central
China and the Songhua in the northeast were told to remain vigilant
even though water levels were falling, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   Dikes waterlogged and weakened by the floods are more likely to
crumble and collapse when waters were receding, it quoted an
unidentified flood control official as saying.
	   ``This is not the right time to talk about victory,'' the report
said.
	   More than 3,000 people have been killed in this year's summer
flood season, including 1,320 along the Yangtze that has seen its
heaviest flooding in 44 years.
	   The Education Ministry announced that a fund was being
established to rebuild schools, more than 44,000 of which have been
damaged in the floods, the China Daily said.
	   The government also will offer subsidized travel fares to
hard-up college students from flood-hit areas and waive or reduce
their tuition and accommodation fees, it said.

Air Force pilots injured in crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine Air Force plane has
crashed into a forest in the southern Philippines, and two pilots
were injured, an Air Force spokesman said Saturday.
	   The twin-propeller OV-10 aircraft was on a maintenance flight
Friday morning when it lost contact with the control tower at the
Davao City airport and was declared missing, Col. Jose Mendoza
said.
	   Villagers found the crash site and rescued the pilots in a
forest near Manay town in Davao Oriental province, about 630 miles
(1,000 kilometers) southeast of Manila.
	   Mendoza quoted a local village leader as saying the two pilots
were safe but did not disclose the condition of the aircraft.

Mexican guerrillas suspected in ambush that killed to policemen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) _ Leftist guerrillas ambushed a group of
policemen Friday in the western state of Guerrerro, killing two and
seriously injuring seven, the local mayor said.
	   Javier Poblete Ramirez, mayor of the municipality of Tecoanapa,
said 10 policemen were on patrol when the guerrillas shot out their
tires, then fired at the police. Only one officer was uninjured.
	   The police chief, Carmen Nava Carranza, and Deputy Commander
Raul Dieguez Teresa were killed.
	   Poblete said the attack was likely committed by guerrillas from
the Revolutionary Army of the Insurgent People, a recent offshoot
of the Popular Revolutionary Army, which first appeared in 1996.
	   He said the attack could have been revenge for a June 7 shootout
in the village of Ayutla, 35 miles (55 kilometers) from Tecoanapa,
in which 11 members of the new group were killed.

Northwest pilots go on strike

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Northwest Airlines' pilots have gone on strike,
threatening to plunge air travel into chaos across the middle of
the country.
	   The pilots' union rejected a last-minute proposal that was
rushed to the union's executive council about 2 1/2 hours before
the strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT) Saturday.
	   ``With no agreement in place, I have instructed our strike
committee to tell our pilots to withdraw all services
immediately,'' Steve Zoller, head of the council, told reporters
shortly before midnight.
	   President Bill Clinton said he would not intervene as he did
last year when the pilots at American Airlines went on strike.
	   Northwest, the nation's sixth largest passenger airline,
controls 75 percent to 82 percent of the airline seats into
Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis, Tennessee.
	   Union spokesman Paul Omodt had said earlier that tentative
agreements had been reached on most contract issues, but not on two
of the most contentious points: job security and compensation.
	   Northwest pilots say they earn an average salary of about dlrs
120,000 per year. The airline says the average salary is dlrs
133,000. There are 6,100 unionized pilots at the airline.
	   The airline held a news conference prior to the strike
announcement and said it had proposed a ``fair offer.''
	   The pilots have been seeking a 15 percent raise over five years
dating to Oct. 31, 1996, when their contract expired. Airline
spokesman Jon Austin said the offer on the table would give
Northwest pilots pay rates 4.5 percent higher than average rate
earned by pilots at American, United and Delta by the year 2000,
and 7 percent higher by end of contract in 2002.
	   Northwest also was offering lump sum payment to pilots of 3.5
percent of annual pay, totaling dlrs 57 million. Pilots had been
seeking a stock and cash package that would be worth a total of
dlrs 152.5 million.
	   Because Northwest announced earlier in the week it was canceling
400 flights on Friday and Saturday, its hub airports in
Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis were calm. The airline controls 75
percent to 82 percent of the plane seats into those cities.
	   About 40 Northwest planes are scheduled to be in the air at the
time of the strike deadline. Austin said those flights would not be
canceled ahead of the strike deadline and would continue to their
final destination.
	   In Detroit, the normally jammed parking decks around the airport
were mostly empty and there was little of the usual crowding around
the gates, ticket counters and baggage carousels.
	   But that could be the calm before the storm.
	   Authorities at the Memphis airport had stockpiled 2,000
inflatable beds, 2,000 blankets and 2,000 pillows for waylaid
travelers. They also set aside cases of baby diapers and formula.
Northwest Airlines, meanwhile, reserved as many rooms as possible
in hotels near the airport.
	   ``The majority of the airport hotels are booked. We're holding
those spaces open for stranded passengers,'' said Suzanne Boda,
director of customer services for Northwest in Memphis.
	   Clinton spokesman Mike McCurry said: ``At this time, the
president has decided not to exercise his authority to intervene
and he urges the parties to stay at the table, work hard and
resolve their differences.''

Fired from the military, Suharto son-in-law goes on pilgrimage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A relative of former President Suharto
suspected of abducting political activists has left Indonesia on a
Muslim pilgrimage, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Former Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, who was dismissed from the
military Monday after an investigation of the kidnappings, traveled
to Mecca, the Islamic holy site in Saudi Arabia, The Indonesian
Observer reported.
	   ``He's a civilian, he has a valid passport, and he's free to
travel,'' the Observer quoted army spokesman Lt. Col. Saragih as
saying.
	   Investigators have not ruled out legal action against Prabowo,
who told them he kidnapped nine activists while the autocratic
Suharto was still in power.
	   Prabowo is the son-in-law of Suharto, who quit in May following
riots and student protests against his 32-year rule. Suharto's
successor. B.J. Habibie, has pledged democratic reforms.
	   More evidence against Prabowo could emerge when 11 members of
Indonesia's special forces who have been implicated in the
abductions go on trial in a military court. Prabowo, once a
fast-rising star in the military, was head of the special forces at
the time.
	   Prabowo met his wife, Siti Hediati Prabowo, in Singapore earlier
this week before flying to Mecca for an ``Umroh,'' a minor form of
the Haj, the annual Muslim pilgrimage.
	   Saragih said there was no need to restrict Prabowo's movements,
for now.
	   ``If at any time we need to do so, we can slap a travel ban on
Prabowo,'' he said.
	   Fourteen activists who were believed kidnapped remain missing
and are feared dead. Those that were released testified that they
were tortured and interrogated about their anti-government
activities.

Indonesia needs security for growth, ambassador says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The people of Indonesia must stop
``bashing one another, forget about their political squabbles'' and
seek national reconciliation and rehabilitation, the Indonesian
ambassador to Australia said Saturday.
	   Sastrohandoyo Wiryono said foreign investors would not risk
their capital in Indonesia if the country had not achieved
political and social stability.
	   ``Capital is not known for its courage, in fact money is the
worst coward _ at the first sign of trouble, it will run away so we
must create political stability,'' Wiryono said.
	   ``We have to put our house in order, otherwise we will keep
bashing each other and we'll only see danger and money hates
danger.''
	   He told a one-day Indonesia in Post-Suharto Era conference at
the University of Melbourne that Indonesia faces a difficult
struggle between demands for economic security and growing
expectations of democratic reform.
	   ``We may lose hope and that's a danger,'' he said.
	   The difficulty of managing democratic reforms was evident in the
emergence of more than 74 political parties, including a party for
taxi drivers, in the run-up to next May's general election.
	   Wiryono said disillusionment with President B.J. Habibie, who
came to power after the May riots, was apparent because of his
close association with former President Suharto.
	   But there were enough ``concrete'' signs of change to have hope
that Indonesia could rise about its troubles, he said.

Northern India gripped by cooking oil poisonings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Contaminated cooking oil sent residents
of northern India into a panic Saturday after authorities reported
that adulterated mustard oil has killed at least two dozen people
and hospitalized 500 others.
	   Several state governments have banned the sale of mustard oil,
which is widely used for cooking in northern India, after virtually
all brands sold in New Delhi were found contaminated with the seeds
of prickly poppy.
	   Saturday's newspapers reported that some types of other
vegetable oils also have been contaminated _ either accidentally or
deliberately. Many people have been left wondering if any oil is
safe to use.
	   Most restaurants reported a sharp drop in business following the
scare.
	   A court in the capital banned the sale of mustard oil on
Wednesday after many people complained of vomiting, swollen limbs
and breathing problems after consuming the oil. Doctors said the
illnesses were caused by a toxic chemical, sanguinarine, that was
present in the oil.
	   Samples tested in government laboratories found it contained the
seeds of a weed, Argemone mexicana, which often grows in mustard
fields.
	   Police have arrested two factory owners on charges of
adulterating oil.
	   Despite the deaths, the government found it difficult to set up
enough testing facilities or prevent traders from smuggling oil to
states where its sale has not been banned.
	   The government ordered highway police to step up checks on
highways following reports that some trucks were transporting
potentially contaminated oil, but marked as milk trucks.

 &UR; Cubs 10, Rockies 5 &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hit his 53rd homer and Jose Hernandez
and pitcher Steve Trachsel also homered as Chicago beat Colorado.
	   Sosa got the Cubs started in the first with a 414-foot
(125-meter) shot to right-center, leaving him one behind St. Louis'
Mark McGwire in the pursuit of Roger Maris' single-season record of
61.
	   In four subsequent at-bats, Sosa grounded into a double play,
struck out, flied out and was intentionally walked.
	   Hernandez broke a 4-4 tie with a three-run homer in the sixth
off John Thomson (8-9). Trachsel (14-7) had the second homer of his
major league career, a two-run blast in the fifth.
	   Larry Walker homered for Colorado.
 &UR; Cardinals 5, Braves 4, 10 innings &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Ron Gant's bases-loaded RBI single in the 10th off
Dennis Martinez (3-5) ended St. Louis' six-game losing streak.
	   Mark McGwire had his home run lead shaved to one when Chicago's
Sammy Sosa connected for No. 53 at Colorado, but did gain ground on
Babe Ruth's walk record with two full-count free passes off Greg
Maddux.
	   McGwire, who also doubled in the third and struck out in the
eighth and 10th, has 140 walks in 135 games. Ruth had 170 in 1923.
	   St. Louis' Fernando Tatis tied it at 4 in the ninth with his
fifth homer. Juan Acevedo (7-3) pitched two scoreless innings for
the Cardinals.

Torrential rain pours for three hours but in only one half of city
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Torrential rains fell on one half of the Far East
city of Nakhodka for three hours, while the other half received not
even a drop, the ITAR-Tass news agency said Saturday.
	   The rain destroyed 46,000 square meters (55,000 square yards) of
roads, damaged and flooded many homes and caused landslides that
buried many cars on Friday, the news agency said.
	   Nakhodka Mayor Viktor Gnezdilov estimated the storm caused 30
million rubles (about dlrs 3.8 million) in damage. He said the
rainfall was the equivalent of what the city normally gets in two
months.

Indonesian president again distances himself from old mentor,
</HEADLINE>
Suharto &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Facing criticism that he is too
closely identified with Indonesia's old government, President B.J.
Habibie said he is not a ``photocopy'' of his autocratic
predecessor, Suharto.
	   In a meeting Friday with Indonesian media chiefs, Habibie said
his government was implementing democratic reforms and had
apologized for human rights abuses committed under Suharto.
	   Habibie, who became president after economic and political
turmoil dislodged Suharto in May, rejected allegations that he is a
shadow of his old mentor.
	   ``I am not a photocopy of the previous president. ... That's
nonsense,'' The Jakarta Post quoted Habibie as saying.
	   A childhood friend of Suharto, Habibie served as research and
technology minister before his appointment as vice president
earlier this year.
	   Since becoming president, Habibie has dismantled many features
of Suharto's rigid style of rule, freeing some political prisoners,
legalizing political parties and scheduling general elections next
year.
	   He is also implementing economic reforms designed to haul
Indonesia out of a financial crisis that is expected to shrink the
economy by as much as 15 percent this year.
	   Critics complain that Habibie is not moving fast enough on
reform.
	   In the meeting, Habibie suggested that demands that officials
from the old government be held accountable for wrongdoing could
divide the fragile country.
	   He said more important tasks such as reviving the economy should
get priority.
	   ``Is it proper for us to confuse the people?'' the official
Antara news agency quoted him as saying. ``Let us forget the
past.''

Chipmunks roam free on flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials are investigating how four chipmunks
evaded security checks and got aboard a flight to London, an
airport spokeswoman said Saturday.
	   The latest bungle at the new dlr-20 billion airport raised
questions about its security system.
	   Two Frenchmen smuggled four chipmunks on board a British Airways
flight from Hong Kong to London Wednesday, the South China Morning
Post reported Saturday.
	   One of the creatures broke free and roamed through the crowded
economy class cabin just before the 14-hour flight landed, the Post
said. One woman was scratched, it said.
	   The paper quoted veterinarians as saying that chipmunks could
chew through aircraft wiring and bring rabies into Britain.
	   The two Frenchmen were questioned in London and allowed to
continue to Paris, and the chipmunks were held in quarantine, the
report said.
	   Esther Wong, a spokeswoman for Hong Kong's Airport Authority,
said the chipmunks were probably stowed in the passengers' pockets
or hand luggage, but the X-ray security system could not detect
live animals.
	   ``The system only screens guns or weapons, but this is a piece
of flesh,'' Wong said.
	   Wong said the passengers should have reported the animals to the
airline, and it's up to airline to decide how to handle them.
	   British Airways officials in Hong Kong could not be reached
Saturday.
	   The Post claimed in a recent report its reporters strolled
freely in restricted area in the cargo terminal, even though they
didn't have the required permits.
	   Last month, the Dutch airline KLM said one of its planes bound
for Amsterdam violated safety rules by taking off with the bags of
two passengers who weren't aboard.
	   Passenger and cargo services have improved markedly since the
airport opened early July.

Myanmar general says people want peace, not disruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A senior member of the military regime
has said that most people want peace and, fearing violence, have
not rallied behind the opposition led by Nobel laureate Aung San
Suu Kyi, official newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the top four generals of the ruling
junta, again warned that the government would not tolerate
opposition calls for a civilian parliament to convene.
	   ``It is obvious that, apart from the handful of destructive
instigators, the majority of the public want to live in peace and
are scared of the occurrence of any disturbances,'' Khin Nyunt said
in a monthly speech at a refresher course for teachers.
	   ``The obstructionists, with evil intentions, are trying to
disrupt stability and derail the government's development
activities with the aim of gaining popularity and grabbing state
power,'' Khin Nyunt said.
	   A month-long campaign by anti-government groups inside and
outside Myanmar, also known as Burma, marking the 10th anniversary
of a nationwide uprising has failed to ignite popular protests and
the country has remained calm.
	   The uprising in 1988 was crushed by troops, leaving an estimated
3,000 people dead, and fear still runs deep.
	   A protest Monday by 200 university students _ the first in
nearly two years _ has not been repeated. Police have been posted
throughout the city to stop any hit-and-run demonstration from
occurring.
	   The All Burma Students Democratic Front, a Thailand-based exile
group, claimed Friday that some students trying to organize
protests have been arrested. No details were released.
	   Suu Kyi, whose political activities are extremely restricted,
ended a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities Monday, one of
the few forms of protest open to her. She was stopped outside
Yangon while trying to travel to visit provincial supporters.
	   Her party, the National League for Democracy, has demanded that
the government finally convene a parliament elected in 1990. The
NLD overwhelmingly won the election, but the military, which has
ruled Myanmar since 1962, refused to relinquish power.
	   The issue is extremely touchy for the ruling State Peace and
Development Council, which has insisted that a new constitution be
drafted before a civilian parliament can be called.
	   The NLD walked out of the drafting committee in 1995, claiming
it was stacked in favor of military rule. The panel has not met in
two years.
	   But the government warned the NLD this week that attempts to
undermine a new constitution could result in long prison terms and
the party being declared illegal.
	   The government has held rare, recent talks with NLD officials _
though not with Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize _ and
portrays them as confidence-building measures.
	   The U.S. Embassy has said that it doubts the government is
sincere about beginning a meaningful dialogue, partly because the
leaders refuse to meet Suu Kyi, recognized inside and outside the
country as the leader of the pro-democracy movement.
	   Khin Nyunt said that the ``flexibility and constructive approach
in order to maintain peace and stability is misinterpreted by
anti-government groups that the government has given in to
international pressure.''
	   The generals, who insist that Myanmar is not like other
countries, have resisted years of cajoling, criticism and even
economic sanctions from foreign countries to open negotiations with
the NLD.

Thailand's anti-corruption panel asked to probe Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's anti-corruption body has
been asked to probe alleged irregularities over the construction of
a sports complex for the upcoming Asian Games, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
	   The Bangkok Post reported that the Counter-Corruption
Commission, an agency that reports directly to Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai, has been urged to investigate alleged corruption involving
the sports complex at Bangkok's Thammasat University.
	   A spokesman for the commission could not immediately confirm the
report.
	   According to the Post, Kaewsan Atipo, university vice rector in
charge of the project, has asked for the investigation to clear his
name after numerous leaflets and unsigned letters were distributed
on campus alleging irregularities.
	   Corruption allegations came in the wake of a report by the House
of Representatives' Committee on Sports Affairs, which accused the
contractors of using substandard materials in the construction of
the sports complex.
	   The report also pointed to the cracks in concrete embankments at
the spectator's stand, the Bangkok Post said.
	   The Asian Games are the continent's premier Olympic-style event
and will held Dec. 6-20 in Bangkok. More than 10,000 athletes from
43 countries are expected to attend.
	   The Thai government and corporate sponsors have faced
difficulties organizing the games because of the Asian economic
crisis.

Report: Indonesian fact-finding team finds no proof of rapes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A government fact-finding team has not
found any proof that ethnic Chinese women were raped during riots
in May that led to the ouster of President Suharto, the official
Antara news agency reported Saturday.
	   Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiah, one of the leaders of
the investigation, echoed military chiefs who said earlier this
week that they had failed to find evidence of mass rapes.
	   ``The team has been conducting an investigation for one and a
half months now but has found no woman who fell victim to gang rape
or who claimed to have been raped during the May riots,'' Antara
quoted Alawiah as saying.
	   However, the minister said there were cases of sexual harassment
during the unrest in Jakarta, which claimed 1,200 lives and left
thousands of cars and buildings damaged or gutted by fire.
	   Rioters targeted property of the ethnic Chinese minority, which
has become a scapegoat for Indonesia's economic ills because it
dominates commerce in the nation of 202 million.
	   Reports by women's groups that at least 168 Chinese women and
girls were raped during the riots angered many ethnic Chinese
abroad. Protests against the Indonesian government have been staged
in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States and elsewhere.
	   President B.J. Habibie has apologized for the rapes, but
military chief Gen. Wiranto and other officials say investigators
have found no evidence that they happened.
	   Alawiah said hospital records checked by the fact-finding team
did not list any rape victims. And investigators were unable to
find two alleged rape victims reported to have been flown to a
hospital in Singapore, Antara quoted her as saying.

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to ADD that deaths in Tibet were for since mid-June,
other details, UPDATES with dikes blown in northeast in graf 12

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ With torrential rains forecast, flood fighters in
Tibet are bracing for further inundations, prolonging a season of
deadly summer flooding in the remote Himalayan region, state media
reported Saturday.
	   As in other parts of China hit by devastating floods, Tibet has
mobilized soldiers and civilians to build up dikes as water levels
on its major rivers hit record levels over the past two months, the
China Daily said.
	   At least 53 people have been killed in heavy floods and
mudslides in the region since mid-June, the newspaper said.
Nationwide, flooding has killed more than 3,000 people, including
1,320 along the Yangtze, China's longest river that has seen its
heaviest flooding in 44 years.
	   Two months of floods have hit 40 of Tibet's more than 70
counties, affecting more than 80,000 people, destroying more than
2,000 houses, killing more than 4,000 livestock animals and
inundating 13,300 hectares (32,851 acres) of farmland, the China
Daily said.
	   Persistent rains since mid-August have raised river levels, and
meteorologists forecast more torrential rains soon, it said.
	   With a new flood surge expected to arrive before Sept. 10, the
region's government allocated 1 million yuan (dlrs 120,000) in
emergency funds to repair old dikes and dangerous embankments and
pay for flood fighting patrols that were working round the clock,
it said.
	   Some 100,000 civilians and soldiers have been fortifying dikes
in the region over the summer, plugging breaches and evacuating
flood victims, the newspaper said. Water levels on Tibet's Yarlung
Zangbo and Lhasa rivers rose to record highs, it said.
	   While water levels on major Tibetan rivers began to fall Friday,
they remained near danger lines and were expected to rise again as
the latest forecast rainstorms bore down, it said. Flood fighters
across the region were warned to remain alert, it said.
	   Meanwhile, millions of soldiers and civilians who have been
fighting devastating floods along the Yangtze River in central
China and the Songhua in the northeast were told to remain vigilant
even though water levels were falling, the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   Dikes waterlogged and weakened by the floods are more likely to
crumble and collapse when waters were receding, it quoted an
unidentified flood control official as saying.
	   ``This is not the right time to talk about victory,'' the report
said.
	   In Daqing in the northeast, where China's largest oil field is
located, soldiers used three tons of explosives to blow open dikes
to channel trapped flood waters back into the Songhua River, the
Beijing Youth Daily said.
	   The Education Ministry announced that a fund was being
established to rebuild schools, more than 44,000 of which have been
damaged in the floods, the China Daily said.
	   The government also will offer subsidized travel fares to
hard-up college students from flood-hit areas and waive or reduce
their tuition and accommodation fees, it said.

Crisis teaches young Russians to see both sides of capitalism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Russia-Economy &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five years ago, college students like Vladimir
Sinitsa and Maxim Tarasenko had little interest in Russia's
economic problems. Now they're all ears.
	   ``I'm an optimist,'' Tarasenko, a 23-year-old political economy
major at Moscow State University, says over coffee and cigarettes.
``But we never thought we'd find ourselves in economic crisis.''
	   The last time Russia's economy collapsed, Tarasenko was only 11
years old and he doesn't remember much. So now, accustomed to the
feverish optimism of the early years of Russian capitalism, he and
many other young Russians are getting a wakeup call as the downside
of reform hits them for the first time.
	   And ironically, the financial collapse has caught some repeating
the mistakes of their elders, like putting faith in Russia's shaky
banking system.
	   ``I had a bit of money, and I put half of it in one bank, and
half in another,'' said Sinitsa, a 20-year-old who just got a
degree in finance at the country's premier business school, the
Plekhanov Economic Academy.
	   ``Now I go every day and wait in the lines so I can change my
rubles for dollars,'' he said, echoing a lament commonly heard from
his elders.
	   Perhaps because of the instability, commonly voiced goals
haven't changed: find a secure, well-paying job, hopefully with a
Western company that pays in dollars.
	   For Sinitsa, though, it may take time. Companies are firing
workers and jobs are scarce.
	   ``I've still got hope, but not for the next six months,'' he
said.
	   One thing they've all grown up with _ and that the collapse
confirms _ is deep mistrust of the government. They say they won't
trust their future to Boris Yeltsin or anyone else in the
government.
	   ``Our government is a boat that's covered with rust,'' Tarasenko
said. ``We have to take a knife and scrape it off.''
	   In fact, they express a view at odds with what many consider
youth's natural affinity for freedom: The government should move
away from Russia's freewheeling democracy toward stricter rule.
	   Tarasenko supports Alexander Lebed _ a potential presidential
candidate in 2000 elections who appeals to many older Russians sick
of the country's roller coaster economy and drawn by his promises
to impose law and order.
	   ``Our democracy is a joke anyway,'' Tarasenko said. ``I think
it's important to have someone in power like Lebed, who will do
what he wants with criminals.''
	   Still, growing up in times that saw an influx of foreign goods
and a rise in expectations for the future leaves many students
unwilling to change their visions of the future, which often
include founding a business or working in finance.
	   ``The people's mentality has already changed,'' said Alexander
Ratushin, a 19-year-old international economics major. ``They've
felt the taste of freedom and they won't give it up.''
	   ``The most important thing for me right now is to get a strong
education,'' Ratushin said. ``After all, we're the ones who are
going to have to resurrect Russia.''

U.N. Security Council quiet while conflicts rage on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council did something
this week it hasn't done for a long time.
	   By voting to suspend sanctions on Libya when it turns over two
suspects in the Pan Am bombing _ and threatening more if it doesn't
_ the council sent a strong, united message that a U.N. member
state must comply with the will of the international community.
	   You might have thought the council's 15 ambassadors had
forgotten how to do it.
	   On Iraq, Kosovo, even on the pan-African war in Congo, the
Security Council has been quiet. A few statements expressing
concern and urging restraint have been the norm for the organ that
considers itself responsible for maintaining peace and security in
the world.
	   Rather than making and enforcing tough decisions on
international conflicts, the council has delegated responsibility
to regional organizations, individual countries, and most recently,
the U.N. chief himself.
	   What's the result of this inaction? One prediction came in a
stinging letter of resignation Wednesday from an American member of
the U.N. Special Commission, which inspects Iraq for weapons of
mass destruction.
	   Scott Ritter warned that the council's failure to strongly
punish Iraq for freezing cooperation with inspectors and
essentially paralyzing their work would end with Iraq keeping its
banned weapons.
	   Diplomats say that after eight years of sanctions, neither the
United States nor Britain _ the nations that have taken the
toughest stance against Iraq _ can muster the support at home or in
the council for a strong action if a confrontation with Baghdad
arises.
	   On Friday, Britain began circulating a resolution that would
suspend regular looks at possibly removing sanctions until Iraq
lets inspectors do their jobs. The move marks the toughest council
action yet on the impasse but is still a far cry from the threat of
``severest consequences'' the council leveled in February.
	   To date, the council has only said Baghdad's Aug. 5 decision was
``totally unacceptable,'' and urged inspectors to try to go about
their work.
	   The council has also shown its unwillingness to get involved in
Kosovo, deferring to NATO, the Contact Group of states and U.S.
envoys to try to persuade the Serbs and ethnic Albanians fighting
for independence to come together for talks.
	   Meanwhile, shells fall on Kosovo and tens of thousands of people
have been routed from their homes.
	   ``What I think the council lacks sometimes is a strategy,''
conceded Brazil's ambassador, Celso L.N. Amorim. ``On Kosovo, we
have no strategy.''
	   This week, the council managed to issue a statement by its
president urging a cease-fire and expressing its concern for the
Kosovo refugees' plight.
	   China's traditional opposition to intervention in internal
matters seems again to have stymied the willingness of European
countries to get involved in a problem in their own backyard,
diplomats say.
	   On Congo, the council seems simply burned out after dealing with
a second civil war there in a year, diplomats say. Members are also
unwilling to get involved in what has become a regional conflict _
preferring regional efforts to end it, they said.
	   Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia have acknowledged supporting
Congolese President Laurent Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda are
accused of backing the rebels who want to oust him. Rwanda and
Uganda deny the charge.
	   The council has expressed its support for the Southern African
Development Community, which is leading negotiations to put an end
to the civil war. Those talks, though, have been put off until the
upcoming Non-Aligned Movement summit in South Africa.
	   And so with this backdrop, it was a surprise that the council
came together on a muggy Thursday night to agree unanimously to
suspend sanctions against Libya once two suspects in the 1988
bombing of a Pan Am jetliner are turned over for trial.
	   The council president, Danilo Turk of Slovenia, noted the
occasion.
	   ``The council should be able to act with the same wisdom
whenever required,'' he said.

Villagers flee fighting between soldiers, Muslim extremists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Hundreds of villagers have fled
their homes on a southern Philippine island fearing clashes between
a Muslim extremist group and the military, officials said Saturday.
	   At least five members of the extremist Abu Sayyaf group have
been killed in sporadic clashes since Thursday on Panigayan, an
island of Basilan province, the military said.
	   In the latest military campaign against the Abu Sayyaf, soldiers
were deployed to stop the group's extortion activities in Basilan,
about 880 kilometers (550 miles) south of Manila.
	   Haber Glang, spokesman of Basilan Gov. Wahab Akbar, said at
least 1,000 villagers from Panigayan have evacuated to government
shelters, mostly school houses, in the provincial capital of
Isabela.
	   Glang said the villagers feared between caught in the crossfire
of a full-blown battle between the military and the Abu Sayyaf, the
smaller and more militant of the two Muslim rebel groups fighting
for self-rule in the southern Philippines.
	   The Abu Sayyaf has been blamed for numerous violent attacks,
including ransom kidnappings of foreign Christian missionaries, on
remote southern islands.
	   Its attack on the town of Ipil in Zamboanga del Sur province in
April 1995 left 53 people dead.
	   The military and police believe the group has received financial
support from Mohammad Jamal Khalifa, said to be a brother-in-law of
Omar bin Laden, whom the United States has blamed for the bombings
at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
	   The group is also linked to Ramzi Yousef, the convicted
mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing in New York in 1993.

Tornado injures 50 in flooded Bangladesh

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ A tornado ripped through several
villages in eastern Bangladesh, injuring at least 50 people and
leveling hundreds of mud-and-thatch huts already weakened by flood
waters, police said Saturday.
	   The 20-minute tornado on Friday compounded the miseries of the
flood-affected people in Comilla district, 95 miles (150
kilometers) east of the capital Dhaka.
	   Five people were hospitalized in critical condition, police
said.
	   Meanwhile, the death toll from nearly two months of flooding
rose to 615 as more deaths were reported. Eight people died on
Thursday and Friday after they came in contact with submerged
electrical wires in Dhaka and the neighboring Munshiganj district,
police said.
	   Another five people drowned in Manikganj district near Dhaka and
two deaths were reported from diarrhea in neighboring Tangail
district Friday.
	   Upstream rivers in India swollen by incessant rain in the
Himalayas worsened the situation in Bangladesh.
	   The floods were more serious than those in 1988, considered the
worst in memory. This time, more than two-thirds of the country has
been under water for nearly two months.
	   At least 46 of the country's 64 districts are bearing the brunt
of the deluge, which has marooned 25 million people, destroyed
thousands of houses and damaged roads, bridges and embankments.
	   ``We are witnessing the most lingering floods of the century,''
said A.K.M. Shamsul Islam, an official at Dhaka's Meteorological
Department. ``Never before in the history of Bangladesh have floods
lingered for two months,'' he said.
	   Floods waters were slow to recede into the Bay of Bengal because
the sea has a high tide four feet above normal, Islam said. The
unusual high tide is blamed on a depression that is whipping up
high waves. Weather experts see no respite until the middle of next
month.
	   Fearful of an economic disaster the government this week
appealed for more than dlrs 600 million in foreign aid.
	   The U.S. has agreed to provide 260,000 tons of wheat in
immediate flood relief. European countries have also promised to
help Bangladesh buy food and medicines.

Honda to make, sell big sports utility in North America: Report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Honda Motor Co. will begin manufacturing in Canada
in the year 2000 a new large sports utility vehicle for the North
American market, Japan's leading business daily reported Saturday.
	   Honda officials did not answer calls to their office Saturday.
	   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun said the vehicle will share a common
platform and engine with Honda's Odyssey minivan, which the
automaker will also produce at a Canadian plant starting next
month.
	   Honda hopes to cut costs by producing both the Odyssey and the
new sports utility vehicle in the same plant, the Nikkei said.
	   Up to now, Honda has exported only the CR-V, a smaller sport
utility vehicle, to North America.
	   By debuting a larger sport utility, that will be built in North
America for that market, Honda is showing it is seriously set on
competing against U.S. automakers in that sector, the Nikkei said.
	   Honda hopes to double the production of the Odyssey minivans in
Canada to 120,000 next year, the report said. Honda plans to
produce 30,000 sports utility vehicles there a year.

Yeltsin says he will not step down, opposition on retreat

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's opponents appeared
Saturday to be backing off their demands for an immediate
power-sharing agreement after he vowed unequivocally that he would
not resign.
	   ``I want to say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to
resign. I will work as I'm supposed to for my constitutional
term,'' Yeltsin said Friday night in an interview on national
television.
	   ``In 2000, there will be an election for a new president and I
will not run.''
	   Yeltsin's emphatic denial came after days of feverish
speculation that he was about to resign or be ousted as his country
plunged into a seemingly bottomless economic decline. He had not
been seen in public since Tuesday, prompting reports that he had
already stepped down.
	   Hours after Yeltsin's statement, his Communist-led foes in
parliament signaled they were prepared to water down their demand
for a power-sharing agreement that would sharply limit the
president's powers.
	   In talks with the government late Friday, the opposition
continued to insist on amendments to the constitution that would
give parliament more say over Cabinet appointments and government
policies, Russian media reported.
	   But they appeared to back off their demand that these changes be
implemented immediately as a condition for confirming acting Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
	   They agreed for now to only urge the president to consult them,
said Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the State Duma.
	   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is scheduled to meet
Monday to consider Chernomyrdin's appointment.
	   Under the Russian constitution, the Duma must approve the prime
minister. If it rejects a candidate three times, Yeltsin can
dissolve the Duma and call parliamentary elections _ an option
Yeltsin said Friday he had no plans to take.
	   Looking calm and speaking easily, Yeltsin said on national
television that he was working to restore stability and he believed
things could be fixed. He acknowledged the crisis, especially the
devaluation of the ruble, would mean more hard times for his people
after years of privation.
	   ``It would be naive to say that we'll take some steps and people
won't suffer,'' he said. ``However as president, I must say that
we'll take every measure to ensure that people don't lose their
savings. I cannot promise that prices won't go up, but as president
I am obligated to do everything to keep it to a minimum.''
	   Russians, who have weathered one crisis after another in recent
years, were taking the latest one in stride, too. Short lines
formed outside some banks as people tried to change rubles for
dollars, but there was little sign of panic.
	   All currency trades were suspended for a third day Friday.
Russian stocks actually rose by 5.7 percent, but trading was very
light and dealers warned that the rise did not signal a market
recovery.
	   The financial crisis began in early summer as tremors from
Asia's economic turmoil reached Moscow and a decline in oil prices
_ Russia's top export _ derailed vital reforms and sent the economy
crashing.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced
leader to replace the youthful Sergei Kiriyenko and contain the
crisis.
	   In a concession to hard-liners, Yeltsin fired prominent
reformers Boris Nemtsov and Anatoly Chubais _ the latter for the
third time. Both men are hated by the opposition for being the
chief proponents of reform.
	   And, Chernomyrdin agreed to opposition demands for some
Soviet-style measures to boost state control of the economy as part
of efforts to stabilize the economy, according to some Russian
media. Measures included price and currency controls and printing
money to reflate the economy, they said.

Financial secretary: Government to continue buying spree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped word `to' in quote in 4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The government will continue its two-week stock
buying spree to drive off speculators and protect the Hong Kong
dollar's currency link to the U.S. currency, the financial
secretary said Saturday.
	   In an address on state-owned Radio Hong Kong, Donald Tsang said
government intervention was necessary to drive off speculators,
whom he said have been manipulating the markets and attacking the
currency peg.
	   But the government would stop once speculators are driven off,
he said.
	   ``My colleagues and I have been criticized for ruining the free
market economy,'' he said. ``But do we want to see ... the free
market being manipulated? Do we want Hong Kong to become an
automatic teller machine for international speculators?''
	   Tsang said speculators are still in the market, and could push
the index to below 4,000 points. ``The market cannot operate
normally as long as it is being manipulated.''
	   The government has been scooping up shares recently, trying to
push the stock index up so that speculators who bet the market
would go down could not profit.
	   Tsang had refused to say how much the government has spent, but
analysts estimated it could be up to 100 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 12.8 billion), or about 13 percent of its massive
reserves.
	   On Friday, aggressive government buying pushed trading volume to
a record 79 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion).
Analysts estimate the government spent 71 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 9.1 billion) _ about 12,000 Hong Kong dollars (dlrs
1,538) for each of Hong Kong's 6.6 million people.
	   Still, the stock market closed 1.2 percent lower at 7,829.74
points, but 1,200 points higher than two weeks ago.
	   The government announced after trading was closed Friday that
gross domestic product shrank 5 percent in the second quarter,
officially declaring that Hong Kong had slipped into the first
recession in 13 years.
	   Analysts say investors, having already prepared for the worst,
would unlikely be further deterred by the grim economic data.
	   What follows will likely be a bloody battle with no end, and the
government will be unable to unload the shares it owns without
bringing a market collapse and invite more speculative attacks,
analysts say.
	   ``The government is being dragged into something like the
Vietnam War. It's an endless commitment,'' the South China Morning
Post quoted Democratic Party legislator Albert Ho as saying.
	   In a separate interview on Radio Hong Kong, Tsang said the
government would unload shares ``in a very orderly manner over a
long period of time.''
	   He reiterated the government will not unpeg the currency.
	   ``Has any Southeast Asian country been able to solve its
problems through currency devaluation?'' he said. ``If we give up
the peg now, it will definitely trigger another round of currency
devaluations,'' in Asia.
	   Officials say they will table legislation to tighten operations
of the financial markets to make it harder for speculators to
profit and attack the currency link.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake shook Tokyo and its
surrounding areas Saturday morning, slightly injuring two but
causing no major damage.
	   The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4 was centered in
the Tokyo Bay about 70 kilometers (40 miles) deep underground, the
Central Meteorological Agency said.
	   The earthquake, which rattled shelves and windows for several
seconds, struck at 8:46 a.m. (2346 GMT Friday).
	   A 54-year-old woman sprained a leg muscle after falling down in
Tokyo, and a 34-year-old woman twisted her leg in Yokohama, just
south of Tokyo, fire department officials said.
	   The agency said there were no dangers of tsunami, or undersea
waves set off by volcanic activity or earthquakes.
	   The quake shook Tokyo and nearby prefectures, including Chiba,
Tochigi, Kanagawa and Saitama, the agency said.
	   Japanese media reports said bullet trains in areas near Tokyo
temporarily stopped running as a precaution but restarted in less
than a half-hour.
	   Temblors of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage, if it
strikes a residential area.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Cho In-joo defeated
Gerry Penalosa of the Philippines on Saturday to become the new WBC
super flyweight champion.
	   The judges were 2-1 in favor of 29-year-old Cho, who gained the
upper hand early in the match by landing a series of right-hand
straights.
	   Cho, the No. 4 challenger, slowed down Penalosa with a punch on
the chin at the end of the first round and a 7th round combination
that nearly knocked him down.
	   With his face bleeding from a 4th round head-butt, Penalosa
launched an aggressive attack with hooks in the last two rounds,
but failed to pin down the quick-footed South Korean.
	   Saturday's win brings Cho to 13 wins, 7 of them by knockout,
with no defeats or draws. Penalosa's record fell to 39 wins, two
losses and one draw. The match was held at the Seoul Ritz-Carlton
Hotel.

Government to guarantee bank deposits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
reiterated Saturday that the government will fully guarantee
Russian's savings held in bank accounts.
	   At present, only customers of the state-owned savings bank,
Sberbank, enjoy a 100 percent government guarantee for their
deposits.
	   ``Taking into account the anxiety of people over their savings,
we decided to guarantee the safety of deposits of private citizens
in full,'' Chernomyrdin said, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   ``The government and the Central Bank are already working on a
mechanism for implementing this decision,'' he said.
	   Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin said Thursday the
government would ask commercial banks to sign cooperation
agreements with Sberbank and enter a pool in which banks guarantee
private deposits.
	   It was not clear whether this was the plan to which Chernomyrdin
was referring or whether the government has new proposals.
	   Many commercial banks are expected to fail as a result of
Russia's financial crisis.

Cambodian opposition leader vows to lead Sunday protest march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Sam Rainsy
promised to lead a new protest march Sunday through Phnom Penh and
invited Cambodians from around the country to join demonstrations
against leader Hun Sen.
	   Sam Rainsy told thousands of protesters in the sixth day of a
sit-in outside the National Assembly to refrain from violence.
	   The round-the-clock sit-in, with numbers generally fluctuating
from 600 people at night to 10,000 by late afternoon, has become
the focal rallying point against strongman Hun Sen and his declared
victory in parliamentary elections last month.
	   ``Our struggle must continue, but we must avoid using
violence,'' Sam Rainsy told the protesters, camped out in a tent
city before the National Assembly.
	   Sam Rainsy said he would lead a rally at the capital's main
sports stadium Sunday, followed by a march throughout the streets.
	   Hun Sen's government is accusing Sam Rainsy, whose self-named
party finished third in the vote, of fomenting civil unrest. There
have been hints he could be arrested.
	   The atmosphere has been festive since the sit-in was launched
Monday, though the rhetoric has occasionally been chilling and
large, violent cartoons depicting Hun Sen being killed or dying dot
the park.
	   The protesters have demanded that Hun Sen step down and that
alleged irregularities in the voting and counting of ballots in the
elections July 26 be properly addressed. The Hun Sen-controlled
electoral commission called the complaints ``baseless.''
	   The opposition's complaints are now at the country's highest
appeals body, the Constitutional Council, made up largely of
members of Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party. It is to make
a ruling by Wednesday.
	   Sam Rainsy has called claims in the pro-Hun Sen press that he
was distributing leaflets urging civil war ``a dirty trick.''
	   But he has also said that the United States should fire a cruise
missile into Hun Sen's home. U.S. State Department spokesman James
Foley said Friday in Washington that the political crisis should be
resolved in a nonviolent fashion through dialogue.
	   The elections were held a year after Hun Sen deposed his
co-prime minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a bloody coup. But
political stability has remained elusive since the vote.
	   Ranariddh, whose party came in second, and Sam Rainsy have
refused to recognize the election result that gave Hun Sen's party
a slight majority in the assembly.
	   Their refusal to join a coalition means Hun Sen cannot muster
the necessary two-thirds majority of the 122 seats required to form
a government.
	   The new assembly is scheduled to meet for the first time Sept.
24.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ International officials are
criticizing a plan by Muslim and Croat authorities to spend most of
the proceeds from privatizing state companies to pay soldiers who
fought in the Bosnian civil war.
	   The plan calls for vouchers to be issued to residents, which
then can be exchanged for shares in state-owned companies.
	   The vouchers are to be divided among three categories of people:
all pre-war residents, based on their investments before the war;
those whose foreign currency accounts were frozen during the war;
and soldiers who weren't paid for their war service.
	   Federation officials estimate unpaid Bosnian and Croat soldiers
are owed 9 billion marks (dlrs 5 billion).
	   The total value of property available for privatization is only
15 billion marks (dlrs 8 billion).
	   The Bosnian federation's privatization plan was generally
approved by international officials. But now the officials are
calling on authorities in the Bosnian Muslim and Croat portion of
the country to revise the process.
	   ``We do have serious concerns about how the authorities in the
federation have handled this,'' said Simon Haselock, spokesman for
Carlos Westendorp, the top international official in Bosnia.
	   Haselock questioned the amount of money being spent to pay the
soldiers and called the decision ``politically motivated.'' General
elections are being held Sept. 12-13.
	   ``Getting compensation for soldiers obviously helps to win
votes,'' and is blocking the whole privatization process, he said.
	   Westendorp urged authorities in July to review the issue, but
received no response, Haselock said. This could prompt Westendorp
to block certain categories of residents from receiving vouchers.

Central bank chiefs quit after differing with Malaysia's PM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
acknowledged on Saturday that the country's top central bank
officials resigned over a policy rift with his government.
	   Irreconcilable differences over monetary policy spurred Bank
Negara Governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong Weng Phak,
to quit earlier this week, said sources close to the central bank.
	   ``Well, we have some differences,'' acknowledged Mahathir.
``They wanted to quit ... so I think I accept that.''
	   Mahathir added that his administration had never agreed with
Bank Negara's move to raise interest rates and lower spending _
measures that were also advocated by the International Monetary
Fund and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir has favored a loose monetary policy with interest rates
low as a way of spurring investment, while Ahmad and the central
bank have pushed interest rates higher in part to protect the
currency.
	   After Bank Negara's policy failed to avert a contraction in the
first quarter this year, Mahathir began pushing for a looser fiscal
policy. Government spending surged by 20 percent and benchmark
interest rates were cut.
	   Malaysia's economy shrank 6.8 percent in the second quarter, and
2.8 percent in the first _ a far cry from the 8-percent-plus growth
rates which the country has enjoyed for the last decade.
	   Assistant Governor Dr. Zeti Akhtar Aziz has been appointed
acting governor of the central bank and will take up her new
position Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, Mahathir also stressed that the government has no
plans to slap restrictions on the flow of capital in and out of the
country.

Taiwan's China Airlines reports first loss in 12 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ China Airlines, Taiwan's flagship carrier,
said Saturday it posted 1.56 billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 45
million) in losses after tax in the first six months _ its first
loss in 12 years.
	   The airline blamed the loss on the Asian financial crisis and
the slashing of its prices to boost business following the crash of
an Airbus in February that killed 202 people.
	   Following the crash, the goverment ordered the foundation that
controls the carrier to sell some of its shares to private
investors to improve the airline's management.
	   The crash occurred as China Airlines was trying to improve its
safety record after a spate of accidents culminating in a crash in
Nagoya, Japan, in 1994 that killed 264 people.
	   Partly because of the price cuts, the airlines said in a

Taiwan's computer giant slashes profit forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwan's computer giant Acer Inc. has
slashed its net profit forecast for 1998 by 36 percent to 3.5
billion Taiwan dollars (about U.S. dlrs 100 million), citing
slumping chip and personal computer prices.
	   Acer, however, raised its 1998 sales target slightly to 90
billion Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.58 billion), it said in a
statement Saturday.
	   A global slump in dynamic random access memory chip prices has
bottomed out, and the group expects its earning's outlook to
improve later this year, Senior Vice President Philip Peng said.
	   Acer Semiconductor Corp., formerly a joint venture with Texas
Instruments, has been racking up losses over the past few years
because of falling prices in DRAM chips. The U.S. firm sold its
shares in the venture to Acer last March.
	   Acer's profit cuts are the latest in a series of similar moves
by other large Taiwanese technology companies.

Report: Indonesian fact-finding team finds no proof of rapes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS last graf with rape victims possibly unwilling to talk to
investigators. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A government fact-finding team has not
found any proof that ethnic Chinese women were raped during riots
in May that led to the ouster of President Suharto, the official
Antara news agency reported Saturday.
	   Women's Affairs Minister Tutty Alawiah, one of the leaders of
the investigation, echoed military chiefs who said earlier this
week that they had failed to find evidence of mass rapes.
	   ``The team has been conducting an investigation for one and a
half months now but has found no woman who fell victim to gang rape
or who claimed to have been raped during the May riots,'' Antara
quoted Alawiah as saying.
	   However, the minister said there were cases of sexual harassment
during the unrest in Jakarta, which claimed 1,200 lives and left
thousands of cars and buildings damaged or gutted by fire.
	   Rioters targeted property of the ethnic Chinese minority, which
has become a scapegoat for Indonesia's economic ills because it
dominates commerce in the nation of 202 million.
	   Reports by women's groups that at least 168 Chinese women and
girls were raped during the riots angered many ethnic Chinese
abroad. Protests against the Indonesian government have been staged
in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States and elsewhere.
	   President B.J. Habibie has apologized for the rapes, but
military chief Gen. Wiranto and other officials say investigators
have found no evidence that they happened.
	   Alawiah said hospital records checked by the fact-finding team
did not list any rape victims. And investigators were unable to
find two alleged rape victims reported to have been flown to a
hospital in Singapore, Antara quoted her as saying.
	   Human rights activists say rape victims may be unwilling to seek
help because of the stigma associated with the crime or view police
as corrupt and prefer not to seek their help.

Ozaki retakes lead in Hisamitsu KBC Augusta
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHIMA, Japan (AP) _ Two-time defending champion and first-round
leader Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki carded a 7-under-par 65 Saturday to
retake the lead for a three-stroke advantage going into the final
round of the Hisamitsu KBC Augusta.
	   A hot putter and a bunker shot helped yield eight birdies
against a bogey for the 51-year-old Ozaki, Japan's winningest
golfer with 107 career victories.
	   The round left Ozaki at a 13-under 203 total, three shots ahead
of overnight leader Katsunori Kuwabara, who shot a 70.
	   After leading the opening round with a 66, Ozaki had a 72 in the
second round. The disappointing score sent him to the practice
green.
	   In the third round, Ozaki one-putted 11 holes.
	   ``It was good that I had a birdie start today,'' said Ozaki, in
contention for his second title of the year. ``And No. 1 is the
toughest hole for me at this course.''
	   After a 3-under front nine, Ozaki bogeyed the par-4 10th hole.
Then he got hotter and birdied four straight holes from the 12th
and also birdied the par-5 final hole.
	   Kuwabara, who led by a stroke overnight, made a slow start and
had two birdies and two bogeys in the first 12 holes before scoring
three straight birdies from the par-5 13th. That pulled him within
a stroke of Ozaki.
	   Kuwabara, winless since his only career victory in the 1995 Acom
International, then suffered a demoralizing double bogey at the
par-4 16th. But he made a good finish with a birdie at the final
hole.
	   Another three strokes back at 209 were Yasuharu Imano, Katsumasa
Miyamoto and Ikuo Shirahama.
	   Shoichi Kuwabara, Keiji Teshima and Nobuo Serizawa shared sixth
at 210.
	   The 100 million yen (dlrs 699,000) event offers a top prize of
18 million yen (dlrs 125,000).

Government to guarantee bank deposits

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
reiterated Saturday that the government will fully guarantee
Russian's savings held in bank accounts.
	   Only customers of the state-owned savings bank, Sberbank, now
enjoy a 100 percent government guarantee for their deposits.
	   ``We have taken measures to guarantee citizens' deposits in
full,'' Chernomyrdin said in an interview on NTV television. ``I
want to say to the depositors of commercial banks: You needn't
worry, you will get your deposits.''
	   Central Bank Chairman Sergei Dubinin said Thursday the
government would ask commercial banks to sign cooperation
agreements with Sberbank and enter a pool in which banks guarantee
private deposits.
	   However, the Central Bank did not say what the terms of such
deals would be, and there is no information on how many commercial
banks have subsequently entered such agreements.
	   Many commercial banks are expected to fail as a result of
Russia's financial crisis.

Laos will free 144 prisoners to commemorate Constitution Day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) _ Laotian government officials say a
general amnesty will be granted to 144 prisoners, including five
women, as part of Constitution Day celebrations.
	   The amnesty has been granted on the order of President Khamtay
Sipandong, the official said on condition of anonymity Friday.
	   The decree, which has not been publicly announced, also states
that 302 prisoners are to have their sentences decreased. The order
did not specify the nature of anyone's crimes.
	   The holiday was Aug. 15, but the release was likely to take some
time, the official said.
	   No reference was made to two long-held political prisoners,
Latsami Khamphoui and Feng Sakchittaphong, jailed since 1990 for
pushing for democratic reforms in the single-party Marxist state.
	   The pair, together with Thongsouk Saysangkhi, who died in prison
last February, received 14-year prison sentences. The are all
former high-ranking government officials or party members.
	   The trio were said by the human-rights group Amnesty
International to be suffering various illnesses, including kidney
and intestinal problems, diabetes and angina.

Police battle terrorists in China's restive northwest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police in a far west Chinese region rocked by a
series of terrorist attacks have arrested a group of suspects and
seized firearms, an official newspaper reported.
	   The attacks occured in the Yili district of Xinjiang, a large,
restive region where Muslim separatists are battling Chinese rule.
	   Acts of violent terrorism have occured ``many times'' in Yili
since last year, the Xinjiang Daily said in its Aug. 24 edition,
seen Saturday in Beijing.
	   Police responded with repeated efforts this year to suppress the
terrorists, breaking up more than 10 criminal gangs, detaining a
group of suspects and seizing guns and ammunition, the newspaper
said.
	   It gave no details of the crackdown but said some police
officers were killed and injured. Since last year, Yili police have
set up 33 new stations and hired 456 additional officers, it said.
	   Xinjiang was ruled by Chinese emperors for 200 years as a buffer
state between China and the Muslim nations of Central Asia. The
Uighurs, Xinjiang's main ethnic group, briefly ran an independent
state before communist forces retook the region in 1949.
	   Separatist sentiment, never fully quelled, has been reignited in
recent years by the newly independent Central Asian nations created
in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse and by Iran's Islamic
revolution.
	   China has tried to counter the effect by improving relations
with Kazakstan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and getting them to
pledge not to support anti-Chinese separatists.

Rioting hits Indonesian town for a second day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with rioting Saturday morning &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs burned a warehouse Saturday on
the second day of rioting in a coastal town where thousands of
fishermen attacked Chinese-owned cars and houses, newspapers
reported. At least 33 people were arrested.
	   The violence in the Java island town of Cilacap had dwindled by
the afternoon. Security forces patrolled past shops and
restaurants, shuttered by their owners for fear of more unrest.
	   On Friday, hundreds of police and soldiers were unable to
prevent the mob rampaging until late in the evening, The Jakarta
Post reported. The rioters were angry over low wages and alleged
corruption.
	   Rioters torched a shrimp warehouse on Saturday morning, reported
the Suara Pembaruan, a daily newspaper.
	   The unrest was the latest in a string of riots this week around
Indonesia, which is suffering economic turmoil that has stripped
millions of their jobs and pushed up prices.
	   The ethnic Chinese minority dominates the economy and has often
been blamed for the crisis. Chinese-owned property was targeted in
more widespread violence that led to the downfall in May of former
President Suharto after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Authorities arrested 33 people but there were no reports of
injuries in Cilacap, 435 kilometers (270 miles) east of Jakarta,
the capital.
	   The rioting began when the fishermen burned at least 10 trawlers
moored in the fishing port near the town, the Post reported. They
then moved into Cilacap, burning and damaging four cars, 10
motorcycles and 20 houses belonging to ethnic Chinese.
	   Soldiers blocked thoroughfares but were outnumbered and had to
call for backup from neighboring towns.
	   The crews of the fishing boats said they were exploited by their
employers and had not received a pay raise in six years. The
fishermen are paid 2,000 rupiah (18 U.S. cents) a day, a salary
below the minimum wage, the Post quoted Cilacap police chief Col.
Andi Lolo as saying.
	   The protesters also complained that port officials extorted
money from them.
	   Under Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, the government
has pledged to curb corruption and is instituting democratic
reforms. General elections are scheduled next year.

Strong aftershock rocks Tibet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A strong aftershock rocked a remote central area
of Tibet on Saturday, but the government's seismology bureau said
it did not expect any casualties or damage.
	   The magnitude-5.2 jolt hit Xainza, about 250 kilometers (155
miles) northwest of the region's capital, Lhasa, early Saturday
morning, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said.
	   The quake was an aftershock of a magnitude-6 temblor that hit
Xainza on Tuesday, it said.
	   An official at the State Seismological Bureau, who gave just his
surname, Wang, said he believed the shock was too mild to have
caused any casualties or damage.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ One of Myanmar's ruling generals said
most people have not rallied pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi
because they fear violence, official newspapers reported Saturday.
	   Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the top four generals of the ruling
junta, again warned that the government would not tolerate
opposition calls for a civilian parliament to convene.
	   ``It is obvious that, apart from the handful of destructive
instigators, the majority of the public want to live in peace and
are scared of the occurrence of any disturbances,'' Khin Nyunt said
in a monthly speech at a refresher course for teachers.
	   ``The obstructionists, with evil intentions, are trying to
disrupt stability and derail the government's development
activities with the aim of gaining popularity and grabbing state
power,'' Khin Nyunt said.
	   A month-long campaign by anti-government groups inside and
outside Myanmar, also known as Burma, marking the 10th anniversary
of a nationwide uprising has failed to ignite popular protests and
the country has remained calm.
	   The uprising in 1988 was crushed by troops, leaving an estimated
3,000 people dead, and fear still runs deep.
	   A protest Monday by 200 university students _ the first in
nearly two years _ has not been repeated. Police have been posted
throughout the city to stop any hit-and-run demonstration from
occurring.
	   Suu Kyi, whose political activities are extremely restricted,
ended a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities Monday, one of
the few forms of protest open to her. She was stopped outside
Yangon while trying to travel to visit provincial supporters.
	   Her party, the National League for Democracy, has demanded that
the government finally convene a parliament elected in 1990 but
prevented from taking office by the military government. The NLD
overwhelmingly won the election.
	   The issue is extremely touchy for the ruling State Peace and
Development Council, which has insisted that a new constitution be
drafted before a civilian parliament can be called.
	   But the government warned the NLD this week that attempts to
undermine a new constitution could result in long prison terms and
the party being declared illegal.
	   Official newspaper commentaries said that Suu Kyi was ``dancing
to the tunes'' of the United States and other critical countries
and that the army could not hand over power to her party.

Central bank chiefs quit after differing with Malaysia's PM
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 10th graf that Mahathir not going to non-aligned
meeting in South Africa; New to some points &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
acknowledged on Saturday that the country's top central bank
officials resigned over a policy rift with his government.
	   Irreconcilable differences over monetary policy spurred Bank
Negara Governor Ahmad Mohamed Don and his deputy, Fong Weng Phak,
to quit earlier this week, said sources close to the central bank.
	   ``Well, we have some differences,'' acknowledged Mahathir.
``They wanted to quit ... so I think I accept that.''
	   Mahathir added that his administration had never agreed with
Bank Negara's move to raise interest rates and lower spending _
measures that were also advocated by the International Monetary
Fund and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir has favored a loose monetary policy with interest rates
low as a way of spurring investment, while Ahmad and the central
bank have pushed interest rates higher in part to protect the
currency.
	   After Bank Negara's policy failed to avert a contraction in the
first quarter this year, Mahathir began pushing for a looser fiscal
policy. Government spending surged by 20 percent and benchmark
interest rates were cut.
	   Malaysia's economy shrank 6.8 percent in the second quarter, and
2.8 percent in the first _ a far cry from the 8-percent-plus growth
rates which the country has enjoyed for the last decade.
	   Assistant Governor Dr. Zeti Akhtar Aziz has been appointed
acting governor of the central bank and will take up her new
position Tuesday.
	   Meanwhile, Mahathir also stressed that the government has no
plans to slap restrictions on the flow of capital in and out of the
country.
	   He also said that he would not be attending the 12th Non-Aligned
Movement summit in Durban, South Africa. ``I have a lot of things
to do. I am tired, I am worn out,'' the 72-year-old told reporters.

Yeltsin says he will not step down, opposition in retreat

Communist reaction, Chernomyrdin pledging to ensure ruble's
convertibility. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's opponents appeared Saturday to be
backing off on their demands for an immediate power-sharing
agreement after the president vowed unequivocally that he would not
resign.
	   ``I want to say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to
resign. I will work as I'm supposed to for my constitutional
term,'' Yeltsin said Friday night in an interview on national
television.
	   ``In 2000, there will be an election for a new president and I
will not run.''
	   Yeltsin's emphatic denial came after days of feverish
speculation that he was about to resign or be ousted as his country
plunged into a seemingly bottomless economic decline. He had not
been seen in public since Tuesday, prompting reports that he had
already stepped down.
	   Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin went on television
Saturday and attempted to calm both the markets and the Russian
people, by reiterating that he would keep the ruble convertible and
guarantee people's bank savings.
	   The government had earlier indicated it would impose
Soviet-style measures to cope with the mounting economic crisis,
despite warnings from the International Monetary Fund that this
would put all loans on hold.
	   Yeltsin's envoy to parliament negotiated with the opposition
Saturday about its demand for a power-sharing agreement that would
sharply limit the president's powers.
	   The opposition continued to insist on amendments to the
constitution that would give parliament more say over key Cabinet
appointments and government policies.
	   But they appeared to cave in on their main demand that these
changes be implemented immediately as a condition for confirming
Chernomyrdin, said Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the State
Duma.
	   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is scheduled to meet
Monday to consider Chernomyrdin's appointment.
	   ``In order not to fuel tension, we would not immediately
consider specific amendments,'' Kotenkov said at a news conference
on Saturday. ``We need a government now, and then we shall see.''
	   As part of the compromise being worked out, the Duma would
promise not to hold a no-confidence motion in the govermment for
one year and Yeltsin would refrain from shuffling the Cabinet for
the same period.
	   For its part, the Kremlin would agree to consider legal changes
that would increase parliamentary control over the Cabinet.
	   Yeltsin also promised to accept lawmakers' proposals on Cabinet
appointments _ but only after Chernomyrdin is confirmed. _ Kotenkov
said. That could mean the appointment of more Communists to the
Cabinet.
	   So far the agreement has been accepted by all factions in
parliament, he said.
	   Communist leaders refused to comment, but predicted Yeltsin
would still be forced out.
	   ``The political and economic situation in the country will force
Yeltsin to resign,'' the Communist Party's No. 2 man, Valentin
Kuptsov, said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Earlier in the week, while rumors were swirling of Yeltsin's
imminent departure, his senior aides discussed possible scenarios
with the Communists, including such things as immunity from
prosecution. Their conversations helped fuel the speculation
Yeltsin would resign.
	   But Kotenkov said Saturday that Yeltsin specifically asked him
to tell lawmakers on Friday he did not want any such guarantees and
was not seeking withdrawal of an impeachment motion that stands
little chance of passing anyway.
	   ``The president said he doesn't need any handouts from the
Duma,'' Kotenkov said. ``The president believes he hasn't done
anything illegal, and is ready to face the people to prove it.''
	   Under the Russian constitution, the Duma must approve the prime
minister. If it rejects a candidate three times, Yeltsin can
dissolve the Duma and call parliamentary elections _ an option
Yeltsin said Friday he had no plans to take.
	   Russians, who have weathered one crisis after another in recent
years, were taking the latest one in stride, too. Short lines
formed outside some banks as people tried to change rubles for
dollars, but there was little sign of panic.
	   In a bid to calm jittery markets, Chernomyrdin pledged Saturday
the government would not ban the sale of dollars and other foreign
currencies, but would keep the ruble convertible.
	   ``If we close (exchange offices) that would only revive the
black market,'' he said.
	   The financial crisis began in early summer as tremors from
Asia's economic turmoil reached Moscow and a decline in oil prices
_ Russia's top export _ derailed vital reforms and sent the economy
crashing.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced
leader to replace the youthful Sergei Kiriyenko and contain the
crisis.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sloshing through mud, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Saturday inspected areas devastated by flooding, stopping
by a home for the handicapped where five people were killed by a
mudslide.
	   Heavy rains that began earlier in the week continued in Tokyo
and nearby areas in eastern Japan, causing rivers to swell and
flooding thousands of homes.
	   Police said at least 13 people have died and 32 people injured
nationwide, as of early Saturday, in damage caused by the heavy
downpour brought on by Typhoon Rex.
	   Search efforts continued Saturday for three people still missing
after a river burst its banks Thursday in Tochigi Prefecture
(state) 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo.
	   Nearly 8,000 homes have been flooded, destroyed or partly
destroyed, police said. Mudslides totaled 575, while 19 bridges
have been swept away, they said.
	   Thousands of people have been evacuated throughout the
disaster-struck regions.
	   Obuchi arrived in the morning in Fukushima Prefecture (state),
175 kilometers (110 miles) north of Tokyo, and was expected to
visit Tochigi in the afternoon.
	   He was shown on nationwide TV news shaking hands with people who
had fled their homes and telling them, ``Keep strong.''
	   The Central Meteorological Agency said Rex was expected to hit
the eastern coast of Japan over the weekend or early next week.
	   As of noon Saturday, Rex, packing winds of up to 126 kph (80
mph), was slowly moving northeasterly from out in the Pacific
Ocean, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tokyo, it said.
	   Rex had been classified as a tropical storm until Saturday, when
winds increased to typhoon levels.
	   The agency warned of additional mudslides as well as thunder and
lightning, strong winds and hail in affected areas.
	   Ibaraki Prefecture, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, was expected to have 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain
Saturday.
	   The rains have filled roads with mud and smashed rice stalks in
fields. TV news showed people fleeing on boats from homes so buried
in murky water that only rooftops showed.
	   Elsewhere, people waded through kneehigh waters, and in coastal
areas, waves tossed docked boats.

Fighting in eastern Kinshasa tapers off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Decaying corpses littered the streets of
Kinshasa's eastern suburbs, where platoons of government troops
searched house after house on Saturday for pockets of rebel
fighters.
	   Fighting in eastern Kinshasa tapered off to little more than
sporadic machine-gun fire, although insurgent forces trying to oust
President Laurent Kabila still held positions outside the city.
	   ``There are many dead in the area,'' said Health Minister
Jean-Baptist Sondgi. ``It's a terrible scene of bodies here and
there.''
	   On the city's west side, new fighting broke out overnight with
heavy mortar fire echoing through the area near the Ndangi forest
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown.
	   ``We could hear the fighting all night,'' said one resident who
left the area and came to central Kinshasa overnight. The fighting
had tapered off by morning.
	   Fresh combat now on Kinshasa's west side comes one day after
thousands of people waving tree branches and cheering said the war
in Kinshasa was over.
	   Electricity to the city continued to be cut off by a rebel-held
power dam and a dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in place.
	   ``Many of the aggressors have surrendered and laid down their
arms,'' state-controlled radio reported Saturday. ``But vigilance
must continue, you must denounce any suspected Rwandan
aggressors.''
	   A coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and disenchanted
members of Kabila's military had said it was determined to take
Kinshasa.
	   Kabila maintains neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are behind the
3-week-old rebellion, a charge both countries deny.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma have been silent in
recent days amid growing indications their assault on the capital
was facing tough resistance from troops loyal to Kabila and his
Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian allies.
	   Rebel gunmen had slipped into the city earlier in the week and
were fighting for control of the airport and several eastern
districts, including Kingasani and Masina.
	   The fighting also unleashed a killing spree in parts of Kinshasa
where soldiers and civilians hunted down suspected rebel fighters
and beat, burned or shot them death.
	   Government and allied troops were firmly in control of the
airport and appeared to be containing rebel positions elsewhere.
	   State radio late Friday reported other suspected insurgents
spotted in the Ndangi forest near Kabila's private residence about
10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown Kinshasa.
	   Away from the capital, rebel forces still control the Inga power
dam that supplies electricity to Kinshasa. Angolan forces trying to
retake the dam said the insurgents were threatening to blow it up.
	   State-controlled Voice of the People radio continued Saturday to
call on former government troops now fighting for the rebels to lay
down their arms.
	   ``We know you have been tricked by the Rwandans, lay down your
arms and rejoin your ranks with the Congolese forces,'' an
announcer said.
	   The insurgents scored repeated military successes early in the
month-old rebellion, capturing important cities in eastern Congo
and launching a drive toward Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of foreign troops in recent days has
apparently turned the tide in the southwest.
	   A respected Zimbabwean business newspaper reported Friday that
about 2,000 Zimbabwean troop reinforcements have been airlifted to
Congo, bringing the total Zimbabwean force to 2,800.
	   Along with the armored cars, vehicles and attack helicopters
that Zimbabwe has shipped, the cost of its involvement was
estimated by the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper at more than
$100,000 a day _ a huge figure for a country mired in economic
turmoil.

Greek Orthodox Church leader accused of political meddling

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ He's supposed to be a messenger of peace.
But the leader of the Greek Orthodox Church is sounding more like a
general preparing for battle.
	   ``We are ready, if necessary, to shed blood and make sacrifices.
We, as a church, pray for peace ... But we bless the sacred weapons
when the moment demands it,'' Archbishop Christodoulos said
recently on the Assumption of the Virgin holy day _ which doubles
as Greece's armed forces day.
	   In the nearly four months since his enthronement, Christodoulos,
59, has peppered Greeks with feisty opinions on everything from
economic affairs to the dream of reclaiming lands from the
``barbaric'' Turks and others.
	   Initially viewed as a reformer who might modernize the church,
Christodoulos has become a darling of the far right. The
ultra-nationalist newspaper Stohos dubbed him ``Archbishop
Thunderbolt.''
	   His stormy comments reach far beyond the pulpit.
	   Orthodox leaders have traditionally enjoyed deep respect as
keepers of an essential element of the Greek ethnic identity during
four centuries of Muslim Ottoman rule. The church helped fan the
1821 independence revolt.
	   But boasting about the past is not the same as chiming in on
current affairs, critics say.
	   Christodoulos could be inflaming nationalist fervor at a highly
sensitive time. Plans by Greek Cypriots to deploy anti-aircraft
missiles on their part of the Mediterranean island are heightening
tensions between Greece and neighboring Turkey, whose troops occupy
the northern third of the divided island.
	   ``If he wants to reinvigorate church life, he should stress
pastoral work, religious education, the education of clergy,
outreach to the young, and not by way of demagoguery or political
rabble rousing,'' said Nicholas P. Constas, an assistant professor
of theology at Harvard Divinity School.
	   Christodoulos shows no signs of quieting down.
	   During the Aug. 15 armed forces day blessing, he vowed ``as the
leader of the Greeks'' to open an abandoned monastery in Turkey.
	   And he called for the restoration of Greek lands in Turkey,
bellowing the war cry of the ancient Spartans: ``We stand
defiant!''
	   ``We send a message in every direction, to the civilized West
and the barbaric East,'' he cried.
	   Christodoulos says his only mission is to get people back to
church, but many of his statements are political.
	   Among other things, he warned that the government's policies to
align Greece's economy with the rest of the European Union are
leading to ``perdition and destruction.''
	   He has lambasted efforts to fully separate church from state and
threatened to smite critics with his scepter, crowned by two
intertwined snakes being crushed by a cross.
	   Some officials have had enough.
	   ``If he wants to deal with politics, he should take off his
robes,'' said Justice Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos.
	   Unlike a politician, Christodoulos has to answer to no one.
	   Orthodoxy is Greece's state religion and more than 90 percent of
its 10.2 million people are baptized into the church, one of more
than a dozen Orthodox churches worldwide. And the church is
Greece's second biggest landowner after the government, with
unofficial estimates of its wealth put at about dlrs 1 billion.
	   But while financially healthy, the Greek Orthodox Church is
ailing spiritually. Regular church attendance is sliding and ever
fewer faithful are able to understand the archaic Byzantine Greek
used in its services.
	   According to a recent poll, only 12 percent of Greeks worship
every Sunday, compared to 31 percent in 1963.

Cabaret owner wounded in fifth gang attack in a month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMASSOL, Cyprus (AP) - A cabaret owner and two doormen were
wounded early Saturday in a bombing in the fifth gang attack in a
month, police said.
	   Sotiris Athinis, 42, and the doormen were slightly wounded when
a remote-controlled bomb exploded as they were leaving the Panache
nightclub before dawn, police said, speaking on customary condition
of anonymity.
	   Panache was the target of a bomb attack three years ago in an
earlier outbreak of gangland bombings and shootings. Athinis'
brother, Melios, 48, was one of about a dozen people killed or
wounded.
	   Gang warfare flared up again in this tourist resort and port
city on July 31 when Andros Aeroporos, 32, a member of a Limassol
underworld clan, was shot and killed as he was leaving a cabaret.
Andros and two of his brothers had been acquitted in June of the
attempted murder of Andonis Fanieros, the reputed underworld leader
of Larnaca, a town 40 kilometers (25 miles) east of Limassol.
	   On Aug. 9, Andonis' son Loucas, escaped unhurt when his car was
sprayed with bullets outside a Larnaca nightclub.
	   On Aug. 17, Charalambos Agathocleous, 29, was wounded in a
remote-controlled bomb attack as he was leaving his Limassol pub in
the heart of the town's night life district.
	   Five days later, Evangelos Christodoulou, 35, was shot and
wounded as he was leaving his cabaret in the same district.
	   Britain warned troops at its bases on Cyprus, one which is near
Limassol and the other next to Larnaca, to avoid a number of pubs,
cabarets and nightclubs in the two towns.
	   Cyprus police characterize the underworld flare up as part of a
struggle for control of the island's cabarets, which are allegedly
fronts for prostitution and drugs.

Yeltsin says he will not step down, opposition in retreat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to ADD Chernomyrdin saying no return to Soviet
past. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo NY107 &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's opponents appeared Saturday to be
backing off on their demands for an immediate power-sharing
agreement and the interim government said there would be no return
to the Soviet past.
	   Yeltsin vowed unequivocally Friday that he would not resign, and
the government tried to reassure both Russians and international
investors that efforts to build a market economy would not be
abandoned.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
said on national television.
	   He reiterated that he would keep the ruble convertible and
guarantee people's bank savings, and that he would not stop the
sale of dollars and other foreign currencies.
	   Yeltsin went on television Friday night to insist he would not
resign and would serve out the rest of his term.
	   ``I want to say that I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to
resign. I will work as I'm supposed to for my constitutional
term,'' Yeltsin said. ``In 2000, there will be an election for a
new president and I will not run.''
	   Yeltsin's emphatic denial came after days of feverish
speculation that he was about to resign or be ousted as his country
plunged into a seemingly bottomless economic decline. He had not
been seen in public since Tuesday, prompting reports that he had
already stepped down.
	   The government had earlier indicated it would impose
Soviet-style measures to cope with the mounting economic crisis,
despite warnings from the International Monetary Fund that this
would put all loans on hold.
	   Yeltsin's envoy to parliament negotiated with the opposition
Saturday about its demand for a power-sharing agreement that would
sharply limit the president's powers.
	   The opposition continued to insist on amendments to the
constitution that would give parliament more say over key Cabinet
appointments and government policies.
	   But they appeared to cave in on their main demand that these
changes be implemented immediately as a condition for confirming
Chernomyrdin, said Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the State
Duma.
	   The Duma, the lower house of parliament, is scheduled to meet
Monday to consider Chernomyrdin's appointment.
	   ``In order not to fuel tension, we would not immediately
consider specific amendments,'' Kotenkov said at a news conference
on Saturday. ``We need a government now, and then we shall see.''
	   As part of the compromise being worked out, the Duma would
promise not to hold a no-confidence motion in the government for
one year and Yeltsin would refrain from shuffling the Cabinet for
the same period.
	   For its part, the Kremlin would agree to consider legal changes
that would increase parliamentary control over the Cabinet.
	   Yeltsin also promised to accept lawmakers' proposals on Cabinet
appointments _ but only after Chernomyrdin is confirmed. _ Kotenkov
said. That could mean the appointment of more Communists to the
Cabinet.
	   So far the agreement has been accepted by all factions in
parliament, he said.
	   Communist leaders refused to comment, but predicted Yeltsin
would still be forced out.
	   ``The political and economic situation in the country will force
Yeltsin to resign,'' the Communist Party's No. 2 man, Valentin
Kuptsov, said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Earlier in the week, while rumors were swirling of Yeltsin's
imminent departure, his senior aides discussed possible scenarios
with the Communists, including such things as immunity from
prosecution. Their conversations helped fuel the speculation
Yeltsin would resign.
	   But Kotenkov said Saturday that Yeltsin specifically asked him
to tell lawmakers on Friday he did not want any such guarantees and
was not seeking withdrawal of an impeachment motion that stands
little chance of passing anyway.
	   ``The president said he doesn't need any handouts from the
Duma,'' Kotenkov said. ``The president believes he hasn't done
anything illegal, and is ready to face the people to prove it.''
	   Under the Russian constitution, the Duma must approve the prime
minister. If it rejects a candidate three times, Yeltsin can
dissolve the Duma and call parliamentary elections _ an option
Yeltsin said Friday he had no plans to take.
	   Russians, who have weathered one crisis after another in recent
years, were taking the latest one in stride, too. Short lines
formed outside some banks as people tried to change rubles for
dollars, but there was little sign of panic.
	   The financial crisis began in early summer as tremors from
Asia's economic turmoil reached Moscow and a decline in oil prices
_ Russia's top export _ derailed vital reforms and sent the economy
crashing.
	   Chernomyrdin, who was fired in March, was brought back in a
surprise move last Sunday as Yeltsin sought a more experienced
leader to replace the youthful Sergei Kiriyenko and contain the
crisis.

Murai, three others share lead in Goyo Ladies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOMOZAKI, Japan (AP) _ Mayumi Murai fired a 5-under-par 67
Saturday and surged ahead to share a one-stroke lead with three
others after 36 holes in the three-round Goyo Construction Ladies.
	   Murai, seeking her first title in two years and seventh overall,
scattered five birdies en route to a 6-under 138 total.
	   Aiko Hashimoto, an overnight co-leader, shot a 71 and was tied
for the lead also with Fusako Nagata and Chie Yoshida. Nagata shot
a 68 and Yoshida a 70.
	   Fuki Kido, winner of the Mizuno Ladies three weeks ago, carded a
71 for 139.
	   Toshimi Kimura and Chieko Nishida were another stroke back at
140.
	   The 60 million yen (dlrs 419,000) event pays the winner 10.8
million yen (dlrs 75,000).

Police nab three Serbs to be retried for war crimes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Police arrested three Serbs, who are to
be retried on war crimes charges stemming from the 1991 war between
Croatian forces and Serb rebels, the state-run HINA news agency
reported.
	   The three, who were only identified as Pero K., 45, Vujo H., 45,
and Zeljko K., 47, were among 19 Serbs, who in 1995 had been
convicted in absentia of killing Croats and sentenced to prison
terms between 11 and 20 years.
	   The 19 are from the village of Sodolovci in the region known as
Eastern Slavonia, which rebel Serbs seized in 1991.
	   When the region reverted to government rule last January, the
group appealed the sentence and was granted a retrial.
	   United Nations officials, who administered the area during the
transition to Croat rule, insisted that the defendants remain free
during the retrials.
	   But the Supreme court recently upheld the local district
attorney's request to have the group detained during the trials.
	   Police issued warrants for the 19 _ eight of whom are believed
to have fled to neighboring Serb-led Yugoslavia _ and then detained
the three Friday evening.
	   Another member of the group, Goran Vusurovic, surrendered
earlier and is currently being retried.
	   International officials based in Croatia, who monitor the
country's treatment of minority Serbs, did not comment on the case
on Saturday.

Six farmers slaughtered in latest Algerian violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Assailants believed to be part of an
Islamic militant protection racket tortured and slit the throats of
six farmers in western Algiera, hospital officials said Saturday.
	   The six victims _ four men and two women _ were found dead
Friday afternoon near their farms close to Tipaza, 100 kilometers
(62.5 miles) west of Algiers.
	   Locals said the attackers belonged to the Armed Islamic Group,
and were running a protection racket in the area.
	   Western Algeria has been rocked by bombings and murders in
recent months. An estimated 75,000 people have died during a
six-year nationwide insurgency by Islamic militants.
	   Last Friday, four people were injured when a bomb exploded under
the sand at a nearby beach.
	   Further west, near the Moroccan border, Algeria's security
forces have been scouring the Ain-Sefra region in search of Islamic
militants for the last ten days.
	   The newspaper L'Authentique reported Saturday that authorities
are hunting about 30 militants. It claimed the group was
responsible for the murders last Monday of six Algerian border
guards who were ambushed.
	   Algeria's insurgency was triggered when authorities canceled
elections the now banned Islamic Salvation Front was set to win.

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A former dissident who spent over
nine years in communist prisons will become the country's
commissioner for human rights, a daily reported Saturday.
	   The daily Pravo said that the new Social Democratic government
plans to appoint Petr Uhl, 56, to the new post next week.
	   He also will become chairman of the government's Committee for
Minorities, the daily said.
	   Uhl, a co-founder of the human rights movement Charter 77 and an
activist of the Committee for the Unjustly Prosecuted, was jailed
several times and spent over nine years in communist prisons.
	   He was appointed director of the national news agency CTK in the
early 1990s after the collapse of communist rule.
	   Uhl currently works as an editor for Pravo.

Northwest strike causes flight cancellations across Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Northwest Airlines pilots strike forced the
cancellation of the carrier's flights from Asia on Saturday, but
most passengers weren't stranded because the company had arranged
flights on rival airlines.
	   In Japan, 16 Northwest flights scheduled to depart from Tokyo's
Narita International Airport were cancelled Saturday. Four of those
were to have flown to the United States, including two to Honolulu.
	   Northwest's nineteen scheduled flights from Tokyo on Sunday were
also expected to be cancelled.
	   Northwest's pilots went on strike Saturday over contract
disputes over job security and compensation and pay, grounding the
airline after 10 days of intense negotiations.
	   In anticipation of the strike, Japan Airlines earlier this week
agreed to a Northwest request to schedule nine extra flights to
accomodate passengers affected by the walkout.
	   Northwest estimated that 33 percent of its trans-Pacific
passengers, or about 3,600 people, would be unable to travel to
their destinations on the first day of the strike.
	   In South Korea, Northwest officials said that the 370 people
booked for Saturday's flight from Seoul to Tokyo had been notified
24 hours in advance and that the company had found them flights on
other carriers.
	   Northwest operates one flight a day from Seoul's Kimpo Airport
to Narita.
	   Northwest's Sunday morning flight from Beijing to Detroit was
also cancelled. Passengers were either being given tickets on other
airline or delaying their trips, the company said.
	   The airline's flights Monday from Beijing to Detroit and from
Shanghai to Tokyo were likely to be cancelled if the strike
continued, said John Watkins, the Northwest's vice president for
China. He said a decision would be made Sunday.
	   About 250 passengers who had been booked to fly on Sunday's
flight to Detroit were given tickets on other airlines, Watkins
said.

	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ ``Mother Teresa: In,'' says a wooden
board on the wall outside Mother House.
	   Inside the three-story, gray-washed building, nuns in the
familiar blue-bordered white saris bow their heads at her marble
tombstone, decorated with orange flowers and candles. Then they
step out into Calcutta's traffic-clogged streets.
	   Mother Teresa may have died, but their mission remains the same:
Rescuing the suffering, destitute and dying from Calcutta's nooks
and alleys.
	   In homes the nuns run across the teeming city, volunteers flit
around patients' beds tending worm-eaten limbs, festering wounds
and leaking bladders. At orphanages and schools, children swarm
around matrons, laughing and puffing at colorful balloons.
	   When Mother Teresa died last Sept. 5 at age 87, some people
feared the Missionaries of Charity would shrivel without her
dynamic leadership.
	   But the order is thriving and expanding under her successor,
Sister Nirmala, a Hindu-born Indian convert to Roman Catholicism.
The 4,000-nun order has added nearly 20 new centers since its
founder's death and will have 614 homes around the world by year's
end.
	   Charitable contributions and other donations have increased
since Mother Teresa died, the order says, although its books are
not open to the public.
	   ``It's God's work,'' Sister Nirmala said in a rare interview at
Mother House. ``If it was Mother's work, maybe in course of time it
would have happened, but since it is God's work, it is the same.''
	   Sister Nirmala was elected superior general of the order six
months before Mother Teresa, its founder, died. Despite Mother
Teresa's support, she began her six-year tenure with several
disadvantages.
	   She stepped into one of the most visible positions in the
Catholic Church outside the Vatican, but few people except her nuns
could even identify her.
	   There were fears she would be overshadowed by more senior nuns,
several of whom had been seen over the years as possible successors
to Mother Teresa and who handled most of the day-to-day
administration.
	   Sister Nirmala, 64, has emerged with her own distinctive style,
keeping the superior-general the pivot of the order but delegating
powers to her four counselors.
	   ``The order is going on in the same direction, the direction
that Mother Teresa gave it,'' said the Rev. Edward le Joly, an
89-year-old Jesuit priest who worked with Mother Teresa for 40
years.
	   ``The new superior-general does not have the gifts and graces
which Mother Teresa had,'' he added. ``But she does not need them,
because the congregation goes on according to the laws of the
Catholic Church and carries on in the spirit of Mother Teresa.''
	   Sister Nirmala's toughness was tested in a controversy over the
first anniversary of Mother Teresa's death.
	   A group of Calcutta devotees formed a Mother Teresa Memorial
Committee. It opened a bank account and collected donations from
corporations to mark the anniversary by erecting a statue and
naming a street after her.
	   Sister Nirmala called a news conference and, in a statement
packed with politeness as well as punch, slammed the fundraising in
Mother Teresa's name.
	   ``Mother belongs to everybody, but she has vested her name in
the Missionaries of Charity,'' Sister Nirmala said in the
interview. ``We have lived the life she has lived _ we are her
sisters _ so this name has to be protected from misuse.''
	   But she knows the order cannot shield Mother Teresa's name from
use across the world, either by well-intentioned admirers or by
unscrupulous people seeking handouts.
	   ``We are considering allowing the use of Mother's name by
schools, colleges and institutions, provided they are ready to
abide by certain conditions that will be stipulated,'' Sister
Nirmala said.
	   She also expresses determination to be aggressive on issues that
were close to Mother Teresa's heart, such as opposing abortion and
birth control.
	   ``We believe in the same way and whenever it is necessary,
whenever there is an opportunity, we will surely'' speak out,
Sister Nirmala said.
	   The order has also begun identifying miracles attributed to
Mother Teresa that will help the Vatican begin the process of
canonization, the first step towards declaring her a saint.
Documents relating to these miracles are being sent to the Pope for
verification.
	   One of these miracles reportedly happened in the United States,
the nun said. A French woman broke several ribs in a car accident,
but her injuries miraculously healed when she wore a Mother Teresa
medallion around her neck.
	   The Roman Catholic Church requires that two miracles attributed
to the candidate be confirmed by the Vatican before
canonization.The canonization process does not usually begin till
five years after the candidate's death.
	   Some old associates of the order say it may evolve as years
pass, with the rigid austerity identified with Mother Teresa
becoming more flexible.
	   ``After some years, it is always possible that they'll want to
modernize certain aspects of their life and work,'' Le Joly said,
noting that Mother Teresa herself ``changed her ways and adapted
the dress and the style of life of the poor Bengali people.''
	   But the philosophy of the old, bent nun who became one of the
best known women on Earth will guide the hundreds of orphanages,
soup kitchens, homeless shelters and clinics she started around the
world.
	   ``The sisters are doing the job they were doing earlier, but the
charisma of Mother Teresa was special,'' said an Italian volunteer
cleaning a young boy's infected legs at one of the order's homes.
	   ``We miss Mother, but life goes on,'' he said.

Police nab three Serbs to be retried for war crimes

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Police arrested three Serbs, who are to
be retried on war crimes charges stemming from the 1991 war between
Croatian forces and Serb rebels, the state-run HINA news agency
reported.
	   The three men, who were only identified as Pero K., 45, Vujo H.,
45, and Zeljko K., 47, were among 19 Serbs, who in 1995 had been
convicted in absentia of killing Croats and sentenced to prison
terms between 11 and 20 years.
	   The 19 are from the village of Sodolovci in the region known as
Eastern Slavonia, which rebel Serbs seized in 1991.
	   When the region reverted to government rule last January, the
group appealed the sentence and was granted a retrial.
	   United Nations officials, who administered the area during the
transition to Croat rule, insisted that the defendants remain free
during the retrials.
	   But the Supreme court recently upheld the local district
attorney's request to have the group detained during the trials.
	   Police issued warrants for the 19 _ eight of whom are believed
to have fled to neighboring Serb-led Yugoslavia _ and then detained
the three Friday evening.
	   Another member of the group, Goran Vusurovic, surrendered
earlier and is currently being retried.
	   International officials based in Croatia, who monitor the
country's treatment of minority Serbs, did not comment on the case
on Saturday.

Mother Teresa's successor comes to terms with challenges

 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ Mother Teresa's successor doesn't have
her own business card for visitors. She hands out Mother Teresa's.
	   ``The fruit of SILENCE is Prayer/The fruit of PRAYER is
Faith/The fruit of FAITH is Love/The fruit of LOVE is service/The
fruit of SERVICE is Peace ... Mother Teresa,'' the card says.
	   It's not easy following the saintly founder of the Missionaries
of Charity order. But Sister Nirmala, the little-known, soft-spoken
nun elected last year to lead the group, is firmly in control.
	   ``This is an awesome responsibility,'' Sister Nirmala said in an
interview. ``... But just trusting in God and his grace for the
present, moment by moment, I could accept'' the burden.
	   ``Difficulties are a part of life. I would not consider them as
difficulties to crush, but challenges to face and to grow,'' she
added, sitting under a large wooden cross in a tiny anteroom at the
order's headquarters.
	   She was born Nirmala Joshi into a family of Brahmins, the
traditional Hindu priestly caste. She was educated by Christian
missionaries in the eastern city of Patna, but remained a Hindu
until age 24, when she heard of Mother Teresa's works and converted
to Roman Catholicism.
	   She was one of the first nuns of her order to head a foreign
mission when she went to Panama. Later, she headed missions in
Europe and the United States.
	   She returned to Calcutta to head the order's Contemplative Wing,
which deals with spiritual matters. Six months before Mother
Teresa's death, she was elected superior-general by a conference of
120 nuns.
	   Friends describe her as humble, simple, yet decisive. ``Sister
Nirmala may look weak and docile, but she is very firm. She is all
there _ just like Mother,'' said Sunita Kumar, a close friend of
Mother Teresa for three decades.

Kohl stresses aid for Russia contingent on further reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany stressed Saturday that Moscow must
continue market reforms before being issued any new credit, and
expressed confidence Russia would not return to a Soviet-style
command economy.
	   Acting Russian Prime Minister was at the same time quoted in a
German newspaper as saying the West should not ``demand the
impossible from Russia'' and that Western help often has come too
late for Russia to avert economic crisis.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in an interview for Sunday's Welt am
Sonntag newspaper that Germany in particular should use its great
influence with Russia to press Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
economic reforms.
	   Kohl said such reforms should take place before the
International Monetary Fund releases more loans; the group is
scheduled to release dlrs 4.3 billion to Russia on Sept. 15.
	   ``They cannot hope that the international community will give
new money, when the IMF conditions are not fulfilled,'' Kohl said
in the interview, released Saturday. ``That goes for German
coffers, too.''
	   Russia's financial meltdown will probably result in ``enormous
difficulties, also in international financial relations,'' Kohl
said, but added that there's no reason for panic in Germany.
	   Chernomyrdin, also in an interview for Welt am Sonntag, said
that Western leaders have shown ``skepticism and passivity'' about
the development of Russia's market economy.
	   ``This skepticism and passivity has often meant that the
necessary support of the Russian reforms came too late,''
Chernomyrdin said.
	   The acting prime minister noted that Germany's postwar economic
miracle occurred over 20 years, and that Russia's market reforms
have been underway only seven years.
	   ``Russia lived for more than 70 years under socialism; that's
three generations,'' he said. ``What we've already achieved is that
the Russian people reject a return to the past, that they connect
their future with the market economy ... Is that a lot or a
little?''
	   German officials expressed confidence in Chernomyrdin's
assurances Saturday that Russia would not return to a Soviet-style
controls of the economy.
	   Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that he ruled out any
possibility that Chernomyrdin ``is a man who will turn back to the
old notions.''
	   Chernomyrdin said Russia needs not only loans but more economic
partnerships, and indicated a broad willingness to work with
European neighbors.
	   Russia should play a role in the European Union's project to
begin creating a continent-wide currency next year, Chernomyrdin
suggested.
	   ``We should work together for the future of our countries, for
the future of Europe,'' Chernomyrdin said.

Tensions rise in Liberian capital after shooting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ West African peacekeeping tanks
patrolled the capital on Saturday a day after a former rebel
fighter was shot dead and others injured by peacekeeping soldiers
outside President Charles Taylor's home.
	   The shooting occurred when supporters of former warlord
Roosevelt Johnson gathered outside Taylor's official residence in a
bid to prevent Johnson from meeting the president.
	   The ex-rebels were insisting that Johnson, who has had icy
relations with the president, would not be safe in Taylor's house,
witnesses said.
	   The meeting had been arranged to discuss a growing rift between
the two, according to government officials.
	   As peacekeepers from the Nigerian-led force known as ECOMOG
moved in to disperse the crowd, one of Johnson's supporters stepped
between his leader and the ECOMOG troops to block his path. He was
shot dead by a peacekeeper, who then sprayed a stream of bullets to
scatter the crowd.
	   An unknown number of people were taken to hospital with bullet
wounds following the incident. Roosevelt was unharmed, witnesses
said.
	   On Saturday morning, a heavy presence of Liberian government
troops and ECOMOG soldiers and tanks patrolled the streets near
Roosevelt's residence and the presidential compound in Monrovia.
Passerbys were searched at roadblocks for weapons and guns,
although Taylor declared on state radio that the situation was
calm.
	   There was no comment from Johnson or his supporters. Johnson
charged last week that ECOMOG had helped disguise Liberian
policemen as peacekeepers in a search of his house.
	   The former warlord has accused Taylor's security forces of
trying to kidnap him on several occasions in recent months.
	   Johnson was Taylor's chief rival in Liberia's seven-year civil
war in which more than 150,000 people died. Relations between the
two have remained tense since Taylor won the presidency in
elections last year.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Police wielding truncheons on Saturday
charged a group of demonstrators protesting the disappearance of
people in police custody, detaining at least 100 and breaking up
the gathering.
	   Hundreds of people, calling themselves ``Saturday Mothers, have
demonstrated weekly for the past three years to draw attention to
the disappearances and their demand that the government account for
the missing.
	   Turkey's Human Rights Foundation said police detained at least
100 people Saturday, including at least 10 foundation officials.
	   Human rights groups say more than 800 people have disappeared
while in the custody of Turkey's security forces.

Myanmar general says people want peace, not disruption
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped `behind' in lead &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ One of Myanmar's ruling generals said
most people have not rallied behind pro-democracy leader Aung San
Suu Kyi because they fear violence, official newspapers reported
Saturday.
	   Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the top four generals of the ruling
junta, again warned that the government would not tolerate
opposition calls for a civilian parliament to convene.
	   ``It is obvious that, apart from the handful of destructive
instigators, the majority of the public want to live in peace and
are scared of the occurrence of any disturbances,'' Khin Nyunt said
in a monthly speech at a refresher course for teachers.
	   ``The obstructionists, with evil intentions, are trying to
disrupt stability and derail the government's development
activities with the aim of gaining popularity and grabbing state
power,'' Khin Nyunt said.
	   A month-long campaign by anti-government groups inside and
outside Myanmar, also known as Burma, marking the 10th anniversary
of a nationwide uprising has failed to ignite popular protests and
the country has remained calm.
	   The uprising in 1988 was crushed by troops, leaving an estimated
3,000 people dead, and fear still runs deep.
	   A protest Monday by 200 university students _ the first in
nearly two years _ has not been repeated. Police have been posted
throughout the city to stop any hit-and-run demonstration from
occurring.
	   Suu Kyi, whose political activities are extremely restricted,
ended a 13-day roadside standoff against authorities Monday, one of
the few forms of protest open to her. She was stopped outside
Yangon while trying to travel to visit provincial supporters.
	   Her party, the National League for Democracy, has demanded that
the government finally convene a parliament elected in 1990 but
prevented from taking office by the military government. The NLD
overwhelmingly won the election.
	   The issue is extremely touchy for the ruling State Peace and
Development Council, which has insisted that a new constitution be
drafted before a civilian parliament can be called.
	   But the government warned the NLD this week that attempts to
undermine a new constitution could result in long prison terms and
the party being declared illegal.
	   Official newspaper commentaries said that Suu Kyi was ``dancing
to the tunes'' of the United States and other critical countries
and that the army could not hand over power to her party.

after 10 kilograms (22 pounds) of pure heroin were found in his car
at the Czech-Austrian border, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The daily Mlada Fronta Dnes said the 45-year-old man, traveling
from the Czech Republic to Austria, was arrested on Thursday at the
border crossing in Dolni Dvoriste after a dog sniffed out the drug
in the tank of his BMW during a routine check.
	   The man, who was not identified in the report, faces up to ten
years in prison.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's opponents appeared Saturday to be
backing off on their demands for an immediate power-sharing
agreement and the interim government said there would be no return
to the Soviet past. Yeltsin vowed unequivocally Friday that he
would not resign, and the government tried to reassure both
Russians and international investors that efforts to build a market
economy would not be abandoned. ``We have already joined the world
economy, and there will be no return to the past,'' acting Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on national television. He
reiterated that he would keep the ruble convertible and guarantee
people's bank savings, and that he would not stop the sale of
dollars and other foreign currencies. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Decaying corpses littered the streets of
Kinshasa's eastern suburbs, where platoons of government troops
searched house after house on Saturday for pockets of rebel
fighters. Fighting in eastern Kinshasa tapered off to little more
than sporadic machine-gun fire, although insurgent forces trying to
oust President Laurent Kabila still held positions outside the
city. ``There are many dead in the area,'' said Health Minister
Jean-Baptist Sondgi. ``It's a terrible scene of bodies here and
there.'' On the city's west side, new fighting broke out overnight
with heavy mortar fire echoing through the area near the Ndangi
forest about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown. ``We could hear
the fighting all night,'' said one resident who left the area and
came to central Kinshasa overnight. The fighting had tapered off by
morning. (CONGO)
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ One of Myanmar's ruling generals said
most people have not rallied to pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu
Kyi because they fear violence, official newspapers reported
Saturday. Lt. Gen. Khin Nyunt, one of the top four generals of the
ruling junta, again warned that the government would not tolerate
opposition calls for a civilian parliament to convene. ``It is
obvious that, apart from the handful of destructive instigators,
the majority of the public want to live in peace and are scared of
the occurrence of any disturbances,'' Khin Nyunt said in a monthly
speech at a refresher course for teachers. ``The obstructionists,
with evil intentions, are trying to disrupt stability and derail
the government's development activities with the aim of gaining
popularity and grabbing state power,'' Khin Nyunt said. (MYANMAR)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Sam Rainsy
promised to lead a new protest march Sunday through Phnom Penh and
invited Cambodians from around the country to join demonstrations
against leader Hun Sen. Sam Rainsy told thousands of protesters in
the sixth day of a sit-in outside the National Assembly to refrain
from violence. The round-the-clock sit-in, with numbers generally
fluctuating from 600 people at night to 10,000 by late afternoon,
has become the focal rallying point against strongman Hun Sen and
his declared victory in parliamentary elections last month. Hun
Sen's government is accusing Sam Rainsy, whose self-named party
finished third in the vote, of fomenting civil unrest. There have
been hints he could be arrested. (CAMBODIA-PROTEST)
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Assailants believed to be part of an
Islamic militant protection racket tortured and slit the throats of
six farmers in western Algeria, hospital officials said Saturday.
The six victims _ four men and two women _ were found dead Friday
afternoon near their farms close to Tipaza, 100 kilometers (62.5
miles) west of Algiers. Locals said the attackers belonged to the
Armed Islamic Group, and were running a protection racket in the
area. (ALGERIA)

Russia to hold military exercises with former Soviet republics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will hold joint military exercises with
Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakstan starting Monday, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The five-day air exercises will take place in the Astrakhan
region of southern Russia, Interfax said Saturday. About 800 airmen
will take part in practicing missile launches and rebuffing air
attacks, it said.
	   Interfax also reported that the NATO-related Sea Breeze-98
exercises involving Ukraine, the United States and nine other
countries will be held in the northern Black Sea from Oct. 25 to
Nov. 4.
	   The troops will practice an international relief and
peacekeeping operation to help a populace hit by an imaginary
earthquake.
	   Last summer, Ukraine played host to U.S. and other nations'
ships in Crimea for Sea Breeze-97. That exercise angered Moscow and
many among the Crimean Peninsula's ethnic Russian majority.
	   Russia pulled out of Sea Breeze-97 but accepted Ukraine's
invitation to participate this year.

Chinese legislature ratifies treasury bond issue
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's legislature, the National People's
Congress, on Saturday approved a 100 billion yuan (U.S. dlrs 12
billion) treasury bond issue to boost economic growth.
	   The long-term bonds will fund construction of infrastructure
projects in an effort to increase domestic demand and help attain
the government's target of 8 percent economic growth for the year,
the official Xinhua News Agency said.
	   In ratifying a bill covering the bond issue, the legislature's
Standing Committee said money should go toward speeding up
infrastructure projects already under construction. It also said
priority should go to projects that boost growth, help anti-flood
efforts and the environment, Xinhua said.

Hong Kong announces new measures to curb market manipulation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead to UPDATE with measures announced by the Futures
Exchange; ADDS byline; TRIMS.
 &UR; By KHARK SINGH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Hong Kong Futures Exchange announced steps
Saturday to curb market manipulation and the government pledged to
keep buying stock to punish speculators and protect the territory's
currency.
	   As part of the anti-risk measures, beginning on Tuesday the
futures exchange will demand a 150 percent margin surcharge on
position-holders who have accumulated more than 10,000 contracts.
	   The exchange said it will also require members on Monday to
report any open accounts holding 250 contracts or more and identify
the position-holder. Previously, the reporting level had been 500
contracts, and position-holders could remain anonymous.
	   The new measures are aimed at cutting the risk that the exchange
could be hurt by a single player holding a large position that goes
bad, said Randy Gilmore, the exchange's chief executive.
	   The exchange wanted to prevent the kind of damage done by Nick
Leeson, a trader for Barings, who bet wrong on Nikkei Index futures
in Singapore and caused the bank to collapse in 1995, Gilmore said.
	   The Hong Kong government could find the exchange's measures
useful in its battle against speculators who are shorting the Hong
Kong dollar and Hang Seng Index futures in a ``double play'' aimed
at straining the local currency's peg to the U.S. dollar.
	   In an address on Radio Hong Kong, Financial Secretary Donald
Tsang said government intervention was necessary to drive off
speculators, whom he said have been manipulating the markets and
attacking the currency peg.
	   ``My colleagues and I have been criticized for ruining the free
market economy,'' he said. ``But do we want to see ... the free
market being manipulated? Do we want Hong Kong to become an
automatic teller machine for international speculators?''
	   Tsang said speculators are still in the market, and could push
the index to below 4,000 points. ``The market cannot operate
normally as long as it is being manipulated.''
	   The government has been scooping up shares recently, trying to
push the stock index up so that speculators who bet the market
would go down could not profit.
	   Tsang had refused to say how much the government has spent, but
analysts estimated it could be up to 100 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 12.8 billion), or about 13 percent of its massive
reserves.
	   On Friday, aggressive government buying pushed trading volume to
a record 79 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 10.1 billion).
Analysts estimate the government spent 71 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 9.1 billion).
	   Still, the stock market closed 1.2 percent lower at 7,829.74
points, but 1,200 points higher than two weeks ago.
	   The government announced after trading was closed Friday that
gross domestic product shrank 5 percent in the second quarter,
officially declaring that Hong Kong had slipped into the first
recession in 13 years.
	   Analysts say investors, having already prepared for the worst,
would unlikely be further deterred by the grim economic data.
	   ``The government is being dragged into something like the
Vietnam War. It's an endless commitment,'' the South China Morning
Post quoted Democratic Party legislator Albert Ho as saying.
	   In a separate interview on Radio Hong Kong, Tsang said the
government would unload shares ``in a very orderly manner over a
long period of time.''
	   He reiterated the government will not unpeg the Hong Kong
currency to the U.S. dollar.

Wallabies beat All Blacks 19-14
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Wallaby fullback Matt Burke made up for
some horror kicking with a dramatic late try as Australia consigned
New Zealand's rugby team to its worst ever losing run Saturday.
	   Burke crossed with seven minutes left to put Australia ahead for
the first time, and the hosts finished with a 19-14 victory.
	   With Australia having already secured the Bledisloe Cup with
wins in Melbourne and Wellington, and South Africa claiming the
tri-nations, there was little on the line bar history Saturday.
	   Australia gained its second-ever 3-0 series clean sweep against
New Zealand, and first since 1929, while the All Blacks were
attempting to avoid five straight losses for the first time.
	   ``That clean sweep means a lot to us, especially coming from
behind,'' said Wallaby captain John Eales who kicked four penalties
and a conversion after replacing Burke as kicker. ``I'm just so
proud.''
	   The weight of history seemed oppressive in a dull first half
punctuated regularly by Irish referee David McHugh and his 20
penalties. The Wallabies had the advantage of 14 of them but
fullback Burke, who scored all of Australia's points in the opening
win, missed three simple shots at goal.
	   Australia was more creative to start but got nailed on the
counter attack. Fly-half Andrew Mehrtens opened the scoring on
eight minutes with a 35-meter drop goal before fullback Christian
Cullen was given a gap and left Burke stranded with a stunning
40-meter run in the 17th. Mehrtens' conversion attempt was charged
down by Wallaby fly-half Stephen Larkham, but the All Black added
another penalty for an 11-0 halftime lead.
	   Australia replaced Burke as kicker after the break as McHugh
obliged with two more penalties in range within five minutes of the
restart. Eales, a reluctant goalkicker, took over and guided
through two penalties to cut the margin to 11-6.
	   Australia was buoyed by Eales' leadership and the game opened
up. The Wallabies appeared to lack zest after a physical hammering
a week earlier against South Africa, and the long flight home from
Johannesburg, while the All Blacks, with debutants Xavier Rush and
Kees Meeuws, were fresh from a week's rest.
	   Winger Jeff Wilson went close to increasing the All Blacks' lead
on 55 minutes when he claimed a chip kick inside Australia's
quarter and spun away from Burke, but opposite Joe Roff gathered
Wilson in and forced an error to prevent a try.
	   McHugh intervened again, playing a New Zealand advantage for an
age before calling a penalty in front of the Australian posts,
allowing Mehrtens to kick the visitors to a 14-6 lead on 64
minutes.
	   McHugh blew another penalty, the 30th, and Eales backed his
luck, scoring from out wide on the left. Another penalty put
Australia on attack and scrum half George Gregan made the decisive
break.
	   His 15-meter run set up Burke for a short dash to the line and
he completed the try in agony as his shoulder buckled under his
dive for the line.
	   Eales completed the comeback by banging over the conversion from
the left of the posts. McHugh's final penalty gave Eales another
penalty and the 40,000 crowd celebrated with a three-minute version
of Waltzing Matilda.
	   Scorers:
	   Australia 19 (Matthew Burke try, John Eales 4 penalty goals, 1
goal) def. New Zealand 14 (Christian Cullen try; Andrew Mehrtens 2
penalty goals, drop goal)
	   Lineups:
	   AUSTRALIA: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Jason Little, Tim Horan, Joe
Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David Wilson,
Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew Blades,

Tasmanian voters oust conservative incumbents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Australian Broadcasting Corp. and local news
agency calling a Labor victory.

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Tasmanian voters on Saturday ousted the
state's conservative government, a bad omen for Prime Minister John
Howard's chances in the national election he must call soon.
	   Howard, who leads the national conservative coalition, is
expected by political analysts to announce a federal election date
on Sunday. The election is expected to take place in early October.
	   With more than 77 percent of the Tasmanian vote counted,
Australian Broadcasting Corp. and the national news agency
Australian Associated Press both predicted victory for the
opposition Labor Party.
	   Labor appeared to have won at least 13 seats in the 25-member
House of Assembly, is favored to win a 14th and has a reasonable
chance of a 15th.
	   The former conservative coalition led by ousted Premier Tony
Rundle are guaranteed 10 seats.
	   The election, fought largely on whether to sell the
Hydro-Electric Corp., the state's biggest asset, means Jim Bacon
will likely form the first majority Labor government for 16 years.
	   The 48-year-old former union leader also gained the biggest
personal vote of any candidate in the state.
	   The Labor Party has pledged to keep the power system; Rundle
vowed to sell it to reduce the economically depressed island
state's debt.
	   Rundle called the early election after his minority government
failed to win Green Party support for privatizing the
Hydro-Electric Corp.
	   The future of the Hydro, which Rundle would privatize so
Tasmania could pay off its 3.2 billion Australian dollars (U.S.
dlrs 18.56 billion) debt and which Bacon would keep because he
argues its income stream would soon outweigh the benefits of sale,
was the overriding issue.
	   Bacon is a former union leader whose early work for the Builders
Laborers' Federation in Victoria state on the mainland has made him
the target of a conservative ``union thugs'' smear campaign.
	   He replies that he's always done his best for whoever he's
representing, and he aims to represent all Tasmania. Moreover, his
factional and divisive union days are far behind him _ the best
evidence being his 187-27 majority when he was elected secretary of
the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council in 1989.

	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Sudan's vice president
concluded a three-country West African diplomatic tour Saturday to
press for African condemnation of a U.S. missile attack last week
on a Sudanese factory.
	   Vice President George Kongor Arop told reporters he hoped to
convince the 53-member pan-African organization to join the Arab
League in roundly condemning the attack and giving political
support to Sudan's government.
	   The Sudanese leader, who labeled the attack an ``imperialist
aggression against those who take independent positions on internal
affairs'' said he believed other African countries also faced being
``targets'' of U.S. attacks.
	   ``Today it is Sudan but tomorrow it could be another country in
Africa,'' he said. ``Imperialists do not only target Sudan. Their
aggression will not only be limited to Sudan.''
	   Burkina Faso's President Blaise Campaore, who is the current OAU
chairman, was out of the country and delegated Foreign Minister
Kadre Desire Ouedraogo to meet the Sudanese leader in his place.
	   Arop earlier visited Chad and Nigeria and was due to return home
later Saturday. Sudan has urged the U.N. Security Council and other
international bodies to address the strikes.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Saturday's qualfying. CHANGES throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ World standings leader Mika
Hakkinen clinched his ninth pole position of the Formula One season
Saturday, holding off teammate David Coulthard while his nearest
challenger for the world title, Michael Schumacher, faltered into
fourth place.
	   The McLaren-Mercedes teammates were involved in a seesaw battle
all through one one-hour qualifying session and left opposition far
behind, making sure Schumacher will be facing a silver McLaren
screen ahead of him on Sunday's starting grid.
	   Former world champion Damon Hill confirmed his surging form,
leading his Jordan-Mugen Honda to third place on the grid, just
ahead of the German.
	   Hakkinen took his ninth pole in 13 races by lapping the
6.968-kilometer (4.329-mile) Spa-Francorchamps circuit in 1 minute
48.682 seconds, just 0.163 seconds ahead of Coulthard. Hill, who
won twice here, was 1.046 seconds slower.
	   Schumacher, who had been fastest in Friday's free practice,
slumped well back, 1.115 seconds slower than his world title rival.
	   Schumacher is going for his fourth straight victory in Belgium.
Hakkinen currently holds a 77-70 edge over Schumacher. With 10
points at stake in the four remaining races, the season is still
wide open.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was fifth and
reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve, shook off the effects
of Friday's bad crash to take sixth place.
	   Ahead of qualifying, the infamous Eau Rouge corner claimed yet
another crash victim after Villeneuve was able to walk away from a
horrific 190-kilometer an hour (180 mph) accident on Friday.
	   Finland's Mika Sala lost control of his Arrows-Yamaha at almost
the exact same uphill spot during morning practice and his car
slammed at high speed into protective tires before spinning four
times on the track and coming to a standstill.
	   Salo immediately got out of the wreck, appeared unhurt and was
back for qualifying later Saturday.

UEFA fights back against Super League threat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ UEFA hit out at the proposed breakaway European
Super League on Saturday by claiming that, if successful, the
breakaway body's backers would turn clubs into soccer's equivalent
of the Harlem Globetrotters.
	   UEFA's governing Executive Committee met in Monaco to discuss
the threat of a breakaway competition.
	   Milan-based marketing company Media Partners is tempting big
clubs to leave existing UEFA competitions, saying that new
pay-per-view TV rights would help boost annual revenues from the
flagship Champions League from dlrs 322 million to dlrs 2 billion.
	   UEFA said that clubs would not accept a private venture, but
said it would set up a new task force to examine the future of
European soccer competitions.
	   ``There have been criticisms regarding the marketing structures
of our competitions,'' said UEFA President Lennart Johansson.
	   ``There have been changes to football, which means there must be
changes to our structure. But European competitions must continue
under the umbrella of UEFA.''
	   At a news conference after the meeting, UEFA sharply criticized
Media Partners as being overly-driven by economic concerns.
	   ``Our competitions must be based on sporting criteria. We do not
support the notion of Harlem Globetrotters-type teams,'' Johansson
said.
	   UEFA said it would never accept a private venture and stressed
that games should continue to be shown on open TV.
	   Johannsen said revenue projections published by Media Partners
are ``fantastic,'' and that the company is embarking on a ``mission
impossible.''
	   UEFA announced a new 14-man task force, due to make initial
recommendations before Christmas, which includes representatives
from five clubs _ Ajax Amsterdam, Bayern Munich, Juventus,
Liverpool, and Marseille.
	   It will be the first time that clubs have ever sat on a UEFA
committee.
	   The task force is intended to speed up decision-making in what
officials concede has traditionally been a slow-moving body.
	   UEFA officials confirmed that next season's Champions League
would almost certainly be repackaged fom six groups of four clubs
to four groups of six.
	   That means more matches, but UEFA said it would not change the
overall distribution of income from the competition.
	   Of the dlrs 322 million generated by the Champions League in
1997-98, only dlrs 157 million went to participating teams.
	   Johanssen said UEFA would consider giving past winners automatic
access to the Champions League, but ruled out inviting 16 clubs to
the competition, as Media Partners plans.
	   Media Parters, UEFA said, is bringing U.S.-style sports finance
techniques that don't apply in Europe.
	   But it warned that ``if clubs make a deal outside UEFA they must
deal with the consequences.''
	   Big clubs being wooed by Media Partners include: Italy's AC
Milan, Inter Milan and Juventus; Spain's Real Madrid and Barcelona;
England's Arsenal and Manchester United; Bayern Munich and Borussia
Dortmund of Germany; France's Paris Saint-Germain and Marseille;
and Ajax Amsterdam of the Netherlands.
	   UEFA invited FIFA to its Executive Committee meeting for the
first time to discuss the threat.
	   ``Some clubs are more privileged than others, but that does not
mean we should forget the social and cultural aspects of the
game,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter told reporters after leaving
the meeting.

Hundreds bring flowers to mark early the anniversary of Diana's
</HEADLINE>
death &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo planned &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hundreds of people laid bouquets at Kensington
Palace, Princess Diana's former home, on Saturday, two days before
the first anniversary of her death _ and newspapers carried a mass
of anniversary articles and pictures.
	   Despite a poll indicating that only 6 percent of Britons plan to
observe the anniversary, dozens of those who left flowers said
they'd come early to avoid the rush on Monday, which is also a
national holiday _ held on the last Monday in August every year and
unrelated to Diana's death.
	   People came to Kensington Palace steadily and bunches of flowers
were once more balanced on the palace railings. But it was a
trickle compared with the hundreds of thousands who turned the area
in a sea of flowers in the week after the 36-year-old princess was
killed in a car crash in Paris.
	   ``Everyone can remember what they were doing a year ago when she
died,'' said 15-year-old Victoria Ivins, who came with a girlfriend
from Reigate, 20 miles (32 kms) south of central London. ``I simply
cried and watched the television for a week.''
	   Rita Young, 51, who brought flowers from her home in Reading, 30
miles (50 kms) west of London, said she still felt just as sad.
``The pain hasn't left my heart.''
	   Newspapers, from tabloids through the higher brow broadsheets,
carried thousands of words both in their news pages and weekend
magazine sections.
	   For weeks, there has been a buildup of pictures of Diana and of
her sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, in glossy
magazines and newspapers.
	   On Saturday, some newspapers also carried pictures of Camilla
Parker Bowles, 51, the longtime love of Prince Charles and the
woman Diana blamed for the breakdown of her marriage which ended in
divorce in 1996.
	   Forty-six percent of Britons still oppose the idea of Charles,
49, marrying the divorced Mrs. Parker Bowles, according to a poll
by National Opinion Poll for a London newspaper, The Express.
	   But that was down from 57 percent disapproval in a similar
survey before Diana's death, The Express reported under the
headline, ``Why Camilla has reasons to cheerful.''
	   The Express did not report the number of people questioned or
give the margin of error _ usually 3 percent _ for this poll.
	   A resounding near 80 percent agreed when asked whether they felt
Diana's memory ``should be left alone'' after this week.
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles now regularly spends nights at St. James's
Palace, Charles' London residence, and Highgrove, his country
house, according to newspaper reports.
	   The Daily Telegraph, a conservative, solidly pro-monarchist
daily, on Friday published the results of a telephone survey by
Gallup which found that 94 percent of the 1,009 people questioned
said they had no plans to mark the anniversary.

Great white shark spotted in Adriatic; alligator loose in Tuscan
</HEADLINE>
lake &QL; 
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ First it was the alligator in the Tuscan lake. Then
came the great white shark in the Adriatic. Italy _ that
vacationers' paradise _ is beginning to resemble ``Wild Kingdom.''
	   Beaches near Ancona on the Adriatic were deserted Saturday after
a great white shark estimated at six meters (18 feet) was spotted
by fisherman Stefano Catalani, who captured the animal attacking
another, smaller shark on film right next to his boat.
	   The dramatic video was shown on state television Friday night,
at the beginning of the last weekend of Italy's summer vacation. On
Saturday, red ``no swimming'' flags were posted on Ancona's
beaches, although blustery weather was mostly to blame.
	   In sun-drenched Tuscany, meanwhile, the saga of ``Salvatore
l'Alligatore'' continued.
	   It all began innocently enough _ a couple taking their pet for a
walk on the cool banks of a little Tuscan lake on a hot summers'
day. But the pet was a razor-toothed reptile which slipped off its
leash _ and into the inviting waters of little Lake Accesa.
	   Nearly three weeks later, the beast is still on the loose.
	   ``Salvatore'' has eluded forest rangers, police officers,
amateur hunters and a military helicopter. So far, only some tracks
_ rather large ones, at that _ have been found.
	   City officials in nearby Grosseto are in despair. They have
appealed for ``Salvatore's'' owners to come forward and lend a hand
in the search, but to no avail.
	   ``All we know is that it was a couple,'' Mini Cucci, a city
official in Grosseto, said Saturday by telephone.
	   Swimming has been banned in the lake since Aug. 10, the day a
German tourist saw the alligator escape its owners, Cucci said.
	   On the Adriatic, local officials were trying to reassure people
about the great white.
	   The shark was spotted Friday about 15 miles (25 kms) off the
coast in very deep water. The great white is an extremely rare
visitor to the Adriatic, wildlife officials told the ANSA news
agency, and an animal of such size wasn't likely to come near the
shore.

Iran to hold military exercises near Afghanistan border
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Some 70,000 elite Iranian soldiers plan to
hold exercises near the border with Afghanistan, where Tehran
claims that the Taliban militia is holding 47 Iranians.
	   The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps will hold the maneuvers,
code named Ashura 3, within the next few days, Maj. Gen. Yahya
Rahim Safavi, the commander of the IRGC, said Saturday.
	   He said preliminary exercises have already started and they will
be followed by the main maneuvers, which will last for three days.
	   The maneuvers will be the largest this year and the first held
near the border since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, he said.
	   Iran has accused the Taliban militia, which controls most of the
country, of detaining 47 Iranians since it captured the northern
city of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8. The detainees include 11
diplomats, one journalist and 35 truck drivers.
	   The Taliban says it knows nothing about the Iranian diplomats,
but it admits to holding some 30 Iranians suspected of arming its
opponents.
	   ``It is natural that our maneuvers are not unrelated to the
recent Afghan affairs,'' Safavi said in a press conference attended
for the first time by foreign as well as local reporters.
	   Last week, IRGC troops were deployed on the border with
Afghanistan to monitor the movement of forces fighting the civil
war there.
	   Also last week, former President Hashemi Rafsanjani warned that
Iran might resort to force to free the Iranians.
	   The guard is an elite paramilitary fighting force of about
120,000 ground, air and navy personnel.
	   Pakistan is widely believed to provide arms and other support to
the Taliban. Iran is suspected of backing the northern-based
opposition to the Taliban.

Islamic court-backed militia claims capture of notorious bandits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Militiamen affiliated with Somalia's
Islamic courts fought a pitched battle with a bandit gang in
lawless south Mogadishu, capturing 13 of them, the court said
Saturday.
	   One civilian was killed and another wounded in the hourlong
clash on Friday, in which witnesses said the two sides fought with
rocket-propelled grenades, antiaircraft guns, heavy machine guns
and assault rifles.
	   A court spokesman said the captured bandits would be tried
according to sharia, or traditional Islamic law. Those arrested
included bandit chieftains responsible for a series of abductions
over the past two years, including those of several aid workers,
the court said.
	   In the absence of central authority in Somalia, Islamic courts
have managed to curtail crime by handing down often brutal and
swift justice, such as cutting off the hands of convicted thieves.
However, banditry and abductions remain common.
	   Friday's raid on the bandit stronghold was apparently touched
off by the slaying of a restaurant owner who was killed when he
asked the bandits to pay their bill, neighbors told reporters.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.

Militants kill 7 construction workers in Indian ambush
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Outlawed guerrillas ambushed a group of
construction workers in India's remote northeast Saturday, killing
seven people and injuring another seven, domestic news agencies
reported.
	   Four workers hired by the state-run Border Roads Organization
were missing in Tripura state bordering Bangladesh, United News of
India reported, but it was not clear if they had been abducted by
the militants.
	   The construction workers were attacked by 25 members of the
outlawed National Liberation Front of Tripura, who had taken
positions on a hill overlooking a road the men were building, the
news agency said. The NLFT wants to carve out a separate province
from the mountainous state.
	   Tripura is 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) east of New Delhi.
	   Six people were killed on the spot and a seriously injured man
died in hospital after the guerrillas armed with sophisticated
weapons sprayed them with bullets, Press Trust of India said.
	   Paramilitary soldiers were combing the dense forest in the area
for the militants and the difficult terrain of the border with
Bangladesh had been sealed, PTI said.
	   The NLFT rebels have been fighting for a separate state for 15
years.
	   India's northeastern states are the scene of dozens of
insurgencies, mostly over local issues.

Reports: German ambassador disputes U.S. claims about Sudan plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's ambassador to Sudan disputes
the United States' contention that the Sudanese pharmaceutical
plant it bombed was involved in producing nerve gas, German media
reports said Saturday.
	   Just hours after U.S. missiles destroyed the El-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. on Aug. 20, Ambassador Werner Daum
sent off a letter to superiors in Bonn disputing the American
justification for the attack, the reports said.
	   Daum wrote that the Khartoum plant produced only medicine such
as antibiotics and anti-malaria pills, and that it did not even
produce any chemical products such as fertilizer or pesticide.
	   ``One can't, even if one wants to, describe the Shifa firm as a
chemical factory,'' Daum wrote in the letter, quoted Saturday by
the newsmagazines Focus and Der Spiegel, and the Welt am Sonntag
newspaper.
	   The Foreign Ministry declined to confirm the contents of the
letter, and said only that ambassadors' reports merely contribute
to the position the ministry takes on an issue.
	   ``Ambassadors' reports do not represent the opinion of the
Foreign Ministry or, for that matter, of the government,'' ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   The German government previously has expressed support for the
U.S. attack.
	   The United States simultaneously attacked the plant and a
suspected terrorist base in eastern Afghanistan in retaliation for
Aug. 7 terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   The United States maintained both sites were linked to an
international terrorist group believed responsible for the embassy
attacks.
	   Sudan has insisted the El-Shifa plant made only medicine, but
the Clinton administration said the plant was developing a key
ingredient in deadly VX nerve gas.
	   Under pressure to justify the attack, the Clinton administration
allowed U.S. intelligence officials to speak this week to reporters
about evidence to back its claim. The officials said a soil sample
from near the plant showed traces of a chemical with no commercial
uses but which is a key ingredient in VX.
	   According to the German reports, Daum wrote that the El-Shifa
company imported raw materials from Europe and China, and that
nothing about the company's business was kept secret, Daum wrote.
	   ``Numerous pharmacists, their representatives and others visited
the company on a daily basis,'' Daum wrote.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Burning an American flag and
shouting ``Death to America,'' about 500 Muslim protestors on
Saturday marched on the United States consulate here.
	   The protest by Muslims Againt Global Oppression came four days
after a caller to a local radio station claimed responsibility on
behalf of the group for the bombing of a Planet Hollywood
restaurant that killed one person and injured 27. The group later
denied carrying out the attack.
	   Winding through city center streets packed with weekend
shoppers, the marchers were watched by scores of heavily-armed
policemen bearing shotguns and pistols.
	   Standing in an open-top truck one of the organization's leaders,
Mickaeel Collier, shouted ``Death to Israel! Death to America!
Death to Clinton!'' The mixed crowd of men and women, many wearing
traditional Islamic dress, replied: ``Allahu Akbar,'' meaning,
``God is Great.''
	   The office block housing the American consulate was ringed by
razor wire barricades and protected by a line of police armored
vehicles.
	   American, Israeli and French flags were strung across the wire
and set alight as another of the group's leaders, Moain Achmad,
read out a statement condemning American cruise missile attacks on
suspected terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanisatn.
	   Religious tensions in the city have been running high since the
Planet Hollywood bombing and subsequent arrest of three members of
a Muslim-dominated anti-crime group. After being questioned about
the attack, the three were all released on Friday without charge.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the two sides trading
accusations of atrocities, Serbian police said Saturday they had
discovered a crematory where Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels had
allegedly burned the bodies of at least 22 two Serb civilians.
	   The police statement, carried by the official Tanjug news
agency, said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians previously killed by the rebels, was found in the village
of Klecka, recently retaken by government forces.
	   On Friday, Serb forensic workers had retrieved the bones of 10
Serb civilians, two of them children, who officials said were
executed by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The workers retrieved skulls and other charred human bones like
a pelvis and part of a backbone with bits of singed clothing on it.
	   KLA rebels are fighting to win independence for Kosovo, a
Serbian province where 90 percent of the population are ethnic
Albanians most of whom want to secede from Serbia.
	   Also Friday, the Albanian side in the conflict blamed the Serbs
of killing 17 people in the same region. U.N. officials said they
saw there eight bodies, including an infant and a 4-year-old boy
who had been decapitated during Serb shelling.
	   The latest Serb statement comes amid a series of mutual
allegations of atrocities in six months of fighting that has killed
hundreds on either side and made more than 260,000 people homeless.
	   The alleged crematory was found following testimonies of two
captured rebel fighters, Ljup and Bekim Mazreku, who told police
that in July alone, 22 Serbs as well as some Albanians loyal to
Serbian authorities were killed. It was not clear if the Albanians
were also cremated.
	   Serbian police and Yugoslav army troops have purged KLA fighters
from much of at least 30 percent of Kosovo territory the rebels
controlled at one point.
	   However, violent clashes continue, and the Serb-run Media Center
in Pristina, the Kosovo capital, said that seven ``terrorists''
were killed Saturday morning in a shootout with police in Klina,
western Kosovo.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   After a string of defeats at the hands of government forces, the
KLA appealed to ethnic Albanians to unite and join rebel ranks.
	   In an appeal published Saturday in an Albanian-language paper in
Pristina, the KLA urged all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo to join the
rebellion.
	   ``Like never before, it is high time that we all become KLA
soldiers,'' the KLA statement said, adding that ``the KLA continues
to reorganize and modernize, adapting to the state of war in
Kosovo.''
	   The rebels also urged an end to rifts within the Kosovo Albanian
camp. The KLA and its supporters are opposed to pacifist Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova, who enjoys Western support and is the
preferred negotiator in any future peace talks with the Serbian
government.
	   U.S. diplomats have been trying to set up face-to-face talks
between the Albanians and the Serbian government to discuss the
future of the province. The Americans and Europeans want Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to restore the autonomy he withdrew in
1989.
	   In Belgrade, a U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft on
Friday warned of a humanitarian catastrophe unless the fight ceases
and refugees return to their homes within the next six weeks.
	   After that, Taft said, the advent of winter will bring suffering
and death to tens of thousands of people. Taft said she would ask
President Clinton for emergency aid to prevent a disaster. Refugees
were already suffering from unusually cold, rainy weather.
	   Taft said it was ``absolutely critical that the (Yugoslav)
government considers this an emergency and waves restrictions...
for relief workers, getting commodities in and providing for a
reduced military presence.''

<TEXT>
	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
met with Sultan Qaboos on Saturday as part of a visit aimed at
boosting relations, the official Oman News Agency reported.
	   Vajpayee met with Qaboos in Salala, Oman's summer capital, and
the two discussed political and economic issues, including the
stalled Middle East peace process and the recent nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan.
	   The two leaders also held talks on cooperation in the fields of
oil, gas and fertilizers, the state-run agency said.
	   They also discussed the employment of Indians in Oman, officials
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Since a crackdown on illegal workers was launched at the
beginning of this year, more than 15,000 Indians have been
deported.
	   There are more than 200,000 Indians working in Oman, a small
country on the southeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula.
	   Earlier this year, Oman and India agreed to set up a fertilizer
plant in Oman at a cost of dlrs 1.1 billion.

Rioting hits Indonesian town for a second day

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 5th graf with mob looting rice mill in separate
incident. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs burned a warehouse Saturday on
the second day of rioting in a coastal town where thousands of
fishermen attacked Chinese-owned cars and houses, newspapers
reported. At least 33 people were arrested.
	   The violence in the Java island town of Cilacap had dwindled by
the afternoon. Security forces patrolled past shops and
restaurants, shuttered by their owners for fear of more unrest.
	   On Friday, hundreds of police and soldiers were unable to
prevent the mob rampaging until late in the evening, The Jakarta
Post reported. The rioters were angry over low wages and alleged
corruption.
	   Rioters torched a shrimp warehouse on Saturday morning, reported
the Suara Pembaruan, a daily newspaper.
	   In a separate incident, hundreds of people looted a rice mill
Saturday in the eastern Java town of Situbondo, the official Antara
news agency reported. There were no reports of arrests or injured.
	   There have been a string of riots this week around Indonesia,
which is suffering economic turmoil that has stripped millions of
their jobs and pushed up prices.
	   The ethnic Chinese minority dominates the economy and has often
been blamed for the crisis. Chinese-owned property was targeted in
more widespread violence that led to the downfall in May of former
President Suharto after 32 years of autocratic rule.
	   Authorities arrested 33 people but there were no reports of
injuries in Cilacap, 435 kilometers (270 miles) east of Jakarta,
the capital.
	   The rioting began when the fishermen burned at least 10 trawlers
moored in the fishing port near the town, the Post reported. They
then moved into Cilacap, burning and damaging four cars, 10
motorcycles and 20 houses belonging to ethnic Chinese.
	   Soldiers blocked thoroughfares but were outnumbered and had to
call for backup from neighboring towns.
	   The crews of the fishing boats said they were exploited by their
employers and had not received a pay raise in six years. The
fishermen are paid 2,000 rupiah (18 U.S. cents) a day, a salary
below the minimum wage, the Post quoted Cilacap police chief Col.
Andi Lolo as saying.
	   The protesters also complained that port officials extorted
money from them.
	   Under Indonesia's new president, B.J. Habibie, the government
has pledged to curb corruption and is instituting democratic
reforms. General elections are scheduled next year.

Islamic court-backed militia claims capture of notorious bandits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Militiamen affiliated with Somalia's
Islamic courts fought a pitched battle with a bandit gang in
lawless south Mogadishu, capturing 13 of them, the court said
Saturday.
	   One civilian was killed and another wounded in the hourlong
clash on Friday, in which witnesses said the two sides fought with
rocket-propelled grenades, antiaircraft guns, heavy machine guns
and assault rifles.
	   A court spokesman said the captured bandits would be tried
according to sharia, or traditional Islamic law. Those arrested
included bandit chieftains responsible for a series of abductions
over the past two years, including those of several aid workers,
the court said.
	   In the absence of central authority in Somalia, Islamic courts
have managed to curtail crime by handing down often brutal and
swift justice, such as cutting off the hands of convicted thieves.
However, banditry and abductions remain common.
	   Friday's raid on the bandit stronghold was apparently touched
off by the slaying of a restaurant owner who was killed when he
asked the bandits to pay their bill, neighbors told reporters.
	   Somalia has had no central government since the 1991 ouster of
the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre.

Jayasuriya sets the pace with an unbeaten 113
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sanath Jayasuriya hammered a brilliant century, an
unbeaten 113, and led a Sri Lankan run-charge in the one-off test
against England at the Oval Saturday.
	   After England had occupied the crease for over 10 hours to score
445 in its first innings, Sri Lanka raced to 192 for two at lunch
on the third day after resuming on 79 for one.
	   Sri Lanka is still 54 runs short of making England bat again.
	   Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka's most prized batsman since the country's
1996 World Cup success, took just 124 balls to reach his fifth
century in his 38th appearence.
	   England got an early breakthrough, removing Jayasuriya's
overnight partner Mahela Jayawardene in the sixth over of the
morning. Jayawardene miscued a drive and Ben Hollioake took a well
judged catch at gully off medium paceman Angus Fraser.
	   It wasn't sufficient to stop the punishing left hander as he
carved out boundaries off Darren Gough, Fraser and Dominic Cork as
he reached his first century in 18 innings.
	   His last century, 199, was scored against India in Colombo in
August 1997 following his 340 against the same opponents in the
previous test.
	   Aravinda de Silva, who became the first Sri Lankan to score
5,000 runs when on 23, kept up with Jayasuriya contributing an
unbeaten 47 runs as the pair shared 107 runs for the third wicket
in just 98 minutes.
	   De Silva, the 74-test veteran, struck three fours off his first
eight deliveries, and soon settled down to play second fiddle to
Jayasuriya in the record stand against England. He has hit seven
fours off 57 balls.
	   Jayasuriya, on 60 at the fall of Jayawardene's wicket, hit
majority of his 18 boundaries through the strong off side field.

Wallabies beat All Blacks 19-14
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS quotes; details &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Wallaby fullback Matt Burke made up for
some horror kicking with a dramatic late try as Australia consigned
New Zealand's rugby team to its worst ever losing run Saturday.
	   Burke crossed with seven minutes left to put Australia ahead for
the first time, and the hosts finished with a 19-14 victory. Burke
screamed in agony as he placed the ball, dislocating his right
shoulder in a dive for the line.
	   With Australia having already secured the Bledisloe Cup with
wins in Melbourne and Christchurch, and South Africa claiming the
tri-nations, there was little on the line bar history Saturday.
	   Australia gained its second-ever 3-0 series clean sweep against
New Zealand, and first since 1929, while the All Blacks were
attempting to avoid five straight losses for the first time.
	   ``That clean sweep means a lot to us, especially coming from
behind,'' said Wallaby captain John Eales who kicked four penalties
and a conversion after replacing Burke as kicker. ``I'm just so
proud.''
	   The weight of history seemed oppressive in a dull first half
punctuated regularly by Irish referee David McHugh and his 20
penalties. The Wallabies had the advantage of 14 of them but
fullback Burke, who scored all of Australia's points in the opening
win, missed three simple shots at goal.
	   Australia was more creative to start but got nailed on the
counter attack. Fly-half Andrew Mehrtens opened the scoring on
eight minutes with a 35-meter drop goal before fullback Christian
Cullen was given a gap and left Burke stranded with a stunning
40-meter run in the 17th. Mehrtens' conversion attempt was charged
down by Wallaby fly-half Stephen Larkham, but the All Black pivot
added another penalty for an 11-0 halftime lead.
	   Australia replaced Burke as kicker after the break as McHugh
obliged with two more penalties in range within five minutes of the
restart. Eales, a reluctant goalkicker, took over and guided
through two penalties to cut the margin to 11-6.
	   Australia was buoyed by Eales' leadership and the game opened
up. The Wallabies appeared to lack zest after a physical hammering
a week earlier against South Africa, and the long flight home from
Johannesburg, while the All Blacks, with debutants Xavier Rush and
Kees Meeuws, were fresh from a week's rest.
	   Winger Jeff Wilson went close to increasing the All Blacks' lead
on 55 minutes when he claimed a chip kick inside Australia's
quarter and spun away from Burke, but opposite Joe Roff gathered
Wilson in and forced an error to prevent a try.
	   McHugh intervened again, playing a New Zealand advantage for an
age before calling a penalty in front of the Australian posts,
allowing Mehrtens to kick the visitors to a 14-6 lead on 64
minutes.
	   McHugh blew another penalty, the 30th, and Eales backed his
luck, scoring from out wide on the left. Another penalty put
Australia on attack and scrum half George Gregan made the decisive
break.
	   His 15-meter run set up Burke for a short dash to the line.
	   Eales completed the comeback by banging over the conversion from
the left of the posts. McHugh's final penalty gave Eales another
penalty and the 40,000 crowd celebrated with a three-minute version
of Waltzing Matilda.
	   ``It's been a hard year and a hard last few weeks,'' said All
Blacks coach John Hart.
	   Hart is likely to come under pressure to keep his job ahead of
next year's World Cup.
	   ``I'm looking forward to the World Cup,'' Hart said. ``We have
got some hard work to do, but the nucleus is there.''
	   Scorers:
	   Australia 19 (Matthew Burke try, John Eales 4 penalty goals, 1
goal) def. New Zealand 14 (Christian Cullen try; Andrew Mehrtens 2
penalty goals, drop goal)
	   Lineups:
	   AUSTRALIA: Matthew Burke, Ben Tune, Jason Little, Tim Horan, Joe
Roff, Stephen Larkham, George Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David Wilson,
Matt Cockbain, John Eales (captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew Blades,

Smith, Nathan Grey, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Glenn Panoho,

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The International Finance Corporation has
decided to raise Lebanon's credit allowance from 1.5 percent to 3
percent, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The director of the bank's north Africa and Middle East
department, Mohsen al-Khalil, said the move would enable the
private sector to draw on IFC's credit resources, which are
estimated to run to more than dlrs 3 billion, the As-Safir daily
said.
	   The IFC is the private-sector division of the World Bank.
	   The credit risks are to be shared by the IFC and Lebanese
commercial banks, the daily said.
	   The World Bank plans to open a regional office in Beirut to
speed up the processing of loans to Lebanon.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The Civil Aviation Authority will soon
charge fees for transit passengers and aircraft landing at Jordan's
three airports, a CAA official said Saturday.
	   Fees could bring in an estimated 3.5 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 4.9 million) a year in revenue, which would be used for
improving airport facilities and services, the official said on
condition of anonymity.
	   He said the fee proposal is to be presented to the Cabinet for
approval.
	   The official declined to give an indication of the fees, but
transit passengers are expected to be charged about dlrs 14 _ the
current airport departure tax charged to non-Jordanians.
	   When the fees are introduced, landing fees for planes carrying
tourists to the Red Sea resort of Aqaba will drop 50 percent, the
official said.
	   ``Small aircraft stand to benefit from the new regulations as
their landing fees will be reduced to 30 dinars (dlrs 42) to
encourage tourism to Jordan,'' the official added.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The state-run Jordan Petroleum Refinery Co.
said Saturday its revenues increased 3.3 percent to 265.7 million
dinars (dlrs 374.2 million) in the first half of 1998.
	   A company official attributed the rise to increased local
demand.
	   Jordan imports its daily requirement of 87,000 barrels of fuel
and crude oil from neighboring Iraq under a special arrangement
approved by the United Nations. The world body has maintained
sanctions on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The refinery, the only one in Jordan, also produces gas
containers, oil tankers and asphalt.

million dinars (dlrs 78.43 million) in profit in fiscal 1997-98,
the highest in its 41-year history, the newspaper Al-Qabas reported
Saturday.
	   Abdullah al-Roumi, managing director of the company, told the
daily the profits were almost double those of the previous year.
Kuwait's fiscal year starts July 1.
	   The gains were due to increased operations, the official said.
KOTC transported more than 25 million metric tons (27.5 million
short tons) of crude, natural gas and products in 1997-98, up 11
percent from the year before.
	   The company transports Kuwait's crude, natural gas and refined
products with its fleet of 32 tankers.

Former Romanian dictator's old wines will be auctioned off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Some 1,200 bottles of wine, champagne
and cognac, which belonged to the family of late Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, will be auctioned off this fall, a government
official said Saturday.
	   The spirits will go under the hammer alongside Ceausescu's cars,
boats and other property.
	   Most of the wines come from Romanian vineyards or were given to
Ceausescu by other Communist leaders. The oldest two bottles from
Tirnave vineyard, 300 kilometers (187 miles) north of Bucharest,
date back to 1918, Mihai Nica, a government spokesman said by
telephone.
	   Every bottle is sealed with a golden ribbon, with an attached
card saying, ``Ceausescu's family residence''.
	   In 1990, after the Romanian revolution, some 3,000 bottles of
spirits were found in Ceausescu's villa in Bucharest. 1,800 were
sold the following year, and the money was given to a hospital.

Portugal deports Moldovan immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal sent more than 100 illegal
Moldovan immigrants back to the former Soviet republic on Saturday,
news reports said.
	   A jet was charted to fly the immigrants to the Moldovan capital
of Kishinev, the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported. The report
said the immigrants had been working illegally in Portugal,
	   No official confirmation was immediately available.
	   Timoteo Macedo, a Portuguese anti-racism activist, criticized
the Portuguese government's action, Lusa said.
	   ``Collective expatriation is a violation of the European Human
Rights Convention,'' Lusa quoted Macedo as saying.
	   Earlier this month, the Foreign Service found 122 illegal
Moldovan immigrants and was investigating two people for allegedly
importing illegal labor from the eastern European country, Lusa
reported.
	   Illegal foreign workers are often employed in the construction
industry in Portugal, which is a member of the Schengen treaty _
the western European zone which does not require border checks for
travelers and employs joint law enforcement.

Kohl stresses aid for Russia contingent on further reforms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Restores first reference to Viktor Chernomyrdin in 2nd graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By IAN MADER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany stressed Saturday that Moscow
must continue market reforms before being issued any new credit,
and expressed confidence Russia would not return to a Soviet-style
command economy.
	   Acting Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin was at the
same time quoted in a German newspaper as saying the West should
not ``demand the impossible from Russia'' and that Western help
often has come too late for Russia to avert economic crisis.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in an interview for Sunday's Welt am
Sonntag newspaper that Germany in particular should use its great
influence with Russia to press Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
economic reforms.
	   Kohl said such reforms should take place before the
International Monetary Fund releases more loans; the group is
scheduled to release dlrs 4.3 billion to Russia on Sept. 15.
	   ``They cannot hope that the international community will give
new money, when the IMF conditions are not fulfilled,'' Kohl said
in the interview, released Saturday. ``That goes for German
coffers, too.''
	   Russia's financial meltdown will probably result in ``enormous
difficulties, also in international financial relations,'' Kohl
said, but added that there's no reason for panic in Germany.
	   Chernomyrdin, also in an interview for Welt am Sonntag, said
that Western leaders have shown ``skepticism and passivity'' about
the development of Russia's market economy.
	   ``This skepticism and passivity has often meant that the
necessary support of the Russian reforms came too late,''
Chernomyrdin said.
	   The acting prime minister noted that Germany's postwar economic
miracle occurred over 20 years, and that Russia's market reforms
have been underway only seven years.
	   ``Russia lived for more than 70 years under socialism; that's
three generations,'' he said. ``What we've already achieved is that
the Russian people reject a return to the past, that they connect
their future with the market economy ... Is that a lot or a
little?''
	   German officials expressed confidence in Chernomyrdin's
assurances Saturday that Russia would not return to a Soviet-style
controls of the economy.
	   Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that he ruled out any
possibility that Chernomyrdin ``is a man who will turn back to the
old notions.''
	   Chernomyrdin said Russia needs not only loans but more economic
partnerships, and indicated a broad willingness to work with
European neighbors.
	   Russia should play a role in the European Union's project to
begin creating a continent-wide currency next year, Chernomyrdin
suggested.
	   ``We should work together for the future of our countries, for
the future of Europe,'' Chernomyrdin said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Hiroshima Carp blanked the Central League
frontrunning Yokohama Baystars 7-0 Saturday at Yokohama Stadium.
	   Carp hurler Shinichi Kato went the distance to pick up his first
shutout victory in two years and improve to 6-4.
	   BayStars pitcher Pat Mahomes' first start in three months was
spoiled as he was tagged for seven runs and ten hits before leaving
the mound in the fifth. Mahomes played previously with the Boston
Red Sox.
	   At Nagoya Dome, Eric Anthony blasted a tie-breaking grand slam
in the ninth to lead the Yakult Swallows to a 10-6 win over the
second place Chunichi Dragons, who remained 1 1/2 games behind the
BayStars.
	   Anthony, who joined the Swallows midseason from the Los Angeles
Dodgers farm system, also hit a two-run double in the third.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Daisuke Motoki cracked a solo homer in the fifth
and batted in a tie-breaking run in the seventh as the Yomiuri
Giants edged the Hanshin Tigers 4-3.
	   In the Pacific League, Brian Williams gave up two hits and no
runs over six innings as the Daiei Hawks blanked the league-leading
Nippon Ham Fighters 3-0 at Fukuoka Dome.
	   Williams, formerly with the Baltimore Orioles, improved to 4-4.
	   At Kobe, the Orix BlueWave beat the second place Kintetsu
Buffaloes 4-1. Orix hurler Hiroshi Kobayashi gave up four hits and
one run over eight innings to pick up his seventh win of the season
against eight losses.
	   Kintetsu starter Rob Mattson, formerly in the Mexican leagues,
went the distance, but took the loss and fell to 6-4.
	   The scheduled game between the Seibu Lions and the Lotte Marines
was postponed due to rain.

Hundreds bring flowers to mark early the anniversary of Diana's

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Hundreds of people laid bouquets at Kensington
Palace, Princess Diana's former home, on Saturday, two days before
the first anniversary of her death _ and newspapers carried a mass
of anniversary articles and pictures.
	   Despite a poll indicating that only 6 percent of Britons plan to
observe the anniversary, dozens of those who left flowers said
they'd come early to avoid the rush on Monday, which is also a
national holiday _ held on the last Monday in August every year and
unrelated to Diana's death.
	   People came to Kensington Palace steadily and bunches of flowers
were once more balanced on the palace railings. But it was a
trickle compared with the hundreds of thousands who turned the area
in a sea of flowers in the week after the 36-year-old princess was
killed in a car crash in Paris.
	   ``Everyone can remember what they were doing a year ago when she
died,'' said 15-year-old Victoria Ivins, who came with a girlfriend
from Reigate, 20 miles (32 kms) south of central London. ``I simply
cried and watched the television for a week.''
	   Rita Young, 51, who brought flowers from her home in Reading, 30
miles (50 kms) west of London, said she still felt just as sad.
``The pain hasn't left my heart.''
	   Newspapers, from tabloids through the higher brow broadsheets,
carried thousands of words both in their news pages and weekend
magazine sections.
	   For weeks, there has been a buildup of pictures of Diana and of
her sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, in glossy
magazines and newspapers.
	   On Saturday, some newspapers also carried pictures of Camilla
Parker Bowles, 51, the longtime love of Prince Charles and the
woman Diana blamed for the breakdown of her marriage which ended in
divorce in 1996.
	   Forty-six percent of Britons still oppose the idea of Charles,
49, marrying the divorced Mrs. Parker Bowles, according to a poll
by National Opinion Poll for a London newspaper, The Express.
	   But that was down from 57 percent disapproval in a similar
survey before Diana's death, The Express reported under the
headline, ``Why Camilla has reasons to be cheerful.''
	   The Express did not report the number of people questioned or
give the margin of error _ usually 3 percent _ for this poll.
	   A resounding near 80 percent agreed when asked whether they felt
Diana's memory ``should be left alone'' after this week.
	   Mrs. Parker Bowles now regularly spends nights at St. James's
Palace, Charles' London residence, and Highgrove, his country
house, according to newspaper reports.
	   The Daily Telegraph, a conservative, solidly pro-monarchist
daily, on Friday published the results of a telephone survey by
Gallup which found that 94 percent of the 1,009 people questioned
said they had no plans to mark the anniversary.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Emboldened by an unprecedented
week-long protest by thousands against strongman Hun Sen,
Cambodia's opposition leaders appealed to the nation Saturday to
drive him from power.

people, part of a crowd that has been encamped in a park before the
National Assembly since Monday demanding Hun Sen step down and his
declared victory in parliamentary elections be overturned.
	   They vowed to hold an opposition rally in the city's main sports
stadium followed by a march through the streets for the second
Sunday in a row, deepening political tension that the July 26
elections were supposed to resolve.
	   ``In the past, when we talked about democracy in Cambodia, we
only talked about it on paper,'' Ranariddh told the crowd. ``But
now people of Cambodia are very courageously bringing real
democracy to the country.''
	   The round-the-clock sit-in, with numbers generally fluctuating
from 600 people at night to 10,000 by late afternoon, has become
the rallying point against Hun Sen, whom the opposition has accused
of massive fraud in last month's elections.
	   ``Someone told us we can't overthrow Hun Sen, but we can do
anything with the will of the people,'' Ranariddh said. ``Do the
people want Hun Sen to continue?''
	   ``No!'' the crowd yelled back.
	   Cambodia has not seen such a determined protest in recent
memory. The protesters have dubbed the park ``Democracy Square''
and set up home under tents and umbrellas, enduring rain and
scorching sun as well as the fear they will be violently removed.
	   The park was the site of a grenade attack last year against a
rally Sam Rainsy was leading. At least 16 people died and more than
100 were wounded, including Sam Rainsy. Hun Sen has been widely
blamed for the attack, but vehemently denies it.
	   The Interior Ministry on Saturday accused Sam Rainsy of
persuading two men to falsely accuse Hun Sen's bodyguards of the
carnage.
	   Earlier, Sam Rainsy told the crowd that ``our struggle must
continue, but we must avoid using violence.''
	   The government is accusing Sam Rainsy of fomenting civil unrest.
There have been hints he could be arrested.
	   The atmosphere has been festive, though the rhetoric has
occasionally been chilling, with large, violent cartoons depicting
Hun Sen being killed or dying dotting the park.
	   The Hun Sen-controlled electoral commission has called
opposition complaints of hundreds of voting and counting
irregularities ``baseless.''
	   The case is now at the country's highest appeals body, the
Constitutional Council, made up largely of members of Hun Sen's
ruling Cambodian People's Party. It is to make a ruling by
Wednesday.
	   The elections were held a year after Hun Sen deposed his
co-prime minister, Ranariddh, in a bloody coup. Hun Sen was hoping
to regain international legitimacy and aid, but political stability
has remained elusive since the vote.
	   Ranariddh, whose party came in second, and Sam Rainsy, whose
party finished third, have refused to recognize the election result
that gave Hun Sen's party a slight majority in the assembly.
	   Their refusal to join a coalition means Hun Sen cannot muster
the necessary two-thirds majority of the 122 seats required to form
a government. The new assembly is scheduled to meet for the first
time Sept. 24.

	   SPA-FRANCORCHAMPS, Belgium (AP) _ World standings leader Mika
Hakkinen clinched pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix Saturday
and easily held off title challenger Michael Schumacher, who
slumped to fourth place on the grid.
	   Hakkinen and teammate David Coulthard were involved in a seesaw
battle all through one one-hour qualifying session and made sure
Schumacher will be facing a silver McLaren-Mercedes screen on
Sunday's starting grid.
	   Former world champion Damon Hill confirmed his surging form,
leading his Jordan-Mugen Honda to third place on the grid, just
ahead of the German.
	   Hakkinen took his ninth pole in 13 races by lapping the
6.968-kilometer (4.329-mile) Spa-Francorchamps circuit in 1 minute
48.682 seconds, just 0.163 seconds ahead of Coulthard. Hill, who
has won twice here, was 1.046 seconds slower.
	   Schumacher, who had been fastest in Friday's free practice, was
well back, 1.345 seconds slower than his world title rival.
	   The first four spots were decided during the last minute of the
session, with Hakkinen coming back from behind to set the top time.
	   ``It was an unbelievable session,'' said Hakkinen. ``Great
stuff. It shows the potential of the car,'' he said, adding he was
``surprised at the gap we are holding.''
	   Especially over Schumacher, who has won here the last three
years and is seeking his fifth Belgian Grand Prix title here Sunday
to coincide with Ferrari's 600th race.
	   The German also badly needs the 10 points at stake if he is to
keep his challenge going. After Belgium, only three Grand Prix are
left on the calendar. Hakkinen currently holds a 77-70 edge over
Schumacher.
	   ``I'm not too happy since we are over one second off pole,''
Schumacher said. ``I hope we can do better in the race.''
	   Pole position is not all-important at the Belgian Grand Prix
since the challenging circuit cutting through the dense forest of
the Ardennes hills offers ample space and time for overtaking.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was fifth Saturday
and reigning world champion Jacques Villeneuve, shook off the
effects of Friday's crash to take sixth place.
	   Ahead of qualifying, the infamous Eau Rouge corner claimed yet
another crash victim after Villeneuve was able to walk away from a
190-kilometer an hour (180 mph) accident on Friday.
	   Finland's Mika Sala lost control of his Arrows-Yamaha at almost
the exact same uphill spot during morning practice. His car slammed
at high speed into protective tires before spinning four times on
the track and coming to a standstill.
	   Salo immediately got out of the wreck, was unhurt and returned
for qualifying.
	   Security at the circuit was beefed up after two separate letters
were received threatening to sabotage the Grand Prix and
Schumacher's car.
	   On Sunday, Schumacher will have to worry first and foremost
about the McLaren cars. After a mediocre performance two weeks ago
in Hungary, where Schumacher won, Hakkinen is bent on bouncing back
in a big way.

Reports: German ambassador disputes U.S. claims about Sudan plant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts 7th graf ``The German ...'' to tighten. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's ambassador to Sudan disputes
the United States' contention that the Sudanese pharmaceutical
plant it bombed was involved in producing nerve gas, German media
reports said Saturday.
	   Just hours after U.S. missiles destroyed the El-Shifa
Pharmaceutical Industries Co. on Aug. 20, Ambassador Werner Daum
sent off a letter to superiors in Bonn disputing the American
justification for the attack, the reports said.
	   Daum wrote that the Khartoum plant produced only medicine such
as antibiotics and anti-malaria pills, and that it did not even
produce any chemical products such as fertilizer or pesticide.
	   ``One can't, even if one wants to, describe the Shifa firm as a
chemical factory,'' Daum wrote in the letter, quoted Saturday by
the newsmagazines Focus and Der Spiegel, and the Welt am Sonntag
newspaper.
	   The Foreign Ministry declined to confirm the contents of the
letter, and said only that ambassadors' reports merely contribute
to the position the ministry takes on an issue.
	   ``Ambassadors' reports do not represent the opinion of the
Foreign Ministry or, for that matter, of the government,'' ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said.
	   The German government endorsed the U.S. attack.
	   The United States simultaneously attacked the plant and a
suspected terrorist base in eastern Afghanistan in retaliation for
Aug. 7 terrorist attacks on U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   The United States maintained both sites were linked to an
international terrorist group believed responsible for the embassy
attacks.
	   Sudan has insisted the El-Shifa plant made only medicine, but
the Clinton administration said the plant was developing a key
ingredient in deadly VX nerve gas.
	   Under pressure to justify the attack, the Clinton administration
allowed U.S. intelligence officials to speak this week to reporters
about evidence to back its claim. The officials said a soil sample
from near the plant showed traces of a chemical with no commercial
uses but which is a key ingredient in VX.
	   According to the German reports, Daum wrote that the El-Shifa
company imported raw materials from Europe and China, and that
nothing about the company's business was kept secret, Daum wrote.
	   ``Numerous pharmacists, their representatives and others visited
the company on a daily basis,'' Daum wrote.

Prime minister visits area devastated by storm flooding

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Saturday
inspected areas devastated by flooding brought on by an approaching
typhoon, stopping by a home for the handicapped where five people
were killed by a mudslide.
	   Heavy rains that began earlier in the week continued in Tokyo
and nearby areas in eastern Japan, causing rivers to swell and
flooding thousands of homes.
	   In Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido, a 12-year-old
boy drowned while playing in a flooded river in Sapporo, 829
kilometers (518 miles) northwest of Tokyo.
	   The drowning brought the death toll in the heavy downpour
brought on by Typhoon Rex to at least 14 since Thursday. Police
said 32 people have injured nationwide as of early Saturday.
	   Search efforts continued Saturday for three people still missing
after a river burst its banks Thursday in Tochigi Prefecture 100
kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo.
	   Nearly 8,000 homes have been flooded, destroyed or partly
destroyed, police said. Mudslides totaled 575, while 19 bridges
have been swept away, they said.
	   Kyodo News reported that hundreds of train runs have been
cancelled in Hokkaido, stranding more than 10,000 people.
	   Thousands of people have been evacuated throughout the
disaster-struck regions.
	   Obuchi arrived in the morning in Fukushima Prefecture, 175
kilometers (110 miles) north of Tokyo, and was expected to visit
Tochigi in the afternoon.
	   He was shown on nationwide TV news shaking hands with people who
had fled their homes and telling them, ``Keep strong.''
	   The Central Meteorological Agency said Rex was expected to hit
the eastern coast of Japan over the weekend or early next week.
	   As of noon Saturday, Rex, packing winds of up to 126 kph (80
mph), was slowly moving northeasterly from out in the Pacific
Ocean, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) south of Tokyo, it said.
	   Rex had been classified as a tropical storm until Saturday, when
winds increased to typhoon levels.
	   The agency warned of additional mudslides as well as thunder and
lightning, strong winds and hail in affected areas.
	   Ibaraki Prefecture, 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, was expected to have 150 millimeters (6 inches) of rain
Saturday.
	   The rains have filled roads with mud and smashed rice stalks in
fields. TV news showed people fleeing on boats from homes so buried
in murky water that only rooftops showed.
	   Elsewhere, people waded through kneehigh waters, and in coastal
areas, waves tossed docked boats.

	   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) _ Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
met with Sultan Qaboos on Saturday as part of a visit aimed at
boosting relations, the official Oman News Agency reported.
	   Vajpayee met with Qaboos in Salala, Oman's summer capital, and
the two discussed political and economic issues, including the
stalled Middle East peace process and the recent nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan.
	   The two leaders also held talks on cooperation in the fields of
oil, gas and fertilizers, the state-run agency said.
	   They also discussed the employment of Indians in Oman, officials
said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Since a crackdown on illegal workers at the beginning of this
year, more than 15,000 Indians have been deported.
	   There are more than 200,000 Indians working in Oman, which is
located on the southeastern tip of the Arabian Peninsula.
	   Earlier this year, Oman and India agreed to set up a fertilizer
plant in Oman at a cost of dlrs 1.1 billion.

An ultranationalist party burns up independent paper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Members of an ultranationalist splinter
group burned up copies of an independent daily Saturday on Zagreb's
main square to protest the paper's alleged anti-Croat bias.
	   Jutarnji list is a privately-owned daily, launched earlier this
year. It is critical of the government and has covered extensively
the case of Dinko Sakic, a World War II concentration camp
commander recently extradited to Croatia to stand trial. The
Croatian Rightists see Sakic as a hero.
	   A few members of the party also handed passers-by a pamphlet,
saying that the paper works toward ``destabilizing the Croatian
state,'' while serving foreign ``enemies,'' particularly the United
States.
	   They also called on others to burn the paper ``whenever you
can.''
	   Onlookers mostly laughed, while others ignored the small crowd
of protesters. A few policemen watched closely, but did not
intervene.
	   The party has only a handful of members and no political
influence but frequently provokes incidents. It regularly pays
tribute to Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet state and often
denounces ``western values.''
	   A Croatian law bans and punishes the spreading of national and
racial hatred, but so far the government apparently has not decided
that the group's activities warrant prosecution.

Pakistan destroys U.S. missile warhead, finds a second one
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan destroyed the warhead of a
U.S. Tomahawk missile on Saturday and found a second missile that
went astray en route to neighboring Afghanistan, the state-run news
agency reported.
	   Quoting unidentified official sources, the Associated Press of
Pakistan said that the Tomahawk missile found Friday landed in the
Mekran area on the Arabian Sea coast.
	   ``The second dud missile found in Mekran would also be
destroyed,'' the APP reported. It didn't say when. Like the first,
it had not exploded.
	   The government has not confirmed the report of a second missile
being found.
	   The United States fired 73 Tomahawk missiles at six targets in
eastern Afghanistan on Aug. 20. The targets were suspected training
camps linked to Osama bin Laden, a multi-millionaire that
Washington believes finances terrorism worldwide, including the
Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   Pakistan lodged a complaint with the U.N. Security Council after
the first missile was found in Kharan, some 600 kilometers (375
miles) south of the U.S. targets near Khost, Afghanistan.
	   There were no reports of injuries caused by either missile, the
APP reported.

Urawa beats first-stage winner Iwata
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Masahiro Fukuda scored and Shinji Ono followed in
the first half as Urawa Reds handed first-stage champion Jubilo
Iwata its second consecutive loss in a 2-0 triumph.
	   Fukuda, the professional Japan League's top scorer in 1995, shot
Urawa ahead in the 11th minute and Ono fired home a middle-range
shot three minutes before the interval.
	   Philippe Troussier, the Frenchman named to coach Japan's
national team, was among the 17,000 spectators at Urawa's home
stadium.
	   Urawa has earned six points from two games played so far in the
second stage.
	   Yokohama Marinos, who edged Iwata in extra time in an opener of
the second stage last week, also was victorious Saturday with a 2-0
win over Verdy Kawasaki.
	   Spanish Julio Salinas took advantage of a defensive goof to
score Marinos' first goal in the 20th minute, followed by teammate
Shoji Jo's insurance goal in the 55th minute.
	   Kashiwa Reysol also won its second straight triumph by edging
JEF United Ichihara 1-0 on a strike minutes before the final
whistle by Hristo Stoichkov. Stoichkov is set to leave the team
temporarily next week for Bulgaria's European Championship
qualifying match.
	   Kashima Antlers, last year's first-stage winner, suffered its
first defeat of the current stage in a 3-1 loss at home to Yokohama
Flugels.
	   The second stage extends through Nov. 14. If two teams emerge as
stage winners, they will play off for the league championship in a
two-leg series Nov. 21 and 28.

Flood drowns new areas in northern India, 1,020 dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAIDEEP MAJUMDAR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Desperate villagers took shelter in trees
and on rooftops as a devastating flood that has killed 1,020 people
and displaced 7 million in India drowned new areas, officials said
Saturday.
	   At least 20,000 villages were reported submerged as the
floodwaters spread to five more districts in the country's most
populous state, that of Uttar Pradesh, provincial minister Ashok
Yadav told The Associated Press.
	   At least 900 people have drowned and another 120 have died of an
epidemic of waterborne diseases in 39 of the northern state's 83
districts since the flooding began three weeks ago. The water level
in most of the rivers in the state is still rising.
	   Yadav said 3.5 million hectares (8.6 million acres) of land _
including crops across 2 million hectares (5 million acres) _ had
been destroyed and the total losses were estimated to have topped
50 billion rupees (dlrs 1.2 billion).
	   ``Since rescue workers have still not been able to reach most of
the remote villages, we have estimated that about 200,000 people
may still be marooned,'' said Ashok Kumar, the state's relief
commissioner.
	   The furious waters of the Garra River swept away 100 people from
three villages in the central Hardoi district late on Friday, he
said. In the east, soldiers and policemen evacuated 30,000 people
from 1,100 remote villages in the districts of Deoria and
Gorakhpur, officials said.
	   The worst-hit area is in the east around the city of Gorakhpur,
the historical region where Buddha once preached.
	   ``Army and air force personnel have told us that villagers have
taken shelter on rooftops and even branches of trees to save
themselves from being swept away,'' Kumar said.
	   Cholera, diarrhea and jaundice have broken out in most of the
flood-affected districts. Tens of thousands of people are in relief
camps.
	   The floodwaters have snapped all road and telecommunication
links in the affected areas and submerged airports and helipads,
officials said.
	   Thieves broke into at least 500 abandoned houses in several
cities after swimming through churning waters and stolen TV sets,
music systems, washing machines and food processors, senior
Interior Department official N. Ravi Kumar said.
	   But few culprits have been caught as most of the police force
has been doing relief and rescue work, he said.
	   Rescue efforts have been hampered by lack of resources and
motorized boats but minister Yadav told a television network that
huge amounts had been pumped into the flood-affected regions by the
state government.
	   Uttar Pradesh is crisscrossed by some of India's major rivers,
which meander toward the sea after making their way down the
Himalayas in India's north. Many are flooded during the monsoon
season.
	   Torrential rains caused more a dozen major landslides in the
state last week, burying villages and mowing down roads and
communication links. At least 239 people were feared killed.

Britain seeks extradition from Spain of road rage suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DARTFORD, England (AP) _ After a two-year hunt, police have
arrested in Spain a Briton suspected of fatally stabbing a
passenger in another car in a ``road rage'' killing and are seeking
his extradition, police said Saturday.
	   Kenneth Noye, 51, was arrested Friday night ``in the south of
Spain,'' Kent County police said in a statement issued at Dartford,
17 miles (27 kms) east of London and near where Noye had a
substantial home before he apparently fled Britain.
	   The case attracted nationwide interest as a dreadful
illustration of the extremes of anger aroused in some road users
over petty incidents.
	   ``A formal request for the extradition of Kenneth Noye will be
sent through diplomatic channels to the government of Spain,'' Kent
police Supt. Nick Biddiss told reporters.
	   Noye faces charges of killing Stephen Cameron, 21, after getting
into an argument that started with angry gestures at an entry road
to the M25, a busy six-lane highway that encircles London.
	   Cameron's girlfriend, then 17, who was driving to buy some
bagels at lunchtime on May 19, 1996, said she had to brake suddenly
for a four-wheel drive vehicle, a Discovery.
	   Danielle Cable said the driver of the Discovery got out of his
car, Cameron also got, out, the Discovery driver hit Cameron and
then, as she pleaded with him to stop, knifed her boyfriend and
drove off.

Russian lawmakers approve political compromise document
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A joint committee approved a draft political
agreement Saturday designed to resolve the country's crisis by
realigning power between the president and parliament.
	   The Interfax news agency said the committee, composed of members
of both chambers of parliament and top government officials,
finalized the document. Its terms were not immediately available.
	   The draft will be reviewed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
later in the day, and further revisions are possible, Interfax
said.
	   The document is essentially an outline of a series of measures
that would then have to be approved through parliament's normal
legislative process. Some amendments to the Constitution are also
likely.
	   The agreement is believed to give parliament, which now has
limited powers, a greater say in government policy. Currently the
parliament, composed of the State Duma and the Federation Council,
can do little except stonewall presidential initiatives.

Khatami sues two publications for defamation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iranian President Mohammad Khatami is suing
two hard-line publications for libel, the country's official news
agency reported Saturday.
	   The suits against the weekly newspaper Shalamcheh and the
monthly magazine Ya Lassarat Al Hossein will begin in a Tehran
court Monday, the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a judiciary
official as saying. The directors of the publications have been
summoned to appear.
	   Khatami is accusing the publications, both founded and sponsored
by the militant Ansar'e Hezbollah group, of printing ``insults and
lies and violating the press law,'' IRNA said.
	   The official, Said Nowbari, told the agency the suits stem from
articles published at the time of the presidential elections in May
1997. He did not elaborate.
	   During the campaign, both publications sharply criticized
Khatami, who was the leading moderate candidate.
	   It was not clear why Khatami has waited so long to file the
suit.
	   Khatami's landslide victory against a hard-liner in the campaign
was widely welcomed by women and young people in Iran who saw it as
a triumph for civil liberties. But the president has encountered
strong opposition from conservatives within the ruling hierarchy
who accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

resistance; new throughout; CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the two sides trading
accusations of atrocities, Serbian police said Saturday that they
discovered a crematorium where Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels
allegedly burned the bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   The police statement, carried by the official Tanjug news
agency, said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians killed by the rebels, was found in the village of Klecka,
which was recently retaken by government forces.
	   On Friday, Serb forensic workers retrieved the bones of 10 Serb
civilians, two of them children, who officials said were executed
by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The workers retrieved skulls and other charred human bones,
including a pelvis and part of a backbone with bits of singed
clothing on it.
	   KLA rebels are fighting to win independence for Kosovo, a
Serbian province where 90 percent of the population is ethnic
Albanian. But Serbs consider the region the cradle of their
culture, and the Western powers prefer not to see boundary changes,
as in the Balkans these often signal the start of further
bloodshed.
	   Also Friday, the ethnic Albanian side blamed the Serbs for
killing 17 people in the same region. U.N. officials said they saw
eight bodies, including an infant and a 4-year-old boy decapitated
during Serb shelling.
	   The latest Serb statement comes amid a series of mutual
allegations of atrocities in six months of fighting that has killed
hundreds on either side and made more than 260,000 people homeless.
	   Discovery of the alleged crematorium followed testimony from two
captured rebel fighters, Ljup and Bekim Mazreku, who told police
that in July alone, 22 Serbs as well as some ethnic Albanians loyal
to Serbian authorities were killed. It was not clear if the ethnic
Albanians were also cremated.
	   Serbian police and Yugoslav army troops have purged KLA fighters
from about 30 percent of the territory that the rebels controlled
at one point.
	   However, clashes continue, and the Serb-run Media Center in
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, said that seven ``terrorists'' were
killed Saturday in a shootout with police in the western Kosovo
town of Klina.
	   The report could not be immediately confirmed.
	   After a string of defeats at the hands of government forces, the
KLA appealed to ethnic Albanians to unite and join rebel ranks, in
an appeal published Saturday in an Albanian-language paper in
Pristina.
	   ``Like never before, it is high time that we all become KLA
soldiers,'' the KLA statement said.
	   The rebels also urged an end to rifts within the Kosovo Albanian
camp. The KLA and its supporters opposes pacifist ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova, who enjoys Western support and is the
preferred negotiator in any future peace talks with the Serbian
government.
	   U.S. diplomats have been trying to set up face-to-face talks
between the Albanians and the Serbian government to discuss the
future of the province. The Americans and Europeans want Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to restore the autonomy he withdrew in
1989.
	   In Belgrade, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft warned
on Friday of a humanitarian catastrophe unless the fighting ceases
and refugees return to their homes within the next six weeks.
	   After that, Taft said, the advent of winter will bring suffering
and death to tens of thousands of people. Taft said she would ask
U.S. President Bill Clinton for emergency aid to prevent a
disaster. Refugees were already suffering from unusually cold,
rainy weather.
	   Taft said it was ``absolutely critical that the (Yugoslav)
government considers this an emergency and waves restrictions...
for relief workers, getting commodities in and providing for a
reduced military presence.''

Nonaligned summit opens in South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ The Nonaligned Movement should
defend weak countries against domination by strong ones, South
Africa's foreign minister said Saturday as he opened a summit of
the 113-member group.
	   Welcoming ambassadors and senior officials to the 12th summit of
the Nonaligned Movement, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said it should
ensure that it places the interests and ambitions of the poor
firmly on the agenda of the international community.
	   Fifty-two heads of state have confirmed they are attending,
among them Congo President Laurent Kabila, the South African Press
Association reported. The heads of state are to meet on Wednesday
and Thursday.
	   Kabila, backed by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia, is
locked in a war against rebels allegedly backed by Rwanda and
Uganda. On Friday, a spokesman for the rebels' Congolese Rally for
Democracy said a rebel delegation would attend the summit, SAPA
reported.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan plans to go and, on the
sidelines, discuss the Congo war and the faltering peace process in
Angola with a variety of leaders.
	   Created during the Cold War by developing countries to fend off
domination by Washington or Moscow, the Nonaligned Movement is
calling for a greater voice for poor countries in the U.N. Security
Council, for relief of overwhelming foreign debt and for improved
trade relationships with the West.

Report: Japanese doctor kicked out of group for fertilizations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A doctor was ejected from Japan's gynecological
association Saturday for performing in vitro fertilizations with
eggs and sperm of donors who were not married to each other, a news
report said.
	   Yahiro Netsu, director of a maternity clinic in Shimosuwa north
of Tokyo, said he has conducted five or six extramarital in vitro
fertilization procedures since June, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology voted on Saturday
to formally eject Netsu. It was the first time the society had
expelled a member based on ethical guidelines, Kyodo reported.
	   The society could not be reached late Saturday for comment.
	   The society has banned fertilizations out of wedlock since 1983,
and requires doctors to use only the eggs and sperm of donors who
are married to each other.
	   The move to eject Netsu does not affect his ability to practice,
since there are no Japanese laws restricting the procedure.
	   In June, Netsu announced he had conducted three in vitro
fertilization procedures using eggs and sperm from siblings of
married couples, resulting in successful childbirth. The society
immediately decided to take action against him, but final vote did
not come until Saturday.
	   Netsu was quoted as saying that he had drawn up his own
guidelines for the fertilizations, using only eggs and sperm from
siblings of married couples and restricting female donors to women
who already have children.
	   No fertilizations are conducted for single mothers and fathers,
and only women under age 45 can receive the treatment, according to
Netsu's own guidelines, the report said.
	   Netsu was quoted as saying that he will urge the Health and
Welfare Ministry to set legal guidelines in this field.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Four people were slightly injured when
an airliner carrying 255 passengers from New York careered off a
runway after landing at Brussels international airport Saturday.
	   The plane, an Airbus 340 of Belgium's Sabena airline, skidded
several hundred meters (yards) off the runway apparently after a
landing-wheel tire burst.
	   Four passengers needed hospital treatment for minor injuries
sustained during an emergency evacuation of the plane.
	   Belgian news reports said the pilot had not indicated any
problems with the plane as he brought it in to land.

Turkish premier tells Kurdish rebels to surrender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz answered a
truce offer from Kurdish rebels by calling on them Saturday to
surrender and end their 14-year war for autonomy.
	   Rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdistan
Workers Party, on Friday announced a unilateral cease-fire.
	   If Ocalan ``has understood that fighting the Turkish state is
helpless and if he makes a step towards surrendering, I find this
positive,'' Yilmaz said.
	   Ocalan told London-based Kurdish MED-TV that the open-ended
ceasefire would begin Tuesday to coincide with world peace day. The
rebels would refrain from attacks on Turkish troops, but would
defend themselves if attacked.
	   The conflict that has raged in Turkey's southeast since 1984 has
killed about 37,000 people. Most rebel cease-fires, including the
latest in April, have been short-lived.

Fairly strong earthquake rattles Tokyo, two slightly injured
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with another quake in islands of eastern Japan, grafs
5-6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A fairly strong earthquake shook Tokyo and its
surrounding areas Saturday morning, slightly injuring two people
but causing no major damage.
	   The quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.4 was centered in
the Tokyo Bay about 70 kilometers (40 miles) deep underground, the
Central Meteorological Agency said.
	   The quake, which rattled shelves and windows for several
seconds, struck at 8:46 a.m. (2346 GMT Friday).
	   A 54-year-old woman sprained a leg muscle after falling down in
Tokyo, and a 34-year-old woman twisted her leg in Yokohama, just
south of Tokyo, fire department officials said.
	   Later Saturday, another quake with a preliminary magnitude of
3.8 jolted the Niijima and Kozushima islands, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) south of Tokyo, the meteorological agency said.
	   There were no immediate reports of damage or injury. The quake's
epicenter was 10 kilometers (6 miles) below the seabed near the
islands
	   The agency said neither quake would stir up tsunami, or undersea
waves set off by volcanic activity or earthquakes.
	   The earlier quake shook Tokyo and nearby prefectures, including
Chiba, Tochigi, Kanagawa and Saitama, the agency said.
	   Japanese media reports said bullet trains in areas near Tokyo
temporarily stopped running as a precaution but restarted in less
than a half-hour.
	   A temblor of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage if it
strikes a residential area.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone nations as it
sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across the
earth's surface.

Kohl's coalition partner squares off against Greens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The junior party in Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's coalition squared off Saturday against another minor party,
calling the environmentalist Greens its main opponent in national
elections.
	   At a gathering in Bonn to launch its final phase of campaigning
before Sept. 27 elections, the Free Democratic Party sought to
portray the Greens as anti-technology and backward-looking.
	   ``If it were up to the Greens, a mobile telephone still would be
two cans connected by a cord,'' Free Democrats general-secretary
Guido Westerwelle said.
	   The Free Democrats are fiscally conservative like the rest of
Kohl's coalition, but tend to overlap more with the left-leaning,
opposition Greens on social issues like immigration and illegal
drugs.
	   The Free Democrats are hoping to gain enough votes to again help
supply Kohl's coalition with a ruling majority. The Greens, for
their part, are hoping for enough support to give the edge to their
presumed coalition partner _ the main opposition party, the Social
Democrats.
	   Both minor parties could be sidelined, however, under a scenario
drawing increased discussion among the two major national parties:
Kohl's party and the left-leaning Social Democrats could team up
together.
	   Social Democratic chancellor candidate Gerhard Schroeder has
indicated his willingness to consider the idea. Kohl and other
coalition members have dismissed Schroeder's stance as a ruse in
his quest to assure middle-class voters he is a business-friendly
centrist.
	   But a key member of Kohl's party, Saxony state governor Kurt
Biedenkopf, was quoted Saturday as saying he thought such a ``grand
coalition'' was not improbable.
	   ``Many voters think it might be best if the two big parties did
things together,'' Biedenkopf said in an interview with Der Spiegel
magazine.

Northwest Airlines grounded by pilots strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with no indication of when talks will
resume, comment from spokesmen. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos DT104, MP112 &QL; 
 &UR; By BETH SILVER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ By the time Northwest Airlines' 6,100 pilots
went on strike, most of their passengers were already gone.
	   Announcements echoed in the nearly deserted main terminal of
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, which is dominated by
the airline. Its bars and shops were nearly deserted Friday night
and most of the baggage carousels were still.
	   Northwest, which accounts for 80 percent of the flights into and
out of Minneapolis-St. Paul, had been warning of the strike
possibility and earlier this week canceled 400 flights scheduled
for Friday and Saturday.
	   There was no indication when talks would resume, although sides
had said they were ready to negotiate.
	   ``When it broke last night, everybody made sure everyone had
everyone's phone numbers,'' Northwest spokesman Jon Austin said
Saturday. But he said the company had not heard from the union, the
Air Line Pilots Association.
	   The union was waiting to hear from Northwest, said spokesman
Paul Omodt.
	   Northwest is also the leading U.S. carrier to Asia with Asian
hubs in Tokyo and Osaka, Japan. It has a global alliance
partnership with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Among overseas cities
served by Northwest from the United States are Amsterdam, London,
Paris, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Osaka and Bejing.
	   Northwest estimated that 33 percent of its trans-Pacific
passengers, or about 3,600 people, would be unable to travel to
their destinations on the first day of the strike.
	   Bargaining had gone into a 10th straight day, and a last-minute
offer was rushed to the union's executive council hours before the
strike deadline of 0401 GMT Friday.
	   Shortly before the deadline, Steve Zoller, the head of the
council, said the offer was rejected.
	   The White House said President Bill Clinton would not intervene.
	   Northwest, based in suburban Eagan, is the United States' No. 6
airline in terms of passengers carried, with more than 54 million
annually.
	   Omodt had said earlier that two of the most contentious points
were job security and compensation.
	   Northwest pilots say they earn an average salary of about dlrs
120,000 per year. The airline says the average salary is dlrs
133,000.
	   The pilots have been seeking a 15 percent raise over five years
dating to Oct. 31, 1996, when their contract expired. Austin said
the offer on the table would give Northwest pilots pay rates 4.5
percent higher than average rate earned by pilots at American,
United and Delta by 2000, and 7 percent higher by the end of
contract in 2002.
	   Northwest also was offering lump sum payments to pilots of 3.5
percent of annual pay, totaling dlrs 57 million. The pilots were
seeking a stock and cash package that would be worth a total of
dlrs 152.5 million.
	   In Amsterdam, Netherlands, Schiphol Airport was calm as travlers
quietly coped with the cancellations of 10 flights. A Dutch court
had issued a ban on Wednesday forbidding pilots with
Amsterdam-based KLM from striking in solidarity with their
Northwest counterparts.
	   Kimo Skyles, 24, and his wife Dana, 22, were sitting on their
luggage eating a pizza as the line moved slowly forward. They were
trying to get home to Salt Lake City, Utah, and arrived at the
airport early hoping to get on an earlier plane.
	   ``I really don't know what to expect,'' Kimo Skyles said with a
sigh. ``We heard about it this morning and decided to come in early
to get everything fixed.''
	   Northwest had said a strike and the corresponding shutdown of
its two Airlink regional feeder services would eliminate 2,640
daily departures at 223 airports in the United States and abroad,
leaving nearly 672,000 passengers without alternative air service
during the first 10 days. Northwest already halted its cargo
service as of Thursday.
	   Outside the airports in Minneapolis, Detroit and Memphis, 25 to
40 pilots walked the picket line as some observers cheered and some
cars honked as they passed.

Police allege Kosovo Albanians burned killed Serbs in crematory
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Yugoslav government statement in grafs 5-6. &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the two sides trading
accusations of atrocities, Serbian police said Saturday they had
discovered a crematory where Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels had
allegedly burned the bodies of at least 22 two Serb civilians.
	   The police statement, carried by the official Tanjug news
agency, said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians previously killed by the rebels, was found in the village
of Klecka, recently retaken by government forces.
	   On Friday, Serb forensic workers had retrieved the bones of 10
Serb civilians, two of them children, who officials said were
executed by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The workers retrieved skulls and other charred human bones like
a pelvis and part of a backbone with bits of singed clothing on it.
	   A statement issued swiftly by the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
spoke of killings ``done Nazi style,'' asking for international
condemnation.
	   It urged foreign countries ``to cut all sources of financing,
recruitment, training, arming and infiltration of terrorists into
Yugoslav territory'' and to put the KLA ``on the list of terrorist
organizations.''

Juventus players' medical records seized
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A prosecutor looking into possible use of
banned substances in Serie A has obtained medical records of
Juventus of Turin players from the league champions.
	   Raffaele Guariniello, who has questioned several current and
former Juventus players and coach Marcello Lippi, sent
investigators to gather the medical files and other documents from
the team, media reports said Saturday.
	   ``They did not show any warrant,'' Juventus team doctor Riccardo
Agricola told the ANSA news agency, ``nor did they make clear the
reason for their request. On the other hand, there was no need to,
because we handed over right away everything we were asked for,
continuing the line of full cooperation that we have always
followed.''
	   Guariniello's is one of three separate inquiries into the use of
banned substances in Italian soccer.
	   One for the Italian Olympic Committee's antidoping commission
ended last week without finding evidence of illegal drug use, but
did find that the use of legal muscle-builders, such as creatine,
is widespread.
	   The investigations were triggered when AS Roma coach Zdenek
Zeman expressed his ``amazement'' at the quick muscular development
of some players. Zeman specifically mentioned current Juventus
striker Alessandro Del Piero and former Juve star Gianluca Vialli,
now player-coach for English club Chelsea.
	   Meanwhile, Guariniello questioned Italian soccer federation
president Luciano Nizzola for more than two hours Saturday.
	   Nizzola told reporters that the federation is looking into
changing the methods of testing for banned substances.
	   ``We are sensitive to the doping problem, even if in soccer real
cases of doping probably do not exist or are not widespread. We are
also sensitive to the issue of protecting the health of soccer
players,'' he said.

Few signs of Russia's financial crisis seen on Moscow streets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ If there was a crisis in Russia on Saturday, there
were few signs on the street. The ruble was regaining value at
exchange booths and the longest lines weren't at banks _ they were
at McDonalds.
	   No angry crowds. No people pushing and shoving to save what
remains of their savings. No panic.
	   All that could be a yet _ no panic yet, no angry crowds yet. But
so far, Russia's financial downfall appears to reflect itself in
nuances _ gloomy faces in the metro, newly stamped price tags, the
murmurings of the elderly.
	   ``I used to buy these beefsteaks for 10 rubles, then for 11 and
now they cost 14. And there only are four small pieces,''
complained pensioner Polina Seliverstova, examining the display at
a food kiosk.
	   At the present street rate of about 9 rubles to the dollar, the
beefsteaks cost about dlrs 1.50. A grocery stand across the street
offers bananas and oranges for 60 cents a kilo (30 cents a pound) _
small change for a foreigner and the average ``new Russian,'' a lot
for a pensioner getting only 400 rubles (about dlrs 40) a month.
	   ``Everything has gone up,'' Seliverstova says.
	   Actually, not quite everything, although it may be just a matter
of time. A metro token still is 2 rubles, a loaf of bread 3 rubles.
	   With other prices creeping upward, some pensioners and
housewives have started to stock up on basic foodstuffs: cooking
oil, groats, even salt, as they did in the years of post-Soviet
inflation.
	   There is no rush on stores, but there is a palpable anxiety.
	   Across town, Irina Krylova, a young attorney, is severely
depressed. She has just begun to realize that the crisis means she
can no longer afford the convenience foods she used to buy to save
herself time and effort in the kitchen.
	   ``I was almost in tears, to tell you frankly,'' she says. ``We
used to be middle-class. Now, who knows? It's a whole different
life.''
	   Like thousands of other Russians, Krylova and her boyfriend have
rushed out to buy something durable with whatever rubles they have
in cash. They would like to buy a new refrigerator, but haven't
found one _ many Moscow stores selling fancy household equipment
are keeping their doors shut, waiting for the ruble to stabilize.
	   Some are turning to gold. A large jewelry company,
Tsentr-Yuvelir, reported a 250 percent increase in sales over the
past few days. On Saturday, though, jewelry and antique stores were
mostly empty.
	   An echo of the crisis is heard in the voice of a megaphone-armed
vendor calling on customers to visit a shoe shop. ``Two days left
before Sept. 1! The dollar rate is going UP and our prices are
going DOWN,'' the man shouts.
	   In fact, nobody really knows what the ruble is worth right now.
Russia's Central Bank halted dollar sales last week, leaving the
official rate at 7.905 rubles to the dollar. On the street, the
rate climbed as high as 12 at exchange booths earlier in the week,
but was mostly below 10 on Saturday.
	   Ironically, after reports of shortages of dollars all week,
there now seems to be a shortage of rubles. Quite a few exchange
points posted small paper notices in their windows _ ``no rubles''
_ and there were small lines outside some where people were cashing
in dollars for rubles.
	   Some places are doing brisk business. At a wholesale market,
people snap cigarettes priced at around 8 rubles a pack _ up from
6.50 rubles a few days ago. Those same cigarettes can still fetch
11 or 12 rubles when they are resold at metro stations farther from
the center.
	   A video games parlor, of all things, is full. At a zoo store, a
man is buying a green water turtle, a present for a friend. A
kitten is meowing in its cage, waiting for some ``good hands,'' as
the sign says. Nearby, a few students are chewing sausage
sandwiches.
	   ``Sorry,'' they tell a stray dog. ``We're also hungry.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With the two sides trading
accusations of atrocities, Serbian police said Saturday that they
discovered a crematorium where Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels
allegedly burned the bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   The police statement, carried by the official Tanjug news
agency, said the furnace, allegedly used to destroy the bodies of
civilians killed by the rebels, was found in the village of Klecka,
which was recently retaken by government forces.
	   On Friday, Serb forensic workers retrieved the bones of 10 Serb
civilians, two of them children, who officials said were executed
by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The workers retrieved skulls and other charred human bones,
including a pelvis and part of a backbone with bits of singed
clothing on it.
	   A statement from the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spoke of ``Nazi
style'' killings and asked for international condemnation.
	   It urged foreign countries ``to cut all sources of financing,
recruitment, training, arming and infiltration of terrorists into
Yugoslav territory'' and to put the KLA ``on the list of terrorist
organizations.''
	    &UR; KLA rebels ... PICKUP 5th graf pvs.

Jayasuriya and de Silva hammer the hapless England
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tea score &QL; 
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; -

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Left-hander Sanath Jayasuriya hit a swashbuckling
202 not out and shared a record stand with Aravinda de Silva, 72
not out, as Sri Lanka put England to sword in the one-off test at
the Oval on Saturday.
	   The third wicket pair batted the entire afternoon session,
grinding out the stingless England attack to prop Sri Lanka to 317
for two at tea on the third day.
	   Jayasuriya, who hit a career-best 340 against India in Colombo
in August 1997, scored his second double century of his 38-match
career as he dominated the 232-run stand.
	   This was after England had batted frustratingly for over 10
hours to score 445 runs in its first innings.
	   Jayasuriya, who came to prominence during Sri Lanka 1996 World
Cup success in the subcontinent, cracked 31 boundaries and a six
off medium paceman Dominic Cork.
	   The experienced de Silva, who became the first Sri Lankan to
score 5,000 test runs during the course of the innings, was happy
to play second fiddle to his junior partner, who simple caned
England.
	   Resuming on 192 for two after lunch, the pair scored 125 runs in
29 overs to maintain an overall run rate of 4.17 compared to
England's 2.8.
	   England's only success of the day came in the six over of the
morning when Angus Fraser had overnight batsman Mahela Jayawardene
well caught at gully by Ben Hollioake for nine.
	   In the 218 minutes together, Jayasuriya and de Silva have hit 32
boundaries between them, 16 each in sessions before and after
lunch.
	   When Jayasuriya reached 100 it was his first century in 18
innings since his 199 against India in Colombo, when he partnered
de Silva in a 218-run stand, Sri Lanka's previous record against
all countries before Saturday.
	   De Silva, the 74-test veteran, hasn't looked back since straight
driving Fraser for his first off his 10 boundaries.
	   To add insult to injury, Cork, who conceded 18 runs in two overs
to Jayasuriya was officially warned by umpire David Shepherd for
running on the pitch.
	   One more admonishment and Cork will be faced with the ignominy
of being removed from England's attack that has already looked
toothless in the face of some hurricane hitting.
	   Normally aggressively de Silva showed no hurry to reach his 50
as he spent 20 balls on 47 before successive singles got him there.
	   Starting on 47 after lunch, he added 25 runs in the post lunch
session as he enjoyed Jayasuriya's crackerjack innings from the
other end.
	   Jayasuriya, who had managed just 145 first-class runs in seven
innings before the test, seemed to have kept his energy reserved
for the big occasion, going from strength to strength with every
ball he faced.
	   So far he has faced 263 balls in three minutes over five and a
half hours at the crease.
	   His century off 124 balls is the third fastest for Sri Lanka in
tests behind team mate Romesh Kaluwitharana's 103-ball innings
against New Zealand and former skipper Duleep Mendis' 112-ball
knock against England at Lord's in 1984.

Bosnian Serbs return home after six years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A group of 150 Bosnian Serbs
returned Saturday to their villages near the southern Bosnian town
of Mostar, which are controlled by the Muslim-Croat Federation.
	   There were no incidents unlike on previous occasions when
members of an ethnic minority returned to their prewar homes. It
was the fourth group of Serbs to return recently to this part of
the country.
	   The refugees returned to the villages of Hudbina and Malo Polje,
some 15 kilometers (ten miles) south of Mostar. They were escorted
by the local police, NATO-led peace force and representatives of
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
	   ``This is ours and will stay ours, let everybody know,'' said
55-year old Milorad Pudar, excited about returning to his home
after having spent the war years in Serb-held eastern Bosnia.
	   The deputy of Mostar's City council, Ratko Pejanovic, himself a
Bosnian Serb, welcomed the returnees and said the biggest problem
now is how to provide adequate accommodation for them till their
houses are repaired.
	   City officials had mobilized construction machines and building
material to help rebuild returnees' homes with the assistance of
international agencies.
	   ``Help is coming, but not enough,'' Pejanovic said.
	   ``I hope we will manage to renew living together with our
neighbors (Muslims and Croats) and that life will become normal
again,'' said Velimir Matkovic, 22, upon his return to his home
which he saw the last time as a teenager.

Bodies litter eastern Kinshasa, fighting tapers off

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Kinshasa was largely quiet Saturday, but
decaying corpses littered the streets of the capital's eastern
suburbs _ the aftermath of days of combat between government troops
and insurgent rebels.
	   Fighting in the city's eastern Kingasani and Masina districts
tapered off to little more than sporadic machine-gun fire.
	   ``There are many dead in the area,'' said Health Minister
Jean-Baptist Sondgi. ``It's a terrible scene of bodies here and
there.''
	   On the city's west side, new fighting broke out overnight with
heavy mortar fire echoing through the area near the Ndangi forest
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown.
	   A rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected
members of the Congolese military are battling to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   ``We could hear the fighting all night,'' said one resident who
left the area and came to central Kinshasa overnight. Hostilities
had tapered off by Saturday morning.
	   The combat on Kinshasa's west side comes one day after thousands
of people waving tree branches and cheering celebrated believing
the war was over.
	   Electricity to the city was still cut off Saturday by a
rebel-held power dam and a dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in place.
Most shops remained closed, but more people ventured into the
streets after days in hiding for fear of the combat.
	   ``Many of the aggressors have surrendered and laid down their
arms,'' state-controlled radio reported. ``But vigilance must
continue, you must denounce any suspected Rwandan aggressors.''
	   Government officials say hundreds of insurgents have been
captured in recent days. The interior ministry earlier said as many
as 1,000 rebel fighters had been caught.
	   Kabila maintains neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are behind the
3-week-old rebellion, a charge both countries deny.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma have remained silent
in recent days amid growing indications their assault on the
capital was facing tough resistance from troops loyal to Kabila and
his Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian allies.
	   One rebel commander said his forces had taken the town of
Manolo, Kabila's birthplace in Katanga province.
	   Manolo is south of the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie, which
according to the commander, fell to the rebels earlier in the week.
	   The rebels' primary target of Kinshasa, however, has proven a
tough battle. Rebel gunmen had slipped into the city earlier in the
week and were fighting for control of the airport and several
eastern districts.
	   The fighting also unleashed a killing spree in parts of Kinshasa
where soldiers and civilians hunted down suspected rebels and beat,
burned or shot them to death.
	   Government and allied troops were firmly in control of the
airport and appeared to be containing rebel positions elsewhere.
	   Away from the capital, rebel forces still control the Inga power
dam that supplies electricity to Kinshasa. Angolan forces trying to
retake the dam said the insurgents were threatening to blow it up.
	   State-controlled Voice of the People radio continued Saturday to
call on former government troops now fighting for the rebels to lay
down their arms.
	   ``We know you have been tricked by the Rwandans, lay down your
arms and rejoin your ranks with the Congolese forces,'' an
announcer said.
	   The insurgents scored repeated military successes early in the
month-old rebellion, capturing important cities in eastern Congo
and launching a drive toward Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops
fighting for Kabila has apparently turned the tide in the
southwest.
	   A respected Zimbabwean business newspaper reported Friday that
about 2,000 Zimbabwean troop reinforcements have been airlifted to
Congo, bringing the total Zimbabwean force to 2,800.
	   Along with the armored cars, vehicles and attack helicopters
that Zimbabwe has shipped, the cost of its involvement was
estimated by the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper at more than
$100,000 a day _ a huge figure for a country mired in economic
turmoil.

British aid worker stabbed to death in Belize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A British aid worker helping to build a school in
a remote part of Belize has been stabbed to death, the Foreign
Office said Saturday.
	   The body of Anna Lightfoot, 27, one of nine British volunteers
working at San Pablo, about 100 miles (160 kms) from Belize City,
the largest town, was found Thursday in dense jungle some 500 yards
(meters) from the track she had taken to visit a nearby village.
The path ran between a banana plantation and jungle.
	   British soldiers based in Belize, a former British colony in
central America, and local police, militia and villagers mounted a
search after Miss Lightfoot failed to return to the project, the
Foreign Office said. Her body was airlifted to a British army base
near Belize City.
	   Raleigh International, the British aid organization for which
she worked, has recalled its entire 17-member team building
classrooms at San Pablo.
	   ``We took a decision to recall the group from the area as a
precaution even though there are a lot of police and army personnel
in the area,'' said Raleigh International chief executive Jamie
Robertson-Macleod.
	   ``We need to reconsider our commitment to the area and we are
waiting for things to be cleared up. But our commitment to Belize,
which is one of the most tranquil of countries, remains,'' he
added.
	   Miss Lightfoot quit her job with a local authority in Tameside,
near the north England city of Manchester, in June to work in
Belize.
	   ``Anna wanted one big adventure before she got a serious partner
and settled down.'' said her father, David Lightfoot. ``She was an
ebullient person, very lively.''

Seven arrested, but not disclosed if suspects in embassy blast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ Police said Saturday that seven
people had been arrested in a sweep following the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy here three weeks ago, but did not say whether those
detained were suspected in connection with the attack.
	   The seven were arrested earlier this week near the Tanzanian
border port of Tunduma, on the Zambian frontier, said a police
officer speaking on condition of anonymity. Their identitities and
nationalities were not disclosed.
	   The suspects were reportedly sent to the commercial capital of
Dar es Salaam under heavy police escort.
	   Police had been staging a nationwide manhunt for suspects since
the August 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es Salaam, which
killed 11 people.
	   A much more deadly blast at almost the same time outside the
U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya killed 247 people and injured more
than 5,000 others.

Langer, Claydon share lead at BMW Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ England's Russell Claydon and Bernhard
Langer, seeking his 11th tournament title in Germany, grabbed the
third-round lead Friday at the BMW International Open.
	   Langer and Claydon, who fired the day's best round of 64,
finished at 14-under-par 202 to take a one-stroke lead at the dlrs
1.39 million event.
	   Langer, who shot a 67, has captured the three other European
tour events played in his homeland, but has failed to win the BMW
Open.
	   ``Winning it is my goal, but I'm not putting any extra pressure
on myself for tomorrow,'' said Langer, who celebrated his 41st
birthday two days ago.
	   Denmark's Thomas Bjorn, the second-day leader, was one back at
203, along with Germany's Thomas Goegele.
	   Bjorn's three-stroke lead entering the day melted away when the
25-year-old Dane bogeyed three straight holes finishing at the
14th.
	   Langer mounted an early charge at Bjorn by collecting three
birdies in his first six holes, but lost a chance to top the
leaderboard alone when his 1 1/2 meter (5 feet) putt slid by on his
final hole.
	   But the two-time Masters champion dazzled the gallery by setting
up the birdie attempt with a long approach shot that hit the green,
then spun back to the flag.
	   ``Unfortunately I read the putt wrong. That happened to me two
or three times today, otherwise I would have had a lower score,''
said Langer.
	   Northern Ireland's Darren Clarke shot a 67 to move three strokes
back at 205, along with England's Jamie Spence and Andrew Beal.
Both had 66 rounds.
	   Clarke would pass the injured Lee Westwood of England as
Europe's leading money-winner if he can finish at least second at
the event.
	   Claydon scattered eight birdies in his round of 8-under 64 as he
moved into position to win his tour title. In his 11-year-career,
he has settled for second seven times.
	   Gary Nicklaus, the son of Jack Nicklaus, moved into striking
distance of the leaders by ringing up a round of 4-under 68. He is
six back at 208.

Autopsy confirms identity but not cause of death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ An autopsy confirmed what police
expected, that a body found last week is that of a Virginia school
teacher missing since July 20. But the cause of death remains
uncertain.
	   Police and relatives of the victim were ``99 percent sure'' that
the body found on Paradise Island Aug. 22 was that of 32-year-old
Lori Fogleman of Richmond, and the autopsy confirmed the identity.
	   Assistant Police Commissioner Reginald Ferguson said Friday
evening that no broken bones or gunshot wounds were found on the
decomposed body, and the local doctor and U.S. forensic pathologist
performing the autopsy were still trying to determine the cause of
death.
	   Ferguson refused to answer questions about whether the victim
had been sexually molested. The British Press Agency reported
Friday that another woman whose body was found the same day,
British tourist Joanne Clark, 24, had been sexually assaulted.
	   The autopsy on Clark's body determined that she died from
``manual strangulation.''
	   Despite speculation in the British press that the two deaths are
the work of a serial killer, Ferguson said the evidence suggests
they are not related.

Official: Pakistan misunderstood, wrongly dubbed fundamentalist
</HEADLINE>

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan is a state both moderate and
modern, often misunderstood and wrongly dubbed fundamentalist, the
information minister said Saturday.
	   ''The people of Pakistan are moderate Muslims and the government
is both moderate and modern,'' Mushahid Hussein said in an
interview with The Associated Press.
	   Hussein's comments follow a move by his government to scrap
inherited British laws in favor of a new Islamic order and a legal
system based on the Muslim holy book, the Koran.
	   The proposed law has been condemned by human rights activists
and opposition politicians who fear that Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif's government is moving Pakistan toward a style of rule
similar to that of neighboring Afghanistan, where the Taliban have
imposed a harsh version of Islam that keeps girls from school and
forces men to wear beards and pray.
	   Hussein dismissed those fears, saying, ``We are not like the
Taliban. ... We guarantee that the rights of minorities and women
will be protected.''
	   But his government is worried about its image abroad, where it
is often seen as sympathetic to Islamic militants, accused of
fomenting violence in Indian-held Kashmir and of acting as a major
transit point for drugs.
	   Pakistan has been associated with names like Ramzi Yousef,
convicted mastermind of the New York World Trade Center bombing;
Aimil Kanzi, convicted killer of CIA employees in Virginia; and
most recently, Osama bin Laden, multi-millionaire financier of
Islamic extremists and accused by the United States of backing the
Aug. 7 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa.
	   Pakistan is outraged by acts of terrorism, Hussein said, calling
it ``repugnant to Islam.''
	   But Western officials say they want Pakistan to do more than
condemn terrorism. For example, they have pressed Pakistan to shut
down offices of Harakat al-Ansar, a group on the U.S. list of
terrorist organizations.
	   ''These people have not done anything that is seen as a
violation of Pakistani law,'' said Hussein.
	   Still, ``We are very concerned about our image, and that is why
when acts of terrorism occur we are among the first to strongly
condemn any act of terrorism. ... It is absolutely indefensible.''
	   At the same time, the West has only itself to blame in some
ways, he said.
	   Terrorist training camps like those allegedly run by bin Laden
in Afghanistan, some of which the U.S. struck with cruise missiles
on Aug. 20, are the legacy of the 1980s war against invading Soviet
troops in Afghanistan.
	   In those days, Hussein said, the Western world led by the United
States put out a call to all Islamic militants to come to
Afghanistan to fight a holy war against the communist Soviet Union.
	   The CIA in particular ``enlisted groups from across the Muslim
world,'' Hussein said. ``The U.S. felt very good about those people
then.''
	   When the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan in 1989 and the
pro-communist government in Kabul fell three years later, the
militants were left without a cause, he said.
	   ``They were trained, highly motivated and organized, and in
search of enemies. ... Many turned to their own home countries,''
Hussein said. ``But the United States had forgotten about
Afghanistan and we were left holding the baby'' _ a violent baby,
and one well-armed and well-trained.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Kinshasa was largely quiet Saturday, but
decaying corpses littered the streets of the capital's eastern
suburbs _ the aftermath of days of combat between government troops
and insurgent rebels.
	   Fighting in the city's eastern Kingasani and Masina districts
tapered off to little more than sporadic machine-gun fire.
	   ``There are many dead in the area,'' said Health Minister
Jean-Baptist Sondgi. ``It's a terrible scene of bodies here and
there.''
	   On the city's west side, new fighting broke out overnight with
heavy mortar fire echoing through the area near the Ndangi forest
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown.
	   A rebel coalition of ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected
members of the Congolese military are battling to oust President
Laurent Kabila.
	   ``We could hear the fighting all night,'' said one resident who
left the area and came to central Kinshasa overnight. Hostilities
had tapered off by Saturday morning.
	   The combat on Kinshasa's west side comes one day after thousands
of people waving tree branches and cheering celebrated believing
the war was over.
	   Electricity to the city was still cut off Saturday by a
rebel-held power dam and a dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in place.
Most shops remained closed, but more people ventured into the
streets after days in hiding for fear of the combat.
	   ``Many of the aggressors have surrendered and laid down their
arms,'' state-controlled radio reported. ``But vigilance must
continue, you must denounce any suspected Rwandan aggressors.''
	   Government officials say hundreds of insurgents have been
captured in recent days. The interior ministry earlier said as many
as 1,000 rebel fighters had been caught.
	   Kabila maintains neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are behind the
nearly month-long rebellion, a charge both countries deny.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma have remained silent
in recent days amid growing indications their assault on the
capital was facing tough resistance from troops loyal to Kabila and
his Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian allies.
	   One rebel commander said his forces had taken the town of
Manolo, Kabila's birthplace in Katanga province.
	   Manolo is south of the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie, which
according to the commander, fell to the rebels earlier in the week.
	   The rebels' primary target of Kinshasa, however, has proven a
tough battle. Rebel gunmen had slipped into the city earlier in the
week and were fighting for control of the airport and several
eastern districts.
	   The fighting also unleashed a killing spree in parts of Kinshasa
where soldiers and civilians hunted down suspected rebels and beat,
burned or shot them to death.
	   Government and allied troops were firmly in control of the
airport and appeared to be containing rebel positions elsewhere.
	   Away from the capital, rebel forces still control the Inga power
dam that supplies electricity to Kinshasa. Angolan forces trying to
retake the dam said the insurgents were threatening to blow it up.
	   State-controlled Voice of the People radio continued Saturday to
call on former government troops now fighting for the rebels to lay
down their arms.
	   ``We know you have been tricked by the Rwandans, lay down your
arms and rejoin your ranks with the Congolese forces,'' an
announcer said.
	   The insurgents scored repeated military successes early in the
nearly month-long rebellion, capturing important cities in eastern
Congo and launching a drive toward Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops
fighting for Kabila has apparently turned the tide in the
southwest.
	   A respected Zimbabwean business newspaper reported Friday that
about 2,000 Zimbabwean troop reinforcements have been airlifted to
Congo, bringing the total Zimbabwean force to 2,800.
	   Including the armored cars, vehicles and attack helicopters that
Zimbabwe has shipped, the cost of its involvement was estimated by
the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper at more than dlrs 100,000 a day
_ a huge figure for a country mired in economic turmoil.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Clear to partly cloudy skies were observed across most of the
local area overnight. Widely scattered showers occurring across the
local Caribbean waters moved north-northwest and affected south and
southeast sections of Puerto Rico, with isolated showers across the
waters of the Virgin Islands.
	   Low-level winds locally turned southerly overnight in response
to the broadening of the winds associated with hurricane Danielle.
Danielle is expected to continue moving west-northwest and will
slowly exit our region through Sunday. South-southeast winds this
morning are expected to become more southeasterly this afternoon
and then east tonight. Moderately unstable upper level conditions
today are expected to become more stable this afternoon. However,
light winds and clear skies early will allow showers to develop
across Puerto Rico, with a few likely to intensify into
thunderstorms across the northern slopes and northwest of the
island. Clear skies across the Virgin Islands this morning will
continue through much of the day there. A few showers will move
through the area and develop during the afternoon along the
northwest coasts.
	   Marine conditions across the local Atlantic waters have begun to
improve overnight as northeast swells from Danielle began to
decrease. However, during the past 12 hours Danielle has slowed
down, with the wind field expanding. This will allow another mild
increase on northerly swells from Danielle to arrive across our
Atlantic waters by mid day, and a small craft advisory remains in
effect for these Atlantic waters and the Mona Passage.

Morceli still could be a contender
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIETI, Italy (AP) _ Noureddine Morceli is not ready to abdicate.
Not completely.
	   The Algerian's reign as the world's premier middle-distance
runner may be over, but he insisted on the eve of Sunday's IAAF
Rieti Grand Prix meet that he still has one or two years of top
performances left.
	   ``As long as I put shoes on my feet there are things I can do,''
Morceli, 28, said in an interview Saturday. ``I have been running
very fast for many years. I have ranked No. 1 seven times. I have
done everything. When you are 28, 29, 30 you don't have the same
strength and speed. But I know I still can produce very fast
times.''
	   His optimism may be bolstered by being in this little town
nestled in mountains about 55 kilometers (35 miles) northeast of
Rome. Morceli twice set world records here.
	   ``It is a special track, it's like it has magic,'' the Olympic
champion said. ``Many people have produced fast times here. I feel
like I am at home.''
	   When he lines up for the 1,500 meters Sunday, the opponents will
not include Hicham El Guerrouj, who clipped more than a second off
Morceli's old record for the 1,500 by running 3 minutes, 26 seconds
at the Golden Gala meet in Rome last month.
	   El Guerrouj also ended Morceli's four-year unbeaten streak at
the distance in 1996 and took away the Algerian's three-year hold
on the world title last year. But El Guerrouj is skipping Rieti to
concentrate on the final Golden League series meet, Tuesday at
Berlin.
	   ``He has great talent and he's very, very young,'' Morceli, who
still owns the standards for the mile and 2,000 meters, said of his
rival. ``The way he has been running he is the king of the middle
distances right now. I have thought about changing my distance,
trying to make my mark in the 5,000 meters. Let's give it another
year or two and see. If (my speed) doesn't come back I won't lose
anything. I still have what I accomplished in the past.''
	   Morceli has been hampered by tendon injuries this season, but
says he's healthy now.
	   Opting out of Rieti were sprinting and long jump star Marion
Jones, and top men's sprinters Ato Boldon and Maurice Greene.
Former 3,000 steeplechase record holder Wilson Boit Kipketer pulled
out with a back injury, while Heike Drechsler _ the newly-crowned
European champion and past Olympic and world titlist and
record-holder in the women's long jump _ was a late scratch because
she had to shoot an advertisement for a sponsor, organizers said.
	   The men's high jump will feature a top-flight battle between
world record holder and world champion Javier Sotomayor, Olympic
titlist Charles Austin and Poland's Arthur Partyka, who captured
the gold at last week's European championships.
	   Others participating include Olympic pole vault champion Jean
Galfion and all three medalists from the shot put at the Europeans
(Aleksander Bagach, Oliver-Sven Buder and Yuri Belonog).

China's floods spread to roof of the world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with new flood crest on Yangtze,
other details, trims. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN LEICESTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ From remote Tibet to oil wells in the northeast,
China's battle against devastating floods continued Saturday with
flood fighters warning that more surging waters were on their way.
	   Flood officials issued an urgent appeal to millions of soldiers
and civilians exhausted by two months of inundations to brace for
yet another flood crest surging down the Yangtze, China's longest
river, which is gripped by its heaviest flooding in 44 years.
	   The flood crest, the eighth this summer, followed rains on the
river's upper tributaries. Flood officials said the high water
would seriously test dikes already weakened and waterlogged.
	   This year's floods have killed more than 3,000 people, 1,320 of
them along the 3,900-mile- (6,200-kilometer-) long Yangtze, the
world's third largest river. Millions more people are homeless.
	   The floods have focused attention on the environmental
destruction accompanying China's rush for economic growth.
	   Officials have admitted that severe deforestation along the
Yangtze contributed to the floods by increasing rain run-off and
soil erosion that silted up river beds. Also blamed is human
encroachment onto Yangtze basin wetlands that has reduced their
ability to absorb floodwaters.
	   With torrential rains forecast, Tibet was also preparing to
renew a battle with flooding that already has killed at least 53
people in the Himalayan region since mid-June, the China Daily
said.
	   As in other parts of China, Tibet has mobilized soldiers and
civilians to fortify dikes as water levels on major rivers hit
record levels, the official newspaper said.
	   The floods have hit 40 of Tibet's more than 70 counties,
affecting 80,000 people, destroying 2,000 houses, killing livestock
and inundating farmland, it said.
	   In the northeast, flood fighters dynamited a dike, sending huge
plumes of earth high into the air, in an effort to release trapped
floodwaters that threatened the Daqing oil field, China's largest,
state television reported.
	   The waters were channeled into the Songhua River, which was
receding after record highs.
	   The Education Ministry, meanwhile, announced that a fund was
being established to rebuild schools, more than 44,000 of which
have been damaged in the floods, the China Daily said.
	   The government will also offer subsidized travel fares to
hard-up college students from flood-hit areas and waive or reduce
their tuition and accommodation fees, it said.

More journalists sentenced for libel in Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ In what was likely another attack on
press freedom, two journalists were convicted of libel in northeast
Romania, the third case in recent months, media reported Saturday.
	   Journalists Florentin Florescu and Radu Burlacu of local paper
Monitorul de Botosani were fined 100 million lei (dlrs 11,250) in
``moral damages'' by a court on Friday. The sum is a fortune in
Romania, where the average monthly salary is just dlrs 100.
	   In case of non-payment, court officials could seize from the
reporters all available assets, including their cars and houses.
They couldn't be reached by telephone for comment.
	   The two wrote articles alleging that a local politician abused
his position in favor of his son, reported the daily Evenimentul
Zilei. The journalists reported that by intervening, the politician
allegedly quashed court proceedings against his son who had
demolished a house protected under the monuments act.
	   In post-Communist Romania, authorities are unaccustomed to
criticism from the free-wheeling press. Justice officials are often
suspected of rushing through cases where they or local officials
have a vested interest and delaying other cases for years.
	   The editor of the paper from Botosani, some 400 kilometers (250
miles) northeast of Bucharest, called the sentencing ``an abuse of
justice.''
	   It was the third time in recent months when journalists were
sentenced for libel in Romania.
	   Last week, a journalist in northwest Romania began a 10-month
sentence for libel. Two journalists in the northeastern city of
Iasi were also sentenced to jail, but an appeal is pending.

Aston Villa takes lone possession of first place
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Aston Villa took lone possession of first place
Saturday in England's Premier League with a 1-0 victory at
Sheffield Wednesday on a goal in the 37th by Julian Joachim.
	   Nottingham Forest, on the third weekend of the season, defeated
Southampton 2-1 to move into second place with six points, one
behind the leaders. For Southampton, it was a third loss in three
games, leaving the side last in the 20-team league.
	   Newly promoted Charlton, the surprise team of the early season,
held defending league and F.A. Cup champions Arsenal to a 0-0 draw
at the Gunners' north London stadium.
	   Arsenal had to settle for the draw after French international
Emmanuel Petit was sent off in the 58th minute after picking up his
second yellow card.
	   Despite the draw, Charlton _ the leaders after two weeks _
stayed in third place tied with four other clubs with five points:
Wimbledon, Arsenal, Leeds and West Ham.
	   Everton remained without a goal in three games, losing 1-0 to
Tottenham, another troubled side that had dropped its first two
games with coach Christian Gross's job clearly on the line.
	   In other games Saturday in the Premier League: Blackburn 1,
Leicester 0; Coventry 0, West Ham 0; Middlesbrough 1, Derby 1;
Wimbledon 1, Leeds 1.
	   On Sunday, all eyes will be on Ruud Gullit's return to the
Premier League, having swapped the glamor of London for Newcastle
of the industrial northeast England, one of the country's most
passionate soccer areas.
	   Gullit, who replaced Kenny Dalglish in a shock move Thursday,
was fired just over six months ago by Chelsea in a similar
surprise. Newcastle has picked up two points in two games and plays
at home at St. James' Park against Liverpool, which has four points
from its first two games.
	   Liverpool could take over first place with a victory by three
goals or more.
	   In England's first division Saturday: Birmingham 0, Barnsley 0;
Bolton 2, Sheffield United 2; Huddersfield 3, Portsmouth 3; Oxford
United 0, Grimsby 0; Queens Park Rangers 0, Bury 0; Stockport 1,
Crystal Palace 1; Swindon 1, Port Vale 1; Tranmere 1, Bristol City
1; West Brom 2, Norwich 0.
	   In Scotland on Saturday, Rangers defeated St. Johnstone 4-0 on
goals by Andrei Kanchelskis (26th), Giovanni Van Bronckhorst
(45th), Rod Wallace (56th) and Jorg Albertz (penalty 85th).
	   In two other key matches in the Premier Division, Celtic and
Dundee played a 1-1 draw as did Dunfermline and Aberdeen.

Sorensen's 13th place secures tour victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dane Rolf Sorensen finished 13th
Saturday in the sixth and final stage of the Tour of the
Netherlands but his time was good enough to secure a narrow overall
victory.
	   Sorensen, who also won the Dutch tour in 1996, cruised in with
the pack just four seconds behind a breakaway trio led by
Australia's Robbie McEwan.
	   McEwan held off Ukrainian Sergej Oetsjakov and former Tour de
France winner Jan Ullrich of Germany in a sprint for the finish in
Landgraf after a 237 kilometer (149 miles) final stage which
started in the southern town of Venray.
	   Vjatsjeslav Jekimov of Russia finished second overall, just two
seconds behind Sorensen. Belgian Peter van Petegem was third
overall, a further eight seconds back.

	   Details of English Premier League games:
 &UR; Arsenal 0, Charlton 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Newly promoted Charlton managed the first point for a visiting
team at Arsenal's north London ground since Blackburn won there in
December. Arsenal made it easier when French international Emmanuel
Petit was sent off in the 58th on his second yellow card. Charlton,
led by Neil Redfearn at midfield, has yet to give up a goal in
three games.
 &UR; Blackburn 1, Leicester 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Blackburn manager Roy Hodgson made a move that paid off. Instead
of starting 7.25-million pound (dlrs 12 million) transfer Kevin
Davies, he benched Davies and started Kevin Gallacher. Gallacher
scored the winning goal in the 12th minute, beating American
international Kasey Keller. Blackburn had been without a goal in
its first two games and had only one point from a possible six.
 &UR; Coventry 0, West Ham 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   The man of the match was Coventry's Swedish international
goalkeeper Magnus Hedman. He made a string of impressive saves _
two on West Ham's Ian Wright and another on Eyal Berkovic of
Israel. Hedman is expected to be in goal next week for Sweden in
its European qualified against _ of all teams _ England.
 &UR; Everton 0, Tottenham 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   This was seen as a showdown between two clubs likely to be
facing relegation at season's end. Les Ferdinand's goal in the 5th
was the difference, a sweet score after Ferdinand was dropped from
the England team for its European qualifier next week. It also may
have temporarily saved the job of much-criticized Swiss coach
Christian Gross. Everton has yet to score a goal this season.
 &UR; Middlesbrough 1, Derby 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Derby went up 1-0 in the 31st on a goal by Costa Rican
international Paulo Wanchope, but second-half substitute Hamilton
Ricard of Colombia equalized in the 48th for newly promoted
Middlesbrough. Neither side played particularly well and neither
deserved a victory.
 &UR; Sheffield Wednesday 0, Aston Villa 1 (0-1) &QC; 
	   Even without Dwight Yorke, who moved to Manchester United on a
12.6-million pound (dlrs 20.7 million) transfer, Villa moved into
the league lead on Julian Joachim's goal in the 37th. Joachim also
got strong support from inconsistent striker Stan Collymore.
 &UR; Southampton 1, Nottingham Forest 2 (0-0) &QC; 
	   It's been a bad start for Southampton. The club has lost its
first three and is lodged in last place. Forest, on the other hand,
has returned to the Premier League with two victories in its first
three matches. France's Jean Claude Darcheville put Forest ahead in
the 52nd and Steve Stone made it 2-0 in the 68th. Matt Le Tissier
scored Southampton's lone goal on a penalty in the 89th.
 &UR; Wimbledon 1, Leeds 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   It was an uneventful game until Leeds' Lee Bowyer hit a
blistering 20-yard (meter) right-footed volley in the 61st for a
1-0 lead. Then Wimbledon's Michael Hughes got an even better goal _
perhaps the best of the young season _ as he picked up a loose ball
in midfield and then scored on an unstoppable, left-footed shot
from 30 yards (meters).

Small-scale clashes in Hebron as Palestinians warn against settler
</HEADLINE>
expansion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian boys hurled stones and
empty bottles towards Israeli soldiers Saturday as the Palestinian
leadership warned of escalating tensions in the fractious city if a
Jewish enclave there is expanded.
	   Israeli soldiers responded with one round of rubber bullets
towards the Palestinian protesters who ranged in age from ten to
fourteen. No injuries were reported.
	   Tensions in the city have been flaring since the stabbing of a
prominent rabbi in his home nine days ago, apparently by a
Palestinian militant.
	   The Palestinian leadership issued a statement late Friday
condemning Israeli plans to expand and fortify Tel Romeida, the
heavily fortified Jewish enclave in the city center where Rabbi
Shlomo Raanan was killed.
	   ``The Palestinian cabinet warns Israel that building in Tel
Romeida would ignite an already tense situation,'' a statement
issued after a meeting of the Palestinian cabinet read.
	   Responding to Raanan's killing, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu announced this week that Tel Romeida's trailer homes
would be replaced by permanent structures.
	   After the killing, Israeli troops imposed a round-the-clock
curfew on 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled
downtown area near the Jewish settler enclaves.
	   In its statement, the Palestinian cabinet demanded the curfew be
lifted immediately.
	   Most of Hebron's population live in the zone that Israel turned
over to Palestinian control last year. The other 20 percent, where
500 Jewish settlers live among 30,000 Palestinians, is controlled
by Israel. The city is often a flash-point for violence between
Israelis and Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, despite Israeli reports that an agreement over a much
delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank was in reach,
Palestinian officials insisted Israel had not yet accepted a U.S.
proposal to hand over a full 13 percent of the area.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Netanyahu has only
accepted a 13 percent pullback in which 3 percent would be
designated a nature reserve where Palestinians would have virtually
no say over land use, including construction. The Palestinians have
consistently rejected such an arrangement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu did not accept 13 percent as he is
insinuating,'' Erekat told reporters after the cabinet meeting,
``We really urge Mr. Netanyahu to revive the peace process through
a clear cut yes to the American initiative with all its
components.''

Palestinian court sentences two cousins to death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian military court
sentenced two cousins to death Saturday for murdering two brothers
as part of a long standing family feud.
	   Raed and Fuad Abu Sultan, both 24, were given death sentences
for gunning down Majdi al-Khaldi, 32, and Mohammed al-Khaldi, 30,
at a wedding party. Four other members of the Abu Sultan family
were given life sentences for their involvement in the shootings
which also injured a third Abu Sultan brother seriously.
	   The members of both families involved in the attack belonged to
Palestinian security services.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had called on the alleged
killers to be prosecuted Friday during a meeting of the Palestinian
cabinet.
	   Although Palestinian courts have issued several death sentences,
no executions have taken place.

Oliver Bierhoff criticizes Vogts over dismal World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ AC Milan forward Oliver Bierhoff became
the latest player to sharply criticize coach Berti Vogts over
Germany's poor World Cup performance in excerpts of a newspaper
interview released Saturday.
	   Bierhoff told Welt am Sonntag, a Sunday weekly, that Vogts
didn't communicate with his players, banished them to the bench too
quickly and failed to support them enough at soccer's premier
event.
	   ``The players were too often ignored at the World Cup. We
weren't offered reasons for decisions, when we would have liked to
have an answer,'' said Bierhoff.
	   Bierhof, now the team's acting captain, scored three goals and
was one of the few German players to turn in a strong performance
in France.
	   The team, which has captured three World Cups, was blasted by
both the media and public after the second straight quarterfinal
ousting under Vogts. Before that, German fans had been spoiled by
the team reaching four of five finals.
	   Bierhof also found fault with the way Vogts constantly shuffled
his lineup, benching stars like midfielder Andy Moeller, in hopes
of solving the team's lackluster performances in France.
	   ``In the future, I hope Vogts builds a solid foundation and
offers us more certainty than at the World Cup. It can't be that if
you have one poor match, you're already being second-guessed,''
Bierhoff said.
	   Altogether nine players have quit the team since France, many
because their career end was imminent. But two of them, libero Olaf
Thon and midfielder Stefan Reuter, said they refused to continue
playing for Vogts.
	   Defender Christian Woerms also complained in a magazine
interview that Vogts treated the players like they were in
kindergarten in France.
	   One example of the lack of communication, Bierhoff said, was
that players never received an explanation for why their wives
weren't allowed to ride on the team plane to matches.
	   Vogts came under fierce pressure to resign in the aftermath of
the World Cup, but held onto his post after enough of the country's
top soccer names rallied around him.

Havel supports RFE broadcast to Iran, Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel on
Saturday threw his political weight behind controversial plans by
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast from the Czech
territory to Iran and Iraq.
	   In a program aired by Czech radio Saturday, Havel said it was in
American station's competence ``to decide in which languages it
would broadcast.''
	   Late Wednesday, the new Czech Social Democratic government
agreed to allow Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast to
Iran, but not to Iraq as originally planned.
	   Broadcasting to Iran is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
	   The government said it would consider whether to approve
broadcasts to Iraq only if the U.S. government makes an official
request.
	   Premier Milos Zeman, attending the program with Havel Saturday,
said the RFE broadcast ``must be the subject of negotiations.''
	   ``It is hardly possible that the leadership of any radio station
decides on issues related to the security of a country,'' Zeman
said, an apparent reference to recent bomb attacks on American
Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   But Havel said that when the Czechs invited the U.S.-run radio
station to move to Prague, they should have known that it also
would mean leaving some decisions to the radio.
	   ``We can't ask others to spread the message of freedom to us
when we need it and refuse to let them spread it when somebody else
is involved,'' Havel said, echoing previously aired editorial
opinion.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty began transmitting from Munich,
Germany, in 1951, broadcasting uncensored news to Soviet-controlled
countries behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War.
	   The station moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995, following
communism's collapse.
	   In May, U.S. lawmakers approved the station's plan to create new
services that would be beamed into Iran and Iraq.
	   Despite the previous government's favorable stance, the new
leftist government of Premier Zeman has had second thoughts,
fearing the broadcast may make Prague the target of terrorist
attacks.
	   On Friday, Foreign Minister Jan Kavan said his government would
evaluate the objectivity of RFE's broadcast to Iran by the end of
the year, indicating final approval still depends on whether the
broadcast meets the government's standards.
	   ``The criterion will be whether the broadcast is balanced,
objective, and not tending to be ... hostile toward the Iranian
government,'' Kavan said.
	   The statement drew criticism among politicians as well as
independent analysts.
	   ``We're unable to set the criteria of balance and objectivity
even for our media, so I wonder how the government will request
that from the RFE,'' the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Havel's
spokesman Ladislav Spacek as saying.
	   Analyst Petr Fiala said it is not appropriate for the government
to evaluate the contents of RFE's broadcasts.
	   ``It broadcasts to countries where it's impossible to tell the
thruth,'' Fiala told the daily. ``We have enough experience with
that.''
	   Saturday's radio program was recorded on Tuesday in Prague's
military hospital where Havel was recovering from an abdominal
surgery. He was released from the hospital on Friday.

Russian political crisis eases, prime minister promises no retreat

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government said Saturday there
will be no return to the Soviet system and the hard-line opposition
signaled it was ready to compromise with Boris Yeltsin to restore
political calm.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
declared on national television.
	   His assurances followed days of frenzied negotiations in which
the government appeared ready to take drastic actions to restore
economic calm, including reimposing Soviet-style controls on prices
and the exchange rate.
	   Chernomyrdin, in a scripted interview with journalists, pledged
to keep the ruble convertible, shore up the wobbly banking system
and protect depositors.
	   ``The main thing is to make sure people don't suffer,'' he said,
looking stolidly into the camera. ``For this we should use our
power, and we will use it as much as necessary.''
	   ``You can be calm. You will get your savings,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin reinstated Chernomyrdin as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline. The
crisis of confidence climaxed Thursday in a wave of rumors that
even Yeltsin would resign.
	   But the president, with typical bluster, sought to squash such
speculation by going on television Friday to declare he would not
step down.
	   ``I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to resign,'' he said.
``Considering my personality, I think it is impossible.
Impossible.''
	   The opposition-led parliament, meanwhile, is seeking maximum
political advantage from the crisis and has demanded a series of
concessions from the Kremlin in return for confirming Chernomyrdin.
	   The outlines of an agreement were reportedly reached Saturday,
though the details were not immediately released.
	   Participants said the deal in essence will give parliament more
say over key Cabinet appointments and government policies, and will
require some Constitutional amendments.
	   The Constitution currently gives parliament fewer powers than is
common in the West, and lawmakers are mostly reduced to blocking
the president's policies, not legislating their own.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to parliament's lower house,
said the Communists and other opponents had caved in on one of
their main demands _ that they be given new powers immediately.
Instead, he said the deal would be put in effect by normal
legislative processes.
	   ``In order not to fuel tension, we would not immediately
consider specific amendments,'' Kotenkov told a news conference.
``We need a government now, and then we shall see.''
	   The lower house of parliament, the State Duma, is scheduled to
debate Chernomyrdin's appointment on Monday.
	   As part of the compromise to approve Chernomyrdin, Kotenkov said
the Duma would promise not to hold a no-confidence motion in the
government for one year and Yeltsin would refrain from shuffling
the Cabinet for the same period.
	   Yeltsin also promised to accept lawmakers' proposals on Cabinet
appointments _ but only after Chernomyrdin is confirmed, Kotenkov
said. That could mean the appointment of more Communists to the
Cabinet.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov described the plan as a kind
of ``renovation of the Constitution'' that would place the
executive branch under the control of parliament.
	   ``At the same time it will restore vertical, strong, capable and
authoritative executive power,'' he said in remarks broadcast on
ORT television.
	   Meanwhile, economic uncertainty continued though there were
signs the anxiety of the last two weeks was also easing.
	   The ruble appeared to be gaining strength at exchange booths
around Moscow, climbing from a low of 12 a few days ago to an
average of 9 on Saturday.
	   Some stores reported brisk sales of durable items as shoppers
with excess rubles sought to spend them in case they lose more
value.
	   But ironically, most people waiting to change money at private
exchange booths on Saturday said they were buying rubles, not
dollars. And after a week in which banks reported a shortage of
dollars, a number of booths posted signs saying they had run out of
rubles.
	   Cash transactions in dollars have been illegal in recent years
and anyone seeking to make purchases must change dollar savings
into rubles first.
	   Consumer prices were rising in some shops while steady in
others. Chernomyrdin has formed a special team to keep an eye on
price increases and prevent what the Russians call ``speculation''
_ hiking prices unfairly.
	   ``The government has decided to use its powers to make sure no
one takes unfair advantage of the situation,'' Chernomyrdin said in
his television remarks.

Sorensen's 13th place secures tour victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dane Rolf Sorensen finished 13th
in the main pack Saturday in the sixth and final stage, good enough
for a two-second overall victory over Vjatsjeslav Jekimov of Russia
in the Tour of the Netherlands.
	   Sorensen, who also won the Dutch tour in 1996, cruised in just
four seconds behind a breakaway trio led by Australia's Robbie
McEwan.
	   McEwan held off Ukrainian Sergej Oetsjakov and former Tour de
France winner Jan Ullrich of Germany in a finishing sprint in
Landgraf after a 237-kilometer (149-mile) final stage which started
in the southern town of Venray.
	   Vjatsjeslav Jekimov of Russia finished second, eight second
ahead of Belgian Peter van Petegem.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ UEFA is threatening to move the 2000
European Championship out of Belgium and the Netherlands because of
delays in their preparations for the tournament, Belgian newspapers
reported Saturday.
	   Reports in three Belgian papers quoted an anonymous senior UEFA
official saying the Euro 2000 finals may be moved to England or
Germany if the Dutch and Belgians do not speed up preparations.
	   The official was cited saying the Dutch and Belgium governments
appeared to lack enthusiasm for the tournament. He reportedly said
the two countries would be given six-to-eight weeks to furnish UEFA
with guarantees that the necessary preparations would be made.
	   Europe's soccer authorities are particularly concerned about
plans for policing the tournament and the slow progress of work to
modernize stadiums in the Belgium cities of Bruges, Liege and
Charleroi, the reports said.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The staccato crack of automatic weapons
fire mixed with the muffled thud of mortar rounds near central
Kinshasa on Saturday, shattering an otherwise quiet day in Congo's
already tense capital.
	   Although Kinshasa was largely quiet for much of Saturday,
firefights on the city's west side near downtown broke out shortly
before a nightly curfew went into effect at 6 p.m.
	   Elsewhere, decaying corpses littered the streets of the
capital's eastern suburbs _ the aftermath of days of combat.
	   Fighting in the city's eastern Kingasani and Masina districts
tapered off to little more than sporadic machine-gun fire.

retried on war crimes charges stemming from the 1991 war between
Croatian forces and Serb rebels, the state-run HINA news agency
reported.
	   The three, who were identified as Pero K., 45, Vujo H., 45, and
Zeljko K., 47, were among 19 Serbs been convicted in absentia in
1995 of killing Croats and sentenced to prison terms between 11 and
20 years.
	   The 19 are from the village of Sodolovci in the region known as
Eastern Slavonia, which rebel Serbs seized in 1991.
	   When the region reverted to government rule in January, the
group appealed the sentence and was granted a retrial.
	   U.N. officials, who administered the area during the transition
to Croat rule, insisted that the defendants remain free during the
retrial.
	   But the Supreme Court recently upheld the local district
attorney's request to have the group detained during the trial.
	   A top local Serb official, Vojislav Stanimirovic, protested the
arrests Saturday, saying they took place ``despite all promises by
Croatian officials given to representatives of the international
community and to Serb leaders that it won't happen.''
	   Stanimirovic and other Serb officials had given personal
assurances to the suspects that they would not be arrested until a
solution was found.
	   Police issued warrants for the 19 _ eight of whom are believed
to have fled to neighboring Serb-led Yugoslavia _ and then detained
the three Friday evening.
	   Another member of the group, Goran Vusurovic, surrendered
earlier and is being retried.
	   International officials based in Croatia, who are monitoring the
country's treatment of minority Serbs, did not comment on the case
Saturday.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian boys hurled stones and
empty bottles towards Israeli soldiers Saturday and the Palestinian
leadership warned of escalating tensions in the fractious city if a
Jewish enclave there is expanded.
	   Israeli soldiers responded with one round of rubber bullets
towards the Palestinian protesters, who ranged in age from 10 to
14. No injuries were reported.
	   Tensions in the city have been flaring since the stabbing of a
prominent rabbi in his home nine days ago, apparently by a
Palestinian militant.
	   The Palestinian leadership issued a statement late Friday
condemning Israeli plans to expand and fortify Tel Romeida, the
already heavily fortified Jewish enclave in the city center where
Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was killed.
	   ``The Palestinian cabinet warns Israel that building in Tel
Romeida would ignite an already tense situation,'' a statement
issued after a meeting of the Palestinian cabinet read.
	   Responding to Raanan's killing, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu announced this week that Tel Romeida's trailer homes
would be replaced by buildings.
	   After the killing, Israeli troops imposed a round-the-clock
curfew on 30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled
downtown near the Jewish settler enclaves.
	   In its statement, the Palestinian cabinet demanded that the
curfew be lifted immediately.
	   Most of Hebron's population lives in the zone that Israel turned
over to Palestinian control last year. The other 20 percent, where
500 Jewish settlers live among 30,000 Palestinians, is controlled
by Israel. The city is often a flash-point for violence between
Israelis and Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, despite Israeli reports that an agreement over a
long-delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank was in reach,
Palestinian officials insisted that Israel had not yet accepted a
U.S. proposal to hand over a full 13 percent of the area.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Netanyahu has only
accepted a 13 percent pullback in which 3 percent would be
designated a nature reserve where Palestinians would have virtually
no say over land use, including construction. The Palestinians have
consistently rejected such an arrangement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu did not accept 13 percent as he is
insinuating,'' Erekat said after the cabinet meeting, ``We really
urge Mr. Netanyahu to revive the peace process through a clear-cut
yes to the American initiative with all its components.''

Jayasuriya and de Silva put Sri Lanka in control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; -

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Left-hander Sanath Jayasuriya hit a brilliant 213
and vice captain Aravinda de Silva, a fine 125 not out, to put Sri
Lanka in control of the one-off test against England at the Oval
Saturday.
	   After an afternoon of hurricane batting, England, finally got
rid of Jayasuriya, but de Silva and skipper Arjuna Ranatunga, 50
not out, compounded the home side's day, taking Sri Lanka to 446
for three at stumps on the third day.
	   Sri Lanka, took charge of the test in the 108th over, cruising
past England's first innings while maintaining a run rate of 4.05.
	   England, scored at a rate of 2.8 over 10 hours to post 445 in
158.3 overs, thanks to centuries by Graeme Hick and John Crawley,
who hit 107 and 156 not out respectively.
	   The test has so far belonged to Jayasuriya, who gave the Sri
Lankans the kick-start they needed to wrest the initiative after
Ranatunga had sent England into bat.
	   Jayasuriya, put to sword the hapless England bowlers, making
them look mere pedestrian on a wicket that has continued to play
true.
	   Having scored 59 out of Sri Lanka's overnight 79 for one,
Jayasuriya, continued from where he left off on the second day,
brandishing his willow for 33 boundaries and a six off medium
paceman Dominic Cork over square leg.
	   Jayasuriya, whose 278-ball innings was his first hundred in 18
innings since his 199 against India in Colombo in August 1997,
dominated a record third wicket stand against all countries.
	   Jayasuriya and de Silva, coming together after Sri Lanka lost
Mahela Jayawardene (nine), in the sixth over of the morning, batted
together for just under four hours for 243 runs, to improve on
their 218 against India last year.
	   Jayasuriya's double-century was the first in 11 years at the
Oval since Pakistani Javed Miandad's 260 at in 1987 and the sixth
by a Sri Lanka in the 87 tests over 16 years.
	   Jayasuriya, who missed out on Brian Lara's world record 375 by
36 runs when he scored a career-best 340 against India last year,
had his eyes set on it once again, until he fell to Ben Hollioake.
	   Trying to pull the medium paceman, Jayasuriya, gloved a leg side
catch to wicketkeeper Alec Stewart, 13 minutes into the post tea
session. His 62nd test innings lasted 346 minutes.
	   England, took the second new ball immediately, but any hopes of
making any further inroad to Sri Lanka batting was short lived.
	   De Silva and Ranatunga, with 156 tests between them, continued
with the leather-hunt, figuring in an unfinished 118-run stand for
the fourth wicket.
	   De Silva, who became the first Sri Lankan to score 5000 runs in
his 74th test, launched a calculated assault on the toothless
England attack, after being completely overshadowed by his junior
partner, Jayasuriya.
	   He reached his 17th century off 174 balls with 12 boundaries and
then watched Ranatunga take England apart in his 130 minutes at the
crease.
	   De Silva, was given a life when Stewart dropped him off Fraser
when the right-hander was on 107.
	   Ranatunga, cashed in on England's misery, hammering seven fours
and a six off leg pinner Ian Salisbury on the way to his 33rd half
century in his 82nd test.
	   England, conceded 45 fours and two sixes on a day they dismissed
just two Sri Lankan batsmen.

NBA ready to sacrifice games in labor dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Despite never having had to cancel a game
because of a players strike or lockout, the American National
Basektball Association appears ready to sacrifice the streak.
	   The league's perfect record of 35,001 straight games dating back
to 1946 went into serious peril last week when chances dimmed for a
resumption of collective bargaining talks between the NBA club
owners and players union before the scheduled opening of training
camps.
	   ``At some point you have to elect to deal with the lesser of two
evils, and I think we've concluded that to once again make a bad
economic deal is even worse that what'll flow from losing games,''
deputy commissioner Russ Granik told The Associated Press, strongly
indicating that the league-imposed lockout will last into the fall
and perhaps the winter.
	   ``What's changed here is there's a sense that we're not going to
do whatever it takes to make a deal. We've got to have a fair
one.''
	   In other words, the NBA is prepared _ some would say planning _
to sacrifice games in November and December in the hopes it will
put pressure on players as they miss paychecks, leading to a better
collective bargaining agreement for the owners.
	   ``There are different types of lost games,'' Granik said,
comparing the NBA's labor woes to U.S. Major League Baseball (MLB)
and its disastrous players strike of 1994, which started during the
final stages of the season and forced the cancellation of the
post-season playoffs and championship series.
	   ``Obviously here, ours, if we lose games, will be at the
beginning of the season. It might go all season, but at least it's
not going to start at the climax of the season and go from there,''
Granik said.
	   An arbitration hearing on whether owners should have to pay
guaranteed contracts during the lockout is on a nine-day hiatus and
isn't scheduled to end until Sept. 8. Post-hearing legal briefs
must be filed by Sept. 15, and arbitrator John Feerick will then
have 30 days to render his verdict.
	   By that time, the Oct. 6 start of training camps already may
have passed.
	   The lockout will enter its third month Tuesday with the sides
having met for formal bargaining a grand total of one time during
that span. That session ended abruptly when the club owners walked
out of the room upon hearing the players' latest proposal.
	   Another bargaining session in June _ eight days before the
lockout began _ ended after only 30 minutes when the players
declared they would not even listen to a proposal that includes a
weakening of the ``Larry Bird exception'' _ the rule that allows
teams to exceed the salary cap to retain their own free agents.
	   Two months of rhetoric, harsh words and allegations of delaying
tactics haven't brought any progress. September will begin with the
sides far apart on the key issue _ an economic system that will
slow down or limit the growth of player salaries enough to make the
owners happy.
	   A deal would have to be in place by mid-October, at the absolute
latest, to save the 82-game season that is scheduled to start Nov.
4.
	   Even then, it would lead to a three-week scramble to open camps,
sign players, make trades and sneak in an exhibition game or two.
	   The owners have proposed several changes to the current
operating system, asking for an eight-year deal.
	   Proposals have included several different salary limitation
mechanisms: A phase-in of a ``hard'' salary cap with almost no
exceptions, a maximum salary of 30 percent of the cap (excepting
players already over that threshold, but limiting their raises to 5
percent), a phase-out of the ``Bird'' exception that would include
a grandfather clause for current 10-year veterans, and an
elimination of the dlrs 1 million salary cap exception that each
team can use every other year, regardless of whether they are over
the salary cap, to sign an additional player.
	   The owners had the right to toss out the old collective
bargaining agreement if player salaries exceeded 51.8 percent of
basketball-related income (BRI), and that number jumped to 57
percent in the 1997-98 season.
	   ``I can see what (MLB) suffered, and all we can do is hope that
fans will understand the situation that owners find themselves
in,'' Granik said. ``And I think the fans do realize that it can't
make sense for top NBA players to be making 20-25 million dollars a
year when top players in other sports are making between 8 and 12
million dollars.
	   ``When it comes to missing games, fans don't want to hear about
it. But the best we can do is try and explain it as well as we can
and hope they'll understand the problem.''

Court orders police to hunt for former ``bandit queen''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ A court trying a bandit leader-turned
politician issued nonbailable arrest warrants for her Saturday and
warned she would be declared an `absconder' if she did not appear
to face trial early September, court officials said.
	   A police team sent last week to Devi's New Delhi residence from
Kanpur, an industrial city in the northern Uttar Pradesh state
where the trial is being held, could not find her. Another team was
to travel to the Indian capital Sunday, officials said. Kanpur is
500 kilometers (310 miles) away from New Delhi.
	   ``Once Phoolan Devi is declared an absconder, all police
stations will be asked to nab her by any means and the police or
any citizen of India can arrest her or even shoot her down if she
tries to evade arrest,'' prosecution counsel Vijay Narain Singh
Senger told The Associated Press.
	   The judge ordered the police commissioner of New Delhi to help
the provincial police team arrest Devi and asked the team to raid
three places apart from her residence, including the home of one of
her party colleagues.
	   Devi's husband Umed Singh said last week his wife was in the
central Madhya Pradesh state on work.
	   The 25 cases being heard by the court _ all of them part of a
staggered 15-year-old trial _ include charges of mass murder,
abduction and robbery, all of them denied by Devi.
	   Devi belongs to the low-caste Mallah community of boatpeople.
The cases against her include the 1981 massacre of 21 men, 18 of
them from the warrior caste of Thakurs, allegedly sprayed with
bullets at close range in Behmai village in northern India.
	   She allegedly killed the men to avenge her alleged rape by them
in 1980. Devi denies the charge.
	   Devi was in prison for 11 years without charges after she
surrendered with her gang in 1983 before the top elected official
of Madhya Pradesh in central India in an amnesty deal. She was
released on parole in 1994. Soon after, she joined a socialist
political party and became a lawmaker in 1996.
	   Devi gained worldwide fame with the release of ``Bandit Queen,''
a 1993 movie about her life as leader of a band of feared bandits
in the ravines of northern India.

Havel supports RFE broadcast to Iran, Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel on
Saturday threw his political weight behind controversial plans by
Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast from the Czech
territory to Iran and Iraq.
	   In a program aired by Czech radio Saturday, Havel said it was in
American station's competence ``to decide in which languages it
would broadcast.''
	   Late Wednesday, the new Czech Social Democratic government
agreed to allow Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to broadcast to
Iran, but not to Iraq as originally planned.
	   Broadcasting to Iran is scheduled to begin Tuesday.
	   The government said it would consider whether to approve
broadcasts to Iraq only if the U.S. government makes an official
request.
	   Premier Milos Zeman, attending the program with Havel Saturday,
said the RFE broadcast ``must be the subject of negotiations.''
	   ``It is hardly possible that the leadership of any radio station
decides on issues related to the security of a country,'' Zeman
said, an apparent reference to recent bomb attacks on American
Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.
	   But Havel said that when the Czechs invited the U.S.-run radio
station to move to Prague, they should have known that it also
would mean leaving some decisions to the radio.
	   ``We can't ask others to spread the message of freedom to us
when we need it and refuse to let them spread it when somebody else
is involved,'' Havel said, echoing previously aired editorial
opinion.
	   Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty began transmitting from Munich,
Germany, in 1951, broadcasting uncensored news to Soviet-controlled
countries behind the Iron Curtain during the Cold War.
	   The station moved its headquarters to Prague in 1995, following
communism's collapse.
	   In May, U.S. lawmakers approved the station's plan to create new
services that would be beamed into Iran and Iraq.
	   Despite the previous government's favorable stance, the new
leftist government of Premier Zeman has had second thoughts,
fearing the broadcast may make Prague the target of terrorist
attacks.
	   On Friday, Foreign Minister Jan Kavan said his government would
evaluate the objectivity of RFE's broadcast to Iran by the end of
the year, indicating final approval still depends on whether the
broadcast meets the government's standards.
	   ``The criterion will be whether the broadcast is balanced,
objective, and not tending to be ... hostile toward the Iranian
government,'' Kavan said.
	   The statement drew criticism among politicians as well as
independent analysts.
	   ``We're unable to set the criteria of balance and objectivity
even for our media, so I wonder how the government will request
that from the RFE,'' the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes quoted Havel's
spokesman Ladislav Spacek as saying.
	   Analyst Petr Fiala said it is not appropriate for the government
to evaluate the contents of RFE's broadcasts.
	   ``It broadcasts to countries where it's impossible to tell the
thruth,'' Fiala told the daily. ``We have enough experience with
that.''
	   Saturday's radio program was recorded on Tuesday in Prague's
military hospital where Havel was recovering from an abdominal
surgery. He was released from the hospital on Friday.

Arab League is trying to talk to US, Britain over Lockerbie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BASSEM MROUE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League is trying to mediate between
Libya and the United States and Britain over arrangements for the
Lockerbie suspects to stand trial, League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Saturday.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he had approached the U.S. and British
embassies in Cairo _ where the 22-member League is based _ and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan with a view to obtaining answers to
Libya's questions on the U.N. Security Council plan for a trial.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to suspend
sanctions against Libya once it hands over two men charged with the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has accepted the principle of such
a trial, but has called for negotiations with the United States and
Britain on the details of the trial and the suspects' care once
they have been transferred to Dutch custody.
	   Spokesmen for the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign
Office rebuffed Gadhafi's request late Friday, saying that the
terms of the U.N. resolution were non-negotiable.
	   Abdel-Meguid told The Associated Press that so far the U.S. and
British embassies in Cairo have not responded. Spokesmen for the
embassies were not immediately available for comment.
	   ``In order to hand over the suspects to the Netherlands, there
must arrangements,'' he said. ``The goal of these arrangements
should be guarantee a fair trial, the safety of the suspects and
their right to defend themselves.''
	   Libya needed to know how the suspects would be handed over to
the Dutch and whether they would be able to appeal the court's
decision, he said.
	   ``The Security Council resolution, in my opinion, does not
answer these questions. Because in order for the hand-over to take
place, we _ as Arabs and Libyans _ should know exactly what are the
procedures that will be followed.''
	   Under the U.S.-British plan, the suspects could not be
extradited once they have arrived in the Netherlands and, if
convicted, they would serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   The secretary-general recalled that the idea of a trial in a
third country was first proposed by Libya, with Arab League
support, four years ago.
	   Until this month, the United States and Britain have insisted
that the suspects be tried on their territory. Libya said the
accused would not receive a fair trial in America or Scotland.
	   The Security Council imposed the sanctions on Libya in 1992.
They ban air travel to and from the country, prohibit arms sales,
freeze some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   In September, a meeting of the League's foreign ministers in
Cairo urged member states to defy the sanctions where they were
humanitarian or religious justifications, such as for flights of
medicine or pilgrims to Mecca.

Police should shoot to kill armed criminals, Brazilian official
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A senior Brazilian state official
said police officers should aim to kill criminals in shoot-outs, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``A bandit who fires at police officers does not deserve to
survive. He should be eliminated from society,'' Noaldo Alves da
Silva, Rio's secretary for public security, was quoted as saying in
the daily Folha De Sao Paulo.
	   Silva's comments come at a time of public debate over a 50
percent increase in killings by police in Rio. Human rights
activists were critical.
	   ``He is saying that police should shoot first and ask questions
later,'' said James Cavallaro, director of Human Rights
Watch/Americas for Brazil. ``This flies in the face of
international human rights and unfortunately is confirmation of
what has been de facto policy in Rio de Janeiro for some time.''
	   No one at the state Public Security ministry was available for
comment Saturday.
	   The number of people killed by Rio police has risen from an
average of 16 a month to 32 a month in the last three years, since
the introduction of a program giving officers bonuses for bravery,
the newspaper said. The government canceled the program two months
ago.

Nonaligned summit opens in South Africa

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report Kabila not coming to summit; ADDS comment
from Rwandan foreign minister on Rwandan intervention in Congo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DURBAN, South Africa (AP) _ The Nonaligned Movement should
defend weak countries against domination by strong ones, South
Africa's foreign minister said Saturday as he opened a summit of
the 113-member group.
	   Welcoming ambassadors and senior officials to the 12th summit of
the Nonaligned Movement, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said it should
ensure that it places the interests and ambitions of the poor
firmly on the agenda of the international community. But beyond
setting an agenda to help poor southern hemisphere countries, a
peace initiative to end the Congo war was expected to be held in
conjunction with the summit.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan plans to go and, on the
sidelines, discuss the Congo war and the faltering peace process in
Angola with a variety of leaders.
	   Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana told reporters in
Durban that his government would send troops into Congo if peace
efforts fail.
	   He said his government would have ``no choice but to intervene
militarily to rescue Rwandese who are living in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, as well as some Congolese ... who do not
support the killings or any form of segregation.''
	   Fifty-one heads of state have confirmed they are attending the
summit. Congo President Laurent Kabila, locked in a war against
rebels allegedly backed by Rwanda and Uganda, had planned to come
but then decided to send his foreign minister, Jean-Charles Okoto
Lolakombe, instead, summit organizers said.
	   Kabila is backed by troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia. On
Friday, a spokesman for the rebels' Congolese Rally for Democracy
said a rebel delegation would attend the summit, the South African
Press Association reported.
	   The heads of state are to meet at the summit on Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Created during the Cold War by developing countries to fend off
domination by Washington or Moscow, the Nonaligned Movement is
calling for a greater voice for poor countries in the U.N. Security
Council, for relief of overwhelming foreign debt and for improved
trade relationships with the West.

Former Argentine economy minister to advise Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The architect of Argentina's
recent sweeping free-market reforms was to travel Russia on Sunday
as advisor to President Boris Yeltsin's economic team.
	   Former economy minister Domingo Cavallo, now an opposition
congressman, was invited by Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to advise his government following a recommendation
from the International Monetary Fund, said a Cavallo aide.
	   Cavallo was lecturing to fellow economists in Cordoba, his
hometown in central Argentina, when he received Chernomyrdin's
invitation, said former Deputy Economy Minister Carlos Sanchez.
	   ``Cavallo pulled Argentina out of hyper-inflation, and that was
the key to IMF's suggestion that he advise the Russians,'' the
Diarios y Noticias news agency quoted Sanchez as saying. ``There
are things you have to live through, that you can't learn in
books.''
	   The Harvard-trained economist was named minister in 1991, when
inflation was running at 84 percent a year. By 1995, it was down to
1 percent a year and the peso was firmly pegged to the dollar.
	   The core of Cavallo's plan was the privatization of virtually
all state-owned companies, including railroads, utilities, the
airline and the giant oil company YPF.
	   President Carlos Menem fired Cavallo in July 1995 after a series
of policy clashes. Cavallo later accused members of the government
of corruption and formed an opposition party. He was elected to
Congress in 1997.

Family caught in politics of U.S. trade embargo against Cuba
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IAN JAMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ A U.S. Customs inspector pulled dozens of dlrs 5,
dlrs 10, dlrs 20 and dlrs 50 bills from bank envelopes Raymond
Castro was carrying in his fanny pack and she counted out dlrs
3,510 on a table in front of him.
	   Castro hadn't expected that taking the money on a flight to Cuba
would pose any problem. Much of it was for his family _ a cousin,
his wife and their 17-year-old son who were granted U.S. visas and
needed the money to leave the island.
	   But the Customs inspector said that taking the money would
violate the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. So the government
seized the cash _ nearly half of the amount Castro took for the
trip to Havana with his sister, Clara, and son, Kenneth.
	   Smuggling illegal amounts of money onto the island is a
lucrative business for those who can make it past inspectors. But
some critics of the embargo say the Customs' seizures hurt Cubans
and Cuban Americans like Castro who are simply trying to help their
families.
	   ``The embargo hurts the little people, both here and in Cuba,''
said Elena Freyre, Florida chairwoman of Americans for Humanitarian
Trade with Cuba. ``It isn't hurting the Cuban government.''
	   Her view is anomalous in South Florida, where many Cuban exile
leaders stand behind the 35-year-old embargo as the best way to
force a peaceful transition to democracy on the island.
	   Castro, who is unrelated to Cuban President Fidel Castro, said
he is not interested in discussing politics. He simply wants his
money back.
	   ``I wasn't hiding anything,'' said Castro, a 46-year-old
salesman from the Miami suburb of Hialeah. ``I do things the way
they're supposed to be done. I'm an American citizen. I've been
here almost 20 years. And they treated me like a criminal. They
treat Cubans like criminals when they're going to their own
country.''
	   On that day last month at Miami International Airport, Castro
said, he declared all the money in his possession. But the
inspector told him each of them could take only dlrs 100 for each
day spent in Cuba. That meant dlrs 2,000 total for the 10-day trip
for Castro and Kenneth, dlrs 2,100 for Castro's sister who planned
to stay longer.
	   ``You guys wanted the embargo. Now, you cannot break the
embargo,'' Castro recalled the inspector telling him. ``This
money's going to be seized.''
	   Ms. Castro, overcome with emotion, wept. Her brother defiantly
took down the inspector's badge number. Then he was ordered to
remove his shoes and was frisked.
	   ``That really ticked me off because that's my money,'' he said.
``I worked for that money. I wanted that money to help my family.''
	   U.S. authorities say they were simply being thorough in their
job. Inspectors have found money stashed in bottles of shampoo,
inside boxes of cookies and even inside passengers' underwear.
	   ``We'll search anybody to the extent we feel is necessary to
make sure they're adhering to the embargo,'' said Customs spokesman
Michael Sheehan.
	   Had Castro obtained an affidavit with the visa numbers of his
cousin and his cousin's wife, according to the regulations, he
could have sent them up to dlrs 2,000 in special one-time
immigration remittances. But Castro said he was not aware of the
rule.
	   His cousin, whose family of three subsists on roughly dlrs 10 a
month, is desperate because their visas could expire in a matter of
months, Castro said. The family still can't afford the more than
dlrs 800 per person needed for airplane tickets, fees for health
exams and exit documents required by the Cuban government, he said.
	   Some of the so-called ``mulas'' _ or mules who transport money
to the island for a fee _ advertise their services discreetly in
Miami's Spanish-language newspapers. The smuggling operations
continue despite efforts by U.S. authorities to stop the cash flow.
	   Customs records show the U.S. government has seized money from
Cuba-bound passengers at least 37 times between Oct. 1 and July 31,
collecting more than dlrs 178,000. That total is slightly higher
than the per-year average confiscated during the previous three
fiscal years.
	   But the Customs Service, which enforces the embargo against Cuba
on behalf of the U.S. Treasury Department, maintains that its
inspectors haven't stepped up their efforts since the resumption of
direct flights to Cuba this summer.
	   The Castros' July 15 flight happened to be the first nonstop
commercial flight to Cuba since 1996 when the U.S. government
banned direct trips in an attempt to punish the Cuban government
for shooting down two unarmed civilian planes. They belonged to a
Miami-based exile group.
	   President Bill Clinton lifted the ban after the January visit of
Pope John Paul II to the island. The new direct flights, which
allow passengers to avoid stops in the Bahamas or Mexico, were
departing from Miami five times a week this month. And travel
agents said there was a demand for even more flights.
	   Castro has asked the Customs service to return his money.
	   Whether he is successful is an open question. Customs officials
decide on a case-by-case basis whether to return all or part of any
cash seizure.
	   Castro said he saved much of the money from his own earnings
from selling windows and sliding-glass doors. Friends and family
also pitched in.
	   When he told his cousin that the money was seized, ``the guy
started crying,'' he said.
	   ``I said, 'Have faith,''' Castro recalled. ``'As soon as I come
back, I'm going to try to bring you the money.''

Nicaraguan police uncover long-distance phone fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaraguan police have found that a
fraudulent telephone company was bilking the state communications
concern of millions of dollars in long-distance calls, an official
said Saturday.
	   Norman Talavera, a spokesman for the government's Communications
Enterprise, said that the Wireless Communications Co. has been
costing the monopoly around dlrs 400,00 a month in lost calls.
	   The government provides all communications services in
Nicaragua, but leases permits for a few private outfits to operate,
usually on long distance service.
	   Wireless Communications received a permit about a year ago for
long-distance data transmission, but instead sold voice long
distance service, Talavera said.
	   The only outfit that can legally provide voice service is the
government, he said.
	   Police are looking for at least two company executives for
questioning.
	   Talavera did not say how the scam was discovered.

Leftist rebels ambush police patrol in Mexico, two killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen suspected of being leftist rebels
ambushed a police patrol in a town in Mexico's Pacific Coast state
of Guerrero, killing two officers and wounding seven, a state
spokeswoman said Saturday.
	   Alejandra Ortiz Ochoa of the State Judicial Police said that
investigators believe Friday's ambush was carried out by the
Revolutionary People's Army, a leftist guerrilla group active
mainly in Guerrero.
	   Ortiz said the officers were ambushed on a road between the
towns of Las Cruces and Las Mesas, some 75 miles (120 kilometers)
south of the beach resort of Acapulco.
	   The government news agency Notimex quoted Ortiz as saying that
the Las Cruces police chief and his deputy were killed instantly
when the gunmen opened fire.
	   Ortiz said the gunmen fled, and police were searching for them.
	   The Revolutionary People's Army is a shadowy group that surfaced
about two years ago with the aim of setting up a Marxist government
in Mexico. A number of people have been killed in attacks on police
installations and sporadic clashes with troops.

Arab League is trying to talk to U.S., Britain about Lockerbie
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League is trying to mediate between
Libya and the United States and Britain over arrangements for the
Lockerbie suspects to stand trial, League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Saturday.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he approached the U.S. and British embassies
in Cairo, where the 22-member League is based, and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan with a view to obtaining answers to
Libya's questions on the U.N. Security Council plan for a trial.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to suspend
sanctions against Libya once it hands over two men charged with the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for suspects Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi
and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah to be tried in the Netherlands by a panel
of three Scottish judges according to Scottish law.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has accepted the principle of such
a trial, but called for negotiations with the United States and
Britain on the details of the trial and the suspects' care once
they have been transferred to Dutch custody.
	   Spokesmen for the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign
Office rebuffed Gadhafi's request late Friday, saying that the
terms of the U.N. resolution were non-negotiable.
	   Abdel-Meguid told The Associated Press that the U.S. and British
embassies in Cairo have not responded. Spokesmen for the embassies
were not immediately available for comment.
	   ``In order to hand over the suspects to the Netherlands, there
must arrangements,'' he said. ``The goal of these arrangements
should be to guarantee a fair trial, the safety of the suspects and
their right to defend themselves.''
	   Libya needed to know how the suspects would be handed over to
the Dutch and whether they would be able to appeal the court's
decision, he said.
	   ``The Security Council resolution, in my opinion, does not
answer these questions. Because in order for the hand-over to take
place, we _ as Arabs and Libyans _ should know exactly what are the
procedures that will be followed.''
	   Under the U.S.-British plan, the suspects could not be
extradited once they have arrived in the Netherlands and, if
convicted, they would serve their sentences in a British prison.
	   The secretary-general recalled that the idea of a trial in a
third country was first proposed by Libya, with Arab League
support, four years ago.
	   Until this month, the United States and Britain have insisted
that the suspects be tried on their territory. Libya said the
accused would not receive a fair trial in America or Scotland.
	   The Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992. They
ban air travel to and from the country, prohibit arms sales, freeze
some assets abroad and limit sales of oil equipment.
	   In September, a meeting of the League's foreign ministers in
Cairo urged member states to defy the sanctions where there were
humanitarian or religious justifications, such as for flights of
medicine or pilgrims to Mecca.

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A Palestinian military court
sentenced three cousins to death Saturday for murdering two
brothers as part of a long standing family feud.
	   Raed and Faris Abu Sultan, both 24, and Mohammed Abu Sultan, 29,
were given death sentences for gunning down Majdi al-Khaldi, 32,
and Mohammed al-Khaldi, 30, at a wedding party Thursday. One member
of the Abu Sultan family was given a life sentence and another
sentenced to five years in prison for their involvement in the
shootings which also injured a third al-Khaladi brother seriously.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had called on the alleged
killers to be prosecuted Friday during a meeting of the Palestinian
cabinet.
	   The members of both families involved in the attack worked for
Palestinian security services.
	   The al-Khaladi family are prominent members of Arafat's Fatah
faction and Saturday night armed Fatah members spray painted walls
in Gaza City calling for a general strike as a symbol of mourning
for the slain brothers.
	   Although Palestinian courts have issued several death sentences,
no executions have taken place.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government declared Saturday that
there will be no return to the Soviet system and the hard-line
opposition signaled it was ready to compromise with Boris Yeltsin
to restore political calm.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
pledged on national television.
	   His assurances followed days of frenzied negotiations in which
the government appeared ready to take drastic actions to restore
economic calm, including reimposing Soviet-style controls on prices
and the exchange rate.
	   The economy meanwhile, showed a few signs of nascent recovery.
After sharp drops earlier in the week, the ruble bounced back a bit
in Moscow street sales on Saturday and demand was high enough that
some exchange booths ran out of the Russian currency. Despite a
lingering feeling of anxiety, Russians were seen shopping for
everything from food to cars.
	   For his part, Chernomyrdin spent hours bargaining with lawmakers
over terms of a political deal that would give the parliament more
power in return for swift confirmation of his nomination.
	   Late in the evening, TV reports said a major sticking point was
whether the lower house, the State Duma, would be granted the power
to approve or reject Cabinet appointments. Currently they only
confirm the president's nomination of a prime minister, not
lower-ranking Kremlin officials.
	   The Duma is scheduled to debate Chernomyrdin's appointment on
Monday.
	   Chernomyrdin's TV remarks appeared directed both at reassuring
fearful Russians and the foreign investors who have abandoned the
country's financial markets.
	   In a scripted interview with journalists, the reinstated prime
minister _ whose devotion to economic reform has frequently been
questioned _ pledged to keep the ruble convertible, shore up the
wobbly banking system and protect depositors.
	   ``The main thing is to make sure people don't suffer,'' he said,
looking stolidly into the camera. ``For this we should use our
power, and we will use it as much as necessary.''
	   ``You can be calm. You will get your savings,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline. The
crisis of confidence climaxed Thursday in a wave of rumors that
even Yeltsin would resign.
	   But the president, with typical bluster, sought to squash such
speculation by going on television Friday to declare he would not
step down.
	   ``I'm not going anywhere. I'm not going to resign,'' he said.
``Considering my personality, I think it is impossible.
Impossible.''
	   The crisis has been building all summer as Russia's financial
markets collapsed, unbuoyed even by a dlrs 23 billion international
bailout. The economic turmoil forced the government to devalue the
ruble two weeks ago, which triggered a larger crisis of confidence
in Yeltsin's government.
	   The opposition-led parliament is seeking maximum political
advantage from the upheaval and has demanded a series of
concessions from the Kremlin in return for confirming Chernomyrdin.
	   The outlines of an agreement were being hotly haggled over late
in the evening. However, participants said the deal is expected to
give parliament more say over key Cabinet appointments and
government policies, and will require some Constitutional
amendments.
	   The Constitution currently gives parliament fewer powers than is
common in the West, and lawmakers are mostly reduced to blocking
the president's policies, not legislating their own.
	   Alexander Kotenkov, Yeltsin's envoy to the Duma, said Communists
and their allies had caved in on one of their main demands _ that
they be given new powers immediately. Instead, he said the deal
would be put in effect by normal legislative processes.
	   He also said the Duma would promise not to hold a no-confidence
motion in the government for one year and Yeltsin would refrain
from shuffling the Cabinet for the same period.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov described the plan as a kind
of ``renovation of the Constitution'' that would place the
executive branch under the control of parliament.
	   ``At the same time it will restore vertical, strong, capable and
authoritative executive power,'' he said in remarks broadcast on
ORT television.
	   There were signs the anxiety of the last two weeks was also
easing.
	   The ruble appeared to be gaining strength at exchange booths
around Moscow, climbing from a low of 12 a few days ago to an
average of 9 on Saturday.
	   Ironically, most people waiting to change money at private
exchange booths on Saturday said they were buying rubles, not
dollars. And after a week in which banks reported a shortage of
dollars, a number of booths posted signs saying they had now run
out of rubles.
	   Cash transactions in dollars have been illegal in recent years
and anyone seeking to make purchases must change dollar savings
into rubles first.
	   Consumer prices were rising in some shops while steady in
others. Chernomyrdin has formed a special team to keep an eye on
price increases and prevent what the Russians call ``speculation''
_ hiking prices unfairly.
	   ``The government has decided to use its powers to make sure no
one takes unfair advantage of the situation,'' Chernomyrdin said in
his television remarks.

Youngsters gather in environmental protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ About 1,000 police lined the
streets of downtown Prague Saturday, fearing that a planned
demonstration of young ecological protesters could turn violent.
	   But the protest was peaceful. About 3,000 people, mostly
teenagers, gathered at a square near the town's center to protests
growing traffic in Prague and the impact multinational corporations
have on the environment.
	   The protest was organized by two radical environmental groups,
Earth First and Rainbow Keepers.
	   Dancing to the sound of loud music and carrying banners that
said ``Human rights against globalization,'' and ``Democracy, not
rule of money!'' the crowd set on march late in the afternoon,
heading toward the center. No incidents were reported.
	   ``My father poisons the air here everyday with his car,''
15-year-old Marta, who did not give her second name, said. ``I
don't think I'm doing anything bad now, we're also living in this
town.''
	   A similar demonstration in May turned violent. Twenty-two police
were injured in the riot and 64 protesters detained.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The staccato crack of automatic weapons
fire mixed with the muffled thud of mortar rounds near central
Kinshasa on Saturday, shattering an otherwise quiet day in Congo's
already tense capital.
	   Although Kinshasa was largely silent much of Saturday,
firefights on the city's west side near downtown broke out shortly
before a nightly curfew went into effect at 6 p.m.
	   Elsewhere, decaying corpses littered the streets of the
capital's eastern Kingasani and Masina districts _ the aftermath of
several days of combat.
	   ``There are many dead in the area,'' said Health Minister
Jean-Baptist Sondgi. ``It's a terrible scene of bodies here and
there.''
	   Fighting first broke out on the city's west side overnight with
heavy mortar fire echoing through the area near the Ndangi forest
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown. By morning, the
fighting subsided to a little more than scattered machinegun fire.
	   The hostilities began nearly a month ago when a rebel coalition
of ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected members of the Congolese
military announced they were battling to oust President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma have remained silent
in recent days amid growing indications their assault on the
capital was facing tough resistance from Kabila's forces and their
Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian allies.
	   Congo's Deputy Interior Minister Faustin Munene reiterated a
call for rebels to lay down their weapons and stop fighting for
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila has accused of being
behind the rebellion.
	   ``Rwanda and Uganda have come here to kill, don't do it for
them,'' Munene said in a statement on state radio. ``Disarm
yourself, you are just being used as cannon fodder.''
	   Both countries deny involvement in the war, although Rwandan
Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana reiterated warnings Saturday that
his government will send troops into Congo if peace efforts fail.
	   Rwanda will have ``no choice but to intervene militarily to
rescue Rwandese ... as well as some Congolese ... who do not
support the killings,'' Gasana told reporters at a Nonaligned
Movement summit in South Africa.
	   The Congo war is likely to be discussed by participants at the
summit, where 51 heads of states are planning to attend. Kabila
will not go, sending his foreign minister Jean-Charles Okoto
Lolakombe instead, summit organizers said.
	   Yet Congolese rebels indicated Friday they would send a
delegation, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The combat on Kinshasa's west side comes just one day after
thousands of people waving tree branches and cheering celebrated
believing the war was over.
	   ``We could hear the fighting all night,'' said one resident who
left the area and came to central Kinshasa.
	   Electricity in the city remained cut off Saturday and a
dusk-to-dawn curfew was in place. Most shops remained closed, but
more people ventured into the streets after days in hiding in fear.
	   Government officials say hundreds of insurgents have been
captured after earlier estimating that as many as 1,000 rebel
fighters had been caught.
	   Away from the capital, rebel forces still control the Inga power
dam that supplies electricity to Kinshasa. Angolan forces trying to
retake the dam said the insurgents were threatening to blow it up.
	   One rebel commander said his forces had taken the town of
Manolo, Kabila's birthplace in Katanga province.
	   Manolo is south of the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie, which
according to the commander, fell to the rebels earlier in the week.
	   The rebels' primary target of Kinshasa, however, has proven a
tough battle.
	   A killing spree has been unleashed in parts of the capital where
government soldiers and civilians have hunted down suspected rebels
and beat, burned or shot them to death.
	   State radio continued to call on defectors fighting for the
rebels to lay down their arms.
	   ``We know you have been tricked by the Rwandans, lay down your
arms and rejoin your ranks with the Congolese forces,'' an
announcer said.
	   The insurgents scored repeated military successes early in the
nearly month-long rebellion, capturing important cities in eastern
Congo and launching a drive toward Kinshasa.
	   But the deployment of Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian troops to
aid Kabila's embattled military has apparently turned the tide in
the southwest.
	   A respected Zimbabwean business newspaper reported Friday that
about 2,000 Zimbabwean reinforcements have been airlifted to Congo,
bringing Zimbabwe's total force to 2,800.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Red Cross took 13 women and
children wounded by shelling from a village crowded with refugees
to Pristina for treatment on Saturday.
	   They were among thousands of ethnic Albanians who crowded into
and around the village of Senik in southwestern Kosovo after their
communities were heavily shelled, only to be shelled again on
Thursday by Yugoslav army tanks.
	   With the weather turning cold and rainy, Red Cross staffers who
accompanied them spoke of looming catastrophe for the tens of
thousands of refugees without shelter since fleeing onslaughts by
Serbian police and the Yugoslav army. They warned that deaths from
exposure would soon increase.
	   Fighting was reported throughout the day in several locations as
Serbian and Yugoslav forces shelled villages. Their months-long
offensive is meant to crush militant ethnic Albanians spearheading
the independence fight of Kosovo's Albanian majority. Kosovo is a
province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   Serbs consider the region the cradle of their culture, and the
Western powers prefer not to see boundary changes, as in the
Balkans these often signal the start of further bloodshed. The
Americans and Europeans want Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to restore the autonomy he withdrew in 1989.
	   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, Serbian police said Saturday
that they discovered a crematorium where Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
rebels allegedly burned the bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   The police statement, carried by the official Tanjug news
agency, said the furnace was in the village of Klecka, which was
recently retaken by government forces.
	   On Friday, Serb forensic workers retrieved the bones of 10 Serb
civilians, two of them children, who officials said were executed
by the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The workers retrieved skulls and other charred human bones,
including a pelvis and part of a backbone with bits of singed
clothing on it.
	   A statement from the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry spoke of ``Nazi
style'' killings and asked for international condemnation.
	   Meanwhile, seven of the wounded evacuated to Pristina were
admitted to the orthopedic department of the Serb-run main
hospital. The rest waited on stretchers or on the wet, cold floor
of the Red Cross truck for nearly two hours. Doctors on duty in the
surgery department at first refused to accept them, saying they did
not have proper identity papers.
	   The refugees said Thursday's attack on Senik targeted civilians.
	   ``The shelling began at seven in the morning,'' said one of the
victims, Xhemile Zulfaj, as she lay shivering on the truck floor,
her 2-year-old son beside her. ``Thirteen of us were in our house.
A shell exploded, and we ran outside, screaming. One of us died.''
	   The woman said the region remained extremely dangerous.
	   ``Snipers shoot at women and children all the time, and shelling
continues,'' she said. She, her son and the others on the truck all
were hit by shrapnel.
	   Maggie Bryson of the International Red Cross, who helped
evacuate the 13, said they were the worst cases of the 39 wounded
in Senik.
	   ``There were others still in worse shape, but they died''
because of lack of medical treatment, she said. With the onset of
cold weather, the estimated 50,000 refugees camped out in the open
in isolated areas were facing an ``absolutely dreadful'' situation,
she said.
	   She said she saw the corpse of a 10-day-old baby while in the
Senik region who had died of exposure.
	   Other aid workers spoke of terror among the refugees crowded in
and around Senik, northwest of Malisevo, about 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina.
	   Since Serbian and Yugoslav forces took Malisevo from the KLA
about a month ago, scores of villages in the region have been
shelled and burned, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless.
Across Kosovo, an estimated 265,000 people have fled their homes.
	   ``They didn't want us to leave,'' said Fernando del Mundo, a
spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner of Refugees, and one of
those in Senik on Saturday. He said those in the village feared
renewed attacks if aid workers left.
	   Del Mundo said that as inhabitants were burying some of the 17
reported killed in shelling Thursday, a baby was brought into the
village who had died of starvation.
	   Meanwhile, the Serb-run Media Center in Pristina, the Kosovo
capital, said that seven ``terrorists'' were killed Saturday in a
shootout with police in Klina, western Kosovo.
	   After a string of defeats at the hands of government forces, the
KLA appealed to ethnic Albanians to unite and join rebel ranks, in
an appeal published Saturday in an Albanian-language paper in
Pristina.
	   ``Like never before, it is high time that we all become KLA
soldiers,'' the KLA statement said.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Sonia Gandhi, a leading Indian opposition leader,
made a one-day visit to Kuwait on Saturday to present awards to
outstanding members of the Indian community.
	   The awards are in honor of her late husband, Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi.
	   A Kuwait-based committee chose the five recipients and the
choice was approved by the New Delhi-based Rajiv Gandhi Foundation,
which is chaired by Mrs. Gandhi.
	   The winners were Sister Bernita, the principal of the Carmel
School and the only female recipient, K.P. Mohanan, the editor of
the Kuwait Times, Paresh Pewekar, the local manager of Air India,
social worker Abey Varicad and neurologist Riyaz Ahmed Khan.
	   The awards consisted of citations recognizing the recipients'
``outstanding contribution'' to the 250,000-member Indian community
in the areas of culture, business, education and social welfare.
	   Although her one-day visit was private, Sonia Gandhi met the
emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the prime minister, Sheik
Saad Al-Abdullah al-Sabah.

Ballanger sets world 500 record; Rousseau adds another title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BORDEAUX, France (AP) - France's Felicia Ballanger set a world
record in the women's 500 meter time trial in winning her second
gold medal of the World Cycling championships Saturday and eighth
since 1995.
	   Ballanger was timed in 34.010 seconds for the two laps around
the 250-meter track at the Stadium of Bordeaux velodrome. She held
the old world record of 34.017 set in Bogota, Colombia in September
1995.
	   Florian Rousseau gave France its third double winner of the
championships taking the individual sprint. He also was part of the
men's Olympic sprint team that also included Arnaud Tournant, the
men's kilometer winner.
	   Ballanger has won the 500 and the individual match sprint since
1995.
	   ``My goal was to beat the world record but it is never easy to
break a world record,'' Ballanger said. `` But it's better to win
with the world record.''
	   Ballanger knew she had the victory almost before she started.
	   Tanya Dubnicoff of Canada had the lead with 35.415 before
Ballanger went off last.
	   ``With a best of 35.4, I told myself that the title shouldn't
get away from me because I do that regularly in training,''
Ballanger said.
	   Michelle Ferris of Australia was third in 35.451.
	   Chris Witty of the United States was fourth in 35.516.
	   Witty won a silver and a bronze medal in speedskating this year
at the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan in February.
	   Ballanger was more than a second ahead at the end of the first
lap -- 19.159 to Dubnicoff's 20.201.
	   ``You go off as fast as you can. Then coming around the curve
there is a special moment where you feel that you can do it or
not,'' Ballanger said. ``Then you try to finish as fast as you
can.''
	   Ballanger knows she is far ahead of the field.
	   ``Right now there is no one that can beat me. The only threat
would have to be someone new,'' she said. ``About the only
challenge is to see if I can get under 34 seconds.''
	   Ballanger's exploit was noticed by French president Jacques
Chirac.
	   Chirac sent his ``most enthousiatic congratulations'' to
Ballanger.
	   ``What a joy for you and for France,'' he said in a statement.
``Besides this eighth title, the fantastic world record of 500
meters confirms your superiority this event. A thousand bravos.''
	   France raised its total to six gold medals with a day to go.
Last year they won six of 12. The championships finish Sunday with
three finals.
	   Rousseau beat German Jens Fiedler in two straight heats in the
best-of-three final for the second consecutive year.
	   Earlier in the week he was part of the French men's team that
won the Olympic sprint title.
	   Rousseau was the Olympic champion in the men's kilometer time
trial before switching events.
	   In addition to Ballanger and Rousseau, France won the first
three events of the championship.
	   Philippe Ermenault won the individual pursuit title on Wednesday
beating teammate Francis Moreau.
	   Tournant set a sea level best in capturing the kilometer time
trial and joined Rousseau and Vincent Le Quellec for the Olympic
sprint team title the next day.
	   The road championships -- where France won three titles last
year -- will be in the Netherlands in October.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League is trying to mediate between
Libya and the United States and Britain over arrangements for the
Lockerbie suspects to stand trial, League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Saturday.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he had approached the U.S. and British
embassies in Cairo _ where the 22-member League is based _ and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan with a view to obtaining answers to
Libya's questions on the U.N. Security Council plan for a trial.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to suspend
sanctions against Libya once it hands over two men charged with the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has accepted the principle of such
a trial, but has called for negotiations with the United States and
Britain on the details of the trial and the suspects' care once
they have been transferred to Dutch custody.
	   Spokesmen for the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign
Office rebuffed Gadhafi's request late Friday, saying that the
terms of the U.N. resolution were non-negotiable.
	   Abdel-Meguid told The Associated Press that so far the U.S. and
British embassies in Cairo have not responded. Spokesmen for the
embassies were not immediately available for comment.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said it would be
``inappropriate'' for the League to mediate as the plan had
assigned that role to the U.N. Secretary-General.
	   Abdel-Meguid said the U.N. plan entailed arrangements.
	   ``The goal of these arrangements should be to guarantee a fair
trial, the safety of the suspects and their right to defend
themselves.''

Lessing wins record fourth world title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Britain's Simon Lessing recaptured
his world championship triathlon title Saturday, to add a record
fourth crown to his collection.
	   The 26-year-old British triathlete completed the gruelling
classic-distance swimming, cycling and running stages in 1 hour, 55
minutes and 30.5 seconds, a convincing 26.9 seconds ahead of New
Zealand's Paul Amey. Australia's Miles Stewart, the 1991 champion,
finished third, 33.7 back.
	   ``I'm so happy with this victory,'' said Lessing, who began
swimming at nine, and won his first triathlon at 14. ``Each year
the competition gets tougher and tougher so victory becomes sweeter
and sweeter. This is the first time my family was able to come and
see me compete so that also made it even better.''
	   Champion in 1992, 1995 and 1996, Lessing finished third last
year in Perth, handing over his crown to Australia's Chris
McCormack.
	   But a stunning display of grit, experience and pure physical
power got Lessing his title back.
	   Third out of the water, and gaining time in the transition,
Lessing trailed 13.1 seconds behind the leader Craig Walton of
Australia going into the bike stage. While his bike performance
enabled him to close the gap slightly to 10.7, Lessing dropped to
12th heading into the final run.
	   But all the extra work on his running this year paid off, as
Lessing surged ahead to pass his toughest challengers,
Jean-Christophe Guinchard of Switzerland, leader after the bike
stage, as well as New Zealand's Hamish Carter, a silver medallist
at last year's worlds, who was second going into the run.
	   ``I've made a lot of progress in my running'' said Lessing, who
trained with French steeplechase Olympians this year for that
purpose. ``I knew I was strong on the bike. But my extra training
in running made the difference.''
	   Normally a force to contend with, the Australians had a
disappointing campaign.
	   McCormack, unable to defend his crown, finished 12th, and
Stewart was the only Australian to make the top-10. Adding to
Aussie woes, leader Walton was forced to pull out after a crash
near the end of the technically demanding bike stage left his left
arm numb.
	   Though he remounted in an effort to complete the race, Walton
eventually had to quit, and was taken to hospital by ambulance.
	   The race began with a 1.5 kilometer (.93 mile) swim in the calm
but cold waters of Lac Leman, followed by a 40km (24.85 mile) hilly
bike ride through the city of Lausanne. Cyclists wound their way
through Lausanne's parks and cemetaries, along the cobbled streets
of the Old Town, and up the wrenchingly steep (17 percent) rue de
la Mercerie, about 140 meters (261 feet) above the lakeside
starting point.
	   The contest ended with a 10 km (6.2 mile) run along along the
lakeshore, to the finishline in front of the Olympic Museum, where
throngs of spectators cheered wildy.
	   ``People were screaming and ringing bells so loudly I could't
hear myself breath,'' described Lessing, who plans to compete at
the 2000 Sydney Summer Games where triathlon will make its Olympic
debut.
	   World Championship action continues Sunday with the women's
event.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government declared Saturday that
there will be no return to the Soviet system and the hard-line
opposition signaled it was ready to compromise with Boris Yeltsin
to restore political calm.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
pledged on national television.
	   His assurances followed days of frenzied negotiations in which
the government appeared ready to take drastic actions to restore
economic calm, including reimposing Soviet-style controls on prices
and the exchange rate.
	   The economy meanwhile, showed a few signs of nascent recovery.
After sharp drops earlier in the week, the ruble bounced back a bit
in Moscow street sales on Saturday and demand was high enough that
some exchange booths ran out of the Russian currency. Despite a
lingering feeling of anxiety, Russians were seen shopping for
everything from food to cars.
	   For his part, Chernomyrdin spent hours bargaining with lawmakers
over terms of a political deal that would give the parliament more
power in return for swift confirmation of his nomination.
	   A major sticking point was whether the lower house, the State
Duma, would be granted the power to approve or reject Cabinet
appointments. Currently they only confirm the president's
nomination of a prime minister, not lower-ranking Kremlin
officials.
	   The talks ended without a final agreement late Saturday and were
to resume Sunday. Chernomyrdin said the deliberations were
difficult in part because they are historic.
	   ``This is the first time in six years that we are coming to
agreement on the definition of the problems in which Russia finds
herself,'' he said after the meeting adjourned, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov told Interfax that all sides
expect to reach final agreement Sunday before parliament takes up
debate on Chernomyrdin's appointment on Monday.

Bullfighters defy Portuguese law, kill bulls in ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BARRANCOS, Portugal (AP) _ Maintaining a 300-year-old local
tradition and flouting Portuguese law against killing bulls in
public, matadors killed two bulls during a bullfight Saturday in
this small town in southeast Portugal.
	   Bullfights are popular in Portugal, but killing the bull in the
ring has been outlawed since 1928, unlike in neighboring Spain.
	   However, officials have always turned a blind eye to the slaying
of the bull in the arena during the Barrancos annual summer
festival, which draws thousands of visitors each year.
	   Under pressure from animal rights groups, the Internal Affairs
Minister warned that police would intervene this year to prevent
the bull being killed in the town's makeshift wooden ring.
	   Locals in the rural town, about 200 kilometers (120 miles)
southeast of the capital Lisbon, vowed to fight the prohibition.
	   The Spanish matadors were not named by the organizers. They left
by car under the protection of local people immediately after the
event.
	   Tome Queiros, president of the Society for the Protection of
Animals, told daily Publico that the matadors usually came from
Spain, Mexico or Venezuela. He complained they were never punished
for killing bulls in the ring.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Arab League is trying to mediate between
Libya and the United States and Britain over arrangements for the
Lockerbie suspects to stand trial, League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Saturday.
	   Abdel-Meguid said he had approached the U.S. and British
embassies in Cairo _ where the 22-member League is based _ and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan with a view to obtaining answers to
Libya's questions on the U.N. Security Council plan for a trial.
	   The Security Council voted unanimously Thursday to suspend
sanctions against Libya once it hands over two men charged with the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 270 people.
	   The resolution provides for the suspects _ Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah _ to be tried in the
Netherlands by a panel of three Scottish judges according to
Scottish law.
	   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has accepted the principle of such
a trial, but has called for negotiations with the United States and
Britain on the details of the trial and the suspects' care once
they have been transferred to Dutch custody.
	   Spokesmen for the U.S. State Department and the British Foreign
Office rebuffed Gadhafi's request late Friday, saying that the
terms of the U.N. resolution were non-negotiable.
	   Abdel-Meguid told The Associated Press that so far the U.S. and
British embassies in Cairo have not responded. Spokesmen for the
embassies were not immediately available for comment.
	   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said it would be
``inappropriate'' for the League to mediate as the plan had
assigned that role to the U.N. Secretary-General.
	   Abdel-Meguid said the U.N. plan entailed arrangements.
	   ``The goal of these arrangements should be to guarantee a fair
trial, the safety of the suspects and their right to defend
themselves.''

Lessing wins record fourth world title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) _ Britain's Simon Lessing recaptured
his Triathlon World Championship Saturday, a record fourth title.
	   The 26-year-old Briton completed the 1,500-meter swim,
40-kilometer cycling course and 10-kilometer run in 1 hour, 55
minutes and 30.5 seconds, a convincing 26.9 seconds ahead of New
Zealand's Paul Amey.
	   Australia's Miles Stewart, the 1991 champion, finished third,
33.7 seconds back.
	   ``I'm so happy with this victory,'' said Lessing, who began
swimming at nine, and won his first triathlon at 14. ``Each year
the competition gets tougher and tougher so victory becomes sweeter
and sweeter. This is the first time my family was able to come and
see me compete so that also made it even better.''
	   World champion in 1992, 1995 and 1996, Lessing finished third
last year in Perth, handing over his crown to Australia's Chris
McCormack.
	   But a stunning display of grit, experience and pure physical
power got Lessing his title back.
	   Third out of the water, and gaining time in the transition,
Lessing trailed leader Craig Walton of Australia by 13.1 seconds
going into the cycling stage. By the end of the four 10K laps, he
had closed the gap slightly to 10.7 but dropped to 12th heading
into the run.
	   Lessing surged past his toughest challengers: Jean-Christophe
Guinchard of Switzerland, leader after the cycling stage, and New
Zealand's Hamish Carter, a silver medallist at last year's worlds
and second going into the run.
	   ``I've made a lot of progress in my running'' said Lessing, who
trained with France's Olympic steeplechase team this year. ``I knew
I was strong on the bike. But my extra training in running made the
difference.''
	   Normally a force to contend with, the Australians had a
disappointing campaign.
	   McCormack finished 12th and Stewart was the only Australian to
make the top 10. Adding to Aussie woes, Walton was forced to pull
out after a crash near the end of the technically demanding cycling
stage left his left arm numb.
	   Though he remounted in an effort to complete the race, Walton
eventually quit and was taken to hospital by ambulance.
	   The race began with a 1,500-meter swim in the calm but cold
waters of Lac Leman, followed by ride through the city of Lausanne.
Cyclists wound their way through Lausanne's parks and cemetaries,
along the cobbled streets of the Old Town, and up the rue de la
Mercerie with an average gradient of 17 percent _ about 140 meters
(261 feet) above the lakeside starting point.
	   The contest ended after a run along along the lakeshore and past
the Olympic Museum, where throngs of spectators cheered wildy.
	   ``People were screaming and ringing bells so loudly I could't
hear myself breathe,'' described Lessing, who plans to compete at
the 2000 Sydney Summer Games where triathlon will make its Olympic
debut.

Veteran McKnight upsets British champion Garcia at U.S. Amateur

<TEXT>
	   ROCHESTER, New York (AP) _ Tom McKnight, who gave up his pro
golf ambitions around the time Sergio Garcia was born, upset the
18-year-old British Amateur champion Saturday to reach the final of
the U.S. Amateur championship.
	   McKnight, 44, who operates a family-owned chain of gas stations
and convenience stores in rural Virginia, strung together four
birdies to oust the Spanish sensation 3 and 1 in match play at Oak
Hill.
	   ``What a day. Unbelievable!'' he said quietly. ``It's hard to
describe the emotions that I felt out there. ... This is what you
dream about from Day 1.''
	   In Sunday's 36-hole final, he will meet Hank Kuehne, 22, a
recovering alcoholic whose even-par round was sufficient to defeat
a floundering Bill Lunde of Henderson, Nevada, 6 and 5. Kuehne's
brother and caddy, Trip, was beaten by Tiger Woods in the 1994 U.S.
Amateur final.
	   McKnight got off to a shaky start, three-putting the 1st hole,
but evened the match with a 6-meter (20-foot) birdie putt on the
7th and followed with a birdie from 3 meters (10 feet) on the 8th.
Garcia played a poor bunker shot on the 9th to fall 2-down but
recovered on the next hole by sinking a 7 1-2-meter (25-foot) putt
for birdie.
	   After bogeying the 12th, Garcia pulled level again with a par on
12 and a birdie on 13, then drove into the water on the par-3 15th.
	   On the decisive 16th, McKnight sank a 6-meter (20-foot) birdie
putt, drawing the biggest roar of the day from thousands of
spectators, and Garcia lipped out from 3 1-2 meters (12 feet).
	   Needing to win the 17th hole to survive, Garcia drove into a
tree and took a double-bogey.

Britain seeks extradition from Spain of road rage suspect

<TEXT>
	   DARTFORD, England (AP) _ After a two-year hunt, police have
arrested in Spain a Briton suspected of fatally stabbing a
passenger in another car in a ``road rage'' killing and are seeking
his extradition, police said Saturday.
	   Kenneth Noye, 51, was arrested Friday night in the southern town
of Barbate while dining in a restaurant, local government official
Miguel Osuna told the state news agency EFE. Noye tried to resist
when he was apprehended.
	   Osuna said that Noye had been living in the nearby town of
Tarifa since he apparently fled Britain two years ago. Noye, who
has been portrayed by the British media as a well-known criminal
figure, was sentenced in 1986 to 14 years in a British prison for
his part in a dlrs 38.7 million bullion robbery. He was released
several years ago.
	   ``A formal request for the extradition of Kenneth Noye will be
sent through diplomatic channels to the government of Spain,'' Kent
police Supt. Nick Biddiss told reporters.
	   Noye faces charges of killing Stephen Cameron, 21, after getting
into an argument with him at an entry road to the M25, a busy
six-lane highway that circles London.
	   Cameron's girlfriend Danille Cable, then 17, was driving to buy
some bagels at lunchtime on May 19, 1996, when she braked hard to
avoid a four-wheel drive Land Rover Discovery.
	   Cable said that the driver of the Discovery got out of his car
and an argument between him and Cameron began. The driver hit
Cameron and then, as Cable pleaded with him to stop, he knifed her
boyfriend and drove off.
	   Noye was in a Spanish police cell Saturday while the authorities
processed the extradition request from the British government,
police said.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A Cuban commercial aircraft carrying 82
people burst into flames and crashed Saturday in Quito, Ecuador,
authorities said. Dozens were believed killed, including four
people on the ground.
	   Witnesses said the Cubana de Aviacion aircraft crashed into a
street and empty lot at the end of the runway at the Quito
international airport.
	   Airport officials said there were 76 passengers and six crew
members on board.
	   Reports varied on whether the plane was taking off for Havana or
landing.
	   ``There must be many dead, but there are also survivors. I
pulled one person out alive,'' said civil defense volunteer Hugo
Albuja.
	   Four people also died when the plane struck an auto mechanic's

Reports: Security for Netanyahu and other top officials to be
</HEADLINE>
increased &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In light of reported threats by right wing
extremists, security is being stepped up for Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and other top officials, Israeli media reported
Saturday.
	   The Shin Bet security service, in charge of protecting public
figures, has decided to step up security for Netanyahu, Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and other officials who have been
targeted by far right Jewish extremists, the reports said.
	   Israel Radio reported that Netanyahu has met several times with
Shin Bet officials in recent days to discuss the threats which
follow reports that Israel may be close to cinching a deal with the
Palestinians over a troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
	   The extremists are militantly opposed to Israel conceding any
territory to the Palestinians as part of a land-for-peace deal.
	   Mordechai has recently become a visible target of increasing
attack by Jewish extremists who staged daily protests outside his
home this week, calling him a murderer and, according to one report
have plans to assassinate him.
	   As a moderate in a hardline government and a supporter of peace
talks with the Palestinians, Mordechai has never been a favorite of
Israel's right-wing, including Jewish settler groups.
	   The attacks against Mordechai were reminiscent of those against
former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the weeks before his
assassination by an ultranationalist Jew in November 1995.

	   DARTFORD, England (AP) _ After a two-year hunt, police have
arrested in Spain a Briton suspected of fatally stabbing a
passenger in another car in a ``road rage'' killing and are seeking
his extradition, police said Saturday.
	   Kenneth Noye, 51, was arrested Friday night in the southern town
of Barbate while dining in a restaurant, local government official
Miguel Osuna told the state news agency EFE. Noye tried to resist
when he was apprehended.
	   The case attracted nationwide interest as a dreadful
illustration of the extremes of anger aroused in some road users
over petty incidents.
	   Osuna said that Noye had been living in the nearby town of
Tarifa since he apparently fled Britain two years ago. Noye was
sentenced in 1986 to 14 years in a British prison for his part in a
dlrs 38.7 million bullion robbery. He was released several years
ago.

Rival Iraqi Kurdish groups agree to free prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The rival Iraqi Kurdish groups have agreed
to free their prisoners of war and detainees, one of their radio
services reported Saturday.
	   The prisoners will be freed on Tuesday, the radio of the
Kurdistan Democratic Party said in a broadcast monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp.
	   The release was agreed on at a meeting between the KDP, led by
Massoud Barzani, and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, led by Jalal
Talabani, in the town of Koya, Irbil province, in the Kurdish
autonomous zone of northern Iraq, said a BBC transcript received in
Cairo.
	   The two parties have wrestled for control of the autonomous zone
since the western allies created it after the Iraqi government
suppressed a Kurdish revolt in 1991. Recently their executives have
been negotiating moves to consolidate a U.S.-brokered cease-fire
signed in May 1997.

Small-scale clashes in Hebron as Palestinians warn against settler

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with lifting of ten-day curfew on Hebron, graf 7 and
report of Arafat message sent to Clinton, graf 11 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian boys hurled stones and
empty bottles towards Israeli soldiers Saturday as the Palestinian
leadership warned of escalating tensions in the fractious city if a
Jewish enclave there is expanded.
	   Israeli soldiers responded with one round of rubber bullets
towards the Palestinian protesters who ranged in age from ten to
fourteen. No injuries were reported.
	   Tensions in the city have been flaring since the stabbing of a
prominent rabbi in his home nine days ago, apparently by a
Palestinian militant.
	   The Palestinian leadership issued a statement late Friday
condemning Israeli plans to expand and fortify Tel Romeida, the
heavily fortified Jewish enclave in the city center where Rabbi
Shlomo Raanan was killed.
	   ``The Palestinian cabinet warns Israel that building in Tel
Romeida would ignite an already tense situation,'' a statement
issued after a meeting of the Palestinian cabinet read.
	   Responding to Raanan's killing, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu announced this week that Tel Romeida's trailer homes
would be replaced by permanent structures.
	   Israel's Army spokesman announced that a curfew imposed on
30,000 Palestinians living in the Israeli-controlled downtown area
near the Jewish settler enclaves would be lifted early Sunday
morning.
	   The round-the-clock curfew had been in effect since the killing,
and in its statement, the Palestinian cabinet had demanded that it
be lifted immediately.
	   Most of Hebron's population live in the zone that Israel turned
over to Palestinian control last year. The other 20 percent, where
500 Jewish settlers live among 30,000 Palestinians, is controlled
by Israel. The city is often a flash-point for violence between
Israelis and Palestinians.
	   Meanwhile, despite Israeli reports that an agreement over a much
delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank was in reach,
Palestinian officials insisted Israel had not yet accepted a U.S.
proposal to hand over a full 13 percent of the area.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat sent U.S. President Bill
Clinton a message, Israel Radio reported Saturday, asking him to
put pressure on Israel to accept the U.S. proposal.
	   Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Netanyahu has only
accepted a 13 percent pullback in which 3 percent would be
designated a nature reserve where Palestinians would have virtually
no say over land use, including construction. The Palestinians have
consistently rejected such an arrangement.
	   ``Mr. Netanyahu did not accept 13 percent as he is
insinuating,'' Erekat told reporters after the cabinet meeting,
``We really urge Mr. Netanyahu to revive the peace process through
a clear cut yes to the American initiative with all its
components.''

Wiltord fires Bordeaux to fourth win; PSG downed by minnow Lorient
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A double strike by in-form striker Silvain Wiltord
gave Bordeaux a 2-0 win at struggling Metz Saturday, its fourth
straight win.
	   Elie Baup's team is the only one with a maximum 12 points after
four rounds of the championship.
	   Wiltord struck his fifth and sixth goals of the season in the
27th and 84th minutes.
	   First, he picked up a poor defensive clearance to beat Metz
goalkeeper Lionel Letizi from 20 meters (yards) and then, on a
quick breakaway, collected a smart pass by Kaba Diawara to make it
2-0.
	   Bordeaux's success completes an awful week for Metz.
	   On Wednesday, it surprisingly lost to Helsinki in the qualifying
stages of the European Champions League.
	   Britanny minnow Lorient pulled off the shock of the season so
far, beating big-spending Paris Saint-Germain 2-1 at the Parc des
Princes.
	   The game looked like going to form when Marco Simone scored a
first half penalty, but Lorient scored twice in two second half
minutes through Ousmane Soumah and Stephane Pedron to grab the
points.
	   Second-placed Marseille, which stormed from 4-0 behind to win
5-4 against Montpellier last week, came back down to earth with a
0-0 draw at Le Havre.
	   Montpellier continues to be the most entertaining team in the
early rounds, thumping Toulouse 3-0.
	   It has already scored 12 goals this season.
	   Young Cote D'Ivoire striker Ibrahima Bakayoko netted twice
before Philippe Delaye scored a third.
	   In one of the most eagerly-awaited matches of the season so far,
Lyon drew 1-1 with Monaco.
	   In front of 40,000 fans, Alain Caveglia opened the scoring in
the 40th minute, before Robert Spehar scored a late equalizer.
	   The result means that the teams, among the favorites to win a
trophy this year, both remain unbeaten.
	   Champion Lens continued its improving form, but had to come from
behind to beat newly-promoted Nancy 2-1.
	   Veteran Irish striker Tony Cascarino opened the scoring in the
8th minute with a thumping header.
	   Pascal Nouma, a recent signing from Strasbourg, fired a double,
though the winning goal looked close to offside.
	   In Saturday's other game, Nantes beat Sochaux 2-0.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A Cuban commercial aircraft carrying 82
people burst into flames and crashed during takeoff Saturday in
Ecuador, authorities said. Dozens were believed killed, including
four people on the ground.
	   Witnesses said the Russian-made Tupolev aircraft owned by Cubana
de Aviacion crashed into a street and empty lot at the end of the
runway at the Quito international airport.
	   Airport officials said there were 76 passengers and six crew
members on board.
	   Reports varied on whether the plane was taking off for Havana or
landing.
	   ``There must be many dead, but there are also survivors. I
pulled one person out alive,'' said civil defense volunteer Hugo
Albuja.
	   Four people also died when the plane struck an auto mechanic's
shop, a local radio station reported.
	   Channel 10 television interviewed Cuban survivor Hernan Boada,
27, who suffered a broken ankle.
	   ``Before we heard the roar of the crash, we felt the plane rise
a bit and burst in flames. There were three explosions,'' Boada
said. ``I saw other people wrapped in flames jump from the plane.''
	   Boada said other people jumped from the plane, but ``they were
wrapped in flames.''
	   ``Some people nearby, in a soccer field, helped me get away from
the plane fearing explosions,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ The staccato crack of automatic weapons
fire mixed with the muffled thud of mortar rounds near central
Kinshasa on Saturday, shattering an otherwise quiet day in Congo's
already tense capital.
	   Although Kinshasa was largely silent much of Saturday,
firefights on the city's west side near downtown broke out shortly
before a nightly curfew went into effect at 6 p.m.
	   Elsewhere, decaying corpses littered the streets of the
capital's eastern Kingasani and Masina districts _ the aftermath of
several days of combat.
	   ``There are many dead in the area,'' said Health Minister
Jean-Baptist Sondgi. ``It's a terrible scene of bodies here and
there.''
	   Fighting first broke out on the city's west side overnight with
heavy mortar fire echoing through the area near the Ndangi forest
about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from downtown.
	   By morning, the fighting subsided to a little more than
scattered machinegun fire.
	   The hostilities began nearly a month ago when a rebel coalition
of ethnic Tutsi fighters and disaffected members of the Congolese
military announced they were battling to oust President Laurent
Kabila.
	   Rebel leaders in the eastern city of Goma have remained silent
in recent days amid growing indications their assault on the
capital was facing tough resistance from Kabila's forces and their
Angolan, Zimbabwean and Namibian allies.
	   But a defiant rebel commander said Saturday the effort to oust
Kabila is still alive, despite recent losses.
	   ``They say the war is over but I say the war in not finished,''
Jean-Pierre Ondekane said in his eastern stronghold of Goma.
``We're in Kinshasa fighting. The situation is going well.''
	   Congo's Deputy Interior Minister Faustin Munene reiterated a
call for rebels to lay down their weapons and stop fighting for
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, which Kabila has accused of being
behind the rebellion.
	   ``Rwanda and Uganda have come here to kill, don't do it for
them,'' Munene said in a statement on state radio. ``Disarm
yourself, you are just being used as cannon fodder.''
	   Both countries deny involvement in the war, although Rwandan
Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana reiterated warnings Saturday that
his government will send troops into Congo if peace efforts fail.
	   Rwanda will have ``no choice but to intervene militarily to
rescue Rwandese ... as well as some Congolese,'' Gasana told
reporters at a Nonaligned Movement summit in South Africa.
	   The Congo war is likely to be discussed by participants at the
summit, where 51 heads of states are planning to attend. Kabila
will not go, sending his foreign minister Jean-Charles Okoto
Lolakombe instead, summit organizers said.
	   Yet Congolese rebels indicated Friday they would send a
delegation, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The combat on Kinshasa's west side comes just one day after
thousands of people waving tree branches and cheering celebrated
believing the war was over.
	   ``We could hear the fighting all night,'' said one resident who
left the area and came to central Kinshasa.
	   Through their control of a key power dam, the rebels continued
to deny electricity to the city, and a dusk-to-dawn curfew remained
in place. Most shops were closed, but more people ventured into the
streets after days in hiding.
	   Government officials say hundreds of insurgents have been
captured after earlier estimating that as many as 1,000 rebel
fighters had been caught.
	   Angolan forces trying to retake the Inga dam southwest of
Kinshasa said the rebels were threatening to blow it up.
	   One rebel commander said his forces had taken the town of
Manolo, Kabila's birthplace in Katanga province.
	   Manolo is south of the Lake Tanganyika port of Kalemie, which
according to the commander, fell to the rebels earlier in the week.
	   The rebels' primary target of Kinshasa, however, has proven a
tough battle.
	   A killing spree has been unleashed in parts of the capital where
government soldiers and civilians have hunted down suspected rebels
and beat, burned or shot them to death.
	   State radio continued to call on defectors fighting for the
rebels to lay down their arms.
	   ``We know you have been tricked by the Rwandans, lay down your
arms and rejoin your ranks with the Congolese forces,'' an
announcer said.
	   The insurgents scored repeated military successes early in the
nearly month-long rebellion, capturing important cities in eastern
Congo and launching a drive toward Kinshasa.

New-look Lazio edges Juventus 2-1 for Italian SuperCup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A revamped Lazio of Rome upset reigning
Serie A champion Juventus of Turin 2-1 Saturday night on Sergio
Conceicao's dramatic injury-time goal to claim the Italian SuperCup
for the first time.
	   Veteran striker Roberto Mancini provided the assists on both
Lazio goals at Delle Alpi Stadium.
	   Lazio held a 1-0 lead from Czech midfielder Pavel Nedved's early
goal and a one-man advantage when Juventus striker Filippo Inzaghi
was sent off in the 65th minute with his second yellow card.
	   But Alessandro Del Piero brought Juventus level in the 87th on a
penalty kick.
	   The visitors then pressed forward and Sergio Conceicao drove
home the winner four minutes into injury time when Mancini ended a
tight series of four passes by finding the Portuguese midfielder
unmarked on the right flank.
	   Nedved had made it 1-0 in the 39th after Mancini fed him with a
blind heel-pass.
	   Of Lazio's 11 starters Saturday, only three _ Nedved, Mancini
and 'keeper Luca Marchegiani _ were with the club last season, when
it captured the Italian Cup for its first trophy since 1974. Lazio
did not use Christian Vieri, the burly World Cup star acquired this
week from Spain's Atletico Madrid.
	   ``It's a great satisfaction to get this win,'' Lazio coach Sven
Goran Eriksson said. ``We deserved to win. We played well and had a
lot of scoring chances. I'm very happy with how the players worked
together.''
	   While both clubs were rusty, Lazio managed to create the
stronger threats throughout and only some brilliant goalkeeping by
Juve's Angelo Peruzzi limited the damage.
	   Del Piero _ looking to rebound from a lackluster World Cup for
Italy _ provided the other bright spots for Juventus, which had won
two of the last three Italian SuperCups.
	   Eight minutes before he tallied from the spot, Del Piero nearly
scored by firing a low shot after rounding Marchegiani on a
counterattack. Lazio's Yugoslavian defender Sinisa Mihajlovic
barely beat the ball to the line and knocked it away before
violently slamming into the post. He left the game but did not
appear to be injured seriously.
	   The Serie A season opens Sept. 13.

Former Argentine economy minister to advise Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The architect of Argentina's
recent sweeping free-market reforms was to travel Russia on Tueday
as advisor to President Boris Yeltsin's economic team.
	   Former economy minister Domingo Cavallo, now an opposition
congressman, was invited by Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin to advise his government following a recommendation
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``I don't know what they (the Russians) are going to ask, so all
I can say is I will do my best to help them,'' Cavallo told
reporters.
	   Cavallo was lecturing to fellow economists in Cordoba, his
hometown in central Argentina, when he received Chernomyrdin's
invitation, said former Deputy Economy Minister Carlos Sanchez.
	   ``Cavallo pulled Argentina out of hyper-inflation, and that was
the key to IMF's suggestion that he advise the Russians,'' the
Diarios y Noticias news agency quoted Sanchez as saying. ``There
are things you have to live through, that you can't learn in
books.''
	   The Harvard-trained economist was named minister in 1991, when
inflation was running at 84 percent a year. By 1995, it was down to
1 percent a year and the peso was firmly pegged to the dollar.
	   The core of Cavallo's plan was the privatization of virtually
all state-owned companies, including railroads, utilities, the
airline and the giant oil company YPF.
	   President Carlos Menem fired Cavallo in July 1995 after a series
of policy clashes. Cavallo later accused members of the government
of corruption and formed an opposition party. He was elected to
Congress in 1997.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) - A Cuban commercial aircraft carrying 82
people burst into flames and crashed during takeoff Saturday in
Quito, Ecuador, killing at least 68 people.
	   Sixty-four of the victims were on the plane, four were on the
ground.
	   Witnesses said the Russian-made Tupolev aircraft owned by Cubana
de Aviacion crashed into a street and empty lot at the end of the
runway at the Quito international airport. It was heading to
Guayaquil, on the Ecuadorean coast, and then on to Havana, Cuba.
	   Airport officials said there were 76 passengers and six crew
members on board.
	   An official of the Civil Aviation Office said at least 64 people
on board the plane had been killed.
	   ``There must be many dead, but there are also survivors. I
pulled one person out alive,'' said civil defense volunteer Hugo
Albuja.
	   Four people also died when the plane struck an auto mechanic's
shop, a local radio station reported.
	   Channel 10 television interviewed Cuban survivor Hernan Boada,
27, who had burnt hair and a fractured ankle.
	   ``Before we heard the roar of the crash, we felt the plane rise
a bit and burst in flames. There were three explosions,'' Boada
said. ``I saw other people wrapped in flames jump from the plane.''
	   ``I was in seat number 21, a window seat at wing level. The
doors would not open, so I jumped through a hole in the plane amid
the flames from a height of about two yards (meters),'' he said.

Graf defeats Novotna for Pilot Pen title
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's final. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By DONNA TOMMELLEO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Steffi Graf returned to the
winner's circle Saturday, easily beating Wimbledon champ Jana
Novotna 6-4, 6-1 for the Pilot Pen championship.
	   It was the first title in more than a year for Graf, who had
knee surgery in June 1997. Holding the trophy, she said, felt
``awesome.''
	   ``It's been a long way, but it's special to be here right now,
to be at this point,'' Graf said. ``It's worth doing what I done.''
	   What she did Saturday was carve up Novotna's athletic serve and
volley game in one hour, seven minutes.
	   The winner of 21 Grand Slam titles, Graf put on a dominating
display of precision, power and quickness. She kept Novotna off the
net, scoring winners from both sides of the racket. She said her
backhand was probably her most improved shot.
	   ``It makes life a little easier. I didn't really make a lot of
mistakes and felt I was controlling the points,'' Graf said.
	   Novotna, the No. 2 seed, managed only nine points in the second
set.
	   ``She was really overpowering and played unbelievable tennis,''
said Novotna, who admitted being tired.
	   Novotna played in both the singles and doubles draw and competed
until 10:30 p.m. Friday with partner Mariann Deswardt, of South
Africa, in her doubles semifinal, which was suspended due to rain.
She still had more tennis left Saturday afternoon.
	   Graf reached the final with straight set victories over unseeded
Henrieta Nagyova, No. 7 seed Amanda Coetzer and defending champ and
top seed Lindsay Davenport.
	   Novotna, who will improve from third to second in the WTA Tour
rankings on Monday, advanced to the title game in straight sets
over three unseeded players, Chanda Rubin, Amelie Mauresmo and
Julie Halard-Decugis.
	   Graf's last title came in May 1997 on the clay courts of
Strasbourg. A month later she had surgery on her left knee. The
Pilot Pen was her ninth tournament of the year and the first time
she reached the finals.
	   She still holds the longest winning streak at the U.S. Open.
	   Graf, who will break into the top 30 on Monday _ the first day
of the U.S. Open, hasn't lost at Flushing Meadows since the 1994
final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. Her 1996 victory at the U.S.
Open gave her 21 Grand Slam wins, second behind Margaret Court's
record of 24.
	   The 29-year-old German nearly missed the Pilot Pen. After being
bounced early in the Du Maurier last week, she planned to relax in
Florida to rest up before Monday's Open. She was overruled when
coach Heinz Gunthardt told her she needed more matches.
	   ``I felt maybe I needed a few days off. Heinz didn't think so,''
she said. ``And he was very right.''

Congolese rebel commander says war's not over despite losses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Congo &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ In a defiant mood, Congo's rebel commander
said Saturday the war in Congo was not over yet despite recent
losses.
	   ``They say the war is over but I say the war in not finished,''
Jean-Pierre Ondekane said in his eastern stronghold. ``We're in
Kinshasa fighting. The situation is going well.''
	   The 36-year-old Ondekane, the chief rebel commander, spoke to
reporters for the first time since President Laurent Kabila's
forces aided by Angolan and Zimbabwean troops hit back at the
rebels advancing on Kinshasa.
	   The rebels have lost the western Atlantic Ocean air-base of
Kitona when the Angolans tanks and troops came in to Kabila's aid
and appeared to have been beaten back in an attempt to take
Kinshasa's Ndjili airport and infiltrate into the capital's eastern
suburbs.
	   The rebels used Kitona to fly in troops and ammunition they
needed to capture Kinshasa.
	   The rebels _ a coalition of ethnic Tutsis and disenchanted
members of Kabila's army _ still control eastern Congo, the third
largest city of Kisangani and were reportedly moving on to the
southern copper-rich province of Katanga.
	   Ondekane, who appeared relaxed and confident wearing his
camouflage uniform and a green bush hat, said it was too early to
call it a defeat.
	   ``We've taken eastern provinces. We must take other provinces,''
he said. ``The war in Kinshasa will not stop other operations.
We're advancing everywhere.''
	   Ondekane said the rebels had shot down on Saturday two Angolans
MiG fighter jets over the western front, bringing to total five
aircraft downed since the Angolan involvement last week. No
independent confirmation was possible.
	   ``We're not the enemies of the Angolans. We don't have foreign
troops here. We've shown more than once we're not with the Rwandans
or Ugandans,'' he said.
	   Kabila has accused his allies in Rwanda and Uganda of sponsoring
the rebellion, and on Friday paraded what the government said were
Rwandan soldiers captured in Kinshasa.
	   Ondekane warned the rebels will hit back at those forces
supporting Kabila.
	   He said the rebels were in control of the Congo River port and
an air-base at Matadi, 350 kilometers (215 miles) southwest of
Kinshasa, and an adjacent Inga power-plant which supplies
electricity to Kishasa and most of southern Congo.
	   In a carefully worded warning, he said the dam may be destroyed
if Angolan troops try to take it, but stopped short of saying
whether the key installation may serve as a bargaining chip in any
negotiations with the government.
	   ``It is because the foreign troops want to come in, there will
be war there. And in a war one assumes that the missiles and bombs
could easily destroy the wires, towers and the dam itself,'' he
said.

Unseeded Haarhuis upsets third-seeded Pioline, advances to finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW with Saturday's first semifinal; Will be UPDATED with late

<TEXT>
	   BROOKLINE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Unseeded Paul Haarhuis of the
Netherlands upset third-seeded Frenchman Cedric Pioline 7-5, 3-6,
6-3 Saturday in semifinal play at the MFS Pro Tennis Championship
at the Longwood Cricket Club.
	   Haarhuis, best known for his 43 career doubles titles with Jacco
Eltingh, advanced to his first final of the year.
	   The 32-year-old will play the winner of a second semifinal
between fourth-seeded American Michael Chang and qualifier
Sebastien Grosjean of France.
	   Haarhuis recovered from a break in the fifth game of the first
set and went on to break Pioline in the 10th game, when Pioline was
serving for the set. After holding his own serve, Haarhuis again
broke Pioline to take a one-set lead.
	   ``I tried to hit my serves deep and to keep him back,'' Haarhuis
said. ``He plays well from the baseline, but I had to keep
attacking. I thought I was playing well from the beginning, but in
the second set I became impatient.''
	   Pioline, who was favored, took the second set 6-3. He broke
Haarhuis in the ninth game and placed the eventual winner on the
defensive.
	   Haarhuis regained control in the final set, breaking Pioline in
the eighth game and then serving out for the match.
	   Though not known for a powerful serve, Haarhuis slammed two aces
in the final game of the match. He won the match converting on his
second match-point opportunity when Pioline's backhand went into
the net.

U.S. World War II American airmen honor comrades, visit Slovak

	   POLOMKA, Slovakia (AP) _ Fifty-four years after they were shot
down over Nazi-occupied Europe, five former U.S. airmen Saturday
honored Slovaks who aided them and their fellow Americans who lost
their own lives after helping others escape.
	   Joined by veterans of the Slovak wartime resistance, the five _
Neal Cobb of Carmel, Ind.; John Schianca of Enfield, Connecticut;
Roy Madsen of Salt Lake City, Utah; George Fernandez of Bellevue,
Wash.; and Jack Kellogg of Vista, Calif. _ raised plastic glasses
of blueberry brandy and toasted the memory of those who helped save
their lives.
	   ``They did so much for us,'' said Kellogg, the only one of the
five who was captured by the Germans. ``You know when you get back
here, it makes you glad. You did what you did.''
	   The five airmen were shot down over Nazi-occupied Slovakia in
two separate raids in July 1944 and September 1944 -- both of them
targetting an oil refinery in Lauchhammer, Germany, about 60
kilometers (37 miles) north of Dresden.
	   Kellogg, shot down in the July raid, landed in trees outside a
village. After a week of evading the Germans _ tired and dehydrated
_ he collapsed in a field. When he awoke, a Slovak boy was tending
him. The boy took him to his home, gave him food and water and let
him rest for several hours.
	   The boy pointed the way to Allied lines and they parted. having
never exchanged names for security reasons. Kellog was later taken
prisoner crossing into Hungary and was held in Hungarian and German
jails until the war in Europe ended in May 1945.
	   The four others were luckier. They were eventually picked up by
anti-Nazi Slovak partisans, took them to an airstrip in Banska
Bystrica, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of here.
	   On Oct. 7, 1944, a team from the U.S. Office of Strategic
Services, or OSS, the forerunner of the CIA, landed at the
airstrip, which was controlled by Slovak guerrillas.
	   Cobb, Schianca, Madsen and Fernandez flew back to American lines
aboard the plane that brought in the OSS agents, who were
accompanied by Joe Morton, a reporter for The Associated Press.
	   But the agents, along with Morton, were captured by the Germans
in Polomka on Dec. 26, 1944 and taken to a concentration camp at
Mathausen, where they were executed on Jan. 24, 1945.
	   Morton's daughter, Mimi Gosney of Lexington, Ky., is
accompanying the veterans, whose visit was organized by historian
Jim Downs of Oceanside, California. The group arrived in Slovakia
on Thursday.
	   On Friday, the airmen were all given commemorative medals by
municipal authorities of Banska Bystrica, where the 1944 Slovak
uprising against the Nazis began.
	   The visit has brought back memories of the desperate days when
Europe was in flames.
	   Schianca, 83, broke his leg after bailing out of his flaming
bomber. He was picked up by Slovaks who took him to a nunnery in
the town of Trencin, where the nuns cared for him until his leg
healed.
	   After several weeks, he left the nunnery and began to make his
way toward Allied lines. He was guided by Frantisek Sekeres, then a
17-year-old partisan, who took him to the airstrip.
	   ``You don't know how often I have made that trip in my mind all
these years,'' Schianca told Sekeres through a translator. It was
their first meeting since the war.
	   During the ceremony here Saturday, Slovak army Lt. Col. Anton
Filo recalled hearing as a child that ``the Americans were here.''
	   ``And I know the children in the village have seen you today and
they, too, will say: `The Americans were here,''' he said.

_ he collapsed in a field. When he awoke, a Slovak boy was tending
him. The boy took him to his home, gave him food and water and let
him rest for several hours.
	   The boy pointed the way to Allied lines and they parted. having
never exchanged names for security reasons. Kellog was later taken
prisoner crossing into Hungary and was held in Hungarian and German
jails until the war in Europe ended in May 1945.
	   The four others were luckier. They were eventually picked up by
anti-Nazi Slovak partisans, took them to an airstrip in Banska
Bystrica, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of here.
	   On Oct. 7, 1944, a team from the U.S. Office of Strategic
Services, or OSS, the forerunner of the CIA, landed at the
airstrip, which was controlled by Slovak guerrillas.
	   Cobb, Schianca, Madsen and Fernandez flew back to American lines
aboard the plane that brought in the OSS agents, who were
accompanied by Joe Morton, a reporter for The Associated Press.
	   But the agents, along with Morton, were captured by the Germans
in Polomka on Dec. 26, 1944 and taken to a concentration camp at
Mauthausen, where they were executed on Jan. 24, 1945.
	   Morton's daughter, Mimi Gosney of Lexington, Ky., is
accompanying the veterans, whose visit was organized by historian
Jim Downs of Oceanside, California. The group arrived in Slovakia
on Thursday.
	   On Friday, the airmen were all given commemorative medals by
municipal authorities of Banska Bystrica, where the 1944 Slovak
uprising against the Nazis began.
	   The visit has brought back memories of the desperate days when
Europe was in flames.
	   Schianca, 83, broke his leg after bailing out of his flaming
bomber. He was picked up by Slovaks who took him to a nunnery in
the town of Trencin, where the nuns cared for him until his leg
healed.
	   After several weeks, he left the nunnery and began to make his
way toward Allied lines. He was guided by Frantisek Sekeres, then a
17-year-old partisan, who took him to the airstrip.
	   ``You don't know how often I have made that trip in my mind all
these years,'' Schianca told Sekeres through a translator. It was
their first meeting since the war.
	   During the ceremony here Saturday, Slovak army Lt. Col. Anton
Filo recalled hearing as a child that ``the Americans were here.''
	   ``And I know the children in the village have seen you today and
they, too, will say: `The Americans were here,''' he said.

Badly-organized PSV drops further back
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ PSV Eindhoven's shaky start to the
season continued Saturday with a 2-1 home defeat to SC Heerenveen.
	   English coach Bobby Robson's PSV has just one point from the
season's first two league games, and needed extra time Wednesday to
reach the Champions League against Slovakia's Maribor.
	   Yugoslavian Radoslav Samardzic was at the center of many
Heerenveen attacks but failed several times in front of goal.
	   But striker Dennis de Nooijer opened the scoring on 22 minutes,
turning swiftly on the edge of the penalty box and riding a weak
challenge fom PSV keeper Ronald Waterreus.
	   Brazilian defender Joorginho failed to clear an easy ball on 58
minutes and Samardzic finally found the net to make it 2-0.
	   Joorginho's reward was a swift substitution by Robson.
	   Ruud van Nistelrooij gave PSV some hope with a quarter of an
hour to go, driving the ball home after Gilles de Bilde's header
bounced back off the post.
	   But Heerenveen held on and is now tied at the top of the Dutch
premiership with Ajax on six points from two games.
	   Elswhere tonight, AZ Almaar against Vitesse Arnhem finished
scorelees and Finnish defender Sami Hyypia's header gave Willem II
Tiburg a 1-0 victory over Fortuna Sittard.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) - A Cuban commercial aircraft carrying 82
people burst into flames and crashed into a street during takeoff
Saturday in Quito, Ecuador, killing at least 69 people, civil
aviation authorities said.
	   They did not specify if the death toll included people killed on
the ground nor give the cause of the crash. Radio reports earlier
said four people were killed as the plane plowed into an auto
mechanics' shop, but authorities did not immediately confirm this.
	   Witnesses said the Russian-made Tupolev aircraft owned by Cubana
de Aviacion crashed into a street and empty lot at the end of the
runway at the Quito international airport. It was heading to
Guayaquil, on the Ecuadorean coast, and then on to Havana, Cuba.
	   Airport officials said there were 76 passengers and six crew
members on board. They did not provide the nationalities of the
passengers.
	   Alfredo Albuja, head of emergency operations for the Civil
Aviation Office, said at a news conference that at least 69 people
were killed in the crash but he did not specify if that included
anyone killed on the ground.
	   ``There must be many dead, but there are also survivors. I
pulled one person out alive,'' said civil defense volunteer Hugo
Albuja.
	   Channel 10 television interviewed Cuban survivor Hernan Boada,
27, who had burnt hair and a fractured ankle.
	   ``Before we heard the roar of the crash, we felt the plane rise
a bit and burst in flames. There were three explosions,'' Boada
said. ``I saw other people wrapped in flames jump from the plane.''
	   ``I was in seat number 21, a window seat at wing level. The
doors would not open, so I jumped through a hole in the plane amid
the flames from a height of about two yards (meters),'' he said.

Rafter advances to finals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's first semifinal; WILL be UPDATED. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Australia's Patrick Rafter, the
defending U.S. Open champion, continued his mastery of Greg
Rusedski with a 6-4, 7-5 victory Saturday to advance to the finals
of the Hamlet Cup.
	   The 25-year-old Rafter, ranked No. 3 on the ATP Tour and the
second seed in the tournament, is 5-1 _ including 5-0 on hard
courts _ against Rusedski, last year's U.S. Open runner-up.
	   ``I played a smart game today,'' Rafter said. ``I served well
and made the most of the big points.''
	   The Australian, 25-3 with three titles since mid-June, will
oppose the winner of Saturday's other semifinal match between No. 8
Felix Mantilla of Spain and 18-year-old Marat Safin, the rookie
sensation from Russia, in Sunday's championship.
	   ``My goal in this tournament, in addition to wanting to win, was
to make sure my game is all there for the U.S. Open. It is,''
Rafter said. ``I definitely have a chance to win if the draw opens
up a bit. I have to keep my energy level up, especially if the
weather continues hot and humid, as it has been here.''
	   Rusedski, in only his second tournament since a seven-week
layoff because of a sprained ankle suffered June 12 at the Queens
Club in London, dropped to 30-16 and 20-6 on hardcourt.
	   ``It was satisfying to get seven matches in since my return,''
Rusedski said. ``Patrick's serve was definitely on. By far, he's
the best player on the tour this summer.''
	   Rafter, the runnerup in last year's Hamlet looking for his fifth
title of the year, said Rusedski mixed his game up well, but the
24-year-old Canadian, who lives in Britain, has some way to go.
	   ``Only because he missed so many matches and has to catch up,''
Rafter said. ``He's still a step away and it's going to take two to
three weeks to catch up.''
	   Rusedski agreed with Rafter's assessment.
	   ``I didn't raise my intensity level high enough,'' he said. ``I
have to get into the match right from the start. Today I didn't. I
didn't start off serving very well. You can't do that against top
10 players. They make you pay for it.''

Karl named Bucks' sixth coach since '87
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. FRANCIS, Wisconsin (AP) _ The Milwaukee Bucks hired former
Seattle SuperSonics coach George Karl on Saturday to replace Chris
Ford, who was fired last week.
	   Karl was signed to a four-year deal.
	   ``When the opportunity here came about, I was very excited,''
Karl said at a news conference at the Bucks' training center in St.
Francis. ``I love coaching and I wanted to coach this team.''
	   Karl, said to be seeking a contract worth between dlrs 3 million
and dls 5 million per year, had been mentioned as a candidate for
the Denver Nuggets and Los Angeles Clippers jobs earlier this
summer.
	   When Ford was fired Wednesday, team owner Herb Kohl said money
wouldn't be an object in hiring a new coach.
	   Over the past six seasons, Seattle won more games than any team
in the American National Basketball Association except the Chicago
Bulls. Still, owner Barry Ackerley was disappointed by his team's
lack of playoff success despite a trip to the NBA Finals in 1996.
	   Karl has strained relations with Ackerley and Sonics general
manager Wally Walker, and the team cited its inability to trust
Karl with sensitive information when announcing that he would not
return.
	   Paul Westphal has been named Karl's replacement in Seattle.
	   Ford, 49, a former Boston Celtics coach, joined the Bucks in
June 1996 with a three-year contract. The Bucks hired him after
Mike Dunleavy moved up to general manager. But Dunleavy resigned as
GM in 1996 and later returned to coaching in Portland.
	   The Bucks were 33-49 in Ford's first season and 36-46 last
season.

Valencia defeats Atletico 1-0 to open season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Miguel Angel Angulo led Valencia to a 1-0
win over Atletico de Madrid in the in the opening game of the
Spanish league season.
	   Second-ranking Atletico de Madrid and Valencia, both with
Italian defense masters, Arrigo Sacchi and Claudio Rainieri, faced
off in the second match of 10 this weekend.
	   Valencia, fresh from its midweek Intertoto victory over
Austria's Salzburg to qualify for a UEFA berth, got the lead in the
68th with a header by Angulo after a pass by Rumanian striker
Adrian Illie.
	   Atletico relying on its new signings Argentine Jose Antonio
Chamot and Yugoslav Vladimir Jogovic, noticed the absence of its
former player Italian striker Christian Vieri who signed for
Italia's Lazio just hours before the League's start.
	   Valencia and Atletico played before some 50,000 fans at the
Mestalla stadium in the eastern town.
	   In the first match of the season, newly promoted Alaves had a
quiet game in the 0-0 tie with Betis in northern town of Bilbao.
	   Betis pressured early as its new Brazilian World Cup star
Denilson shot wide right in the opening minutes.
	   Denilson, brought from Sao Paulo is one of the most expensive
player of the Spanish premier division. Betis spent 5.5 billion
pesetas (dlrs 36 million) in an effort to restore glory to Spain's
popular team which finished eight last year.
	   In the second half, Alaves led several attacks and fired
dangerous shots to Betis goal but all were blocked by Betis
defenders.
	   FC Barcelona begins defense of its title against Racing de
Santander on Sunday. In other games Sunday, it is: Real Sociedad
vs. Oviedo, Espanyol vs. Tenerife, Celta vs. Deportivo de la
Coruna, Zaragoza vs. Athletic de Bilbao, Mallorca vs. Salamanca and
first-division newcomer Extremadura vs. Valladolid. Real Madrid
Villareal, a side playing its first game ever in the premier
division, on Monday.

Graf defeats Novotna for Pilot Pen title

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Novotna losing in doubles. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW HAVEN, Connecticut (AP) _ Steffi Graf returned to the
winner's circle Saturday, easily beating Wimbledon champ Jana
Novotna 6-4, 6-1 for the Pilot Pen championship.
	   It was the first title in more than a year for Graf, who had
knee surgery in June 1997. Holding the trophy, she said, felt
``awesome.''
	   ``It's been a long way, but it's special to be here right now,
to be at this point,'' Graf said. ``It's worth doing what I done.''
	   What she did Saturday was carve up Novotna's athletic serve and
volley game in one hour, seven minutes.
	   The winner of 21 Grand Slam titles, Graf put on a dominating
display of precision, power and quickness. She kept Novotna off the
net, scoring winners from both sides of the racket. She said her
backhand was probably her most improved shot.
	   ``It makes life a little easier. I didn't really make a lot of
mistakes and felt I was controlling the points,'' Graf said.
	   Novotna, the No. 2 seed, managed only nine points in the second
set.
	   ``She was really overpowering and played unbelievable tennis,''
said Novotna, who admitted being tired.
	   Novotna played in both the singles and doubles draw and competed
until 10:30 p.m. Friday with partner Mariann Deswardt, of South
Africa, in her doubles semifinal, which was suspended due to rain.
Second-seeded in the double draw, Novotna and Deswardt lost in the
final in straight sets to the top seeded French pair of Alexandra
Fusai and Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Graf reached the final with straight set victories over unseeded
Henrieta Nagyova, No. 7 seed Amanda Coetzer and defending champ and
top seed Lindsay Davenport.
	   Novotna, who will improve from third to second in the WTA Tour
rankings on Monday, advanced to the title game in straight sets
over three unseeded players, Chanda Rubin, Amelie Mauresmo and
Julie Halard-Decugis.
	   Graf's last title came in May 1997 on the clay courts of
Strasbourg. A month later she had surgery on her left knee. The
Pilot Pen was her ninth tournament of the year and the first time
she reached the finals.
	   She still holds the longest winning streak at the U.S. Open.
	   Graf, who will break into the top 30 on Monday _ the first day
of the U.S. Open, hasn't lost at Flushing Meadows since the 1994
final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario. Her 1996 victory at the U.S.
Open gave her 21 Grand Slam wins, second behind Margaret Court's
record of 24.
	   The 29-year-old German nearly missed the Pilot Pen. After being
bounced early in the Du Maurier last week, she planned to relax in
Florida to rest up before Monday's Open. She was overruled when
coach Heinz Gunthardt told her she needed more matches.
	   ``I felt maybe I needed a few days off. Heinz didn't think so,''
she said. ``And he was very right.''

Cook makes up ground but Duval still leads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RUSTY MILLER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AKRON, Ohio (AP) _ John Cook torched the golf course where he
first learned the game, shooting an 8-under-par 62 Saturday, but
steady David Duval still maintained the lead by a shot through
three rounds of the NEC World Series of Golf.
	   Duval chipped in from 9 meters (30 feet) for a birdie at the
17th, but then had trouble getting out of the deep rough after
pulling his drive on the closing hole. He settled for a bogey _
hitting a difficult 1-meter (4-foot) putt _ for a second straight
66 that put him at 9-under 201.
	   Cook, who had just six birdies while playing the first two
rounds in even par, started the day tied for 10th and was five
strokes behind co-leaders Duval, Tiger Woods and Craig Parry.
	   Yet he came out of the pack to flirt with the magical 59 _ the
lowest score ever recorded in a U.S. PGA Tour event. The 10-time
tour winner was nine under heading to the 16th tee and needed
birdies on two of the last three holes to join Al Geiberger (1977)
and Chip Beck (1991) as the only players to ever shoot 59 on tour.
	   A three-putt bogey on the 17th green _ including a quirky U-turn
on his 1-meter (3-foot) par putt _ ended his run at history. Still,
the 62 matched the lowest round in an American PGA Tour event this
year.
	   Almost lost in the wake of Cook's blitz was the steady assault
of Duval. While many of the rest of the big names near the top of
the leaderboard floundered, Duval had four birdies on the front
side and never lost the lead.
	   First-round leader Phil Mickelson, who won the World Series in
1996, also had a 66 to climb into third place at 7-under 203.
	   British Open and U.S. Masters winner Mark O'Meara shot a 65 that
put him at 204.
	   Woods double-bogeyed the closing hole after hitting his approach
shot into the sand behind the green. From a buried lie he blasted
the ball just a few feet onto the fringe and then left another
wedge shot 4 1-2 meters (15 feet) short of the hole. He two-putted
for an even-par 70 that left him at 5-under 205.
	   Cook spent a lot of his youth in Akron where his father, Jim,
was an assistant gridiron football coach at the University of
Akron.
	   Cook, who led after the third round a year ago, lives in Rancho
Mirage, California, but many in the large crowds lining the ropes
consider him a local boy who went off, starred at Ohio State
Univeristy and then became famous on the U.S. PGA Tour.
	   His father, who first brought him to Firestone Country Club as a
small child, has been the tournament manager of the World Series
for the past 19 years.
	   Cook almost holed a birdie putt on No. 1, then posted birdies at
2, 4, 5 and 7 to make the turn in 4-under 31. The birdie at 4 came
on a 60-foot putt.
	   At 10 and 11, he hit irons within 2 meters (5 and 6 feet) and
made the birdie putts. He had three straight birdies starting at
No. 13 _ blading a 4 1-2-meter (15-foot) sand wedge from off the
fringe at 13, almost holing a 9-iron at 14 and hitting a 3
1-2-meter (12-foot) putt at 15.
	   The galleries following him grew in size and volume with each
birdie.
	   Cook salvaged par at the 625-yard (563-meter) 16th hole, known
as ``The Monster,'' chipping from over the green to 2 meters (6
feet) where he canned the par putt.
	   At 17, he had just 2 meters (6 feet) for birdie and barely
missed the tricky, downhill birdie putt. His half-meter (2-foot)
comeback putt did everything but go in, making a U-turn around the
lip, leaving him with a bogey and dropping him to eight under for
the day and the tournament.
	   He even teased the cup on a 2 1-2 meter (9-foot) birdie putt at
the finishing hole, but it just skimmed the edge of the hole.

Cuban airliner crashes in Ecuador, killing at least 69

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Red Cross saying at least one engine failed. ADDS
comment from president, background on previous crashes at Quito
airport. &QL; 
 &UR; By CARLOS CISTERNAS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) - A Cuban commercial aircraft carrying 82
people burst into flames Saturday during takeoff and slammed into a
soccer field, killing at least 69 people, civil aviation
authorities said.
	   They did not specify if the death toll included people killed on
the ground nor give the cause of the crash.
	   Witnesses said the Russian-made Tupolev aircraft owned by Cubana
de Aviacion lost altitude and clipped the top of an auto mechanic's
shop beyond the end of the runway at the Quito international
airport before plowing into a soccer field.
	   The flight was headed to Guayaquil, on the Ecuadorean coast, and
then on to Havana, Cuba.
	   Red Cross official Galo Leoro said the plane had just started
taking off when apparently at least one motor failed and the
airliner crashed several hundred yards (meters) beyond the end of
the runway.
	   Airport officials said there were 76 passengers and six crew
members on board. They did not provide the nationalities of the
passengers.
	   Alfredo Albuja, head of emergency operations for the Civil
Aviation Office, said at a news conference that at least 69 people
were killed in the crash, but he did not specify if that included
anyone killed on the ground.
	   Four people died when the plane struck the auto mechanic's shop,
a radio station reported, but that could not be confirmed.
	   ``There must be many dead, but there are also survivors. I
pulled one person out alive,'' said civil defense volunteer Hugo
Albuja.
	   Channel 10 television interviewed Cuban survivor Hernan Boada,
27, who had burnt hair and a fractured ankle.
	   ``Before we heard the roar of the crash, we felt the plane rise
a bit and burst in flames. There were three explosions,'' Boada
said. ``I saw other people wrapped in flames jump from the plane.''
	   ``I was in seat number 21, a window seat at wing level. The
doors would not open, so I jumped through a hole in the plane amid
the flames from a height of about two yards (meters),'' he said.
	   At the crash site, President Jamil Mahuad told reporters he was
asking investigators to speed up ongoing feasibility plans for a
proposed new airport outside the Ecuadorian capital.
	   The current airport is in the middle of the city, surrounded by
a populous middle-class neighborhood.
	   A Brazilian FLY airlines plane, carrying the Brazilian soccer
team Corinthians, almost crashed on May 1, 1996. One of the jet
turbines flamed out, but the crew managed to abort takeoff, sending
the plane crashing into an airport wall. One player was slightly
injured.
	   In September 1994, a cargo plane from the Ecuadorian company
AECA crashed at the end of the runway during takeoff, killing 65
people.
	   Both planes fell in roughly the same spot where the Cubana plane
crashed.

Americans win slugfest 12-9
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's game. &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSPORT, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Chris Cardone homered in
consecutive at-bats, including a game-winning two-run shot in the
sixth, as American champion Toms River, New Jersey, won the Little
League Baseball World Series with a 12-9 victory over Kashima,
Japan, Saturday afternoon.
	   Todd Frazier, Scott Fisher and Casey Gaynor also homered for the
the U.S. team in a slugfest in which 11 balls clear the fences.
Toms River's bench celebrated at home plate after each one and,
after Frazier struck out the final batter, they leaped on top of
him as the crowd full of fans from the Atlantic Ocean community
only 240 kilometers (150 miles) away celebrated.
	   Frazier went 4-for-4 and finished the series with a .600 average
and four homers.
	   Tetsuya Furukawa, Kashima's hottest hitter all week with a .555
average and 10 RBIs, hit three of Kashima's five homers. And on two
of them, Tatsuya Sugata followed with solo shots of his own. But
Kashima, the first team from Japan in the series final since 1976,
couldn't overcome Toms River's onslaught.
	   Sayaka Tsushima, the sixth girl to play in a World Series and
the first from a Far East champion, was the first girl to play in a
final. She went 0-for-3.
	   Toms River, after twice surrendering leads, scored four runs in
the sixth inning as Cardone broke out of a 1-for-10 series slump.
Gabe Gardner, whose two fifth-inning errors had helped Japan tie
the game, drove in two runs with a single to make it 12-8.
	   After surrendering a 3-0 first-inning lead, Toms River went
ahead 8-4 on two-run homers by Fisher and Gaynor in the fourth
inning and Cardone's pinch-hit shot in the fifth.
	   As they had all day, the Japanese came back behind the second of
Furukawa and Sagata's consecutive homers in the fifth inning.
Gardner's two errors at third allowed a third run to score, and a
passed ball on Frazier's first pitch in relief tied the game 8-8.
	   Frazier's homer came on Sugata's third pitch of the game.
Gaynor's single drove in a second run, but Sugata _ who gave up
three runs on three hits and three walks in two-thirds of an inning
_ got his revenge with a homer in the bottom of the inning.
	   A Japanese team hadn't been to the final since Chofu, Tokyo, won
it in 1976 by beating Campbell, California, 10-3.

U.S. Secretary of state tries to give democracy a nudge in Croatia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY SCHWEID &QC; 
 &UR; AP Diplomatic Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright arrived in Croatia on Saturday to try to accelerate
democracy in a nation affected by ethnic war in neighboring Bosnia
and the hard-line rule of President Franjo Tudjman.
	   An increase in return of Serb refugees and expansion of press
freedom were on the top of Albright's agenda as she prepared for
talks Sunday with President Franjo Tudjman, Foreign Minister Mate
Granic and other government leaders.
	   She also will meet Josip Bozanic, archbishop of this
predominantly Roman Catholic country and a critic of Tudjman's
rule. Appointed by the Vatican last October, the 49-year-old
archbishop probably has more political influence in Croatia than
opposition leaders.
	   In his Easter message, Bozanic cautioned that many people in
this 7-year-old Balkan nation were falling into a ``spiritual
void'' and in another speech he criticized leaders who act in their
own interest.
	   Albright also will talk to Tudjman's political opponents and
journalists. Although there are many independent newspapers in
Croatia, the only nationwide television network is controlled by
Tudjman.
	   Tujman's party has been sharply criticized abroad for its
hard-line positions and unwillingness to cooperate in implementing
the Muslim-Croat Federation and in the return of Serb refugees who
fled fighting and ethnic cleansing in the recent Balkan conflict.
	   ``We've been very pleased that the Croatian government has now
put into place strong measures to facilitate the return of Serbs,''
a senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told
reporters traveling with Albright. ``We want to see this
intensified.''
	   The United States has two fundamental interests in Croatia, the
official said. The first, he said, is to see Croatia develop as a
democratic nation; the second is to back economic modernization.
	   An ominous note, the official said, was a statement by Defense
Minister Andrija Hebrang that revived aspirations of a ``greater
Croatia.'' That implies Croatia is keeping a hungry eye on Bosnia,
which has a sizable ethnic Croatian population.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) - A Cuban airplane carrying 90 people burst
into flames Saturday during takeoff and slammed into a soccer
field, killing at least 71 people, civil aviation authorities said.
The jetliner barely missed a heavily traveled avenue at the end of
the airport runway, which is at an altitude of 9,300 feet (2,830
meters). Witnesses said the Russian-made Tupolev-154 aircraft owned
by Cubana de Aviacion lost altitude and clipped the top of an auto
mechanic's shop beyond the end of the runway before plowing into a
soccer field. The nose and front part of the plane disintegrated in
the crash. Red Cross workers in red uniforms dug through the
charred wreckage for survivors while fire fighters sprayed jets of
waters on the smoking ruins to prevent further explosions.
(ECUADOR-PLANE CRASH)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government declared Saturday that
there will be no return to the Soviet system and the hard-line
opposition signaled it was ready to compromise with Boris Yeltsin
to restore political calm. ``We have already joined the world
economy, and there will be no return to the past,'' acting Prime
Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin pledged on national television. His
assurances followed days of frenzied negotiations in which the
government appeared ready to take drastic actions to restore
economic calm, including reimposing Soviet-style controls on prices
and the exchange rate. The economy meanwhile, showed a few signs of
nascent recovery. After sharp drops earlier in the week, the ruble
bounced back a bit in Moscow street sales on Saturday and demand
was high enough that some exchange booths ran out of the Russian
currency. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ In a defiant mood, Congo's rebel commander
said Saturday the war in Congo was not over yet despite recent
losses. ``They say the war is over but I say the war is not
finished,'' Jean-Pierre Ondekane said in his eastern stronghold.
``We're in Kinshasa fighting. The situation is going well.'' The
36-year-old Ondekane, the chief rebel commander, spoke to reporters
for the first time since President Laurent Kabila's forces, aided
by Angolan and Zimbabwean troops, hit back at the rebels advancing
on Kinshasa. The rebels have lost the western Atlantic Ocean
air-base of Kitona when the Angolans came in to Kabila's aid and
appeared to have been beaten back in an attempt to take Kinshasa's
Ndjili airport and infiltrate into the capital's eastern suburbs.
(CONGO-DEFIANT REBELS)
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ Palestinian boys hurled stones and
empty bottles toward Israeli soldiers Saturday as the Palestinian
leadership warned of escalating tensions in the fractious city if a
Jewish enclave there is expanded. Israeli soldiers responded with
one round of rubber bullets toward the Palestinian protesters who
ranged in age from ten to fourteen. No injuries were reported.
Tensions in the city have been flaring since the stabbing of a
prominent rabbi in his home nine days ago, apparently by a
Palestinian militant. The Palestinian leadership issued a statement
late Friday condemning Israeli plans to expand and fortify Tel
Romeida, the heavily fortified Jewish enclave in the city center
where Rabbi Shlomo Raanan was killed. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ From remote Tibet to oil wells in the northeast,
China's battle against devastating floods continued Saturday with
flood fighters warning that more surging waters were on their way.
Flood officials issued an urgent appeal to millions of soldiers and
civilians exhausted by two months of inundations to brace for yet
another flood crest surging down the Yangtze, China's longest
river, which is gripped by its heaviest flooding in 44 years. The
flood crest, the eighth this summer, followed rains on the river's
upper tributaries. Flood officials said the high water would
seriously test dikes already weakened and waterlogged. This year's
floods have killed more than 3,000 people, 1,320 of them along the
3,900-mile- (6,200-kilometer-) long Yangtze, the world's third
largest river. Millions more people are homeless. (CHINA-FLOODS)

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jean-Claude Van Damme remembers the day he
almost died.
	   It came just over a year ago while Van Damme was out of his mind
on cocaine, pacing back and forth in a Hong Kong hotel suite like a
caged animal.
	   ``I was in the room, I wrote on the back of a script my
problems, my complexes, my fears. I wrote with that coke, like, 80
pages,'' Van Damme says in the Sept. 4 Entertainment Weekly. ``I
wrote and I wrote, and I almost passed out. Then I was in the
corner of the room. I was dying. I saw my body on the floor. I felt
cold, I felt hot, I felt scared. I didn't feel like a man or a
woman.
	   ``And then I just came back into that envelope, that body, with
that soul, and I said, `I'm not ready. I know what's death after
life.'''
	   Van Damme, 37, who has since been diagnosed with manic
depression, says he started doing cocaine in 1993 while making
``Sudden Death.'' He entered a drug rehabilitation center in 1996
but dropped out of the monthlong program after a week.
	   After the Hong Kong hotel incident, the Belgian star of the
upcoming film ``Knockoff'' quit cocaine and now receives medication
for manic depression.
	   ``I don't feel the change (on medication),'' he says. ``Maybe I
feel 5 percent, but I see the difference in me in the people around
me.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cindy Crawford thinks the years have been kind
to her.
	   The supermodel first did a nude layout for Playboy a decade ago
and recently did another for the magazine's October issue _ over
the objections of advisers.
	   ``My agent, among other people, said `You shouldn't do Playboy
again because people are just starting to take you seriously,''
Crawford says in the Sept. 7 People magazine. ``I thought, `How
sad. Do I have to sacrifice being perceived as a sensual woman to
be taken seriously?''
	   The recently remarried model who has also done some acting and
``House of Style'' episodes on MTV has an ABC special due Sept. 22
called ``Sex With Cindy Crawford.'' Her latest Playboy spread is
her fourth (she also appeared in the magazine in 1994 and 1995).
	   At 32, Crawford admits her picture-perfect body has changed
since her first Playboy shoot.
	   ``Obviously some things aren't quite as high or perky as they
were, but my body is a result of how I treated it, as opposed to
what I was born with,'' Crawford said. ``I am really pleased with
the pictures.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ TV star and cancer survivor Robert Urich,
riding high as captain of the Love Boat, will be at the helm of
this year's Hollywood Christmas Parade.
	   The former star of ``Vegas,'' ``Spencer For Hire'' and ``The
Lazarus Man'' was named grand marshall for 67th annual holiday
parade through the heart of Hollywood.
	   Urich heads a cruise ship on the current American TV show,
``Love Boat, The Next Wave.'' The Christmas parade featuring
celebrities, floats and marching bands will be broadcast nationwide
by the UPN network, which carries his show, on Nov. 29.
	   Urich, 51, underwent chemotherapy, radiation treatments and two
operations in the mid-1990s to successfully fight synovial cell
sarcoma. He has been cancer-free for more than a year.
	   This year, the parade will offer a commemorative ornament, with
a portion of the proceeds donated to Urich's favorite charity, the
American Cancer Society.
	   ``It is an honor to take part in an event with the legacy and
tradition of the Hollywood Christmas Parade, and it is gratifying
to know that my role will help make a difference,'' Urich said.
	   Previous Hollywood Christmas Parade grand marshals have included
John Wayne, James Stewart and Sammy Davis Jr. Comedian Tom Arnold
led the parade last year.
	   ___
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Magic Johnson says the main reason his talk show
failed was that top black celebrities wouldn't appear on the
program.
	   ``We all have to support each other, and we don't do that. Black
stars think that if they're not on `Leno' or `Letterman,' then
they're not making it. That's the problem,'' the former basketball
star said in an online interview posted Friday. ``Their managers
and agents keep them off of the black shows. There it is, there's
your major problem right there.''
	   Johnson, whose ``The Magic Hour'' was canceled earlier this
month, urged blacks to support the next attempt at a black
entertainment program.
	   ``We still need an avenue,'' he said on the Electronic Urban
Report Website. ``Because, regardless if the show was good or not,
you don't have an outlet anymore. Now we will complain because we
don't have anything.''
	   ___
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Some 1,200 bottles of wine, champagne
and cognac, which belonged to the family of late Romanian dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu, will be auctioned off this fall, a government
official said Saturday.
	   The spirits will be sold along with Ceausescu's cars, boats and
other property.
	   Most of the wines come from Romanian vineyards or were given to
Ceausescu by other Communist leaders. The oldest two bottles from
Tirnave vineyard, 190 miles north of Bucharest, date back to 1918,
said government spokesman Mihai Nica.
	   Every bottle is sealed with a golden ribbon, with an attached
card saying, ``Ceausescu's family residence''.
	   After the communist dictator was executed in the 1989
anti-Communist revolution, some 3,000 bottles of spirits were found
in his villa in Bucharest. The following year, 1,800 were sold and
the money was given to a hospital.

Pigs in panda's clothing _ artist tells us to look beneath the
</HEADLINE>
surface. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ Americans see pigs as dirty, greedy slobs, but
in China, the pig is respected for its usefulness.
	   To artist Xu Bing, the American disdain for pigs is a metaphor
for people's tendency to make instant judgments about one another,
instead of looking beneath the surface at hidden qualities.
	   He expresses that idea through his exhibit, ``Xu Bing _ Cultural
Animal,'' at the Wood Street Galleries in downtown Pittsburgh, in
which he displays three black-and-white Hampshire piglets wearing
panda masks.
	   Pigs have many good qualities and in rural China many households
have at least one pig which is given scraps of food that would
otherwise be wasted. When the pig is large enough, it is killed or
sold.
	   Pigs are intelligent animals, says Xu, a New Yorker. ``They are
really smart, they are really cute and they are really sensitive.
Each pig has a different personality.''
	   Murray Horne, the museum's curator, explained that Xu chose the
panda disguise because in the West the panda has a cuddly, positive
image, unlike the pig.
	   The fake-fur masks leave eyes and snouts free, and the pigs were
able to eat, investigate a worker cleaning their cage and walk to
the edge of the cage to be patted. Their floor was covered with
pine shavings and topsoil, and rocks and bamboo were placed in
their cage.
	   Bernie Wilke, a member of Animal Advocates, said he hadn't seen
the exhibit and couldn't say whether the ``Panda Zoo'' portion of
Xu's show used animals ethically. However, confining any animal
runs counter to its interests, he said.
	   ``It would seem that animals would like to be free and forage
for their own food,'' Wilke said.
	   The artist lives in New York and has lectured at Carnegie Mellon
University, while the pigs come Avondale, Westmoreland County.
	   Spectators' reactions varied.
	   ``It doesn't seem to be anything very specific. Everyone here is
just talking it out,'' said Richard Pell, 22, an art student.
``He's not preaching, he's just stirring the pot.''
	   ``I'm not sure what's going on,'' said Julie McAfee, 37, an
artist from Wilkinsburg, a suburb of Pittsburgh. ``I'm looking
forward to understanding more of what is being said.''
	   ``The environment creates a situation of interaction but
separation,'' said art student Thad Kellstadt, 21. ``It also poses
a question and possibly makes a joke or social commentary.''

Paramount Ranch: A Western movie set that could fool a ghost

<TEXT>
	   AGOURA HILLS, California (AP) _ The leather on his saddle
squeaks, and his spurs jingle as the cowboy ghost of Westerns past
climbs down from his horse in front of The Gold Nugget Hotel and
Saloon.
	   ``Mighty quiet,'' he says to no one in particular as he glances
around suspiciously while fingering his bushy brown mustache.
	   Hot and thirsty, he swaggers up the steps of the watering hole
and turns the doorknob. Locked. He taps on the window; it's
plastic. He raps on the log walls; they're pressed fiberglass. He
pushes on the stone fireplace; the rocks are hard-shelled foam.
	   He grabs his pistol, spins around on a cowboy boot heel and
jumps back on his horse. ``We've been had!'' he yells as he gallops
off into the sunset. ``This ain't Bodie!''
	   While most of the Old West's ghost towns were abandoned by
miners, Western Town at Paramount Ranch _ authentic enough to fool
a ghost _ was forsaken by Hollywood.
	   From the 1920s to 1950s, the studios shot hundreds of classic
cowboy flicks there. In the years since, the deserted town's Wild
West facade in the rugged Santa Monica Mountains northwest of Los
Angeles has been the backdrop for only a handful of movies and TV
series.
	   Gary Cooper, Mae West and Cecil B. Demille once practiced their
craft here. When the fledgling medium of television needed
locations for Westerns such as ``The Cisco Kid'' and ``Zane Grey
Theatre,'' Paramount Ranch was the place to shoot.
	   Bears, bobcats, coyotes and rattlesnakes freely roam the dense,
chaparral-covered hillsides peppered with white granite boulders
that surround the town, giving the location a truly untamed feel.
	   A dusty road winds through the center of town past mercantile,
gunsmith, saddlery and leather goods shops and a jail.
	   Hitching posts and watering troughs parallel the wooden walkways
in front of each weathered building's entry. Cobweb-laced windows,
some darkened by faded velvet curtains, tempt the curious to peek
inside.
	   But instead of finding remnants of a once-flourishing boomtown,
visitors see only the hollow interiors of empty shells that served
to send movie and television viewers back in time.
	   Most recently, Paramount Ranch was transformed into a
19th-century Colorado mining town for filming of the now-canceled
series, ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' starring Jane Seymour.
	   For more than six years, cast and crew members worked out of
air-conditioned trailers tucked under eucalyptus trees just outside
of town to film the popular family show.
	   But again, the town went bust when the CBS network cut the
series unexpectedly in January. On a recent afternoon, workers tore
down the last of the show's extra sets and carried the debris away
in trailer trucks.
	   As if part of a script, a turkey vulture circled overhead just
as the demolition crew ripped apart the heart of the show: Dr.
Quinn's cabin.
	   ``I saw every single episode that was ever made,'' said Sue
Buetow of Shakopee, Minnesota, who stopped by the site on a visit
to Southern California.
	   ``It makes me sick that it's being torn down,'' she said as a
forklift sent the cabin's fireplace crashing to the dirt.
	   The ranch first became a film site in 1927, when Paramount
Pictures purchased 2,400 acres (970 hectares) of Rancho Las
Virgenes. Its remote look, yet proximity just inside the ``studio
circle,'' made it an attractive location for the industry. (Any
place more than 35 miles (56 kilometers) from Hollywood is
considered out-of-town work by unions and therefore more expensive
for studios.)
	   Between 1927 and 1948, 14 percent of Paramount's movies were
produced at least in part at the ranch, and other film companies
often leased the ranch.
	   Early silent films starring George Bancroft, W.C. Fields and
Fred Thompson were shot at the ranch. Later, Hopalong Cassidy,
Buster Crabbe and Roy Rogers briefly made the town their home.
	   Paramount sold the ranch in the early 1950s.
	   William Hertz, a Western movie fan, bought the site in 1953 and
rebuilt the town into a permanent Western location using original
Paramount props stored on the property.
	   In 1955, Hertz sold the ranch, and the area was subdivided
several more times before the National Park Service purchased the
property in 1980 for dlrs 6 million. It restored the Western Town
and has a ``special park uses manager'' who coordinates filming
there.
	   ``Part of the National Park's mission is to preserve our
nation's cultural heritage,'' Alice Allen said. ``So we're
preserving this site as a working motion picture ranch so it will
still be there for our children.''
	   And for the occasional ghost.

Wesley Snipes takes the bite out of vampire heroes

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wesley Snipes has offended many people during
his rich film career: anti-gang activists, Japanese, black women,
white men who can't jump.
	   Now there's a new group: the undead.
	   Vampires take an awful beating when Snipes morphs into
``Blade,'' a Marvel Comics-based superhero who slashes his way
through Earth's teeming mass of toothy bloodsuckers.
	   This time, though, Snipes isn't worried about any backlash.
After all, the movie-going public is decidedly pro-living and
anti-vampire.
	   ``I'm trying to touch all the markets, man,'' jokes Snipes,
grinning behind a pair of sunglasses.
	   Snipes obviously relishes his new over-the-top role. During a
recent interview, the actor borrowed most of Blade's costume: the
all-black clothing, the inpenetrable pair of shades _ even the SWAT
team flack jacket. He makes the Terminator look like a Teletubby.
	   Which is, of course, a 180-degree turn from the actor's last
film role _ the unheroic, complicated anchor of ``One Night
Stand,'' director Mike Figgis' atmospheric take on infidelity.
	   ``Look, I'm not limited in my imagination, so why should I be
limited in my work? I've been the underdog pretty much all my life
so I'm not afraid of not being the cat's meow, the one who's
ordained,'' says the actor whose title character in ``Blade'' is a
half-human, half-vampire who packs a sword, a flame-thrower and a
nasty assault weapon that shoots silver bullets.
	   ``It's been that way all my life and I'm very accustomed to
it,'' he says. ``So I'm always going to do the things that are
somewhat unexpected.''
	   That might just as well be his motto. Over a two-year period,
1991-92, Snipes portrayed a chilling, streetwise crack boss in
``New Jack City,'' an architect in an interracial affair in
``Jungle Fever,'' a paraplegic in ``The Waterdance'' and the heroic
``Passenger 57.''
	   This much is clear: The 36-year-old actor _ who also starred in
``White Men Can't Jump'' _ can run. He can jump. He can shoot _ and
cry. He'll even wear a dress _ in 1995's ``To Wong Foo, Thanks for
Everything! Julie Newmar.''
	   ``He's really taken some chances,'' says Stephen Dorff, his
``Blade'' co-star. ``And it's obvious he's an interesting actor
underneath it all.''
	   Snipes grew up in the Bronx and attended the High School of the
Performing Arts _ the celebrated ``Fame'' school _ where he studied
dance, singing and acting.
	   While still a teen-ager, he moved with his mother to Orlando,
Florida, where money was tight and Snipes, small for his age,
developed a slickster persona. He credits a tough background with
keeping him real.
	   ``I've been doing work now for maybe 10 years or so and there
have been times when I've been really, really hot and other times
when I've been kind of cool,'' he says.
	   ``And in those times, I'm not tripping. I'm not drinking myself
to madness or out there trying to commit suicide because I'm not in
a hit movie. Some people can't do that. And I think that has a lot
to do with having been one of the have-nots for a long time.''
	   Early in his career, Snipes had a number of minor film and
television roles, including that of the rival gang leader who
menaced Michael Jackson in the music video ``Bad.'' Now he
generally pumps out at least two movies a year, working alongside
the best in the business: Robert De Niro, Sylvester Stallone, Woody
Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones and Sean Connery, whom he joined in the
thriller ``Rising Sun,'' which some complained was guilty of
Japan-bashing.
	   He hasn't shared much screen time, however, with fellow black
actors, getting the opportunity to do so _ thanks to director Spike
Lee _ with Samuel L. Jackson and Denzel Washington. As for, say,
Will Smith and Morgan Freeman, he's still waiting.
	   ``You put Wes and Morgan in a movie and it's no longer an
American film: It becomes a black film,'' he says. ``Now, you can
put Nicolas Cage and John Travolta in a film and it's like a Great
American Film. Nobody calls it a white movie! That's unfortunate
because it speaks to some of the color-consciousness that still
exists.''
	   And for all of his dizzying range of roles, he's troubled by
something else.
	   ``I look at magazines sometimes and they'll have the 25 Hottest
Actors, the 30 Top Up-and-Comers, Who's Hot This Year, who's
legitimate _ and they never really put my name in it. Never! It's
amazing. I mean, categorically, I've done more versatile stuff than
anybody _ maybe short of Mel Gibson and Johnny Depp,'' he says,
shaking his head.
	   ``But that's OK. What it does is just fuel the fire. It just
keeps me going. No problem _ I still work and I still get paid.
Pretty soon, ya'll will catch on.''

Country with a kick _ Shania breaking barriers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY332 &QL; 
 &UR; By LARRY McSHANE &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ She looks about as country as the Manhattan
skyline.
	   Skin-tight black leather pants, cut low to expose her belly
button. A red ribbon of fabric, strategically placed above her bare
midriff. Thick chestnut hair, cascading down her back.
	   But Shania Twain, who wore the above ensemble for her recent
Rolling Stone cover shoot, is adamant that she's more Nashville
than New York.
	   ``I consider myself a country artist,'' she says. ``That music
was always such a big part of me growing up. I loved Stevie Wonder
and the Carpenters, but Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton were just as
big an influence.
	   ``You've to got to fit somewhere, and for the sake of fitting,
I'm country,'' the 32-year-old Canadian continues. ``I have no
complaints about that. The challenge is to go beyond that.''
	   The Rolling Stone cover, released in August, is just part of her
success in handling that challenge. Twain became the first female
country artist on the cover since Dolly Parton in 1980, a
distinction she's quite proud to claim.
	   ``It's hard to break free of the mold, to try and transcend
labels,'' she says. ``It's just difficult to do. When I can, I
consider it a triumph somehow for me.''
	   Her first world tour, which started in North America in May, is
another triumph. When tickets went on sale for her Detroit show,
they were gone in 29 minutes _ a rate matched previously by The Who
and Metallica.
	   The critics were wowed, too. One reviewer said the current queen
of country put on a show ``that was more Patti Smith than Patty
Loveless'' _ a first-of-its-kind comparison.
	   By midsummer, Twain's single ``You're Still The One'' had
crossed over everywhere: No. 2 on the Billboard Top 40, No. 1 on
adult contemporary, No. 1 on country, in heavy rotation at mellow
VH1 and its hipper sibling, MTV.
	   Her across the board success, her flesh-baring videos, and her
collaboration with husband (and ex-Def Leppard producer) Robert
``Mutt'' Lange have ruffled some feathers in Nashville _ which is
just the way Twain likes it.
	   ``I was, at one time, trying to convince people that it's valid
to be original and unique,'' she says, laughing. ``That means not
being traditional, but it also means not being run of the mill.
	   ``I just go about things my own way.''
	   It has worked.
	   Twain was Billboard's No. 1 country artist in 1996, and captured
a best country album Grammy that same year for ``The Woman in Me.''
Her latest album, ``Come On Over,'' was another chart-topper. And
the tour is selling out.
	   But Twain's success has created some problems _ like becoming a
topic for the supermarket tabloids.
	   ``I take most of it with a grain of salt: `Shania and Mutt
divorcing, or unhappy, or whatever,''' she says. ``We laugh about
it, because it's so far from the truth.''
	   But one recent story did get under her skin, a piece detailing
how ``Snooty Shania'' can't stand her fans.
	   ``I love my fans,'' she said.
	   The exposure has also convinced Twain to abandon her upstate New
York home for a new place in Switzerland. Her New York neighbors
are ``wonderful, sweet and normal,'' she said. ``But it's tough
being recognized at the grocery store.''
	   Only five years ago, Twain could do all her shopping unimpeded.
Her 1993 debut album disappeared quickly, but it was still the year
that changed her life: She met Lange in June, and they married six
months later.
	   Working with her husband, she struck platinum _ 12 times over _
with her follow-up, ``The Woman in Me.'' It sold 10 million copies
in the United States, a sales figure hit by only five other women:
Carole King, Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Celine Dion and Alanis
Morissette.
	   ``Come On Over'' has sold more than 4 million copies in nine
months. Twain says the numbers, while impressive, don't mean all
that much to her.
	   ``I don't pay much attention to the charts,'' she says. ``It's
like the stock market. I can't sit there and watch the stock
market. If you put too much emphasis on it, you set yourself up for
disappointment.''

Keeping the faith's an uphill battle for Russian democrats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It was a gloomy day when they buried Igor
Schmarov.
	   Black rain clouds glowered over the cemetery as Schmarov, a law
professor, lay in his open coffin, flowers tumbling over his legs,
a knot of friends and family gathered around.
	   Some chatted; some stared dolefully at the waxen figure before
them. A breeze blew through the trees, scattering the stored-up
remnants of the morning's rain over mourners and the corpse.
	   He was 69 when he died of throat cancer, an eminent man,
co-author of Russia's new criminal code among many other texts and
documents. He saw many changes during his life. And he died, said
his friend and co-author, Alexander Mikhlin, believing that his
country was on the right course.
	   ``He was a democrat,'' Mikhlin said. ``His entire family has
found their place in the new system.''
	   But Russia has done little to reward the faith of democrats like
Schmarov. Years of economic change have succeeded largely in
transferring assets from the state to a new class of superrich
known in Russia as the oligarchs. While the nation now holds free
elections, it still vests extraordinary power in a few leaders and
has not fully adopted the Western idea of the rule of law.
	   Now, with financial markets in retreat, the value of the ruble
in free fall and the country's leadership in flux, some are
questioning whether the experiment was worth it.
	   This is the Russia that President Clinton will visit when he
arrives Tuesday for a two-day summit with President Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``If we use the terminology of the Communist Party, we would say
that this period has shown the bankruptcy of the ruling regime of
the country,'' said Alexei Chaplygin, a political analyst at the
Center for Studies of Civil Society Institutions. ``Seven years of
so-called reforms showed that there were no reforms at all.''
	   Chaplygin is no communist, but he is among those who have seen
their hopes for creation of a prosperous, democratic society
dashed. He has become pessimistic and believes the likelihood
exists that Russia's government will turn more dictatorial.
	   Still, like most Russians, he knows this society can go back
only so far. ``There's no way to go back to the control of people's
minds and thoughts, which was the case in the Soviet system,'' he
said.
	   The present period in Russia ``will be seen as the end of an
era,'' said Alan Rousso, director of the Moscow office of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He expects Yeltsin to
resign ``or at least fade into the background'' soon.
	   ``Did Yeltsin succeed in introducing democracy in Russia? I
would say he succeeded only very modestly,'' Rousso said.
	   Yeltsin helped establish a system of democratic elections in
Russia but did little to create democratic institutions. He rammed
through a constitution that gives the president vast powers and
reduced parliament to a role akin to that of a Greek chorus,
bemoaning the tragic course of events without being able to change
them.
	   Among Yeltsin's greatest mistakes, Rousso believes, was his
failure to lead a political party and encourage development of a
true multiparty system. As things stand now, the government is not
strongly associated with any party.
	   The only party with real political power is the Communists, but
they are widely viewed as a waning force whose support is mostly
elderly. So any talk of future presidents revolves around
personalities, not policies, and encourages continuation of
Russia's historic form of government: autocracy.
	   On the same day that Igor Schmarov died, Alexander Kutuzov was
born at Maternity Hospital No. 6 in central Moscow.
	   A round-headed little boy with thick, reddish-brown hair, Sasha
_ the diminutive for Alexander _ was born into a Russia in the
throes of crisis and change. But for now, all around him is placid.
	   Maternity Hospital No. 6 was founded in 1906, and has changed
physically very little since then. It is a sparkling clean place of
dull green walls and white tile floors, steel-frame beds and
old-fashioned radiators.
	   Aside from the clear plastic bassinet in which Sasha is tightly
swaddled, little in the room hints that he was born at the end, not
the beginning, of the 20th century.
	   ``This time is, of course, very difficult,'' his mother,
Yevgenia Kutuzov, said. ``But each epoch has its difficulties. I
think I also was born in difficult times. I was born in 1974. Our
parents tell us that life was not sugar at that time.''
	   That was the Brezhnev era, the Era of Stagnation, when the
Soviet Union was fully absorbed with the Cold War. People had
stability, but few choices. Consumer goods were cheap, but limited
and shabby.
	   Mrs. Kutuzov is an accountant for a military band academy. Her
husband, Sergei, works in construction for the military. They live
with Sergei's parents but hope one day to have an apartment of
their own.
	   They want the best for their son and don't care what he does
when he grows up so long as he's happy.
	   ``He's a nice guy,'' Mrs. Kutuzov said as she gazed lovingly at
little Sasha. ``And we'll use all our knowledge and ability to
bring him up in the right way. I want to give him as much
tenderness as possible.''
	   Things are hard right now, and the future looks bleak. Mrs.
Kutozov voted for Yeltsin two years ago and regrets it, but she
doesn't know who would have been better.
	   She sees only one solution to the country's ills: to raise a new
generation that is better than the old. In this, at least, she
believes her generation will succeed.
	   ``Of course,'' she says. ``Every mother must be an optimist.''

War and death add to plight of Kinshasa's street kids

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ On mean streets, where tempers flare and
garbage rots, barefoot Domain Luminda picks his way past the
smoldering bodies of three executed rebels in downtown Kinshasa.
	   With a hand covering his nose and mouth to ward off the stench
of burnt hair and flesh, the young boy gazes at one victim, its
face frozen in a twisted, lifeless grimace.
	   A homeless street kid, Domain's life in this impoverished city
has never been better than a struggle for survival. Now, war
batters Kinshasa's suburbs, lynch mobs roam downtown neighborhoods
and death is a brutal reality for a 9-year-old boy.
	   From the other side of Kinshasa's June 30th Boulevard, Domain
and two of his buddies watched on Saturday morning when a truck
filled with troops pulled up and unloaded three captives.
	   ``They had tires pushed over their bodies and the soldiers began
to kick them and hit them with their rifles,'' Domain said in slow,
apprehensive words. ``They shot one of them, and he fell. The other
man's head split open, and they set him on fire.''
	   By mid-afternoon, the bodies of the rebels, suspected members of
a coalition force trying to oust President Laurent Kabila, were
still on a sidewalk of one of Kinshasa's busiest streets. Smoke
curled up from one body.
	   Motorists slowed to gawk, pedestrians scurried past. And, as if
standing guard, Domain and his friends circled pensively from a
safe distance.
	   ``I'm scared,'' he said. ``I've never seen a dead man before,
but I want to see it.''
	   The government appears to be gaining against rebel fighters who
days ago slipped past the capital's defenses and launched attacks
in the eastern and western suburbs.
	   In the Kingasani and Masina districts near the airport, decaying
corpses littered the streets, Health Minister Jean-Baptist Sondgi
said.
	   ``It's a terrible scene of bodies here and there,'' he said.
	   In the heart of Kinshasa, government troops hunted for
insurgents.
	   Most people have sought shelter at home, avoiding the worst of
the conflict.
	   But for the homeless children who dodge in and out of stopped
traffic and work pedestrian crowds for a handout, back alleys and
side street cubby holes are their only refuge.
	   Thirteen-year-old Herithier Kafoti and his gang of 13 other boys
are only slightly more fortunate. A Belgian expatriate lets the
boys sleep on the ground outside his home, in a tiny courtyard by
the trash heap.
	   Each morning, the boys fold up their beds of broken cardboard
boxes and climb over the fence to the street. The clean, white
walls of the U.S. Embassy are across the street.
	   Faced with food and water shortages and few people venturing
out, handouts in these days of war are hard to come by, said
Herithier.
	   Now, on top of the daily challenge of begging in an impoverished
city, the boys face hostile streets.
	   Unable to read and without access to a radio, the boys don't
understand what's happening.
	   ``I know something's going on,'' says a shirtless Herithier,
scratching at a sore on his thigh below grubby, cut off jeans.
``But nobody tells us what it is.''
	   A coalition force of ethnic Tutsi fighters and disenchanted
members of Kabila's military is trying to take Kinshasa. Kabila
maintains neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are behind the month-old
rebellion, a charge both countries deny.
	   When Kabila took power last year after toppling longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, he launched an ambitious campaign to get
the kids off the streets and into schools or military training
camps.
	   Over time, most of the younger boys fled back to the streets,
complaining of harsh conditions.
	   Some are now afraid they have to hide from government gangs in
search of new recruits for the army.
	   ``I don't want to fight, I'm afraid,'' said Tshimanga Mutinga,
16, whose main ambition in life is to drive a taxi. ``I think
they're going to come and get me.''

Police allege Kosovo Albanians burned Serbs in crematory

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian police say they have
discovered a crematory in southern Kosovo where ethnic Albanians
allegedly had burned the bodies of at least 22 Serb civilians.
	   Police said Saturday that the furnace, allegedly used to destroy
the bodies of civilians killed by the rebels, was found in the
village of Klecka, recently retaken by government forces.
	   The statement, carried by the official Tanjug news agency, was
the latest in a series of claims of brutality and atrocities by
both sides. It could not be independently confirmed.
	   Meanwhile, the Red Cross evacuated 13 women and children, who
were wounded Thursday by fierce shelling, from a crowded refugee
village to the Kosovo capital of Pristina Saturday.
	   The victims were among an estimated 50,000 ethnic Albanians near
Senik village in southwestern Kosovo, where they fled after their
own communities were shelled by Yugoslav army tanks.
	   Fighting was reported Saturday in several locations. The
Serb-run Media Center in Pristina said seven ``terrorists'' were
killed in a shootout with police in Klina, western Kosovo.
	   Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have waged a months-long
offensive to crush the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is
spearheading the independence fight of Kosovo's Albanian majority.
Kosovo is a province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic.
	   On Friday, Serb forensic workers retrieved from the crematory
the bones of 10 Serb civilians, two of them children, who officials
said were executed by the KLA.
	   The alleged crematory was found based on testimony from two
captured rebel fighters, Ljup and Bekim Mazreku, who told police
that in July alone, 22 Serbs as well as some Albanians loyal to
Serbian authorities were killed. It was not clear if the Albanians
also were cremated.
	   A statement issued swiftly Saturday by the Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry urged foreign countries ``to cut all sources of financing,
recruitment, training, arming'' to the rebels in light of the
allegations.
	   In Pristina, some of the evacuees from around Senik said the
attack Thursday targeted only civilians.
	   ``The shelling began at seven in the morning,'' said one of the
victims, Xhemile Zulfaj, as she lay shivering on the floor of the
Red Cross truck, her 2-year-old boy beside her. ``Thirteen of us
were in our house. A shell exploded, and we ran outside, screaming.
One of us died.''
	   The woman said the region remained extremely dangerous.
	   ``Snipers shoot at women and children all the time, and shelling
continues,'' she said. She, her son and the others on the truck all
were hit by shrapnel.
	   Maggie Bryson of the International Red Cross, who helped
evacuate the 13, said conditions around Senik were deplorable.
	   With the onset of cold weather, the estimated 50,000 refugees
camped out in the open in isolated areas were facing an
``absolutely dreadful'' situation, she said.
	   ``Without shelter, people cannot survive,'' she said.
	   In Belgrade, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Julia Taft on
Friday warned that with winter on the way, there is a strong risk
of a refugee disaster. She said she would ask President Bill
Clinton for emergency aid to stem such a crisis.
	   Serbian police and Yugoslav army troops have purged KLA fighters
from much of the at least 30 percent of Kosovo territory the rebels
once controlled.
	   After a string of defeats, the KLA is appealing to ethnic
Albanians to unite and join rebel ranks. ``Like never before, it is
high time that we all become KLA soldiers,'' said a statement
published Saturday in an Albanian-language paper in Pristina.
	   U.S. diplomats have been trying to set up face-to-face talks
between the Albanians and the Serbian government to discuss the
future of the province. The Americans and Europeans want Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to restore the autonomy he withdrew in
1989.

Cuban airliner crashes in Ecuador, killing at least 76
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) - A Cuban plane carrying 90 people burst
into flames Saturday during takeoff and slammed into a soccer
field, killing at least 76 people, civil aviation authorities said.
	   The jetliner barely missed a busy street in a middle-income
residential area at the end of the runway, which lies at 9,300 feet
(2,834 meters) in the Andes mountains.
	   Witnesses said the Russian-made Tupolev-154 aircraft owned by
Cubana de Aviacion clipped the top of a car mechanic's shop beyond
the end of the runway and plowed into a soccer field. The nose and
front part of the plane disintegrated in the crash.
	   Red Cross workers in red uniforms dug through the wreckage for
survivors while fire fighters sprayed jets of water on the smoking
ruins to prevent further explosions.
	   Ecuadorean television stations reported that at least five
survivors were pulled from the wreckage, but that could not be
confirmed.
	   Officials gave no cause for the crash. nor did they specify if
the toll included people killed on the ground. One woman said three
of her children, who were playing near the crash site, were
missing.
	   Four people died when the plane struck the auto mechanic's shop,
a local radio station reported.
	   The flight was headed to Guayaquil, on the Ecuadorean coast, and
then on to Havana.
	   At least 19 foreigners, including Cubans, Chileans, Italians,
Spaniards, one Argentine and one Jamaican, were killed, said Gen.
Osvaldo Dominguez, director of the Civil Aviation Office, as he
left the morgue.
	   Red Cross official Galo Leoro said the plane had just started
taking off when apparently at least one motor failed and the
airliner crashed several hundred yards (meters) beyond the end of
the runway at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International Airport.
	   Dominguez said there were 76 passengers and 14 crew members on
board.
	   ``There must be many dead, but there are also survivors. I
pulled one person out alive,'' said civil defense volunteer Hugo
Albuja.
	   Channel 10 television interviewed Cuban survivor Hernan Boada,
27, who had burnt hair and a fractured ankle.
	   ``Before we heard the roar of the crash, we felt the plane rise
a bit and burst in flames. There were three explosions,'' Boada
said. ``I saw other people wrapped in flames jump from the plane.''
	   ``I was in seat number 21, a window seat at wing level. The
doors would not open, so I jumped through a hole in the plane amid
the flames from a height of about two yards (meters),'' he said.
	   Boada said that ``people nearby, in a soccer field, helped me
get away from the plane fearing explosions.''
	   President Jamil Mahuad went to the crash site and told reporters
he was asking investigators to complete studies as soon as possible
for building an airport outside the capital.
	   People have often complained about the danger posed by a large
airport in a heavily populated residential area.
	   In 1984, an Ecuadorean cargo plane slammed into a neighborhood
beyond the end of the runway after failing to gain altitude,
killing 65 people.
	   And in 1996, a Brazilian FLY airlines plane carrying a Brazilian
soccer team crashed into airport walls after one of the jet
turbines flamed out and the crew aborted the takeoff. One player
was slightly injured.

Hart persists despite woeful season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ All Blacks coach John Hart, facing a
harsh reaction at home following a record losing streak, is set to
stay in charge through to next year's rugby World Cup.
	   The All Blacks' seven-test season ended on the ultimate low
Saturday when Australia sentenced them to a fifth-straight loss for
the first time in New Zealand rugby history.
	   ``I'm sure there'll be plenty of speculation, New Zealanders
will always speculate on rugby, but I'm looking forward to the
World Cup,'' Hart said.
	   The lack of any outstanding challengers will likely help Hart
achieve his goal of taking the All Blacks to the World Cup, hosted
by Wales, next November and his team gets a chance to reflect
before the losing streak gets tested by France early next year.
	   The international retirements of Sean Fitzpatrick, Zinzan Brooke
and Frank Bunce hit the All Blacks hard this season and the team
lacked its usual fiber Saturday, squandering an 11-0 halftime lead
as Australia scored a dramatic 19-14 victory.
	   Hart said before the match that he might go live in outback
Australia if his team lost again. Afterwards he said, ``I'm trying
to decide whether Moscow might be a better place at the moment,
maybe I can go and visit Boris Yeltsin.''
	   Australian fullback Matthew Burke overcame a horror kicking game
to score the winning try seven minutes from time, but he suffered
an expected broken shoulder in landing over the try line.
	   The Wallabies had looked in control against a strangely
undisciplined All Blacks, who were caned in the penalty count but
contributed to their own downfall with some loose play.
	   ``Some of the times we had clean breaks and threw the ball away,
made little knock ons, had kicks that were pretty aimless and gave
the ball to the opposition when we should have put the pressure
on,'' Hart said.
	   He refused to criticize fly-half Andrew Mehrtens for kicking
away most of the All Blacks possession, keeping winger Jonah Lomu
out of action.
	   Hart was forced to try 10 new All Blacks during a season which
never got moving despite two early wins over a weak England outfit.
	   ``It's been a hard year and certainly a hard few weeks,'' Hart
said. ``I don't think they've forgotten how to win they're just
finding it hard to win at the moment which is part of the
experience that we've lost, that ruthlessness.''
	   Australian coach Rod Macqueen said he felt sorry for Hart, who
was never one to share that sort of emotion for a rival when the
All Blacks were on top.
	   New Zealand's five losses include the 3-0 sweep by Australia in
the Bledisloe Cup and two to South Africa in the tri-series.
	   Australia's clean sweep was its first against the All Blacks
since 1929 and came despite the team being battered in a loss to
South Africa a week earlier and a long trip home from Johannesburg.
	   ``That clean sweep means a lot to us, especially coming from
behind,'' said Wallaby captain John Eales who kicked four penalties
and a conversion after replacing Burke as kicker. ``I'm just so
proud.''
	   Australia must play three World Cup qualifying games in
September against Fiji, Tonga and Western Samoa.

	   LONDON (AP) _ One year on the flowers are once again being laid
at the gates of Kensington Palace, the former home of Princess
Diana, ready for the anniversary of her death on Monday.
	   Despite a poll indicating that only 6 percent of Britons plan to
observe the anniversary, TV stations are planning a rash of
programs about her, while the weekend's newspapers from tabloid to
highbrow carried tributes to the princess, essays on why her death
was - or wasn't - important, and pullout supplements carrying her
most well-known images.
	   Britain's royal family hasn't been quite the same since Diana's
death in the Paris car crash on Aug. 31 that also killed her
companion Dodi Fayed and chauffeur Henri Paul.
	   The Sunday Times, on the front page of its review section,
questioned whether Queen Elizabeth II, who is still well regarded
by most Britons according to polls, has been able to adapt to a
more informal role that Britons now seem to expect from their
monarchy.
	   And for those who needed reminding that Diana's death remains
contentious for some, The Sunday Telegraph reported that Mohamed Al
Fayed - who has publicly said that he believes Diana and Dodi death
were no accident - is offering up to 14 million pounds (dlrs 20
million) to anyone who could provide evidence to prove his theory.
	   The conservative, broadsheet newspaper quoted unnamed sources
for the story. A spokesman for Al Fayed was not available for
comment.
	   Dozens of those who left flowers this weekend at Diana's west
London palace home said they'd come early to avoid the rush on
Monday, which is also a national holiday _ held on the last Monday
in August every year and unrelated to Diana's death.
	   But it was a trickle compared with the hundreds of thousands who
turned the area into a sea of flowers in the week after the
36-year-old princess was killed in a car crash in Paris.
	   ``Everyone can remember what they were doing a year ago when she
died,'' said 15-year-old Victoria Ivins, who came with a girlfriend
from Reigate, 20 miles (32 kms) south of central London. ``I simply
cried and watched the television for a week.''
	   Rita Young, 51, who brought flowers from her home in Reading, 30
miles (50 kms) west of London, said she still felt just as sad.
``The pain hasn't left my heart.''
	   For weeks, there has been a buildup of pictures of Diana and of
her sons, Prince William, 16, and Prince Harry, 13, in glossy
magazines and newspapers.
	   On Saturday, some newspapers also carried pictures of Camilla
Parker Bowles, 51, the longtime love of Prince Charles and the
woman Diana blamed for the breakdown of her marriage which ended in
divorce in 1996.
	   Forty-six percent of Britons still oppose the idea of Charles,
49, marrying the divorced Mrs. Parker Bowles, according to a poll
by National Opinion Poll for a London newspaper, The Express.
	   But that was down from 57 percent disapproval in a similar
survey before Diana's death, The Express reported under the
headline, ``Why Camilla has reasons to be cheerful.''
	   The Express did not report the number of people questioned or
give the margin of error _ usually 3 percent _ for this poll.
	   A resounding near 80 percent agreed when asked whether they felt
Diana's memory ``should be left alone'' after this week.
	   Mrs. Parker-Bowles now regularly spends nights at St. James's
Palace, Charles' London residence, and Highgrove, his country
house, according to newspaper reports.
	   The Daily Telegraph on Friday published the results of a
telephone survey by Gallup which found that 94 percent of the 1,009
people questioned said they had no plans to mark the anniversary.

Cutrufello a bright new star for rock 'n' roll
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ To everyone else at your local bar, you're just
a bore who's told the same stories a few times too many. But for
Mary Cutrufello, you're research.
	   The rock 'n' roll singer and guitarist loves to climb into her
car and drive into a strange town. She'll search for a bar that
looks comfortable, preferably one with a decent jukebox, sit down
and order a drink. And she'll listen.
	   ``I've gotten some strange looks, but actually, people are
really friendly,'' she said. ``If you're honest and sincere and not
coming in from the big city to be ironic, people are happy to talk
to you.
	   ``Since I write songs, it's part of my job to listen to
stories,'' she said.
	   Cutrofello's songs are filled with characters she's likely to
have encountered along the way _ a woman who can't accept the end
of a love affair, an ambitious youth yearning to escape a dead-end
town, a struggling single mother.
	   Those populist themes and her searing guitar make the
27-year-old Cutrufello a worthy heir to her musical hero, Bruce
Springsteen. Even the raspy voice that seems to originate from a
deep well sounds familiar.
	   While Cutrufello's songwriting occasionally suffers from the
overreaching ambition of youth, so, too, did Springsteen's at an
early age. Her music has an undeniable spark and has attracted an
unusual amount of attention for a newcomer. She may not be rock's
savior, but few doubt she is a potential leader.
	   ``I feel like I'm prepared as it's possible to be,'' Cutrufello
said with a smile in the weeks before her album, ``When The Night
Is Through,'' was released.
	   Part of the reason Cutrufello attracts double-takes is the
easygoing way she shatters stereotypes. A black woman raised in
Connecticut and educated at prestigious Yale University, she loves
rock 'n' roll and moved to Texas to immerse herself in country
music.
	   The heritage of both forms is rich with black contributors but
in the more musically segregated 1990s, Cutrufello realizes she's
unusual. But she wants to be defined professionally by what she
does, not who she is.
	   ``This is the way I came out,'' she said. ``I can't change
anything. I don't write from the point of view of any of those
things, I write from the point of view of a human being. I
understand that it's a good hook and everything, but I realize that
it's such a hook that you can talk about that and not the music,
which is what I really want to do.''
	   Cutrufello grew up with a single mom who was a devoted fan of
Broadway musicals. Only recently has she recognized that it was her
Broadway exposure that influenced her determination to make records
that hang together thematically.
	   As a teen-ager, she and her friends were loyal fans of rock 'n'
roll radio stations from nearby New York. And if you're a rock fan
who grew up in the New York suburbs, you worship New Jersey boy
Springsteen.
	   Cutrufello went to Yale with vague ambitions of becoming a
teacher. Her career path became clearer when she spent more nights
playing music than doing homework.
	   She moved to Texas after graduation, both because it seemed she
could make a living as a musician there and because it allowed her
to study country music. A big fan of country-rockers Steve Earle
and Dwight Yoakam, she wanted to delve into the music's roots.
	   ``One of the reasons I find it so compelling is the same reason
I find rock 'n' roll compelling,'' she said. ``When it's done
right, it's a real outgrowth of the heart and soul of the people
who make it.''
	   She toured in 1996 as the hired guitarist of Jimmie Dale
Gilmore. But when the time came to make her own record, Cutrufello
left the country world behind.
	   ``I got to where I could do it pretty well, but it's not my
home,'' she said. ``You can learn a lot about it and do a good
version of it, but the people who do it best are the ones for which
it is home. And that's the way I feel about rock 'n' roll.''
	   Besides Springsteen, another obvious reference point is Melissa
Etheridge. Like Etheridge, Cutrufello can rely too much on stock
images in her songs _ ``the fire in my heart and the fever in my
soul'' _ but she's also unafraid to search for universal truths and
common ground.
	   You get the feeling that more adept writing will come with time.
	   During her travels to bars across the country, Cutrufello would
see the same albums in jukeboxes _ some vintage Bob Seger or Lynyrd
Skynyrd, John Mellencamp's ``Scarecrow'' or Tom Petty's ``Full Moon
Fever.'' Quintessentially American rock 'n' roll.
	   Get into the 1990s, though, and there aren't quite as many of
those albums. Cutrufello is convinced the taste for such music
hasn't disappeared. Someday, she'd like to see her own records
beside those others.
	   She's trying to write songs that will appeal to as many people
as possible who slip dollars into those jukeboxes.
	   ``My whole scene is about the connections that bring people
together,'' she said. ``There's like a covenant between me and the
people I perform and write for. If I'm writing songs that other
people can't relate to, then I'm breaking that covenant.''

Cherry Poppin' Daddies rule the swing circuit with punk attitude
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PACENTI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   POMPANO BEACH, Florida (AP) _ In the grunge rock bastion of the
Pacific Northwest, Steve Perry decided to do something contrary to
the guitar-crunching climate.
	   He formed the Cherry Poppin' Daddies, an eight-piece ska and
swing band, in Eugene, Ore. Leave Seattle to Nirvana and
Soundgarden _ Perry's band would be the alternative to alternative.
	   ``We just stayed in the uncool place and did our own thing,''
the singer-guitarist says. ``With a lot of hard rock, it's a bunch
of meatheads throwing elbows around and showing how macho they can
be.
	   ``Swing is so the antithesis of that. It's about actually
getting out and meeting people.''
	   Swing, the popular dance music style dating back more than 60
years, is back as the pop music du jour. It's in movies,
commercials and increasingly on the radio. Perry's group is one of
the first breakout neo-swing bands, along with the Squirrel Nut
Zippers and Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
	   The Cherry Poppin' Daddies helped propel the movement when their
video for ``Zoot Suit Riot'' went into heavy rotation on MTV. But
now that Perry's hunch about resurrecting old-time music has paid
off big, the swing stylist has become a worrywart, fearing swing is
in danger of becoming a nostalgic fad.
	   ``I was sort of against putting us in a major mainstream radio
format. I didn't think it was a good idea,'' Perry says.
	   ``What is bad is the cynical attempts to exploit swing. I'm not
a fan of cover bands, or covers of any sort. I don't think it's
adding anything. ...The scene destroys itself from the inside out
by not trying to grow. People get afraid to try new things and try
new dance steps.''
	   The Cherry Poppin' Daddies lean heavily on ska _ dance music,
popular in Jamaica in the 1960s, characterized by the use of
saxophones and brass, an accented offbeat and the influence of New
Orleans rhythm and blues, jazz and calypso.
	   And its brassy influence on the new swing can't be overstated,
Perry says.
	   Ska bands _ like the Mighty Mighty Bosstones _ reopened the door
for horns in popular music and made room for the swing bands on the
bill. ``Swing was a natural progression to move into,'' Perry says.
	   Natural, but not easy.
	   After forming in 1989, the band came under immediate assault in
Eugene for taking the name Cherry Poppin' Daddies _ a moniker
inspired by a 1950s newspaper article about a polygamous train
conductor.
	   They didn't realize some would think it a reference to incest.
One day Perry was walking down the street in Eugene and a woman
passing by burned him with her cigarette.
	   ``We couldn't get gigs as the Cherry Poppin' Daddies,'' Perry
said. ``We had a big audience, but we kept getting bomb threats and
we'd have to clear out the entire bar.''
	   So the band would play under various names, advertising as the
Merry Poppin' Daddies at one Christmas gig. Eventually they moved
down the coast to Southern California and started opening for the
jump blues of Royal Crown Revue.
	   For years, the Cherry Poppin' Daddies were known as much for ska
as swing. They even looked more like a grunge band. The Mighty
Mighty Bosstones told the band members they needed to look the
part. Off came the jeans and on went the pinstripes.
	   Then came ``Zoot Suit Riot,'' a compilation of the band's swing
numbers with a few new tunes sprinkled in. MTV latched on to the
tom-tom fueled title song and kicked the swing movement into high
gear.
	   The 1997 CD was a sleeper but recently went platinum. The songs
may have a Tin Pan Alley beat, but each tries to pave new ground.
``Drunk Daddy'' and ``Here Comes The Snake'' are about as far from
Glenn Miller's ``Chattanooga Choo-choo'' as you can get, taking on
alcoholism and raw lust.
	   However, the music is very much rooted in the Miller-era swing
of the 1930s and early '40s.
	   A big part of the swing movement is the fashion and the dance.
Perry says he doesn't know many steps _ and he absolutely abhors
talking about the clothing.
	   ``We didn't dress up until recently,'' Perry says. ``Guys who
are writing books on this, they continually go back to the clothes.
I say, 'Look, dude, I can play this stuff naked.'''
	   The dancing, though, is something Perry truly loves to watch
from the stage. Swing has created a new singles scene, he says,
that has been missing for a long time.
	   ``People are actually talking,'' he says. ``When they're on the
dance floor for the first time, they are both making mistakes. It's
real cute and it's real human. After all that, the walls are down
and they have a great time.''

<TEXT>
	   HELENDALE, California (AP) _ It's 110 F (43 C) in the shade _ a
big outdoor thermometer says so _ and Dixie Evans, in full pancake
makeup in the middle of the Mojave Desert, is doing a dead-on
imitation of a legendary blond bombshell.
	   Evans is 72. And her face appears to be melting.
	   But, as surreal as it seems, the Marilyn Monroe of Burlesque is
a professional. She would never acknowledge the heat, much less its
withering effects.
	   So she coos, bats false eyelashes and hikes a yellow muumuu
above wrinkled knees.
	   Eccentric, yes. Loony, no.
	   She could have given up long ago and followed other aging
strippers into reclusion, surrounded by molting feather boas and
yellowing photographs. But Evans chooses to put these objects on
public display at the Exotic World Burlesque Hall of Fame, halfway
between Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
	   Her paean to pasties opened in 1991. Ever since, Evans and her
collection of breakaway gowns, rhinestone G-strings and sequined
bras have gotten lots of attention. Network television crews,
National Public Radio, Smithsonian magazine and MTV have trekked to
Helendale to relive something that's gone the way of vaudeville and
silent movies.
	   For three decades, she disrobed with the best _ Blaze Starr,
Lili St. Cyr, Tempest Storm _ before television killed burlesque,
and topless joints replaced elaborate revues featuring women who
didn't really take it all off.
	   Burlesque's biggest days came during the Depression. For 25
cents, Americans could escape lives stuck in despair. Stripping was
only part of the show. Jugglers, acrobats and young comedians named
Red Skelton, Phil Silvers and Jackie Gleason also performed.
	   Burlesque was working-class glamour _ a B-world of wealth, furs
and high living for girls who dreamed of Hollywood but didn't make
the cut.
	   ``It was the time of our lives,'' says Evans, standing in the
airless museum that draws about 40 visitors a week. She is
surrounded by glass cases full of pasties, a steamer trunk that
belonged to Gypsy Rose Lee and scores of framed, signed
photographs.
	   ``We had money. We went to places like the 21 Club. We brought
glamour to the place. They were always glad to have us.''
	   Born in Long Beach, California, Evans made the 30-mile
(48-kilometer) trip to Hollywood at age 19. The closest she got to
celebrity was hoofing in small-time road shows with her roommates.
	   ``You know,'' she says, twirling long hair she still dyes
yellow, ``anybody then was happy to have four dumb blondes to
careen around on stage.''
	   New York was her next stop. Pushed by a friend, she filled a
last-minute opening in a burlesque chorus line. ``I was scared to
death,'' she says. ``But I did it. The room was filled with sailors
... I moved all over that room. The band played 'Body and Soul.' I
got hired on the spot.''
	   Traveling the Eastern half of the country, she made dlrs 250 a
week in the late 1940s. Her father died when she was 11, and she
supported her mother and a sister.
	   Evans sees no shame in her profession. ``We didn't even think
about that,'' Evans said. ``We were insulated. We were all like
family.''
	   Along the way, there was a 15-year marriage to a prizefighter,
about whom she says: ``He was very handsome. But he was a gambler
and he played around.''
	   She divorced him and kept on working. She has no children and no
regrets.
	   Her skin, more visible as the mercury rises, is nearly
translucent. Her former colleagues, displayed in recent
photographs, don't look their ages either.
	   ``Honey, we never saw daylight,'' Evans says. ``Our skin never
got exposed to the sun.''
	   Her contemporaries included fan dancer Sally Rand, whose lisp
ended her film career when talkies came in. St. Cyr, whose act
featured a glass bathtub and a lot of bubbles, hauled her
monstrously heavy tubs from theater to theater.
	   Then there was Evans, whose Marilyn Monroe visage and voice were
so definitive, the screen siren's attorney wrote a threatening
letter. Evans' show went on, though, featuring revamped scenes from
Monroe films such as ``The Prince and the Pauper.''
	   In those days, no nudity was allowed onstage. ``You had to leave
your pasties on and your net bra and your net panties,'' Evans
said. The acts lasted as long as 30 minutes, nearly all of it tease
and illusion, just like the dancer's flesh-colored underwear.
	   The pasties were another matter.
	   Pasties could hold tassels, sparklers, blinking lights, you name
it. Gifted performers could move them in mind-boggling ways.
	   With huge casts and constant traveling, burlesque shows were
expensive to produce. When television arrived, ``nobody went out
anymore,'' Evans laments. ``Everyone sat glued to this box.''
	   After Monroe committed suicide in 1962, Evans couldn't go on
with the act. ``Everyone was just too depressed,'' she says. By
then, burlesque was dead as well.
	   Evans returned to Southern California and lived with her sister.
She worked as a nurse's aide and soon ran into an old friend and
fellow performer, Jennie Lee.
	   Mrs. Lee had been diagnosed with breast cancer and her husband
moved her to the desert, some 120 miles (190 kilometers) east of
Los Angeles, onto a piece of condemned property he bought cheap.
	   Evans followed. ``I helped take care of Jennie until she died,''
Evans says.
	   A year later, Evans dusted off the old costumes she and her
friend used to wear. She had a catwalk built near the pool. She
opened the museum at the Lees' home, where a tour costs dlrs 10,
and started the annual Miss Exotic World pageant for contestants
from 19 to 90.
	   She still shimmies. Every day. And she laughs a lot.
	   ``All my old girlfriends say, 'God, you live in the past.'
	   ``And I say, 'Yeah, I do. '''

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The wife of a Croatian who led a
Nazi-era concentration camp was to be extradited to Croatia in the
next 30 days, according to local press reports.
	   Nada Sakic, 76, wife of former Jasenovac concentration camp
commandant Dinko Sakic, told Federal Judge Hernan Bernasconi late
Friday she accepted her extradition.
	   Nada Sakic is believed to have run a female block at Jasenovac
when she was 16. She and Dinko Sakic have denied any wrongdoing at
the camp where thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies died, saying
``Serbs'' are behind their persecution.
	   Dinko Sakic, now in Zagreb's main prison, fled Croatia in 1945,
when its wartime Nazi puppet state was defeated.
	   He and Nada lived quietly in Santa Teresita, 185 miles southeast
of Buenos Aires, until he acknowledged in an April interview that
he ran Jasenovac.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gunmen ambushed a police patrol, killing two
officers and wounding seven, a state spokeswoman said Saturday.
	   The ambush Friday evening in the state of Guerrero is believed
to have been carried out by the Revolutionary People's Army, a
leftist guerrilla group, Alejandra Ortiz Ochoa of the State
Judicial Police said at a news conference.
	   Ortiz said the ambush occurred on a road between Las Cruces and
Las Mesas, 75 miles south of the beach resort of Acapulco.
	   The gunmen fled, and police have started a search for them,
Ortiz said.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A Brazilian state official said
police officers should aim to kill criminals during shootouts, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Criminals who fire at police officers do not deserve to survive,
Noaldo Alves da Silva, secretary for public security in Rio De
Janeiro, told the daily Folha De Sao Paulo.
	   His comments confirm what has been de facto policy, said James
Cavallaro, director of Human Rights Watch/Americas for Brazil.
	   Killings by police in Rio have risen from an average of 16 to 32
a month since police officers began receiving bonuses for bravery
three years ago. The program was discontinued two months ago.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A passenger jet lost a front landing carriage
tire Saturday and had to make an emergency landing in the western
city of Guadalajara, but the aircraft was no damage and no one was
hurt.
	   A news release from the Airports and Auxiliary Services said the
DC-9 plane belonging to the Mexican airline TAESA, with 72
passengers on board, was on its way from Mexico City to the U.S.
border city of Tijuana.
	   One of the front tires burst shortly after it took off from a
midway stop in Aguascalientes. The news release said after the
emergency landing the tire was changed and the plane flew on to
Tijuana with about an hour's delay.
	   ___
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombian anti-narcotics police hampered
by Vietnam-era equipment received two new U.S. helicopters Saturday
intended to improve their ability to destroy the crops used to make
cocaine and heroin.
	   The two Bell 212 helicopters_ the first of a half-dozen promised
by the United States_ were delivered Saturday by Assistant
Secretary of State for International Narcotics Affairs Rand Beers,
who is on a three-day visit here.
	   Colombia produces 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United
States and a growing share of the heroin.
	   The Clinton Administration in June agreed to upgrade Colombia's
crash-plagued fleet of 1960s ``Huey'' helicopters and to provide
the more reliable and higher-flying Bell 212's.
	   The gunships provide the armed escort for crop dusting planes,
which spray the illegal plantations with deadly herbicides.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A team of firefighters are to fly
in to battle fires near a reservation inhabitated by 17 Indian
tribes, authorities said Saturday.
	   The out of control blazes sparked by three months of dry weather
have ravaged land across neighbouring states of Mato Grosso, Para
and Goias in central and northern Brazil in recent days.
	   On Saturday, the fires were 12 miles (20kms) from Xingu National
Park which is home to 3,000 Indians, said Elizabeth Fernandes,
spokesman for government environmental protection agency, IBAMA,
said.
	   She said 30 firefighters would be flown by the air force to the
region on Monday to combat the blazes, she said.
	   There were no immediate plans to move any of the 3,000 Indians,
who live in the 2.3 million hectare (5.6 million acre) Xingu
National Park, she added.
	   The reservation in Mato Grosso state, 870 miles (1,400 kms)
north west of Rio, was set up for Indian tribes to live in relative
isolation from western culture.
	   ___
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Police captured a man they said is a
key figure in smuggling Colombian drugs through Venezuela to the
United States.
	   Ernesto Melendez, 34, was arrested Friday in an outdoor square
in Maracaibo, Venezuela's second largest city about 120 kilometers
(75 miles) from the Colombian border.
	   Officials said Melendez was in charge of recruiting and paying
``mules,'' small-time smugglers who hide drugs in their suitcases,
shoe soles, or often their stomachs.
	   ``He is a key person for many investigations that will originate
from his arrest,'' said German Valero, government secretary of the
state of Zulia, where Maracaibo is located.
	   Anti-narcotics officials say Zulia has become a major
transshipment point for Colombian cocaine en route to the United
States. Venezuela and Colombia share a 2,200-kilomter (1,300-mile)
border.
	   Zulia's main trafficking organization, the Guajira cartel, takes
its name from a vast, largely unpatrolled jungle called the Guajira
Peninsula. Police said Melendez is a member of that gang.

Overwhelmingly large slate of movies for the fall season

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ With all the Oscar clatter surrounding this
summer's ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Truman Show,'' you'd
think they'd just cancel the fall movie season _ the traditional
time for studios to roll out their quality movies _ and get on with
the awards show.
	   Not so fast. More than 140 movies are due to arrive in theaters
between September and December, and chances are a few will break
out as Oscar contenders. But it's tough for viewers to keep them
straight.
	   With such a big, varied, overwhelming slate, just to stand out,
a film would have to star Sean Penn, Nick Nolte, George Clooney,
John Travolta, John Cusack and Woody Harrelson. And one does: ``The
Thin Red Line.'' That would have been the year's event picture
about World War II if Steven Spielberg hadn't beaten them to it.
	   The glut is so extensive, the fall offers shades of the summer's
dueling comets phenomenon, with not one but two films about
precocious dwarfs _ ``Simon Birch'' and ``The Mighty'' _ and two
computer-animated features about ants that talk: ``Antz'' and ``A
Bug's Life.''
	   At last check, Meryl Streep is in at least two movies. So are
Robin Williams, Travolta, Kenneth Branagh, Ralph Fiennes, Jeanne
Garofalo, Edward Norton and busy character actor Oliver Platt.
Woody Allen lends his voice to one movie (``Antz'') and directs
another, ``Celebrity.'' Val Kilmer and Sandra Bullock provide
voices for ``The Prince of Egypt'' and appear on screen in separate
films (``At First Sight'' for Kilmer, ``Practical Magic'' for Ms.
Bullock).
	   Even aging rockers from 80s hair bands have movies. Dee Snider,
the frontman from Twisted Sister, wrote, directed and stars in
``Dee Snider's Strangeland,'' and Poison's lead singer Bret
Michaels does Snider a few hyphenates better as
writer-director-producer-scorer of ``A Letter From Death Row.''
	   Out of the avalanche of films, a few trends emerge to help
moviegoers make sense of the fall. Among them:
	    &UR; DON'T LET DEATH GET YOU DOWN
	   Maybe it's the approaching millennium. Maybe it's the moral
crisis in Washington. Maybe it's just a coincidence. But several
fall films deal with spirituality, the afterlife and the
possibility of second chances.
	   Michael Keating dies in a car crash in ``Jack Frost,'' then
returns as a snowman, while Brad Pitt in ``Meet Joe Black'' has
A-list death credentials. He's the Grim Reaper but falls in love
with a tycoon's daughter during a vacation to the land of the
living.
	   ``There are a lot of people right now who are looking for some
definition of what it is to be human,'' said Stephen Simon, one of
the producers of ``What Dreams May Come,'' about a wife (Annabella
Sciorra) who kills herself so she can find her late husband
(Williams) in the hereafter.
	   ``It's very threatening to be confronted with the idea that
things happen for a reason,'' added Oliver Platt, who plays an
understanding surrogate father in ``Simon Birch.'' ``For cynics
like myself, it's much easier to say: There's no plan; it happened.
But as I get older, you start to ask these questions about life.''
	   From the great beyond to the great unknown of the supernatural,
there are the witches-with-man-trouble, ``Practical Magic'' with
Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, and Hollywood's latest take on
cinema's favorite dwellers of the dark in ``John Carpenter's
Vampires'' starring James Woods.
	   ``We make it slightly more real in terms of the way vampires are
killed,'' explained Carpenter, who was initially reluctant to make
a vampire movie. ``Crosses don't work. You have to kill them about
55 times and drag them into the sun, and when you do they ignite
like magnesium.''
	    &UR; HOME IS WHERE THE HEARTACHE IS
	   In ``One True Thing,'' Renee Zwellweger is an ambitious magazine
reporter in New York _ the fourth movie lead this year to work for
a New York magazine. She reluctantly gives up her career to take
care of her dying mother (Streep) and finds just how painful it is
to come to terms.
	   Another film pairing top actresses, ``Stepmom,'' casts Susan
Sarandon as the ex-wife who wants to hate former hubby's new
girlfriend, Julia Roberts, but just can't do it. Without giving too
much away, let's just say that Sarandon's health in this movie
isn't so good, either.
	   The most disturbing family drama is from director Todd Solondz,
whose ``Happiness'' is a very dark comedy that deals with
loneliness, masturbation and pedophilia in suburbia. The film,
virtually guaranteed an NC-17 rating, was dropped by October
Releasing, under pressure from parent Universal Studios, and will
be released independently by its producers.
	    &UR; STAR POWER
	   One of the most anticipated films of the fall is ``Rounders,'' a
snappy Matt Damon vehicle with his first lead role since the
overnight success of ``Good Will Hunting.'' Edward Norton makes a
run for another Oscar nomination as Damon's morally challenged,
fast-talking friend, and Gretchen Mol _ anointed in Vanity Fair
this month _ plays Damon's girlfriend.
	   ``With Matt, it was just a tremendous experience,'' gushed Mol,
who also worked with Leonardo DiCaprio on ``Celebrity'' (she calls
DiCaprio ``an accomplished actor.'') ``Matt's got such a knowledge
of filmmaking. He's really smart and sensitive, and he just made me
feel comfortable.''
	    &UR; LOOK TO A TOUGH BOOK
	   Filmmakers adapting ``A Civil Action'' from Jonathan Harr's
bestselling book faced a dictionary- thick work filled with the
intricacies of tangled civil litigation. In the end, hundreds of
pages _ and dozens of characters _ were cut.

	   Similarly, it took Oprah Winfrey 10 years to bring Toni
Morrison's ``Beloved'' to the screen while she searched for a way
to extract a movie from the book's difficult narrative, which moves
back and forth in time.
	   ``We really wanted to follow the story. This movie is as true to
the book as any story has been,'' said Winfrey, producer who also
stars with Danny Glover. ``We used the book every day. I would
literally walk into the scene and ... refer to the book. We'd ask:
What does the book say about this?''
	    &UR; KEEPING ACTIVE
	   Thrillers and science fiction adventures didn't die in the
summer's hail of meteorites. The fall season has a surprisingly
large number of movies usually associated with the popcorn months,
including a political thriller from ``Armageddon'' producer Jerry
Bruckheimer in ``Enemy of the State,'' starring Gene Hackman and
Will Smith.
	   Denzel Washington, Bruce Willis and Annette Bening are called in
to resolve a terrorist crisis in New York City in ``Against All
Enemies,'' and Robert De Niro is part of a team of mercenaries
seeking a very important briefcase in Paris in ``Ronin,'' which
promises one of the greatest car chases since ``The French
Connection.''
	   ``This is not an action picture. It's a drama with action in
it,'' said director John Frankenheimer. ``This is a movie for an
audience that really likes a good story. The characters are very,
very interesting. I hope that people like the action sequences, but
I think you could run this picture without the action sequences and
have a very good movie.''
	   There's also plenty to look at in the latest ``Star Trek''
evergreen, ``Star Trek: Insurrection,'' with hundreds of special
effects and, in a twist, a major love theme, as Capt. Picard is
smitten.
	   ``It's a totally different look than any other 'Star Trek'
film,'' said director Jonathan Frankes. ``We're in the ninth
venture in the franchise; I think surprises are essential.''

Stewart takes lead into final round

<TEXT>
	   SURREY, British Columbia (AP) _ Payne Stewart shot a 6-under-par
65 Saturday and took a one-stroke lead over Brandel Chamblee after
three rounds of the dlrs 2 million Greater Vancouver Open.
	   ``I came here so I'd have a chance to win tomorrow. Now I've got
that,'' said Stewart, who opened the tournament with a 64 and had a
15-under 198 total.
	   Chamblee, who started the third round tied for the lead with
Chris DiMarco, had a 68 on the 6,893-yard (6,300-meter) Northview
Golf and Country Club course.
	   DiMarco, whose second-round 63 was one stroke off the course
record, blew up to a 72 and was tied with Brent Geiberger, Tom
Pernice Jr., Harrison Frazar and Larry Rinker at 10-under 203.
	   Hal Sutton matched Stewart's 65 for the best round of the day
and was tied with Russ Cochran, Bob Estes, Mike Weir and Tom Byrum
at 204.
	   Cochran, who started the day four under, had an eagle on the
par-5 12th but bogeyed the 18th for a 66.
	   ``I had a chance to do something special today and I didn't do
it,'' Cochran said. ``I didn't get my driver going when I needed
to. I didn't keep it on the fairway on the back nine.''
	   Paul Stankowski also had a 65 Saturday, but was seven strokes
behind Stewart.

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES _ Emmy celebrates a 50th birthday Sept. 13 with a
big enough outpouring of awards and nostalgia to fill a whopping
four hours of prime television time in the United States.
	   ``We're using the occasion to go back and look at 50 years of
the Emmy Awards,'' says executive producer Don Mischer, ``but also
look at 50 years of television.''
	   Some 200 TV journalists and historians have been polled for the
10 greatest moments in TV history, both in news and entertainment.
The results will broadcast live during the extravaganza at the
venerable Shrine Auditorium.
	   Some may be easy to guess: the walk on the moon; birth of Lucy's
baby, ``Little Ricky''; shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald; Kefauver
crime hearings; emergence of Archie Bunker; Milton Berle in drag;
Chuckles the Clown's funeral on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'';
Edward R. Murrow's reply to Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
	   Sadly, Mischer's history of the Emmy Awards will be incomplete.
``The first five years of the Emmy broadcasts unfortunately have
been totally lost,'' he says. ``We tried every source, as have many
other people.''
	   For the first five years, the show was not broadcast nationally
and contained a L.A. localism, a favorite category, that Mischer
fondly recalls: ``Outstanding male performer seen only in Los
Angeles except for occasional guest-shot appearances elsewhere.''
	   Filling four hours of prime time challenged even Mischer, but he
welcomed the chance to include such material as Emmy acceptance
speeches and final episodes of long-running series.
	   This year's top contenders include the dramas ``ER'' and ``The
X-Files,'' each with 16 nominations, and ``From the Earth to the
Moon,'' produced by Tom Hanks with 17 bids.
	   The idea of an Academy of Television Arts and Sciences was the
brainstorm of Syd Cassyd, a reporter for a trade newspaper who saw
television as an entertainment giant. In 1946, he gathered industry
movers and shakers to discuss an academy similar to the one for
motion pictures.
	   They enlisted as front man: ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, one of
the first stars to enter the new medium.
	   The Academy's first awards were called ``Ikes,'' for the
iconoscope tube. But that seemed to be an endorsement of Gen.
Dwight Eisenhower, new to the political scene. The statuette was
renamed Emmy, a female version of Immy, after the image orthicon
camera then in use.
	   Edie DeWolfe, a veteran Los Angeles newswoman, remembers the
first Emmy awards on Jan. 25, 1949, at the Hollywood Athletic Club.
She recalls some 600 guests, but with this observation:
	   ``What impressed me was how few celebrities appeared. None of
the stretch-limos you see today,'' she says, ``Most of us parked
our own cars. The lack of celebrities was probably because people
in radio and movies were jealous of the new medium.''
	   If Hollywood's famous failed to recognize the impact of
television, politicians did not. California Gov. Earl Warren, Los
Angeles Mayor Fletcher Bowron, city councilmen and other politicos
appeared at the event, she recalls. De Wolfe attended as the wife
of Klaus Landsberg, an early organizer of the Academy and the
brilliant chief of KTLA that collected half of the awards.
	   Six Emmys were handed out in 1949 (vs. 81 this year). But only
one went to a performer: puppeteer Shirley Dinsdale.
	   The Academy became less provincial in 1950, initiating
categories for achievements onkinescope. At that time, East Coast
shows were copied on photographic film _ a ponderous process called
kinescope _ for replay in the West. Milton Berle was deemed the
outstanding kinescope personality.
	   Emmy's first major surprise came in 1952, when ``I Love Lucy''
was the rage of TV. Everyone expected Lucille Ball as Best Comedian
or Comedienne. But Zsa Zsa Gabor announced: ``And the winner is...
Red Skelton.''
	   Even Skelton was startled. ``I think this should have gone to
Lucille Ball,'' he remarked. She did win the following year, when
that category evolved to two: comedian and comedienne.
	   The early years were marked by strife between Hollywood talent
and TV Academy officials, who wanted to establish a national
organization. In 1953, New Yorkers rebelled and staged their own
awards, the Michaels, with Ed Sullivan as emcee.
	   In 1956, the awards were televised nationally for the first
time. Although ``I Love Lucy'' reigned as America's favorite, the
program failed to win any of its five nominations.
	   The schism deepened between East and West, especially as
production centered in Hollywood. The predominance was underscored
in 1960, when the Hollywood-produced ``An Evening with Fred
Astaire'' won all of its nine nominations.
	   Emmy history is studded with controversy and boycotts, and the
TV Academy tinkered with category designations in attempts to quell
the furor. The most bizarre ceremony was in 1981.
	   Both the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of
Radio and Television Artists had called a strike against the
networks over contract matters. A boycott of the awards was
invoked, and the emcees and nominees declined to attend. Only one
actor, Powers Booth, appeared to collect his Emmy, for ``Guyana
Tragedy: The Story of Jim Jones.''
	   Over a half-century, Emmy has lived through far more calamities
and ridicule than its 75-year-old stepbrother, Oscar. The Sunday
marathon seems a fitting tribute to one of the show world's great
survivors.

That Was the Week That Was
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Entertainment highlights during the week of Aug. 30-Sept. 5:
	   55 years old: Warners' all-star ``This Is the Army'' debuted at
the Hollywood Theater in New York. It was the first klieg-lit
premiere since the start of World War II. The film starred Ronald
Reagan, Kate Smith and George Murphy. Murphy played Reagan's
father.
	   35 years ago: ``The CBS Evening News With Walter Cronkite''
expanded from 15 minutes to 30 minutes, becoming network
television's first half-hour nightly newscast.
	   And Phil Spector produced ``Be My Baby'' and ``Baby I Love You''
for The Ronettes. Spector had just signed the trio to his Phillies
label. The Ronettes had started their career as dancers at New
York's Peppermint Lounge.
	   30 years ago: Radio stations in several U.S. cities banned the
Rolling Stones song, ``Street Fighting Man,'' out of concern that
the song might incite civil disorder.
	   20 years ago: Singer Teddy Pendergrass performed a ``For Women
Only'' midnight concert at Avery Fisher Hall in New York.
	   10 years ago: John Sayles' ``Eight Men Out,'' a film about the
attempt to throw the 1919 World Series, starred Sayles, John Cusack
and Charlie Sheen.
	   And a worldwide charity tour to raise funds for Amnesty
International was launched with a concert at London's Wembley
Stadium. The tour featured Bruce Springsteen, Sting, Peter Gabriel
and Tracy Chapman.
	   Five years ago: A smiling and serene David Letterman made his
debut on CBS ``Late Show'' in the plush confines of the renovated
Ed Sullivan Theater in New York. Actor Bill Murray, Letterman's
first guest on ``Late Night,'' joined musical guest Billy Joel for
the CBS debut.
	   And grunge rock grudgingly won the night at the MTV Video Music
Awards, a three-hour maelstrom of irreverence, sexual innuendo and
music. Pearl Jam won four awards for ``Jeremy,'' a haunting video
about teen suicide.
	   One year ago: Harrison Ford arrived at the Venice Film Festival
in Italy in style. The star of ``Air Force One'' piloted his own
plane and sported a recently pierced left ear. Ford called the
piercing _ and the new earring _ a birthday present to himself.
	   Spoken 10 years ago:
	   ``I don't write about things. I write from inside of something,
and I sing and play the same way. It's never about that
'something,' hoping to touch it. It's rather from the inside of it
reaching out.'' _ Folk singer Bob Dylan.
	   Spoken five years ago:
	   ``You know, I was just a drunk. It wasn't anything profound or
spiritual. It's just that I drank until I became addicted to
alcohol. So anybody who draws those parallels is just barking up
the wrong tree.'' _ Actor John Larroquette, who quit drinking in
1981, commenting on his role as a recovered alcoholic in his new
NBC series, ``The John Larroquette Show.''
	   Spoken one year ago:
	   ``A live performance is an experience. You're seeing the heart
and soul of a performer. ... You just hope you don't embarrass
yourself.'' _ Don Everly, the lead singer of the Everly Brothers.

	   In the spotlight: Gloria Estefan, Latina sensation
	    &UR; Claim to fame: Known as the ``Queen of Latin Pop,'' Gloria
Estefan has sold some 45 million records, and she is considered the
single most successful crossover performer in Latin music.
	    &UR; Personal stats: Born Gloria Fajardo in Havana, Cuba, on Sept.
1, 1957, her family fled to the United States and settled in a
Cuban ghetto behind the Orange Bowl in Miami, Florida.
	   She entered the University of Miami at Coral Gables, Florida,
with plans to become a psychologist. Though retiring and serious,
she was persuaded to join the Miami Latin Boys, a local
Cuban-American quartet.
	   The talented soprano blossomed into a sleek, polished and
self-assured performer under the guidance of Emilio Estefan, the
group's leader. The group was soon renamed the Miami Sound Machine.
The two clicked both professionally and personally. She married
Estefan in 1978.
	    &UR; Breakout: The Miami Sound Machine's first single in English was
``Dr. Beat.'' The single became popular in clubs in Britain, and by
the end of 1984, Columbia issued the non-charting ``Eyes of
Innocence.''
	    &UR; Success: ``Conga,'' based on a traditional Cuban street dance,
hit No. 10 in February 1986. It was the group's first U.S. chart
entry. This was followed by ``Bad Boy,'' another hit.
	   In deference to Ms. Estefan's obvious star status at the front
of the group, the name was changed to Gloria Estefan and the Miami
Sound Machine on the Latin-swaying ``Rhythm Is Gonna Get You'' in
1987.
	   The band became known as Gloria Estefan in 1989. Her first solo
album, ``Cuts Both Ways,'' had the hit singles, ``Get on Your
Feet'' and ``Don't Wanna Lose You.''
	    &UR; Almost disaster: While on tour in 1990, Ms. Estefan nearly died
when a tractor-trailer collided with her tour bus. She sustained
serious back injuries. However, with hard work and determination,
she recovered. The songs in her album, ``Into the Light,'' dealt
partly with her recuperation. The album contained the hit single,
``Coming Out of the Dark.''
	   In 1994, Ms. Estefan won a Grammy for Best Tropical Latin Album
for ``Mi Tierra'' (``My Homeland''), a song about missing one's
country, specifically Cuba, the place she and thousands of Miami
residents once called home. Two years later, she won another Grammy
for Best Tropical Latin Performance for ``Abriendo Puertas.''
	    &UR; Let's party: Early this summer, Ms. Estefan threw a block party
in Miami Beach for the release of ``gloria!'' _ her 19th album. ``I
have been working really hard. I really needed a party. This is
it,'' she told the crowd. ``This is my place to celebrate. I'm out
there for the fans. That's what it's about.''

<TEXT>
	   SHEPPERTON, England (AP) _ At west London's Shepperton Studios,
in a room the size of an aircraft hangar, ``Thomas the Tank Engine
and Friends'' are being put through their electrically powered _
and rather sweet _ remote-controlled paces.
	   Wait a minute! Where are the actors?
	   ``Actors sweat, really, and they're nasty and get ill and
stuff,'' says David Mitton, the director and co-producer who
supervises cheerful, brightly colored locomotives with names like
Thomas, Edward and Gordon.
	   Meet Stepney, an engine _ ``He's the little yellow chap,''
Mitton says with a smile _ and the star of this week's 5 1-2
-minute segment.
	   In this particular plot, Stepney is chugging about the grassy
valley when the fog descends and he loses his way.
	   ``He's nearly smelted down,'' Mitton explains later. ``The
diesels are waiting to get hold of him to melt him down badly.''
(In the world according to ``Thomas,'' diesels are usually bad
news.)
	   Then again, this is popular children's TV, not life. So all must
end well, though ``Thomas'' tales often pack a neat little moral.
	   Set on the fictional Island of Sodor, the ``Thomas'' series
began filming in 1984. This round marks the fifth spate of stories,
with Alec Baldwin now narrating.
	   ``Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends'' returned to the U.S.
airwaves with this month's launch of the Fox Family Channel. It is
part of the rotation on ``Mr. Moose's Fun Time,'' at noon EDT,
Monday through Friday. The new cable network also airs ``Shining
Time Station,'' a live-action series featuring the ``Thomas''
animated shorts, at 11:30 a.m., Monday through Friday.
	   At Shepperton, it's business as usual.
	   Special effects supervisor David Eves is in charge of steam, fog
and water. In addition, he knows the engines well, having helped
his father, Peter, build the originals.
	   ``When you see a lot of the rubbish the kids do watch,'' says
Eves, looking up from his work table in an adjacent studio,
```Thomas' has got a lot to offer. Adults watch it as well.''
	   He is not worried about competition from British rivals like
``Teletubbies,'' now demanding their share of the children's
market. Says Eves: ``That's a bit of a passing fad.''
	   Much of the work on ``Thomas'' falls to chief model-maker Brian
Rutland, who built such new characters as The Paxman Diesel and
Harry Topper's Biplane.
	   Rutland's team includes Martin Gaskell, a senior model-maker who
works from some sketches provided by Britt Allcroft. As the series'
original creator and producer, Allcroft has turned the rural
English rector's tales into an international franchise.
	   The show airs in 121 countries, and it has been translated into
nine languages, including Norwegian, Korean, Welsh, and Estonian.
Last month, an amusement park with a ``Thomas'' theme opened in
Japan.
	   Gaskell is busy molding silicone rubber into beguiling,
open-faced expressions so beloved in Britain and abroad. ``They
have working eyes,'' he says proudly of the models.
	   He comes to the series after helping build the main spacecraft
in the William Hurt-Gary Oldman film ``Lost In Space.'' Now marking
his third ``Thomas'' series, Gaskell is adamant: ``I never do
anything that's the same. Every job is different.''
	   So, too, is every expression, including as many as 30 faces for
Thomas alone. And though viewers often assume that the engines'
features move, only the eyes dart as a 12-volt current powers the
engines down the track.
	   Barrels of gravel, sand and stone are evident on the set, as is
a periscope lens that allows Mitton and colleagues to view
everything from the engines' eye level.
	   Human beings figure as well. The kindly Fat Controller (a k a
Sir Topham Hatt) is already a beloved institution.
	   ``He's the sort of corporate image,'' says director Mitton.
``Instead of just actually running a line now, he's getting huge
bonuses all the time.''
	   Mitton knew the Rev. W. Awdry, the English cleric who wrote the
``Railway Series'' that gave rise to the ``Thomas'' phenomenon. The
author died last year.
	   ``I've got great respect for the reverend. I always have had,''
says Mitton, who, with Allcroft, is busy devising stories to carry
on where Awdry left off.
	   The nub of each episode, he explains, is ``an angst position
where one engine realizes he should have listened to the other ...
.
	   ``They generally apologize or say something at the end, or
become friends again,'' says Mitton. ``They're like a little gang
of kids: That's all it is.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's interim government and parliament leaders
are preparing for a new round of talks over a political deal to end
the country's crisis and restore calm to the markets and confidence
to the people.
	   But acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin declared Saturday
there will be no return to the Soviet system.
	   ``We have already joined the world economy, and there will be no
return to the past,'' acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
pledged on national television.
	   His assurances followed days of frenzied negotiations in which
the government appeared ready to take drastic actions to restore
economic calm, including reimposing Soviet-style controls on prices
and the exchange rate.
	   For his part, Chernomyrdin spent hours bargaining with lawmakers
Saturday over terms of a political deal that would give the
parliament more power in return for swift confirmation of his
nomination.
	   A major sticking point was whether the lower house, the State
Duma, would be granted the power to approve or reject Cabinet
appointments. Currently they only confirm the president's
nomination of a prime minister, not lower-ranking Kremlin
officials.
	   The talks ended without a final agreement late Saturday and were
to resume Sunday. Chernomyrdin said the deliberations were
difficult in part because they are historic.
	   ``This is the first time in six years that we are coming to
agreement on the definition of the problems in which Russia finds
herself,'' he said after the meeting adjourned, according to the
Interfax news agency.
	   Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov told Interfax that all sides
expect to reach final agreement Sunday before parliament takes up
debate on Chernomyrdin's appointment on Monday.
	   The economy meanwhile, showed a few signs of nascent recovery.
After sharp drops earlier in the week, the ruble bounced back a bit
in Moscow street sales on Saturday and demand was high enough that
some exchange booths ran out of the Russian currency.
	   For his part, Chernomyrdin spent hours bargaining with lawmakers
over terms of a political deal that would give the parliament more
power in return for swift confirmation of his nomination.
	   The Duma is scheduled to debate Chernomyrdin's appointment on
Monday.
	   In a scripted interview with journalists, Chernomyrdin _ whose
devotion to economic reform has frequently been questioned _
pledged to keep the ruble convertible, shore up the wobbly banking
system and protect depositors.
	   ``The main thing is to make sure people don't suffer,'' he said,
looking straight at the camera. ``For this we should use our power,
and we will use it as much as necessary.''
	   ``You can be calm. You will get your savings,'' he said.
	   Yeltsin brought Chernomyrdin back as prime minister a week ago
because he hoped the familiar figure would restore confidence in
the government, badly damaged by the ruble's sharp decline. The
crisis of confidence climaxed Thursday in a wave of rumors that
even Yeltsin would resign.
	   But the president, with typical bluster, sought to squash such
speculation by going on television Friday to declare he would not
step down.
	   The crisis has been building all summer as Russia's financial
markets collapsed, unbuoyed even by a dlrs 23 billion international
bailout. The economic turmoil forced the government to devalue the
ruble two weeks ago, which triggered a larger crisis of confidence
in Yeltsin's government.
	   The opposition-led parliament is seeking maximum political
advantage from the upheaval and has demanded concessions from the
Kremlin in return for confirming Chernomyrdin.
	   Participants said the deal is expected to give parliament more
say over key Cabinet appointments and government policies, and will
require some constitutional amendments.

Book Review: 'Tell Me Your Dreams' by Sidney Sheldon

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``All around the mulberry bush,
	   The monkey chased the weasel...''
	   If you hear this nursery rhyme, watch out. A brutal murder is
just around the corner. At least that's the way it goes in Sidney
Sheldon's latest _ and probably most harrowing _ novel, ``Tell Me
Your Dreams.''
	   There are three protagonists _ Ashley Patterson, Toni Prescott
and Alette Peters. All are young and beautiful, as Sheldon heroines
usually are.
	   The three work as operators at a computer graphics firm in
Cupertino, California. Ashley is the daughter of a famous surgeon.
Born in Pennsylvania, she is intelligent and elegant. Toni, born in
London, is vivacious and daring. And Alette, born in Rome, is
artistic and sweet.
	   It appears they are all set for wonderful lives, but that's not
what Sheldon, their creator, has in mind.
	   Ashley finds herself being stalked by an unknown party. Whoever
it is, he or she freely gets into her apartment, and even scrawls a
threatening message on the bathroom mirror.
	   Toni's date, a Quebec City jeweler she met on the Internet, is
murdered. So is Alette's boyfriend, a San Francisco artist. Then,
Ashley goes to a high school reunion, and learns that her former
sweetheart is dead, murdered. They are all castrated.
	   The three murders seem vaguely connected with Ashley. Could her
father be the murderer? Ashley agonizes helplessly.
	   Sheldon, an Academy Award-winning writer for best original
screen play (The Bachelor and Bobby Soxer), and the Guinness Book's
``most translated author in the world,'' uses his proven
story-telling skill to dramatize the tormented world of an
emotionally disturbed character filled with murderous rage.
	   ``Dreams'' manages to be both thrilling and thought-provoking.
The chilly ending should haunt psychiatrists and the public alike.
	    &UR; ___
	   ``Tell Me Your Dreams'' was published by Morrow this month. dlrs

At the Movies: 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Film opened nationwide Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By LINDA DEUTSCH &QC; 
 &UR; AP Special Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Only a handful of movies have captured the
excitement and unique character of the era that created rock 'n'
roll. ``The Idolmaker'' and ``The Buddy Holly Story'' come to mind.
	   But few seem to have told it as well as Gregory Nava's new film,
a movie that might seem the least likely candidate to go beyond its
character-driven story and give us insight into the cultural
changes mirrored by music in the 1950s and 1960s.
	   ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' is the story of Frankie Lymon (of
Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers) and the tangled, tragic path his
life took after dazzling success with the title song and a string
of other hits.
	   The dramatic vehicle is an intriguing true story. Three women
came forward after Lymon's death, each claiming to be the rightful
widow of the singing star and seeking royalties on his still
popular songs. Each claim was questionable, and the matter wound up
in a bitterly fought court case. We meet them at the start of this
battle.
	   Through testimony and flashbacks, we learn about Lymon's rise
and fall from superstardom to drug addiction and his involvements
with three beautiful but very different women.
	   The female leads _ the gorgeous Halle Berry as singing star Zola
Taylor of The Platters, Vivica A. Fox as a down-on-her-luck
shoplifter and Lela Rochon as a prim school teacher _ turn in rich,
multi-layered performances.
	   In a telling moment during a break in court proceedings, one
``wife'' says to another: ``You didn't seem like Frankie's type.''
The third ``wife'' chimes in, ``It seems everybody was Frankie's
type.'' And therein lies the tale.
	   Beyond his romances and his problems with a venal
manager-songwriter (Paul Mazursky in a strong supporting
performance) Frankie's life and music serve as a microcosm for an
age that was nothing less than revolutionary.
	   Here was a young black kid from the streets of New York, singing
with a group of mostly Hispanic friends, inventing a new musical
sound and winning screams of approval from a predominantly white
audience.
	   In one scene, a pretty blonde jumps on stage to jitterbug with
the star during a live TV broadcast, sending shivers through crew
members who gasp: ``Frankie's dancing with a white woman.'' The
show is quickly canceled. Racism prevails.
	   The most powerful expression of the era's excitement comes in an
amazing cameo appearance by Little Richard whose performance as a
trial witness is almost as show stopping as his singing style.
	   In concert scenes, in street scenes and in the Beverly Hills
mansion that is the symbol of Zola Taylor's success we see
signposts of the era. Costume designer Elisabetta Beraldo has given
us female stars in cocktail dresses with wide swirling skirts and
male singers decked out in tuxedos.
	   We see go-go girls singing backup, peace demonstrators in the
streets and audiences full of girls in pedal pushers and sweater
sets, saddle shoes and hair in pony tails. Shag carpeting is the
height of home decorating chic.
	   Production designer Cary White seems to have raided every thrift
store around for the authentic costumes and decorations.
	   Gregory Nava, who directed the musical biography ``Selena,''
brings out the best in all of his stars, not the least of whom is
Larenz Tate in the title role. Handsome, energetic and appealing as
the young Frankie, the actor, who last appeared as Kevin Kostner's
sidekick in ``The Postman,'' projects a magnetism that explains
each woman's overwhelming attraction to him. And his lip synching
of Lymon's songs is perfect. He even does the splits a la Lymon.
	   But Tate's transformation into a drug-addled loser is less
convincing, relying heavily on makeup to get the message across.
	   The musical score is best when it relies on Lymon's legacy and
on rock 'n' roll standards of such groups as The Platters.
Audiences will be humming those tunes long after they leave the
theater.
	   ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' is a Warner Bros. release produced
by Paul Hall, Stephen Nemeth, Mark Allan and Harold Bronson.
Screenwriter Tina Andrews makes a strong writing debut after a
career as an actress.
	   Running time 123 minutes.

	   ``Flaming Red'' (A and M) _ Patty Griffin
	   On its face, nothing about ``Flaming Red'' is much different
from 100 or so other modern rock albums of the past several years.
That's what makes it such a disaster.
	   Patty Griffin's debut, ``Living With Ghosts,'' was an
astonishingly powerful album, breathtaking, heartbreaking and raw.
When A and M released it in 1996, the story put out by the company
was that she had recorded a regular rock album, then everybody
involved decided that her demo tapes _ recorded solo _ were just so
much better, so they released them instead.
	   With ``Flaming Red,'' Griffin seems to have made the album
everyone was so happy about not making last time. Oh, there are a
few songs that might clue you in to the fact that Griffin is
special, but not one of them compares favorably with anything from
``Living With Ghosts'' and not one of them wouldn't sound better
performed by just Griffin with her guitar. Instead, ``Flaming Red''
sounds like a primer on Modern Rock Production.
	   Maybe this is who Griffin is; maybe ``Living With Ghosts'' was
the aberration and the plan all along was to sound like everybody
else. If so, the goal's been accomplished.
	   ___
	   ``Where Your Road Leads'' (MCA) _ Trisha Yearwood
	   First of all, there's that voice. Big and lush, silken and
strong, Trisha Yearwood's voice has always carried her beyond the
mediocrity of much of her material. That's again the case on
``Where Your Road Leads,'' an album that seems designed to cast
Yearwood as a Whitney Houston/Celine Dion-type diva more than as a
country singer. It would be terrific to hear Yearwood explore some
rootsier material. As it is, the hum of a fiddle and whine of a
steel guitar come as surprises on ``Where Your Road Leads.'' Still,
Yearwood manages to stand head and shoulders above the
mainstream-country pack.
	   ___
	   ``Songs of Forbidden Love'' (Lazy S.O.B.) _ The Wandering Eyes
	   Now this is country music the way God and George Jones intended
it. Jones, who complained publicly not too long ago that nobody
sang cheating and drinking songs anymore, will find little to
complain about here. ``Songs of Forbidden Love'' is almost all
cheating songs, broken only by a little jail-bait ditty and a song
in which a married man yearns for a married woman.
	   That could play as camp, and certainly there's an element of
that going on here. But the band, an amalgamation of some of
country's best performers, including Dale Watson, Ted Roddy and the
sublime Kelly Willis makes it all work. It's good stuff and it
ought to make Jones happy. Now they need to do an album of drinking
songs.
	   One last word: How can we claim to be a great country when Kelly
Willis does not have a record deal?
	   ___
	   ``Seeing Things'' (Rounder) _ Laurie Lewis
	   Laurie Lewis plays a mean fiddle and has the kind of lonesome
voice a lot of bluegrass singers would kill for. But Lewis takes
her music beyond bluegrass on ``Seeing Things,'' exploring Norteno
on ``I'll Take Back My Heart'' and delivering a ravishing, almost
eerie version of the traditional ``The Blackest Crow,'' on which
her voice is set against what she calls ``a forest of fiddles.''
It's a haunting end to a fine album, one that fans of bluegrass,
rootsy country and singer-songwriters should enjoy.

Prime Minister John Howard calls national election for Oct. 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Sunday
called a national election for Oct. 3 and will campaign mainly on
the issue of sweeping tax reform.
	   Howard's governing conservatives want to introduce a 10 percent
goods and services tax, but are sweetening that proposal by cutting
personal income taxes and many sales taxes.
	   ``''I am very proud of the record of economic and other
achievement of the government that I lead,'' Howard said.
	   The opposition Labor Party, led by Kim Beazley, has proposed
more limited tax reforms and offered tax cuts aimed mainly at its
traditional blue-collar working class constituency.
	   The Labor Party would not introduce a goods and services tax,
however. Labor won a landslide victory in the 1993 election by
campaigning against the introduction of such a tax then.
	   Labor has been ahead in opinion polls for most of the year. But
Howard's government has gained ground since it released its plan to
overhaul the nation's tax system earlier this month.
	   Howard's government, elected in 1996, had until next May to call
an election.
	   But the economic effects of the Asian crisis are beginning to
filter through into Australia, harming commodity exports and
tourism. The sooner Howard called the election, the better to avoid
the worsening effects of the regional problem.
	   The Russian financial collapse has also hit the economy of
Australia, along with the rest of the the world. The share market
has dropped and the Australian dollar has fallen by a penny to
about U.S. 57 cents in the last week.
	   An October election will also be the first federal test for
Pauline Hanson's fledgling One Nation right-wing populist party,
which made major inroads into the major parties' vote in the
Queensland state election in June.
	   In the current House of Representatives, Howard's governing
Liberal Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the
Labor Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's
Country Liberal Party, 1.
	   The Labor Party has to win 27 seats to return to government,
which is formed out of the House of Representatives.
	   Half of the Senate will also be up for grabs.
	   One Nation has a chance of winning enough Senate seats to hold
the balance of power there, where it could block legislation it
opposes, such as gun control, welfare for Aborigines or loosening
Asian immigration restrictions.
	   Howard insisted Sunday, ``I will make no deals in government
with One Nation.''
	   Howard called the election just one day after his party suffered
defeat in Tasmanian state elections, where conservatives had held
power for 16 years.
	   There are about 11.7 million voters among Australia's 18 million
people.

Braves win 4-3 over Cardinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ A rare outburst from Mark McGwire turned the
St. Louis Cardinals' game against the Atlanta Braves on Saturday
into a sideshow.
	   McGwire was ejected for arguing a questionable called third
strike in the first inning, missing a chance to add to his total of
54 home runs and drawing a noisy demonstration from a sellout crowd
of 47,627 at Busch Stadium in a 4-3 loss to Atlanta.
	   Manager Tony La Russa also was thrown out by plate umpire Sam
Holbrook. Cardinals pitching coach Dave Duncan was tossed by
Holbrook after the Braves batted in the second.
	   Police were later called on the field after fans tossed debris,
and the game was halted for about 10 minutes. With two police
officers walking near them, the umpires left the field after the
final out.
	   Tom Glavine (18-5) won for the 11th time in 12 road decisions,
and Javy Lopez hit his 29th homer, a two-run shot. Glavine allowed
three hits and three runs in seven innings. Rudy Seanez got three
outs for his second save.
	   Kent Bottenfield (4-6) was the loser.
 &UR; Mets 4, Dodgers 3 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Edgardo Alfonzo hit a two-out, two-run homer in
the ninth inning off Jeff Shaw to push New York past Los Angeles.
	   Shaw (3-8) retired pinch-hitters Lenny Harris and Matt Franco
before Tony Phillips drew a walk, setting the stage for Alfonzo.
	   Al Leiter (13-5) won for the 10th time in 12 decisions, allowing
five hits and three runs in eight innings. John Franco blanked the
Dodgers in the ninth for his 30th save.
	   Trenidad Hubbard, Raul Mondesi and Bobby Bonilla homered for the
Dodgers, with Mondesi and Bonilla connecting in consecutive at-bats
in the second.
 &UR; Giants 10, Phillies 3 &QC; 
	   In San Francisco, Barry Bonds, Jeff Kent and Joe Carter homered
and Mark Gardner pitched his fourth complete game for San
Francisco.
	   Gardner (11-5) is 3-0 in six starts since losing at Montreal on
July 30. He allowed three runs and eight hits, walked one and
struck out five.
	   Carter, 3-for-5 with three RBIs, tied it in the bottom of the
inning with a leadoff homer off Carlton Loewer (6-6).
	   Wendell Magee and Rico Brogna homered for the Phillies.
 &UR; Reds 7, Marlins 5 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Reggie Sanders had a two-run double and Barry
Larkin tripled in the winning run in the seventh as Cincinnati sent
Florida to its 89th loss _ the most ever for a defending World
Series champion.
	   The Reds improved to 8-0 against the Marlins this season and
relinquished their major league record for worst encore by a
defending Series champion. The 1991 Reds lost 88 games after
sweeping Oakland in the World Series.
	   The Marlins overcame a three-run deficit as Todd Dunwoody had a
pair of RBI doubles and Ryan Jackson homered for a 5-3 lead in the
seventh. But starter Brian Meadows (10-10) failed to get an out in
the seventh.
	   Aaron Boone and Roberto Petagine singled and Sanders followed
with a game-tying double to left. Larkin tripled off Brian
Edmondson to put the Reds ahead and scored on Jeffrey Hammonds'

Rafter advances to finals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COMMACK, New York (AP) _ Patrick Rafter, the defending U.S. Open
champion, continued his mastery of Greg Rusedski with a 6-4, 7-5
victory Saturday to advance to the finals of the Hamlet Cup.
	   The 25-year-old Rafter, No. 3 on the ATP Tour and the second
seed in the tournament, is 5-1 _ including 5-0 on hard courts _
against Rusedski, last year's U.S. Open runner-up.
	   ``I played a smart game today,'' Rafter said. ``I served well
and made the most of the big points.''
	   The Australian, 25-3 with three titles since mid-June, will
oppose the No. 8 Felix Mantilla of Spain in Sunday's championship.
Mantilla eliminated 18-year-old Marat Safin, the rookie sensation
from Russia, 6-3, 5-7, 6-4.
	   ``My goal in this tournament, in addition to wanting to win, was
to make sure my game is all there for the U.S. Open. It is.''
Rafter said. ``I definitely have a chance to win if the draw opens
up a bit. I have to keep my energy level up, especially if the
weather continues hot and humid, as it has been here.''
	   Rusedski, in only his second tournament since a seven-week
layoff because of a sprained ankle suffered June 12 at the Queens
Club in London, dropped to 30-16 and 20-6 on hardcourt.
	   ``It was satisfying to get seven matches in since my return,''
Rusedski said. ``Patrick's serve was definitely on. By far, he's
the best player on the tour this summer.''
	   Rafter, the runnerup in last year's Hamlet looking for his fifth
title of the year, said Rusedski mixed his game up well, but the
24-year-old Canadian, who lives in Great Britain, has some way to
go.
	   ``Only because he missed so many matches and has to catch up,''
Rafter said. ``He's still a step away and it's going to take two to
three weeks to catch up.''
	   Rusedski agreed with Rafter's assessment.
	   ``I didn't raise my intensity level high enough,'' he said. ``I
have to get into the match right from the start. Today I didn't. I
didn't start off serving very well. You can't do that against top
10 players. They make you pay for it.''

Prime Minister John Howard calls national election for Oct. 3
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Beazley quotes in 10th-11th grafs. &QL; 
 &UR; By ALAN THORNHILL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard on Sunday
called a national election for Oct. 3 and will campaign mainly on
the issue of sweeping tax reform.
	   Howard's governing conservatives want to introduce a 10 percent
goods and services tax, but are sweetening that proposal by cutting
personal income taxes and many sales taxes.
	   ``''I am very proud of the record of economic and other
achievement of the government that I lead,'' Howard said.
	   The opposition Labor Party, led by Kim Beazley, has proposed
more limited tax reforms and offered tax cuts aimed mainly at its
traditional blue-collar working class constituency.
	   The Labor Party would not introduce a goods and services tax,
however. Labor won a landslide victory in the 1993 election by
campaigning against the introduction of such a tax then.
	   Labor has been ahead in opinion polls for most of the year. But
Howard's government has gained ground since it released its plan to
overhaul the nation's tax system earlier this month.
	   Howard's government, elected in 1996, had until next May to call
an election.
	   But the economic effects of the Asian crisis are beginning to
filter through into Australia, harming commodity exports and
tourism. The sooner Howard called the election, the better to avoid
the worsening effects of the regional problem.
	   The Russian financial collapse has also hit the economy of
Australia, along with the rest of the the world. The share market
has dropped and the Australian dollar has fallen by a penny to
about U.S. 57 cents in the last week.
	   ``We are on two different chessboards, John Howard and me. He is
talking about bribes, unsustainable to the current economic
circumstances _ bribes to persuade people to support a bad
dead-hand tax on the economy,'' Beazley told TV Network Ten.
	   ``Every Australian knows next year is going to be a year of
great economic difficulty for this nation.''
	   An October election will also be the first federal test for
Pauline Hanson's fledgling One Nation right-wing populist party,
which made major inroads into the major parties' vote in the
Queensland state election in June.
	   In the current House of Representatives, Howard's governing
Liberal Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the
Labor Party holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's
Country Liberal Party, 1.
	   The Labor Party has to win 27 seats to return to government,
which is formed out of the House of Representatives.
	   Half of the Senate will also be up for grabs.
	   One Nation has a chance of winning enough Senate seats to hold
the balance of power there, where it could block legislation it
opposes, such as gun control, welfare for Aborigines or loosening
Asian immigration restrictions.
	   Howard insisted Sunday, ``I will make no deals in government
with One Nation.''
	   Howard called the election just one day after his party suffered
defeat in Tasmanian state elections, where conservatives had held
power for 16 years.
	   There are about 11.7 million voters among Australia's 18 million
people.

No. 4 Nebraska 56, Louisiana Tech 27
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LINCOLN, Nebraska (AP) _ New coach, same old story for the
Nebraska Cornhuskers.
	   The Frank Solich era opened with No. 4 Nebraska beating
Louisiana Tech 56-27 in the Eddie Robinson Classic on Saturday,
although the Bulldogs made a record-setting impression in defeat.
	   Wide receiver Troy Edwards broke the collegiate record for
receiving yards by catching 21 passes for 405 yards and three
touchdowns. Quarterback Tim Rattay rocked the Huskers by completing
46-of-68 passes for 590 yards _ all record numbers against
Nebraska. Edwards had TD catches of 94, 80 and 52 yards in the
second half.
	   The previous all-divisions record for receiving yards was 370
yards.
	   Nebraska set no records in its first game in 26 seasons without
Tom Osborne as coach, but Bobby Newcombe made an impressive debut
at quarterback. He ran for two touchdowns and passed for one as the
Huskers scored TDs on all five first-half possessions in taking a
35-6 lead.
	   Newcombe finished 9-of-10 for 168 yards and carried 12 times for
12 yards. The teams combined for 1,031 yards, with Louisiana Tech
outgaining Nebraska 569-462.
 &UR; Colorado State 23, Michigan State 16 &QC; 
	   In East Lansing, Michigan, Kevin McDougal's 32-yard touchdown
run early in the fourth quarter gave No. 15 Colorado State its
first lead and the Rams held on for a 23-16 victory over No. 23
Michigan State in the Black Coaches Association Classic on
Saturday.
	   The Rams, who once trailed 16-0, increased their winning streak
to 10 games. Michigan State has lost 10 of its last 12 against
ranked opponents and is 7-34 in such games since 1988.
	   McDougal, one of two 1,000-yard rushers in the Rams' backfield,
completed the comeback with a burst off tackle with 11:29 left in
the fourth quarter. Ryan Eslinger, making his first start at
quarterback, was 3-of-3 for 44 yards in the go-ahead drive.
	   Eslinger, a senior who had attempted just 27 passes before this
season, was 13-of-26 for 205 yards and one touchdown with one
interception.
	   Bill Burke, making his first start at quarterback for Michigan
State, was 11-of-21 for 73 yards with one touchdown and one
interception. Freshman Ryan Van Dyke was at quarterback for the
Spartans' final series.
	   Colorado State, which led the nation in turnover margin last
year with a plus-27, forced two Spartans fumbles in the fourth
quarter to protect the lead.

 &UR; Eds: Adds late games, doubleheader. No pick up. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ Rookie Brian Barber held Baltimore hitless
until Cal Ripken doubled with two outs in the seventh inning, and
the Kansas City Royals sent the Orioles to their sixth straight
loss.
	   Pitching in only his 13th major league game, Barber (2-1)
allowed only two walks before Ripken doubled into the left-field
corner.
	   Barber then struck out B.J. Surhoff, but was lifted after giving
up a leadoff single to Chris Hoiles in the eighth.
	   Jeff Montgomery got the last out for his 30th save. The Royals
won for eighth time in 10 games.
	   The loss dropped the sinking Orioles into fourth place in the AL
East and left them 11 games behind Boston in the wild-card chase.
	   Mike Mussina (12-8), working on three days' rest for the first
time this season, gave up two runs and six hits in six innings.
 &UR; Devil Rays 10, Tigers 6, 1st game &QC; 
 &UR; Tigers 8, Devil Rays 2, 2nd game &QC; 
	   In Detroit, rookie Juan Encarnacion hit a three-run homer and
the Detroit Tigers beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays to gain a split of
their doubleheader.
	   In the first game, Mike Kelly hit two homers and Bobby Smith
went 4-for-5 with four RBIs for the Devil Rays.
	   Encarnacion, recalled Aug. 17 from Triple-A Toledo, had an
11-game hitting streak stopped in the opener. He quickly made up
for that in the second game, going 2-for-4.
	   Encarnacion doubled and scored in the fourth before hitting his
second homer for a 7-2 lead in the fifth. In 13 games, he's batting
.367 (18-for-49).
	   Tony Clark homered in both games for Detroit. Rookie Frank
Catalanotto also homered in the second game as the Tigers won for
just the sixth time in their last 26.
	   Rookie Seth Greisinger (4-7) won his third straight start. Bryan
Rekar (1-7) lost his fifth straight decision.
	   In the first game, Kelly hit a three-run homer and Smith added a
two-run triple in a six-run sixth. Knuckleballer Dennis Springer
(3-11) won for the first time since May 30.
	   Justin Thompson (10-12) lost his third straight start and was
rocked for seven runs on 13 hits in 5 2-3 innings.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ A Cuban commercial airplane burst into
flames during takeoff and slammed into a soccer field Saturday high
in the Andes mountains, killing at least 78 people, including nine
people on the ground, authorities said. At least fifteen people
survived the crash.
	   The Russian-made Tupolev-154 aircraft owned by Cubana de
Aviacion clipped the top of an auto mechanic's shop beyond the end
of the runway at Quito's international airport, witnesses said. The
nose and front part of the plane disintegrated in the crash.
	   The jetliner barely missed a heavily traveled avenue at the end
of the airport runway in a middle-class residential neighborhood
9,300 feet (2,850 meters) above sea level. It was en route first to
Guayaquil, on the Ecuadorean coast, and then on to Havana.
	   The plane had just started taking off when apparently at least
one engine failed and the aircraft crashed several hundred yards
beyond the end of the runway, Red Cross official Galo Leoro said
	   Gen. Osvaldo Dominguez, director of the Civil Aviation Office,
said there were 76 passengers and 14 crew members on board. He said
at least 19 foreigners were killed, including Cubans, Chileans,
Italians, Spaniards, one Argentine and one Jamaican.
	   Red Cross workers in red uniforms dug through the charred
wreckage for survivors, while firefighters sprayed water on the
smoking ruins to prevent further explosions.
	   Airport officials reported that at least 15 survivors were
pulled from the wreckage at Quito's Mariscal Sucre International
Airport.
	   ``There must be many dead, but there are also survivors. I
pulled one person out alive,'' said civil defense volunteer Hugo
Albuja.
	   Channel 10 television interviewed Cuban survivor Hernan Boada,
27, who suffered a broken ankle.
	   ``Before we heard the roar of the crash, we felt the plane rise
a bit and burst in flames. There were three explosions,'' Boada
said. ``I saw other people wrapped in flames jump from the plane.''
	   Dominguez confirmed that the death toll included nine people,
including several children, who were killed on the ground.
	   One woman said three of her children, who were playing near the
crash site, were missing.
	   President Jamil Mahuad went to the crash site and told reporters
he was asking investigators to complete studies as soon as possible
for building an airport outside the capital.
	   People have often complained about the noise and the possibility
of accidents at the current airport.
	   In 1984, an Ecuadorean cargo plane slammed into a neighborhood
beyond the end of the runway after failing to gain altitude,
killing 65 people.
	   And in 1996, a Brazilian FLY airlines plane carrying a Brazilian
soccer team, crashed into some airport walls after one of the jet
turbines flamed out and the crew aborted the takeoff. One player
was slightly injured.
	   The Cubana plane used the same takeoff route as the two other
planes, which both fell in roughly the same spot as the Cubana
plane.

Symbol of feudal past, Indonesian sultan casts himself as reformer

<TEXT>
	   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - In the tumult before the downfall
of President Suharto, the sultan of this history-steeped city
emerged a hero, at one point climbing on a car roof to cool the
zeal of a throng of unruly protesters.
	   Like a beloved king and his minions, Sri Sultan Hamengku Buwono
X and many local people share a rapport that eclipses the
limitations of his largely ceremonial post and the erosion of royal
power centuries ago.
	   Trappings of pedigree abound in his white-walled palace, a maze
of courtyards and pavilions where aging retainers in sarongs,
daggers tucked in cummerbunds, squat and smoke clove-scented
cigarettes.
	   In the Javanese dialect, the Sultan's name means ``World in his
Lap.'' Guests can call him ``Your Highness.''
	   But with reform sweeping Indonesia, the heir to a long line of
Javanese kings is molding himself as a voice for democracy and
sharp critic of the new government.
	   ``I'm the godfather of feudalism,'' the Sultan, a 52-year-old
ex-legislator, said in an interview in his quarters. ``But I don't
exercise feudalism in my daily life. I was born after Indonesia
became independent. I'm living in the new era.''
	   Tall and trim, the Sultan tapped cigarettes out of a pack in a
chamber crammed with Chinese porcelain and portraits of royal
luminaries. Well-coiffed, he wore a batik shirt.
	   A stuffed tiger, fangs bared, lurked in one corner as servants
shuffled on their knees, crab-like, in a traditional show of
reverence.
	   As the local Parliament's only candidate, the Sultan will soon
become governor of Indonesia's cultural capital. Students, pedicab
drivers and even transvestites in skirts and high heels have
marched in favor of his appointment.
	   There is speculation that he has loftier ambitions like his late
father, a vice president of Suharto and hero of the 1940s
independence war against Dutch colonizers.
	   The Sultan has harnessed a popular mood by campaigning for
regional autonomy and chastising Suharto's successor, President
B.J. Habibie, for sluggish reform.
	   ``The government, at present, has not been able to accommodate
the people's aspirations,'' he said. ``How is it possible to
implement reform if the people in the government have the old way
of thinking of the Suharto government?''
	   Habibie has pledged general elections next year, freed some
political prisoners and is grappling with economic turmoil. Yet, as
a Suharto protege, he has failed to shed cronyism charges.
	   The Sultan was widely credited with saving Yogyakarta from
deadly rioting that shook Jakarta and other cities in May,
dislodging the autocratic Suharto's decades-old grip on power.
	   One day before Suharto quit May 21, he steered a peaceful rally
of hundreds of thousands of protesters through the streets.
	   Some student activists chided him for joining reformists only in
Suharto's last days. As local chairman of the ruling Golkar party,
the Sultan is also wedded to the old order.
	   Married with five daughters, he studied law at Yogyakarta's
prestigious Gadjah Mada University and has attended conferences in
Australia and the United States.
	   A wealthy man, the Sultan owns a bank, a sugar mill and other
family businesses and heads the local chamber of commerce.
	   But he shuns the title of tycoon, at a time when the business
interests of Suharto, his children and associates are under
scrutiny amid charges of corruption.
	   ``I don't want to call myself a businessman,'' he said. ``All of
my businesses are taken care of by other people.''
	   Some say the aloof Suharto, an ex-army general, fell from favor
for acting like a haughty Javanese king. But the Sultan's faithful
say he belongs to a more modern breed.
	   ``It's like the United Kingdom,'' said Ibnu Santosa, a civil
servant. ``They have a queen, but it's still a democracy.''

	   In Denver, Sammy Sosa didn't homer but Colorado's Larry Walker
and Kurt Abbott did, and Bobby Jones pitched seven strong innings.
	   Sosa, who remained at 53 and one behind St. Louis' Mark McGwire
in their pursuit of Roger Maris' single-season homer record of 61,
went 1-for-4 with an infield single and two strikeouts.
	   Walker, Abbott and Dante Bichette, who went 4-for-5, helped the
Rockies build a 7-0 lead through four innings. Mark Clark (7-13)
took the loss.
	   Jones (7-7) allowed only three hits and one run in his
seven-inning stint, striking out a career-high eight.
	   Chicago's Glenallen Hill hit a two-run homer in the ninth.
 &UR; Astros 6, Pirates 3 &QC; 
	   In Houston, Bill Spiers hit an inside-the-park home run and Jose
Lima pitched 7 2-3 strong innings as Houston beat Pittsburgh.
	   Lima (14-6) allowed seven hits, struck out seven and didn't walk
a batter en route to his sixth straight victory. He helped the
Astros to their 20th victory in August, tying the club record for a
month set in May 1969.
	   Jay Powell got four outs for his sixth save.
	   Pittsburgh starter Jason Schmidt (11-10) lasted three batters
into the seventh inning. He allowed 12 hits and two walks and

	   SPRINGFIELD, Illinois (AP) _ Tammie Green holed out from 126
yards (115 meters) on her final hole and Michelle Redman shot a
career-low 9-under-par 63 Saturday to join a crowded top of the
leaderboard in the suspended second round of the dlrs 700,000 State
Farm Rail Classic.
	   Also tied for the lead at 11-under 133 were Martha Nause, who
shot a 66, Vickie Odegard, 68, and Cindy McCurdy, 66. Emilee Klein
and Janice Moodie were one shot back after shooting 67s.
	   First-round leader Dottie Pepper led a group of six at nine
under, including three players still on the course when play was
suspended due to darkness.
	   Rain on Friday and fog early Saturday delayed completion of the
second round at the 6,403-yard (5850-meter) Rail Golf Course.
Although 33 players were still on the course and would complete
their round Sunday morning, officials projected the 36-hole cut at
an LPGA record-tying low of three under par.
	   By missing the cut, former Rail champion Rosie Jones was
eliminated as a candidate for the 10th and final automatic berth on
the U.S. team that will meet a European squad in the Solheim Cup at
Muirfield Village G.C. in Ohio, Sept. 18-20.
	   Green, who had a 67 Saturday, and Hall of Famer Betsy King are
locked into the ninth and 10th spots. U.S. captain Judy Rankin will
make her two optional choices Sunday evening from a group that
includes Jones, Sherri Steinhauer, Michelle McGann and Barba Mucha.
	   Once also a candidate, Nancy Lopez missed the cut with a
second-round 70 that left her at 143. She appeared out of
contention despite a gritty performance with a back so sore her
caddy had to tee up her ball, repair her ball marks, and mark her
ball on the green.
	   Already on the Solheim squad, Pepper followed her opening 63
with an even par 72. She kept alive her chances of topping rookie
sensation Se Ri Pak of Korea for the dlrs 100,000 first prize in
the Mercury LPGA series which is based on points won in seven
televised events and concludes with this tournament.
	   At two under following the first round, Pak appeared briefly on
the leaderboard Saturday when she had a 6-under 30 on the front
nine, including birdies on the first four holes. She fell back with
a double bogey on No. 10 after hooking her tee shot out of bounds.
	   Green closed out Saturday's round in dramatic fashion by holing
an 8-iron from the fairway on No. 9, her 18th hole of the day.

Approaching typhoon floods northeastern Japan

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Heavy rains brought on by an approaching typhoon
sent waters gushing from streams in northeastern Japan Sunday,
engulfing a farmer working in a rice paddy, flooding more homes and
halting trains.
	   The 58-year-old woman was still missing after a bulging river
swallowed her in Iwate Prefecture (state), 460 kilometers (290
miles) north of Tokyo, police said.
	   At least 13 people have died and 33 people injured by the
downpour caused by Typhoon Rex that began Thursday. Among the dead
were five people who were buried in a mudslide in Fukushima
Prefecture, 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Tokyo, they
said.
	   That death toll does not include a 12-year-old boy who drowned
while playing in a flooded river on the northernmost island of
Hokkaido on Saturday.
	   Police said casualties and damage had spread to at least 22
prefectures (states), as of Sunday morning.
	   Rescue workers digging in mud have been unable to find the three
people who were swept downstream after a river burst Thursday in
Tochigi, 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of Tokyo, they said.
	   More than 9,100 homes have been flooded, destroyed or partly
destroyed, and the number of mudslides climbed Sunday to 623 from
575 Saturday, police said.
	   In rural areas north of Tokyo, about 300 milk cows were whisked
across the prefectural (state) border by a swelling river, the
Mainichi newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Rains were likely to continue for the next two or three days
because Typhoon Rex, still out in the Pacific Ocean, was traveling
northward so slowly, it has barely budged over the last couple of
days.
	   The Central Meteorogical Agency said Rex, packing winds of up to
126 kph (80 mph), still lay about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles)
south of Tokyo, as of Sunday morning. It could near the Japanese
eastern coast by Monday night, the agency said.
	   Heavy rain and flood warnings were issued Sunday throughout
regions in northeastern Japan, including Tokyo and Gunma, Ibaraki,
Tochigi and Saitama prefectures.
	   Rainfall was expected to hit as high as 60 millimeters (2.5
inches) per hour in some areas, the agency said.
	   Nationwide TV news showed cars swimming through currents
swerving through residential streets.
	   Bullet trains and several other lines throughout northern Japan
and areas near Tokyo were disrupted, with stops or slow-downs, a
railway spokesman said.
