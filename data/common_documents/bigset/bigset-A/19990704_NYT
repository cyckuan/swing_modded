BACK SPASMS PUT OLSON ON DISABLED LIST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Embattled reliever  &UR; Gregg Olson was placed on the
disabled list before Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's sore lower back, the result of spasms two days earlier,
and slight lingering pain in his elbow, made the move a necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of everything,'' Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter
said of Olson's ailments. ``The big thing was the 10 days we had
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Olson last pitched on June 22, his move was retroactive
10 days. He will be eligible to be activated July 8. However,
because of the three-day break for the All-Star Game July 12-14,
the club may decide to give Olson additional time to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trainers told me there was a better than average chance
that I could have more spasms,'' Olson said. ``Once I heard that, I
agreed to the move. I thought it was a one-time thing, but they
said it could come back because the spasms were protecting
something else that could be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed reliever  &UR; Bobby Chouinard, recalled from Triple-A
Tucson for the third time this season, replaced Olson on the active
roster. He stepped onto the field during the third inning after
flying in from Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard, whose 4.06 ERA is the ninth-best mark in the Pacific
Coast League, pitched two scoreless innings on Saturday. &QL; 
Not close &QL; 
Right-handed pitcher  &UR; Casey Daigle, the Diamondbacks' second
overall pick in last month's draft, remains unsigned, and prospects
for closing the gap between what he wants as a signing bonus and
what the club is offering remain wide.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, unbeknownst to club officials, Daigle
retained  &UR; Scott Boras as an ``adviser,'' a slick term used by high
school players seeking an agent's help in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen minutes before the draft he decided he needed an
adviser,'' said General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Daigle was 11-2 with a 1.04 ERA and had 97 strikeouts in 69
innings at Sulpher High School in Louisiana. The club is offering
just over $1 million. Daigle, who has a full-scholarship offer to
pitch at Tulane University, is seeking more than $1.5 million, one
major league source said. &QL; 
Etc. &QL; 
For the second consecutive game,  &UR; Travis Lee gave way to  &UR; Greg
Colbrunn as the starting first baseman. With right-handed starters
due to pitch against Arizona the next five games, Lee will return
to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are now 16-12 against left-handed starters and
28-25 against right-handers. They are 8-9 in day games and 36-28 in
night games.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis second baseman  &UR; Joe McEwing extended his hitting
streak to 24 games, the longest ever by a Cardinals rookie.
 &UR; Lou Brock had a 26-game streak in 1971. &QL;

LA RUSSA GIVES HINTS HE MAY LEAVE CARDINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the game's most respected managers may be on his way out
in what might be the best baseball city in the country.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Manager  &UR; Tony La Russa, who entered the weekend series
tied for 12th on the all-time wins list with 1,602, is leaving a
trail of clues as to his future with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa, a three-time Manager of the Year during his time in
the American League, has a standing offer to sign a contract
extension with the club that will keep him as manager for at least
another two years.
</P>
<P>
   He refuses to sign it now, preferring to wait until after the
season to resume such talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I'd let them know after the season,'' said La
Russa, who has guided Oakland, the White Sox and St. Louis to the
postseason. ``The season is about the players, not the manager or
coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   La Russa entered the weekend series against the Diamondbacks
with a 282-282 record since taking over the Cardinals. Even though
he guided them to their lone playoff appearance in 1996 in the past
12 seasons, the locals never have taken a great liking to him.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, three locals have spent a good portion of their
time taking shots at La Russa.  &UR; Ozzie Smith, a part-time television
analyst for home Cardinals games, former St. Louis Manager  &UR; Whitey
Herzog and former center fielder  &UR; Andy Van Slyke have been vocal
opponents of La Russa.
</P>
<P>
   All three are held in high esteem in the St. Louis area, and
their words carry a lot of weight. So when La Russa said a few
weeks ago that he has ``powerful enemies'' around St. Louis, he's
not imagining things.
</P>
<P>
   By not signing his extension and putting an end to the talk, it
seems as if La Russa very well might leave after this season. A few
spots have been mentioned as possible destinations for La Russa
next season.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay, La Russa's childhood home, has been mentioned, but it
seems virtually impossible to believe he would go to an
organization that seems nowhere close to competing for a title.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's north side is a possibility, especially if the Cubs
stumble in the second half and fire Manager  &UR; Jim Riggleman. Don't
forget, La Russa managed on the south side with the White Sox and
loves Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is Baltimore, where it seems impossible to
believe  &UR; Ray Miller will be back in 2000. Taking over the Orioles
job has its obstacles, notably an owner,  &UR; Peter Angelos, who loves
to meddle. However, La Russa's wife, Elaine, is from the Baltimore
area, and that might be enough to push the Orioles into serious
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   But deep down, La Russa always has been an American League man.
He staunchly defended it during his tenure in the AL. Either way,
don't be surprised if La Russa bolts from St. Louis. The signs all
point to it. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
Who are the four active major league players who made their debuts
during the 1970s? &QL; 
MVP? He has a strong case &QL; 
Some people wonder just how much  &UR; Manny Ramirez really matters to
Cleveland's high-flying offense. Well, the answer may have been
provided recently when Ramirez was forced to miss six games because
of a bruised left index finger after being hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, already a lock for the playoffs, lost four of the
six games, batting only .232 and scoring 25 runs collectively
without their main man in the middle of the lineup. Ramirez missed
three other games earlier because of a suspension. Cleveland is 3-6
and averages 4.6 runs per game without Ramirez. Their collective
batting average with Ramirez is an extremely healthy .303, and they
average 6.9 runs per game. Now that's an MVP. &QL; 
Numbers game &QL; 
Sometimes, the smallest, seemingly insignificant things in the
world can bother a player. And it's up to a manager to try to
soothe a player, hoping to get the most out of him. Florida Manager
 &UR; John Boles recently came across such a situation.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Marlins shortstop  &UR; Alex Gonzalez, one of the most
talented young players in the game, always has wanted to wear
uniform No. 13, the same number worn by fellow Venezuelans such as
 &UR; Luis Aparicio (later in his career),  &UR; Dave Concepcion,  &UR; Omar
Vizquel and  &UR; Ozzie Guillen (by the way, all shortstops).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Boles wears No. 13. But Boles had no idea of
Gonzalez's aspirations for the number until a south Florida
reporter mentioned it to him. Boles quickly summoned Gonzalez into
his office and and offered to give him the shirt off his back.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who is wearing No. 11, politely declined and said that
he might take Boles up on the offer next year. Boles is thinking
about swapping numbers with Gonzalez during the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can have it whenever he wants it,'' said Boles, one of the
least assuming managers in the game. ``I'll even do the sewing
myself. Rip the name off it. He can have anything he wants as long
as he keeps playing like that. . . . He just has to wear my name on
(the jersey) for one game. Now batting second and playing shortstop
. . .  &UR; Alex
 &UR; Boles.'' &QL; 
Boo-hoo &QL; 
Texas outfielder  &UR; Juan Gonzalez, who has been American League MVP
two of the past three years, is feeling slighted by the fans in the
voting for the All-Star Game. Gonzalez, who is fifth among AL
outfielders, apparently will not travel to Boston for the game if
he is not a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is not fair,'' Gonza lez said. ``Players with great
seasons don't get to go, and players whose seasons aren't as good
get to go. I'd rather have the three days off to rest and get ready
for the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, truly a good guy, sometimes gets the worst advice from
people who have his ear. This seems to be another example of a
problem that has afflicted him throughout his career. &QL; 
More no-hit facts &QL; 
Before throwing his no-hitter against Arizona 10 days ago, St.
Louis right-hander  &UR; Jose Jimenez allowed five runs on 73 hits in
his previous 57 innings.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first Cardinals rookie to throw a no-hitter since
 &UR; Daffy Dean in 1934. Only two other Dominican-born pitchers had
thrown no-hitters:  &UR; Juan Marichal for San Francisco in 1963 and Los
Angeles'
 &UR; Ramon Martinez in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez's no-hitter was the first complete game thrown by a St.
Louis pitcher all season. In addition, the victory was the 1,600th
in La Russa's managerial career. The last 1-0 complete game
no-hitter occurred in 1977, when Cleveland's  &UR; Dennis Eckersley
accomplished the feat over the California Angels. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
Texas pitcher  &UR; Mike Morgan, who made his debut in 1978, was the
first of the active players to make his big league debut. The
following year,  &UR; Rickey Henderson broke in with Oakland,  &UR; Jesse
Orosco made his debut with the New York Mets and  &UR; Tim Raines played
in 19 games for Montreal. Four-decade players are rare. The last to
accomplish the feat was  &UR; Nolan Ryan. &QL; 
THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It must have been one heck of a ceremony: San Diego General
Manager  &UR; Kevin Towers presented former Padres pitcher  &UR; Kevin Brown,
who bolted town for the Dodgers' $105 million, with his National
League championship ring last week, handing him the box while Brown
was in the bullpen in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; This will probably, almost for sure, we can just
 &UR; about promise, be the last time you hear this tidbit: The Phillies,
in describing shortstop  &UR; Desi Relaford's recent wrist surgery sent
out an announcement that partly read it was ``definitely
potentially season-ending.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Mario Soto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; News the rest of the NL does not want to hear:  &UR; Tom
 &UR; Glavine and  &UR; Greg Maddux, who have combined for six Cy Young
Awards, were 6-3 with a 3.06 ERA during June, dispelling talk that
the two of them are through. The two were 7-9 with a 4.77 ERA the
first two months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Here's a silver lining all Cubs fans can cling to: Chicago
finished June in a swoon, going 10-17 in the month. The only other
losing month the Cubs have had in the past two seasons was June
last year, when they were 12-15 despite benefiting from  &UR; Sammy
Sosa's 20 home runs. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorado superstar  &UR; Larry Walker, who is batting .386, is
attempting to become the first player since Hall of Famer  &UR; Al
Simmons (1929-31) to hit at least .360 three consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay played its final games of the season in Boston,
meaning Devil Rays third baseman  &UR; Wade Boggs, who collected 2,098
of his 2,971 career hits (entering the weekend series) for the Red
Sox, may have made his final visit to Fenway Park as a player.
Boggs' status for 2000 is very much up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Since Philadelphia right fielder  &UR; Bobby Abreau was moved from
sixth in the lineup to third, he is batting just .222. Abreau, one
of the brightest up-and-coming players in the game, was hitting
.360 before the switch was made.
</P>
<P>
   Former Kansas City All-Star second baseman  &UR; Frank
 &UR; White, who was never ejected in 2,324 career games over 18 seasons,
was finally booted last Monday by umpire  &UR; Darryl Cousins, who
objected after White said, ``( &UR; Mike Sweeney) has busted his butt
running 90 feet. It's not too much to ask for you to bust your butt
to run 10 feet to get in position to make the call.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota can, after all, keep its 1999 payroll at $16.2
million, which ranks 29th of the 30 clubs. Twins owner  &UR; Carl
 &UR; Pohlad gave the go-ahead to GM  &UR; Terry Ryan to splurge and keep the
payroll at its current amount instead of the $11 million figure he
mandated during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, which easily has the best record in the majors, has
only had its everyday eight starters and designated hitter in the
starting lineup nine times this season.
</P>
<P>
   Houston submitted a formal bid to host the 2004 All-Star Game at
its new Enron Field, which will open next spring. The Astros may
have trouble hosting that year since either Arizona or Milwaukee,
whichever doesn't host the 2002 game, will probably get the nod in
2004. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appears that San Diego's  &UR; Bruce Bochy, who will manage the NL
All-Star team, is leaning toward taking  &UR; John Smoltz as his only
Atlanta pitcher. If Smoltz, who has been bothered by stiffness in
his elbow, cannot make it, then no Braves pitcher will make the
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's  &UR; Dwight Gooden, who has won just two of his past 16
starts, may be on his way out of the Indians' plans altogether.
Cleveland picked up pitcher  &UR; Tom Candiotti last week and may give
him Gooden's spot in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs third baseman  &UR; Gary Gaetti, who has pretty much
been banished to the bench and limited duty, may be considering
retirement, especially after not starting against a left-handed
starter Wednesday. Gaetti, who is batting .184, started at third
Saturday and got noticed, not for his 1-for-4 day at the plate but
instead for his work on the mound in the eighth inning as the Cubs'
seventh pitcher of the day in a 21-8 loss to the Phillies. He got
three outs but gave up a homer and triple.
</P>
<P>
   For any Dodgers fans out there thinking a trade will fix Los
Angeles' woes, take a look at their roster and there's really only
one player who has much trade value, first baseman  &UR; Eric Karros.
Problem is, he's the only Dodger who seems to care about winning.
The contracts of  &UR; Raul Mondesi,  &UR; Gary Sheffield,  &UR; Eric Young,
 &UR; Devon White,
 &UR; Kevin Brown and  &UR; Carlos Perez make them virtually untradable.
</P>
<P>
   Houston may be in the market to listen to serious offers for
pitcher  &UR; Sean Bergman, whom the Astros believe they can replace
with the heralded  &UR; Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   During off-season meetings, Philadelphia GM  &UR; Ed Wade plans to
bring up the alarming number of hitters who continue to expand the
arsenal of protective gear they wear at the plate. It's a subject
that has come up in many other front offices and should have the
backing from the majority of his peers. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandIndians are actually human; they allowed 10 runs in one
inning to KC.  &QL; 
2. NY Yankees &UR; Chuck Knoblauch, meet  &UR; Steve Sax. You two have a lot
in common.  &QL; 
3. BostonLike him or not, GM  &UR; Dan Duquette has delivered a winner
in Beantown.  &QL; 
4. AtlantaTwo blown saves to Montreal? Suddenly, the bullpen is
struggling.  &QL; 
5. CincinnatiBelieve it, SS  &UR; Barry Larkin may be playing better
than ever.  &QL; 
6. San FranciscoThe magic of  &UR; Dusty Baker is unleashed once again.
 &QL; 
7. Houston &UR; Jeff Bagwell passed  &UR; Cesar Cedeno for the club record in
doubles.  &QL; 
8. NY MetsSince the firing of three coaches, the Mets were 18-6
entering weekend.  &QL; 
9. TexasA tough June stretch that included 20 road games, and still
gained. &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. FloridaPlayed the 1,000th game in its history Wednesday, a rare
win.  &QL; 
29. MinnesotaPitcher  &UR; Brad Radke's groin is aching. Is there an
All-Star left here?  &QL; 
28. BaltimoreOh, what a difference a week _ and tougher opponents _
makes.  &QL; 
27. Tampa BayInfielders are complaining about the turf and sand
combo at Tropicana.  &QL; 
26. DetroitTigers suffered their major league-leading 10th shutout
last week.  &QL; 
25. Los AngelesThe 8-17 June was the third-worst month since
leaving Brooklyn.  &QL; 
24. MontrealSurprisingly, these Expos are playing spunky lately.  &QL; 
23. ColoradoRockies are trying their hand with a four-man rotation.
 &QL; 
22. AnaheimOF  &UR; Tim Salmon has started the slow climb back to the
lineup. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; San Diego Padres: The club with the longest winning streak since
1994 is on fire. The Padres had their 14-game winning streak
snapped Saturday and are at the .500 mark. Most amazing, the Padres
trailed in only six innings during the streak. They gained 9{ games
on first place during the push. Incredibly, San Diego had not won
more than two in a row before it ripped off the winning streak.
Just as important to the Padres, they won six in a row over the
hated Dodgers during a nine-day span. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Diamondbacks: After spending more than a month alone in first
place, Arizona fell from the top spot after being swept in
Cincinnati last week. The club's offense has been sputtering in the
worst way, managing only five runs in the sweep, including getting
no-hit and one-hit in a six-day span. The rotation remains solid
but has received little help from the stumbling offense. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Philadelphia Manager  &UR; Terry Francona, after Phillies center fielder
 &UR; Doug Glanville was not given a hit by the official scorer in
Pittsburgh after Glanville hit a sharp bouncer back to the pitcher
that hit off Pirates pitcher  &UR; Kris Benson's foot: ``That's an error
when a 100-pound pig jumps out of my ear.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Toronto's  &UR; Billy Koch hadn't relieved much before this season, but
once Blue Jays Manager  &UR; Jim Fregosi gave the right-hander a shot at
the end of May, he hasn't looked back, or bad, since. Koch, who
used to possess a 100-mph fastball, has seen it drop to somewhere
in the mid-90s since an arm injury. Koch has emerged as the
Toronto's most reliable reliever, closing out 10 saves in 12
chances. He entered the weekend series with a 1.52 ERA and had
struck out 26 batters in 29 innings. In short, Koch appears to be
here for good. &QL;

MERCURY TAKES HEART IN LOSS  
 MILLER EAGER DESPITE RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ In the ashes of a third consecutive loss,
franchise-low 27.4 percent shooting, a 2-5 road trip and a dip to
last in the WNBA Western Conference, the Mercury might have found
an identity Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   As impossible as it seems, a 56-47 loss to the expansion
Minnesota Lynx (5-4) might have been a more complete effort than
that in any of the Phoenix (3-7) victories.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mercury, 6{ games behind West leader Houston and 3{ out
of playoff position, returns to America West Arena for 14 of its
final 22 games still believing it can reach the postseason for a
third straight season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's time to go home and get that home crowd and hopefully
some home calls and everything else,'' Coach Cheryl Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be one thing (to be 3-7) if everybody in the league
had the type of schedule we had early on. But everybody else has to
come the same route we did in the middle and late in the season.
I'd rather take my hits early, right this ship and play our best
basketball down the stretch than to sit up there, play great and
fall apart at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   With even a tad better shooting _ Phoenix was 2-for-19 from
3-point range _ the Mercury would have completed its comeback from
a 34-20 deficit in the final 17:40 to hand the Lynx a fourth
straight home loss.
</P>
<P>
   But the first four times its lead was trimmed to three,
Minnesota had an answer: Andrea Lloyd-Curry driving layup when it
was 36-33; Tonya Edwards layup at 38-35; Edwards 14-footer at
42-39; and Lloyd-Curry layup at 44-41.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mercury kept coming, and off a Bridget Pettis free
throw at 58.4 seconds was within 50-47. This time there was a
defensive stop _ on a miss by Edwards _ and Jennifer Gillom
rebound. Phoenix raced down court as a nervous 9,560 at the Target
Center saw visions of Thursday's double-overtime loss to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than setting up the offense with 25 seconds left, Edna
Campbell popped a straight-away three-point miss that left her
1-for-14 overall and 0-for-6 on treys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have set something up,'' said Miller,
who had a 20-second and a full timeout remaining. ``But I'd bet
Reggie's house that she'd make that next one. I'd take that shot
any day in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury was without its second-leading scorer, Clarissa
Davis-Wrightsil, due to back spasms, but Gillom did heat up in the
second half to finish with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just shooting like (expletive),'' Campbell said.
``Shooting is pretty much a confidence thing. I don't think I'm
feeling it right now. I'm hesitating on my shot a lot. I get it and
then shoot, it's like an afterthought. When I catch it and shoot
and I'm confident about it, I can count it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you hope the numbers catch up with you,'' she said
of the crunch-time attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx were 6-for-6 on free throws after Campbell's miss, with
Michele Timms and 6-foot-8 Maria Stepanova not connecting on an
inbounds lob after the first pair to snuff the final Mercury hope.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mercury Brandy Reed was the scoring (14) and rebounding
(8) leader for Minnesota, which had its own shooting woes (33.3
percent) and was outboarded, 43-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it (the win) is real important,'' Lynx Coach Brian
Agler said. ``Later in August, we'll sit back and say it was very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury might say the same if, in another loss, it found the
character to keep fighting. &QL;

ROAD HAS BEEN LONG FOR U.S. STAR CHASTAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ This is where it all began for Brandi
Chastain, on the youth soccer fields in the south San Francisco Bay
area.
</P>
<P>
   On the Quaketts, her first team, at 8 years old. On the
Horizons, coached by her dad, Roger, in the early 1970s. Later, on
the Santa Clara University side, where she met her future husband,
Coach Jerry Smith.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems only fitting that Chastain should achieve a career
milestone in her own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. national team defender takes the field for today's
Women's World Cup semifinal match against Brazil, she will make her
100th international appearance. Only 10 American players have done
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure it will be quite a special day,'' Chastain said of
reaching the coveted mark in front of her family and friends just
up Interstate 101 at Stanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the journey to this point was anything but smooth for the
30-year-old San Jose native. After being selected ``Soccer
America's'' Freshman of the Year in 1986, Chastain suffered a torn
anterior cruciate ligament. Two years later, she joined the
national team, only to again undergo reconstructive knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain overcame the injuries, but more heartache was to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain rejoined the national team in time to play in the 1991
World Cup and thought she was on her way to earning a starting
berth. Then one day _ without warning, she says _ Coach Anson
Dorrance decided to drop her from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough time,'' Chastain said. ``The national team had
been so much a part of my life. Then, without any notice, it
suddenly wasn't there for me anymore. I was devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain played two seasons in Japan but longed to return to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   She kept in contact with new Coach Tony DiCicco. Finally, after
the 1995 World Cup, DiCicco invited Chastain to train for the '96
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one catch _ she wasn't going to play forward, the
position she had handled since her youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't care,'' Chastain said. ``I told them I just wanted to
be a part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   She has been a major part of it ever since. And now, 11
tumultuous years later, she is on the verge of her 100th cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say, it's quite an accomplishment for me,'' Chastain
said, with only a hint of irony in her voice, ``because of my
absence from the team and because it's a different time now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the younger players on this team, and I see them
getting the valuable playing time and experience that I never had
when I was younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm happy. It's been a great run.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain has had an interesting run this summer. She joked with
David Letterman on the ``Late Show'' and posed for a provocative
photo in ``Gear'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, she has assisted on two goals _ including a header
pass to Cindy Parlow. Chastain also notched her first goal of the
Cup in the quarterfinals against Germany, but only after she scored
an own-goal in the fifth minute of the match.
</P>
<P>
   But Chastain's value to the team is on defense, where she has
played left, right and central. She even had a few minutes at
defensive midfield against North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gives us so much versatility,'' DiCicco said. ``She's
playing well, but the truth is her best soccer is still ahead of
her in this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain's biggest test likely will come today, when she and her
teammates take on Brazil's Sissi, the tournament's leading scorer
with seven goals. Assistant coach Lauren Gregg knows Chastain will
be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandi is one of our most sophisticated players,'' Gregg said.
``She studies games, all games, and watches players intently. She
is very good both technically and tactically on defense, plus her
ability to attack out of the back makes her a dangerous player.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain said she is ``having a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just enjoy being on the field,'' she said. ``It's been
beautiful. I've enjoyed every minute of it.'' &QL;

REED STARTING TO FIND RHYTHM WITH LYNX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _  &UR; Brandy Reed said she knew through her agent that
she would not be among the Mercury's six protected players for the
WNBA expansion draft three months ago, so she is not surprised to
be with the Minnesota Lynx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't upset,'' Reed said. ``I was just sort of surprised.
I'm going to Minnesota, a different team, a different organization,
a different setting. It's still basketball, you still have to go
out there and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out I was (the first expansion pick), that was an
honor, respectful. I just appreciated that.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1 forward, Phoenix's third-round 1998 draft pick, was
the Lynx's leading scorer for the fourth time in a 56-47 win
Saturday. She also had a team-high eight rebounds in an athletic
performance that would have been familiar to Mercury fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just beginning to find my offensive rhythm, and that is
one of my strengths,'' said Reed, averaging 14.8 points and among
the top 15 in league scoring. ``I'm just trying to continue my
offensive game as much as I can and at the same time develop my
defensive skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed is doing enough on defense to satisfy Coach  &UR; Brian Agler,
who otherwise is starting all players from his Columbus Quest
championship ABL team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandy keeps getting better and better,'' Agler said of the
22-year-old. ``She has a world of potential and has a chance to be
a great player.'' &QL; 
More of Mapp &QL; 
The latest of still rare WNBA trades means that the Mercury will
play seven times against  &UR; Rhonda Mapp this season, including
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2 Mapp now is with the Houston Comets, who play the first
of four games against Phoenix on Friday. In one of her final games
for Charlotte on June 24, Mapp had nine points in the Sting's 88-72
rout of the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Because of injuries to  &UR; Monica Lamb (eye surgery) and  &UR; Tammy
 &UR; Jackson (knee) and the absence of  &UR; Natalia Zasulskaya because of
her mother's illness, the Comets needed a backup for center  &UR; Polina
 &UR; Tzekova. They gave up 6-7  &UR; Kara Wolters, on the injured list since
June 21 because of a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to go out and find an experienced player . . . who
could come in here and help us during this stretch right now,''
Comets Coach/General Manager  &UR; Van Chancellor told the ``Houston
Chronicle''. &QL;

CARBAJAL'S HEART, FIST HEAVY IN FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Michael Carbajal had more than just himself and the
resumption of his boxing career as motivation for a workmanlike
victory Friday night at the Tucson Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   He had a promise to keep.
</P>
<P>
   A memory to honor.
</P>
<P>
   His father-in-law, Billy Martinez, 61, died of cancer late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight was dedicated to him,'' Carbajal said of his
fourth-round technical knockout of an overmatched Oscar Calzada.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix fighter (48-4, 32 knockouts) returned to the Valley
late Thursday to be with his wife, Merci, Martinez's daughter. He
returned to Tucson at about 6 a.m. Friday. If the death in his
family was a distraction, it wasn't evident.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the ring as though he were stepping into an office.
He stopped Calzada (14-8-2) in the businesslike, efficient manner
that marked his career through the days when he was among the
world's best, regardless of weight. Those days are gone.
</P>
<P>
   In his comeback, Carbajal is a different fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as fast,'' Carbajal said as he compared himself to the
fighter he was in 1993 when he dominated the junior flyweight
(108-pound) division. ``But I'm as strong as I ever was. My punches
are more precise.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how the Carbajal of today would fare against the
fierce warrior who six years ago became the lightest fighter in
history ever to collect a $1 million purse, he replied, ``It would
be a draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever physical skill has been lost through time seems to have
been offset by an evident sense of maturity and self-assurance in
Carbajal, who turns 32 in September. During the two to three years
before his 18-month retirement, he was embroiled in problems
outside of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he had said the trouble was not a distraction. But in
retrospect, Carbajal concedes that it was.
</P>
<P>
   It is anybody's guess as to whether relative peace outside of
the ropes will result in a better fighter within them.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake to make too much of the victory against
Calzada, who has lost five of his past six fights. Nine years ago,
Carbajal stopped him within three rounds in the first of many
defenses of the International Boxing Federation's junior flyweight
title.
</P>
<P>
   In the rematch before a Tucson crowd of nearly 5,000, Carbajal
employed withering body shots to knock Calzada to his knees twice,
once in the second round and again in the third. A looping right
uppercut at 2:01 of the fourth finished it as Calzada absorbed the
blow and staggered across the ring like a kid trying to run across
a trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal took a few glancing blows from a game Calzada in the
second and again in the third. But he left the ring unmarked and
with a very predictable victory.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in his comeback doesn't figure to be so certain.
He has agreed to challenge Mexican Jorge Arce (20-2-1) for the
World Boxing Organization's 108-pound title on July 31 in Tijuana,
a card that will feature unbeaten super bantamweight Erik Morales.
</P>
<P>
   For Carbajal, the bout is dangerous. He will be fighting in
front of a rabid Mexican crowd. As the Mexican-American, the odds
will be stacked against him.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time he has been in that situation. He lost
two rematches by controversial split and majority decisions to
rival Humberto Gonzalez in front of Mexican-dominated crowds in Los
Angeles and Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   At Tijuana, his brother, trainer and manager, Danny Carbajal, is
expected to demand that at least one and perhaps two of the
ringside judges be from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Without that assurance written into the contract, Carbajal would
be foolish to take the fight. And even then, he would face a
daunting challenge, especially if Arce borrows Gonzalez's elusive
tactics and runs from Carbajal's undiminished power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to knock him out,'' said Carbajal, whose comeback
goal is to win a major title at a heavier weight, 112. ``I will
knock him out.''
</P>
<P>
   For a businessman in an unforgiving profession, there are no
other options. &QL;

LACK OF RAIN COULD MAKE FOR SPARSE QUAIL HUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ron Engel-Wilson cringes when he's asked for
predictions on this year's quail season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any predictions,'' said Engel-Wilson, the
Arizona Game and Fish Department's small game biologist. ``People
hold me to them. I get into too much trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he did it anyway _ conditionally.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this extremely dry year, he said, things don't look
too bright for Gambel and scaled quail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, hunters killed about 750,000 quail,'' he said.
``This coming season, it probably will be more like half a
million.''
</P>
<P>
   That means breeding season wasn't too successful. To make great
things happen, rain needs to fall late in the year, and more should
follow in February and March. That causes green plants to grow,
stimulating egg production in females that eat the plants.
</P>
<P>
   The rain also produces insects that chicks eat for important
protein.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Arizona got moisture in late spring, but it was too
little and too late in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   Mearns quail, which hold in tight coveys and are considered to
be trophies among hunters with pointing dogs, are different.
</P>
<P>
   These birds, which dwell only in the southeastern part of the
state, rely on summer monsoon rain to spur their reproduction.
That's why the Mearns season opens much later than that for Gambel
or scaled quail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good monsoon rain in the southeast would really help the
Mearns,'' Engel-Wilson said. ``It also would be of some help to
Gambel and scaled quail.''
</P>
<P>
   He said last year was a great season for Mearns quail. More than
15,000 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we're going to have a good season, we must have the
summer rain,'' Engel-Wilson said. &QL; 
Ferrets booming &QL; 
The endangered black-footed fer ret, one of the rarest mammals in
the world, was reintroduced to Arizona in 1996. And it appears the
animals have every intention of making it this time.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of 17 gave birth to 63 kits this year at the
reintroduction site in Aubrey Valley near Seligman, in the
northwestern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the ferret breeding program at the Phoenix Zoo,
100 ferrets were born in Arizona this spring.
</P>
<P>
   That's an amazing number, a success rate of 93 percent compared
with 63 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ferrets will be released into the Aubrey Valley
site. As many as 30 will be held for breeding next year. Arizona
will receive 20 additional kits from the national captive breeding
program later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Adult females have been released from their breeding boxes and
have taken their kits into underground burrows, where temperatures
are much more suitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrets prey primarily on prairie dogs at night.
</P>
<P>
   They have been reintroduced in Wyoming, Montana and South
Dakota. There are plans for reintroductions in Colorado and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish still is looking for volunteers for spotlighting
surveys of the ferrets through September. Those interested can call
biologist Richard Winstead at (520) 692-7700. &QL; 
Bears getting worse &QL; 
Dry conditions are causing more contact by wild animals with
humans. Bears are the biggest problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wildfires, most of them small, are increasing the problem by
driving wildlife away from their territory.
</P>
<P>
   Game and Fish officials are extremely concerned because some
people put out food and water for the animals or leave their trash
unprotected. That invites trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents and visitors at Portal in southeastern Arizona at
the foot of the Chiricahua Mountains had been feeding wildlife
intentionally. Wildlife officers were forced to kill a black bear
because it had lost all fear of humans.
</P>
<P>
   A bear in the Globe area killed a domestic goat. When wildlife
officers approached it, the bear showed aggression and was killed.
</P>
<P>
   A mountain lion in the Sierra Vista area had been killing
chickens and was found sitting on the front porch of residence.
</P>
<P>
   During Memorial Day weekend, a young bear had to be killed after
it became addicted to trash left out along Tonto Creek. &QL;

HASEGAWA GETS SECOND SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Shigetoshi Hasegawa will make his first major-league
start since Sept. 27, 1997, when he takes Ken Hill's spot against
the Seattle Mariners on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa was a starter in Japan for six years before coming to
the U.S. to pitch for the Angels in 1997, but he made only seven
starts before the Angels put him in the bullpen. But it hasn't been
so long that he has forgotten what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first pitcher, right?'' Hasegawa joked.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa struggled as a starter with the Angels, going 0-3 with
a 6.62 ERA in those seven starts. But he said he's learned a lot
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed more control,'' he said. ``Now I think I have a
little better control, a good fastball and changeup. Starting and
relieving is the same _ just don't think too much. Take it pitch by
pitch, hitter by hitter. The team situation is a little tough now
with Ken Hill and Tim Belcher hurt. I want to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins said he picked Hasegawa over Mark
Petkovsek and Scott Schoeneweis because of Hasegawa's success
against the Mariners in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Going into this season, Hasegawa had a 1.10 ERA vs. Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn ready: Jarrod Washburn joined the Angels on Saturday
and might start Tuesday's game against Seattle if he isn't called
out of the bullpen before then.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a tough season for Washburn, considering he spent more
than half of last year in the big leagues with the Angels. This
year, he's been in the minors all year and spent seven weeks on the
disabled list with a muscle strain on his right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got beat out in spring training _ I understand that,'' said
Washburn, who was 4-2 last year with the Angels but is 0-4 with
Triple-A Edmonton this year. ``But the injury part was killing me.
Being on the DL drove me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie steps up: Bret Hemphill got his first career major-league
start Saturday, serving as Chuck Finley's catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up watching him pitch and now I'm going to catch him,''
Hemphill, who was born in Lakewood and attended Cal State
Fullerton, said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   If Hemphill had any nerves going into the game, they weren't
calmed by bullpen catcher Mick Billmeyer, who told Hemphill
jokingly, ``I don't want to put any pressure on you, but we're all
counting on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemphill tied a major-league record earlier in the week when he
got hits from both sides of the plate in his first two major-league
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleball rules: Catcher Steve Decker said he thinks there
should be a new scoring rule in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there's a knuckleball pitcher and the ball gets by
the catcher, it should be ruled a wild pitch,'' Decker said.
</P>
<P>
   Decker has a good case. He was charged with two passed balls in
Friday's game trying to catch knuckleballer Steve Sparks. On one of
them, Decker held his glove up but at the last moment the ball
moved and hit him square in the forehead.

RANGERS COLLAPSE AFTER 7-RUN LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers didn't win the American League
West without reinforcements after the July 31 trading deadline a
year ago. They might again require reinforcements for the final two
months if seven-run leads disappear into The Ballpark in
Arlington's humid air as happened last night in a 13-12 loss to the
Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle right-hander Freddy Garcia gift-wrapped and presented
the Rangers an eight-game advantage in the AL West. The Rangers,
though, turned their noses and matched their club record by
surrendering a seven-run lead in defeat while the Mariners are now
only six games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners third baseman Russ Davis delivered the crushing blow
with his three-run, seventh-inning homer off right-hander Tim
Crabtree (4-1). Thus, the Rangers wasted four runs batted in by
right fielder Juan Gonzalez, who matched a major-league record with
three sacrifice flies, and another three RBI from designated hitter
Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is guaranteed, but if you get a chance to put some
space between you and a good team like that over there, you want to
take advantage of that,'' Rangers shortstop Royce Clayton said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-hander Aaron Sele went to the mound for his fifth
inning of work as the beneficiary of a 9-2 lead that soon would
vanish. Mariners center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. delivered a
three-run double, and first baseman David Segui supplied a one-out
sacrifice fly ball that left the visitors trailing by three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates said of Sele's not being able to
protect the seven-run lead: ``I'll take Sele with a seven-run lead
most nights. Tonight was one of those nights we just didn't do a
good job pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were still going to win that ballgame. Even when
we fell behind 12-9. We got the tying run on base in the ninth. We
just weren't able to finish it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Danny Patterson inherited what little remained of
the Rangers' once-imposing advantage, but it disappeared before the
completion of the sixth inning. Davis reached after being hit by
one of Patterson's deliveries, and left fielder Brian Hunter and
second baseman David Bell produced consecutive one-out triples.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter scored on his triple after an errant throw by second
baseman Mark McLemore skipped into the Mariners' third-base dugout,
and Bell scored the game-tying run on Alex Rodriguez's two-out,
sixth-inning single off Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   All this occurred after the Rangers pounded Garcia for 3 2/3
innings. The Mariners' rookie-of-the-year candidate surrendered
nine runs on seven hits _ which included McLemore's solo home run
on his second pitch of the game _ and issued five walks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' final opportunity for redemption fell into the
hands of Palmeiro after Gonzalez's two-out, ninth-inning single
scored left fielder Rusty Greer and pulled the Rangers within a
run.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners closer Jose Mesa, though, induced a game-ending fly
ball from Palmeiro that Griffey caught on the warning track and a
made a winner of right-hander Jose Paniagua (6-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow is a big game,'' Clayton said of tonight's game.
``We'd hate to look back and say we had a chance to put them in a
position where they had to make a huge climb and didn't. Tomorrow
is another two-game swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin would prefer to avoid
trading young talent this season by building a commanding advantage
in the West before the July 31 trade deadline. Thus, the Rangers
would not need to part with a prospect such as Fernando Tatis to
acquire veterans such as right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, Clayton and
third baseman Todd Zeile as the case July 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven days remain until the July 31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Rangers put the West to rest or require reinforcements?

<P>
   LONDON _ Should I divorce my wife?
</P>
<P>
   This is a reasonable question that men across the world are
asking themselves after watching or reading about newly unattached
Andre Agassi playing a game called tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Not to give Brooke Shields a bad rap. They remain great and good
friends, says Agassi, and probably have joint custody of the People
magazine subscription. Nevertheless, since their April uncoupling,
Agassi has supercharged up the pike like an express train. Call him
the Las Vegas Cannonball. Agassi's post-parting record _ his split
parade _ is 20-2, including Hong Kong and French Open titles and a
13-match winning streak that goes on the line Sunday at the Big W
against his acquaintance and rival of 18 years, Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   New bachelor Agassi showed he'll have no problems with domestic
duties after whipping up a hot and spicy recipe in a Wimbledon
barbecue pit called Court 1. Rafter, the net-marauding Aussie who
has won the last two US Opens, was tough, all right. But Agassi,
marauding through a 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 win, was tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick could nudge and coax only two break points all Saturday
afternoon against Agassi's serve, which has grown muscle and eyes
over the recent weeks. ``Everything he does is terrific,'' Rafter
says, ``but the way his serve has improved really impressed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi hasn't lost serve in a week, 56 consecutive holds since
somebody named Albert Martin broke through by accident. Those
scarce breakers that Rafter glimpsed happened to be set points at
4-5, 15-40, that could have changed everything. But Agassi gave
those vitals the brushoff as though they were aluminum siding
salesmen hoping to remodel one of his palaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first real opening,'' says Rafter, ``but I didn't
realize then it would be my last. Andre never let me in. I couldn't
find any inroads.''
</P>
<P>
   So Patrick was on the outroad to Boston for the Australia-US
Davis Cup showdown at Longwood, inwardly rejoicing that Agassi
won't be there, too.
</P>
<P>
   One shot told you how Agassi was reveling. Set point in the
tiebreaker, Rafter serving at 5-6. Agassi caromed a double-barreled
backhand return past Rafter so quickly that the Aussie had taken
only a step or two on his route to the net. He flicked the ball
like a half-volley, so early that you wondered if he had allowed it
to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I saw that ball _ the balls all afternoon _ really
well,'' enthuses Agassi. The set ended, and so did Rafter, although
they played the third required by rules.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to Sunday afternoon, and the duel at 26-or-so
paces on a patch of lawn that is starting to look as barren as
Agassi's head. As ragged as King Pete's chances to keep his crown
if both men continue at their present pace.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, just about gonzo in Paris, lagging behind the 1998 champ
Carlos Moya by a set and 4-1 in the fourth round, suddenly found
the combination that lifted him beyond previous glories and put him
on another planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work, focus, passion came together,'' says the restored
one, his brown button eyes gleaming thankfully. ``I found there's
much more left in me _ for several years. Who would have believed
it a month ago? I had recovered from the terrible fall to 142 in
the rankings. I was starting to play big tennis again, but I wasn't
winning big matches _ until Paris. Until Moya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Pete again. It's great. This is all the way from
Northridge (Calif.) to Centre Court,'' he laughs at the memory of
two little boys belting balls at each other on a concrete slab in
1981, a 12-and-under tournament. ``I was 11; Pete was 10, about a
foot shorter than me. He's grown a little since. He had a
two-handed backhand then, and he beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras nods, ``If that's the way Andre says it was, fine. I
don't remember, but we've been playing each other ever since. He's
the best returner in the business, maybe the best ever. Andre is
one guy who takes my serve away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi recalls, ``Our first meeting as pros (1989) I beat him
one-and-one in Rome (it was 6-2, 6-1), and he really sucked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras's memory coincides: ``I did suck. I was just struggling
in Europe to break even and didn't know what I was doing on clay.''
</P>
<P>
   That launched a feud that was supposed to be the greatest since
the Montagues and the Capulets. But after Sampras beat Agassi in
four for the US Open title of 1995, you began to wonder if Pete
weren't the apothecary, mixing a potion fatal to Andre's career.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras feels, ``That seemed to take the steam out of him and
the rivalry. Andre started to go off his game. It was too bad
because we've brought out the best in each other. But I never gave
up on him. I knew he'd be back. Andre is too good. No, we're not
close, but we're not unfriendly. We respect each other.''
</P>
<P>
   They made beautiful tennis together, as well as amusing TV
commercials. ``A lot of fun, the tennis and the commercials,''
Sampras says. And now they're back together again, like old lovers
who've decided to make up and give it another try.
</P>
<P>
   Linked once more, they go at each other in racket-to-racket
combat for the 24th time (13-10, Sampras), the sixth in a major
(3-2, Sampras). But never before in a Wimbledon final. Never for
the most cherished prize of them all on this stage of tennis
stages. And never as Yankee Doodle Dandies on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't Northridge, but the occasion still calls for fireworks.
They are just the guys to provide sky rockets, cherry bombs, and
Roman candles every time they swing. Look out, Pete. The usurper
also brings dynamite.

STEVENSON'S WIMBLEDON QUEST ENDS

 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The tabloid fairy tale had a climax only Fleet Street
could love: The heroine got slaughtered in the end.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even her emphatic undoing Saturday in the Wimbledon women's
semifinals by third-seeded Lindsay Davenport _ a 6-1, 6-1
bludgeoning that consumed all of 48 minutes _ could not overshadow
the fact that Alexandra Stevenson was an enchanting, if not
enchanted, princess.
</P>
<P>
   Another rags-to-riches story was ruined when Wimbledon grande
dame Steffi Graf, the No. 2 seed, rallied past unseeded 17-year-old
Mirjana Lucic, 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, 6-3, in the other semi. Sunday Graf
will go for All England Club crown No. 8 against Davenport, who has
never won here but has already reached a peak _ No. 1 in the world
rankings, courtesy of her visit to the final and former top woman
Martina Hingis's first-round loss here.
</P>
<P>
   But the most compelling figure of the day, and perhaps the
tournament, was Stevenson, who was a loser only technically.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old Californian became the first female qualifier
ever to make the semis and never lost her poise, affability, or
ebullience despite the sensationalistic off-court subplot in which
she was basically an innocent bystander.
</P>
<P>
   The latest bombshell that landed in her midst occurred Friday
when Julius Erving confirmed a report he initially denied:
Stevenson is the Basketball Hall of Famer's illegitimate daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that at her postmatch press conference Saturday,
Stevenson answered, ``No comment.'' But before she did, she looked
out into the audience at her mother, former Boston Channel 7
reporter Samantha Stevenson, who shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, more recently a freelancer for the Boston Globe and
New York Times, among other papers, was asked the same question.
The journalist offered the same response she has right along: ``No
comment.'' Asked when she intends to reveal Alexandra's paternity,
her mother said, ``Hopefully never.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra was pressed as to when she would address the situation
involving her father and said, ``I don't know. When I feel ready,
maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, wasn't the lone potential distraction with
which she dealt. Samantha started a firestorm last week when, in a
published interview, she alleged racism and lesbianism among the
players.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra acknowledged that she had been the target of a racial
epithet at a junior tournament last year but said it was no longer
relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the small matter of compensation. Stevenson came
here as an amateur but declared after her victory over 11th seed
Julie Halard-Decugis last Saturday that she would forgo a tennis
scholarship to UCLA and was turning pro immediately. The WTA, which
runs the women's circuit, initially refused to honor the
declaration, saying a player couldn't change status mid-tournament.
Samantha threatened a lawsuit, and Wimbledon officials overruled
the WTA, saying that a player is considered professional as long as
she doesn't request beforehand to preserve her amateur status.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson had not done so, and as a result of her efforts here,
she'll pocket some $160,000, which she indicated she might use on a
couple of pricey items _ a house or, at the very least, a washer
and dryer, so her mother will stop complaining about using the
communal facilities in the basement of their apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   But even for that jackpot, was it worth the aggravation?
Stevenson made it seem as if there were no aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't read the newspapers,'' she said. ``I just focus on my
tennis and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She's also diverted herself by playing soccer with the two young
sons of the people who run the bed and breakfast where she and her
mother are staying.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, you'd never know she had a thing on her mind other
than savoring each moment. Throughout, she has been a portrait of
effervescence, smiling as if that were her permanent expression,
curtsying to the applauding crowd after each match, playing this
occasion to the hilt as if she were still under the spotlight in
the school productions of ``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``Grease,'' and
``The Pajama Game'' in which she's appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Her stay on the main stage, Centre Court, was brief; Davenport
won the first 11 games and never looked back. ``I didn't feel
nervous out there,'' said Stevenson. ``I was rushing everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Davenport expressed admiration and sympathy for her
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the nicest girl,'' said Davenport. ``I mean, she's only
18. She's obviously enjoying the whole Wimbledon experience, played
great, and you know, unfortunately, all this stuff has kind of come
on her because of her mom, and you can't help but feel sorry for
her. I just don't think we appreciate (Samantha) commenting on our
way of life (concerning racism).''
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson, as always, stood by her mother: ``Whatever comments
my mom made, she's my mother and I think she is right, and it
hasn't clouded anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Advised of Davenport's comments, Samantha Stevenson issued her
stock reply: ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Davenport shouldn't be shunted to the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get to the Wimbledon final, it just means so much to me,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's old hat to Graf, 30, who is relishing the occasion
nonetheless. After her stunning upset of Hingis in the Paris final,
she announced that the win was her French Open farewell, but even
if she claims her 23d Grand Slam title Sunday, she isn't prepared
to make the same commitment about Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Graf, who later withdrew from the mixed
doubles with John McEnroe, citing a strained thigh. ``I'm looking
forward to playing tomorrow, and everything else, there's some
other time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for Stevenson, who lasted so long here because she
didn't think about everything else.

RED SOX DON'T HAVE THEIR THINKING CAPS ON 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WHITE SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ For those who made the mistake of tuning in to Fox
Saturday afternoon, it must have seemed like Rupert Murdoch was
scraping the bottom of the barrel for a summer replacement series.
</P>
<P>
   The gray uniforms said ``Boston,'' but there was no sign of
Nomar and the other guys looked more like actors than anyone who
has been performing for the Red Sox this season.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no studio-ordained sitcom, just a particularly
inglorious effort by the Red Sox, who played in an unhappy daze in
a 11-2 loss to the White Sox before 18,028 sweating patrons at
Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   The opening credits _ minus Garciaparra, who sat out with a
strained groin _ were still rolling when the Sox came unhinged in a
two-inning sequence that couldn't be duplicated if they tried. And
while Red Sox rookie Brian Rose may have felt a victim of
circumstance as Chicago scored three runs in each of the first two
innings, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, mincing no words, threw the
responsibility for this debacle squarely in the kid's lap.
</P>
<P>
   And it had nothing to do with Rose's pitching, even though his
line read: 4 IP, 12 H, 9 R, 9 ER.
</P>
<P>
   ``He embarrassed himself not covering first base,'' Kerrigan
said of Rose, who broke late for the bag two batters into the game,
on Chris Singleton's grounder fielded by Mike Stanley on the line.
``That cost him three runs. Then not knowing what to do on a PFP
(pitcher's fielding practice) on a ball hit right in front of the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan was referring to Magglio Ordonez's two-out chopper that
Rose fielded, but the pitcher then looked home, which had been
vacated by catcher Creighton Gubanich, instead of wheeling to first
for the play expected in such circumstances. A run scored on that
play and Carlos Lee followed with a two-run double that made it
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``He embarrassed everybody in uniform today,'' Kerrigan said.
``It's my responsibility as pitching coach that he doesn't screw up
like that. He'll be here bright and early Sunday to make sure he
covers first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``His lack of fielding cost six runs. Young people are like
that. He's got a good head on his shoulders about pitching, and has
a real good feel for the game, but even young people can slip and
he slipped big time.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time in four games that the Sox gave up
double-digit runs in losing, the only exception being Pedro Night,
when they beat Chicago, 6-1. Your box score will note that the Red
Sox did not make an error, but in this case the small print lies.
The errors, even if they went unsanctioned officially and were more
mental than physical, came fast and furious.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't just Rose who found the banana peels. In the first
inning, after Ray Durham flared a 130-foot double over the head of
third baseman Wilton Veras and Singleton reached on Rose's delayed
reaction, Red Sox center fielder Damon Buford, normally the most
surehanded of outfielders, appeared to just plain miss Frank
Thomas's drive to the track, which hit the wall above his head for
an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Ordonez then hit a grounder to third, which Veras gloved and
fired belatedly to the plate, where Gubanich dropped the ball as
Singleton scored.
</P>
<P>
   A two-out single by Craig Wilson made it 3-0. The Ordonez
miscalculation followed in the second, leading to the doubling of
the score, and the White Sox strung together four hits in the
fourth for another three spot that made it 9-0, spelling the end of
Rose's afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But there was more. In the fifth, designated hitter Jason
Varitek apparently lost track of the outs and advanced just one
base on Veras's pop fly single. In the ninth, Trot Nixon, who
entered the game as a defensive replacement, had to be told to go
to first base after taking ball four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't know if it was just the first inning,'' manager Jimy
Williams said of the weirdness of the day's events. ``Just put this
game behind us and go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, as is his custom, wouldn't single anybody out. It was
almost only in passing that he mentioned Rose's failure to cover
first, and didn't use the pitcher's name when he did. His idea of a
fall guy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad managing is all it was,'' he said. ``I put 'em out there,
so I take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had Lou Merloni hitting third and playing short in
Garciaparra's absence, admitted his team wasn't as sharp as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game where maybe we were a little mentally tired,''
he said. ``Not making excuses, but we had a couple of guys out, we
had (flight problems on) the trip, not a lot of sleep. Maybe the
trip caught up with us a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, whose record dropped to 4-1, now has one win in his last
six starts, with four no-decisions. This was the first time this
season that he has been charged with more than four runs in a
start; in six of his nine starts, he has held the opposition to a
run or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tough game overall, tough to chew on,'' he said.
``But I've got to move on. The day was pretty much a disaster for
me. I'll try to put it behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose admitted he should have run harder to first base on the
grounder to Stanley, but defended his actions on Ordonez's chopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were two outs,'' he said. ``I saw Durham running
out of the corner of my eye, and I thought it would be a tough play
to throw across my body. I know Ordonez can run. Call it a mental
error, but I thought the easier play (was the play at the plate).
But it turned around and bit me in the butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Such wounds for the Sox have usually been superficial, lasting
no more than a day. Rose hopes it won't linger beyond his next
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of guy I am,'' he said, ``I look at the bottom line.
The team got a loss, I got a loss, I've got to put out a better
effort. You've got to do your job, but I didn't do mine today.''

US WOMEN ARE A BOX-OFFICE SMASH 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ All of a sudden, they realized that they
couldn't wear their USA gear in public anymore. They realized that
strangers could match their faces with their names. That they have
to check into hotels under aliases. That they can't shake every
hand, sign every autograph. Not any more. ``From what I gather,''
keeper Briana Scurry says, ``we're pretty huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the World Cup began two weekends ago, the US women's
soccer team was still getting mistaken for a high school volleyball
squad. Now, the president comes to the locker room for postgame
congrats. David Letterman calls them `Babe City' and has
defender/sex symbol Brandi Chastain on for late night chitchat.
Hundreds of ``ponytailed hooligans'' turn up screeching for them at
practices in suburban hideaways. Every stadium they appear in draws
NFL-sized crowds. And every game they play is on live and
coast-to-coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of attention paid to us after we won the
Olympics,'' says midfielder Julie Foudy. ``But for all this to
happen so suddenly _ that's the most amazing thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Babes of Summer (even the team's Moms don't mind being
called that) have become America's instant heartthrobs. Who hasn't
seen the Nike ads (`I will take two fillings.')? Who doesn't know
Mia-Mia-Mia's number? Who isn't tuning in to ESPN for at least a
glimpse? Who doesn't know they're playing Brazil here Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   The Babes sold out Giants Stadium (78,972) for their opener with
Denmark. Only the Pope drew more. They sold out Soldier Field
(65,080) in Chicago for a Thursday night mismatch with the
Nigerians. They drew more than 50,000 to Foxboro Stadium on a
steamy Sunday night for an all-but-meaningless date with the North
Koreans. They attracted so many fans to Jack Kent Cooke Stadium for
Thursday night's quarterfinal with Germany that traffic was backed
up for 20 miles on the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon more than 60,000 are expected to attend the
semifinal in Stanford Stadium and 70,000 have already bought
tickets for Saturday's final in the Rose Bowl, anticipating that
the US will be playing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the white-heat attraction, undoubtedly, stems from
America's fascination with the Big Event that comes around once in
a lifetime. Some comes from the recent explosion of interest in
female spectator sports, from figure skating to gymnastics to
basketball to tennis to soccer. And some because the home team
(unlike the US males in 1994) is supposed to win.
</P>
<P>
   Still, not since hockey's Boys of Winter in 1980 has America
taken a team to its heart the way it has this one. And except for
one major difference (the Boys were huge underdogs, the Babes are
decisive favorites), the attractions are similar.
</P>
<P>
   The women are unselfish, enthusiastic, and next-door
approachable. They're playing the game more for love than money.
They get a lump in their throats when they hear the anthem. And
they kick butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't try to be everybody's homecoming queens,'' says
Tony DiCicco, who has coached the squad for half a dozen years.
``They just want to play as hard as they can and support each other
and win gold medals.''
</P>
<P>
   In a time when American sports are most notable for strikes and
lockouts, for holdouts and arbitrations, for lawsuits and felony
charges and for salary caps and draftees demanding eight-figure
contracts, the Babes of Summer come across as unspoiled throwbacks
to an unjaded time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest things about this team is that it's seen as
a team,'' says Foudy. ``That's what attracts people to us. We're
just a team that works well together and believes in that unity and
that trust and that love.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a dozen of them have been playing together for a decade.
Most of them won Olympic gold medals three years ago and are
sticking around for another chance in Sydney next summer. They've
sat red-eyed next to each other on flights to China, to Portugal,
to Brazil, to Australia, to Haiti. They've sweated out endless
two-a-days in Florida camps. They kill each other in practice, hug
each other after games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We genuinely like each other,'' says Scurry. ``It's real. What
you see in the commercials is real. We live and die out there for
each other. It's all about team. I WOULD take two fillings.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry and her teammates play for modest monthly stipends and
for the $12,500 bonus they'll get if they win the Cup (if they lose
Sunday, they get zip). They make a point of taking a postgame lap,
win or lose, to wave thanks to their face-painted fans. They sign
programs, balls, jerseys, forearms until they get writer's cramp.
They thank journalists for interviewing them. Because they remember
when nobody did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were days when we played in front of 100 people,'' says
Mia Hamm. ``And we were thankful then and we are thankful now.''
</P>
<P>
   The US women, who'd watched the men closely when they played
host in 1994, figured that they'd become much more visible when
their Cup was held here. ``It's just a matter of awareness, a
matter of getting us out there,'' says Tiffeny Milbrett.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they were unprepared for the tidal wave of interest that
has swamped them during the past fortnight. ``Everyone always knew
Mia,'' says Milbrett. ``But once the tournament started it was, can
I please have your autograph _ and can you write your number?''
</P>
<P>
   Now Milbrett and Scurry and Chastain and Foudy and Michelle
Akers and Kristine Lilly and the Moms (Joy Fawcett and Carla
Overbeck) have become household faces, too. Soccer dads call their
hotel rooms, asking them to come down to the lobby to meet their
daughters. Ponytailed hooligans peek beneath toilet stalls. Fans
stand five deep at practices, screeching for scribbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much the numbers but the enthusiasm and the
excitement,'' says Akers, who strained a shoulder last week
high-fiving a fan. ``When I walked back onto the field in Chicago
after halftime, the crowd was standing up and yelling my name and
the breath was coming out of me. Because that's something you live
for.''
</P>
<P>
   When Akers scored her first goal for the team 14 years ago, US
women's soccer was barely on the radar screen. The year after they
won the 1991 World Cup (who knew? who cared?), they played only
twice. When they won the 1996 Olympics, NBC didn't even show the
match. Now Akers and her teammates are larger than live.
</P>
<P>
   This is the dream, Foudy says. This is why the Americans came
from behind twice to beat the Germans. This is why Fawcett, who
scored the winning goal with her two daughters watching, wore her
slogan shirt to the postgame press conference: WHAT WE NEED WE
HAVE. AND WHAT WE GIVE IS EVERYTHING WE'VE GOT.
</P>
<P>
   For the Babes of Summer, the dream has been to play the way
they've always been playing and to win what they've won before.
But, finally, to do it here _ before more hands than they can
shake.

BENT ON UPPING PACE, BENDER BROUGHT ON 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Donnie Walsh saw the same things you and I did when the
Knicks ran past his Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference
finals. He saw Latrell Sprewell (whom Walsh, the Pacers' president,
had tried to get) beat his manatees down the floor. He saw Marcus
Camby swoop in, around and over his landlocked leviathans.
</P>
<P>
   He decided it was time to do something about it and, on draft
night, he did. He traded Antonio Davis, one of his key, inside
guys, to the Toronto Raptors for the fifth pick in the draft. He
then had the Raptors select high school wunderkind Jonathan Bender,
who is athletic, gifted, and young.
</P>
<P>
   The deal hasn't been announced officially and won't be until
Aug. 1 because of salary cap complexities. But it's done. Bender
will enter the NBA under the watchful eyes of Larry Bird while
Davis will move north, leaving a veteran, experienced team for a
younger, promising one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to get more athletic and younger, but without
taking the heart out of the team,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   Why Antonio Davis? Well, here's an indication of how things are
today. Walsh talked to him at the end of the 1997-98 season and
Davis told him he would like to start at some point. Walsh talked
to him again at the end of this season and got the same vibes,
although more pronounced and urgent.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was one of the best, most reliable, game-changing sixth
men in the league. He was a huge part of the Pacers' success. But
he wanted to start. It didn't matter that he could be on the floor
when games are being decided. He wanted to be on the floor when
there was no score.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't new or unusual. We heard the same things in the
playoffs from Sprewell. We've heard it from a lot of players over
the years. One player we never heard it from was Kevin McHale, who
was a two-time Sixth Man winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed more guys don't want to do it,'' McHale said of his
stint as a reserve. ``It gives you a chance to get a feel for the
game. And when you do go in, you're usually going in against their
second team, or against the first team that is tired. And they're
usually in the bonus situation so all you have to do is throw a
little pump fake and you're at the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest time is if the team is rolling and they send you
in there and you just don't want to screw anything up. If you're up
like 26-6, you think, `how can I beat that?' But if you're
struggling, it's different. You can make a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he hadn't expressed a desire to start, Davis may well
have been traded. The Pacers did have to make a move, and he was a
very desirable commodity. But he made Walsh's job a lot easier when
he said he felt like it was time. In addition, by trading Davis for
a draft pick, the Pacers get a trade exception of $4.5 million,
which they have a year to use (and will).
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers weren't without in-house friction over roles this
season; Mark Jackson complained about sitting during the fourth
quarters. Now, Bird has a new challenge: nurturing Bender, whom he
has not seen play. The Pacers didn't work him out, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made Larry's job any easier,'' Walsh said. ``But he
accepts that we have to get younger. I'm not worried. We need to
get stars. That's what runs the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers would have settled for Lamar Odom had Bender been
gone by No. 5, but the 6-foot-11-inch high schooler from Picayune,
Miss., is the one they wanted. For good reason, said Celtics
general manager Chris Wallace, whose team also was in on the Bender
Sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bender is a tremendous pick,'' Wallace said. ``It's
not an instant payoff thing. It's a long-term investment. He's not
as ready to play as (Kevin) Garnett was and he's not the
intimidator on defense that Garnett is and he may never be that.
But he has some truly amazing skills and if you're a team that can
afford to be patient with him and wait, as the Pacers can, then
it's fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors, meanwhile, with the trade send a clear message to
Charles Oakley that they are committed to win and win now. They
will renounce Oak (who is on the cap at $15 million) and then
quickly try to re-sign him for considerably less. That's one new
wrinkle in the new rules. Before, if you renounced one of your free
agents, you had to wait a couple months to re-sign him. Now, you
can do so immediately, but only by using money that you have by
being under the cap, now at $34 million. The Raptors also need to
upgrade their point guard situation, so look for them to make a
determined run at Eric Snow, who blossomed last year in Philly. He
will be a very coveted lad, given that Terrell Brandon and Nick Van
Exel are the two most prominent point guard free agents. Snow will
probably attract more interest than Van Exel . . . Speaking of
point guards, the Celtics have let it be known that they are more
than just mildly interested in Tony Delk, who, of course, played
for Rick Pitino at Kentucky. Pitino and Wallace have decided not to
extend a qualifying offer to Damon Jones (the deadline is Monday)
because they want to get a better read on him in the summer league.
Had they qualified him, they would have, in effect, had the right
of first refusal. But there won't be a lot of interest _ he was
there last year for anyone until Boston signed him _ so the Celtics
shouldn't have to worry about a bidding war . . . Each year, the
rating system known as Tendex analyzes the NBA draft, using a
complicated formula ranging from points to game pace to strength of
schedule to rate the prospects. They hit and they miss, like most
services. Last year, for instance, they had Corey Benjamin rated
No. 1. This year, they had Wally Szczerbiak at the top spot and
Andre Miller at No. 2. The big jaw-dropper is No. 3 _ Evan
Eschmeyer, the Northwestern center who didn't go until the second
round. (Elton Brand was fourth, followed by Shawn Marion.) The
service also charts players through their careers, reasoning that
each one should improve and be much better as a senior than as a
freshman. They grade players on how much they've improved, and
Szczberiak got an A. The Celtics' pick, Kris Clack, was given an F.
That might be one reason he slipped; Clack did have much better
numbers as a junior. Another is a possible weight problem (Pitino
will love to hear that) and that he wasn't all that good in the
Chicago pre-draft camp. But he also was the MVP of the Nike Desert
Classic. Regardless, the Celtics had him rated as a late
first-rounder and he was there at 55. ``That's the best you can
hope for with that kind of pick,'' Wallace said . . . And what of
Jumaine Jones, the Georgia forward who was the last Green Room guy
picked Wednesday and already had a tear-splashed face by the time
he greeted David Stern? He slipped for the usual reasons: he
switched agents, he had poor workouts, there were some health
concerns, he was too young, and he should have stayed in school.
``He's a great physical talent,'' Wallace said of Jones, who was
drafted by Atlanta and then traded to the Sixers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Magic, meanwhile, aren't under any illusions that
their 33-17 record this past season indicates they are one of the
beasts of the East. Far from it. They're rebuilding, which was
further dramatized by the trade of Horace Grant to Seattle for the
promising but raw Corey Maggette and a handful of salaries (Don
MacLean, Dale Ellis, Billy Owens). ``We've been living off the '95
team long enough,'' GM John Gabriel said, referring to the club
that went to the NBA Finals. With Grant gone, the only ones left
from that team are Nick Anderson and Penny Hardaway, the latter
being a free agent who may or may not be back. ``I still see us
being competitive,'' Gabriel said. ``You just have to measure how
much of a shelf life you have when you hold on to your older
players. Horace was a great piece for us. He was great in the
locker room. He will be missed.'' The Magic are rebuilding around
youth for first-year coach Doc Rivers; now you know why he wanted
that final year guaranteed. They talk about Michael Doleac, Matt
Harpring, and the unproven Maggette as their building blocks along
with Anderson and Ike Austin, who was awful last season. ``We
expect Ike is going to play much better,'' Gabriel said. ``We've
added some pieces but we've also maintained our depth, which was a
big reason for our success this past season.'' The Magic also want
to re-sign Bo Outlaw, who will be in demand because coaches
appreciate the unselfish way he plays and the enthusiasm he brings
to the game. Then, next season, they have three first-round picks:
their own, Denver's, and Golden State's, without strings . . . So
why didn't Dale Davis opt-out of his contract and become a free
agent? ``I'm glad he didn't,'' Walsh said. The Pacers might not
have traded Antonio Davis had Dale Davis decided to test the waters
as he did three summers ago. ``I thought it was too big a risk,''
said Davis's agent, Steve Kauffman. However, after next season,
Davis is eligible to sign an extension _ he'll have two years left
_ and it can start at 12.5 percent of his last year's salary. Look
for Shaquille O'Neal to do the same thing next summer. And his
extension will be astronomical, as his final year's salary is in
excess of $20 million . . . The Mavericks' selection of
high-schooler Leon Smith with the last pick of the first round
probably means the kid will be sent to Europe to get some playing
time. Their second-round pick, Chinese center Wang Zhi-Zhi, was
interesting. Teams were uncertain whether he was eligible for the
draft until draft day, when the league sent out a memo saying, as
best as it knew, Wang had been born in 1977 and that would make him
OK. (Foreign players who don't declare early have to be 22 in the
year they're drafted.) Wang is no stranger to hoop junkies in and
out of the NBA. He played in the 1996 Olympics and has been seen in
the LA Summer League as well. ``For whatever it's worth, he's the
best Chinese player,'' said Wallace, who called Wang a ``minor
league Toni Kukoc. He's 6-10, lefty, thin, long-armed and likes to
play on the perimeter. He's a finesse player.'' Getting Wang to the
US may be harder than it is for most foreigners. He's supposed to
be in the Army . . . One more Indiana tidbit: Walsh is very high on
center-forward Jeff Foster, whom the team also got out of the draft
by arranging a deal with Golden State, which ended up with Vonteego
Cummings. The Pacers brought in an astounding 29 players for
workouts _ they went into the draft with the 26th pick _ and the
7-foot Foster was the third fastest, tops for big men. He's one of
those quick-growth stories _ David Robinson is another _ going from
5-8 to 6-9 in high school while retaining his ballhandling skills.
``I really like him and so does Larry (Bird),'' Walsh said. ``But I
don't want to say anything more.''

 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ Will they or won't they?
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting question this summer has nothing to do with
what free agent will end up where. It has to do with whether twins
Daniel and Henrik Sedin, who were selected Nos. 2 and 3 by the
Vancouver Canucks in the entry draft, are going to play in the NHL
this coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Canucks general manager Brian Burke, who performed a master
stroke of negotiating to be in position to take both kids, has done
a fine job of giving his team hope for LAP (Life After Pavel).
</P>
<P>
   Before last weekend's draft, the Sedins sounded as if they would
definitely stay home for another year and play for MoDo of the
Swedish Elite League. It seemed unlikely that any team would draft
both of them, which was their wish.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Canucks have succeeded, the Sedins are leaning
toward leaving Sweden for the riches and opportunities of the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone you talk to, in terms of their ability, there is no
question they're ready,'' assistant GM Dave Nonis told the
Vancouver Sun. ``I know schooling is important to the family but I
don't know to what extent it is an issue. I think there are other
factors probably playing into whether or not they'll come. I think
they do feel somewhat obligated to their hometown team and that
there is still a question in their own minds whether they are
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The twins' agent, Mike Barnett, who also represents Bruins
center Joe Thornton, said the oppoartunity to play for the same
team has the Sedins reconsidering their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not under contract yet with their Swedish team and we
haven't discussed the contract yet with Vancouver because the first
decision is whether the players feel comfortable (joining the NHL).
They're discussing that with their family this week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks have missed the playoffs for three straight seasons,
but last season was Burke's first, and Vancouver's fortunes are
about to change. Look for Burke to do everything in his power to
get the Sedins, who turn 19 in September, here next fall. With the
loss of Gretzky's star power, the twins would be a shot in the arm
for both Vancouver and the league.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of theories as why wing Theo Fleury, who is
being wooed big-time by the Rangers, didn't re-sign with the
Avalanche. Fleury cited unstable ownership. ``I think the ownership
thing is a lot more than people think,'' Fleury said. ``That would
have been a huge payroll, if you think about it. And Joe (Sakic's
contract) is up next year. I'm not that surprised by what
happened.'' Another report said that while the ownership problem
was a factor, Avalanche management made its decision on Fleury
during the playoffs, specifically Game 6 against Dallas, after
which GM Pierre Lacroix was said to be unhappy with Fleury's play.
The 31-year-old didn't score a goal in his last nine playoff games
and missed Game 5 against Dallas with a stomach virus. The
Avalanche also were not thrilled with the notion of giving Fleury a
no-trade clause, which he reportedly won't sign without . . .
According to New York reports, the Rangers are in the hunt for
veteran Chicago center Doug Gilmour . . . It's the end of an era in
Philadelphia. Veteran Ron Hextall, one of history's most colorful
netminders, was waived by the Flyers to make way for the next
generation of goalies _ in this case 22-year-old Brian Boucher.
Hextall, 35, who backed up John Vanbiesbrouck last season, is the
franchise's all-time winningest goalie and played 573 games for the
Flyers, a club record. After the Flyers buy out the remaining year
of his deal, provided he's not picked up by another team, it's
possible another club could sign Hextall. But it appears more
likely he'll retire and may take a job in the organization. ``I
don't feel very good about it,'' said GM Bob Clarke. ``But I feel
it has to be done for our team. In some ways, it's not right.
Here's a guy who wants to play here and we're telling him he can't.
It seems like there's no nice way to do anything anymore.'' Hextall
could sometimes be a little extreme on the ice but off the ice,
there are few, if any, classier people . . . Steve Smith sat out
the entire 1997-98 season but signed last year as a free agent with
Calgary, and it looks as if the durable defenseman will be with the
Flames again this year. The 36-year-old is an unrestricted free
agent. Flames GM Al Coates said something could be finalized soon .
. . Tough times for former NHL defenseman Bryan Fogarty, 30, who
was arrested for drug possession last weekend in Brantford,
Ontario. Fogarty, who battled alcohol problems as a player, was
charged with breaking and entering and possession of a controlled
substance, possibly cocaine . . . It appears that assistant GM
Anders Hedberg is a candidate for the Maple Leafs' GM job. Toronto
president Ken Dryden, who runs one of the league's most convoluted
front offices, fired associate GM Mike Smith, who last week told
the media that Hedberg had been reluctant to share draft
information with him, a charge Hedberg denied. ``I'm two years more
prepared (to be GM),'' said Hedberg. ``(But) I have not talked to
Ken to see where he stands, so I think it would be premature to
announce my candidacy.'' Word out of Toronto is that the Leafs will
pursue free agent Valeri Kamensky to reunite him with captain Mats
Sundin. The two played together in Quebec before the franchise
moved west to Denver . . . There has been little to celebrate in
the Islanders' front office of late but an offer by co-owners
Howard Milstein and Steven Gluckstern seems to have generated some
optimism. Reportedly, they have said they will privately finance a
$300 million arena to replace aging Nassau Coliseum. Reportedly,
their conditions for financing an arena are that they would manage
it and control the revenue streams for all events held there. One
key stumbling block is that the Islanders' lease runs through 2015
and would have to be severed first . . . Blackhawks GM Bob Murray,
who stunned Bruins president/GM Harry Sinden on draft day when he
criticized him after the Bruins selected defenseman Nick Boynton
with the 21st pick, had some pointed remarks for the league
regarding conduct leading up to the draft. Murray said agent Rich
Winter, who represented No. 1 pick Patrik Stefan, wouldn't meet
with the Hawks and wouldn't provide medical records concerning
Stefan's history of concussions. Islanders GM Mike Milbury also
torched Winter for the same runaround. Murray said he was so
disgusted with his treatment by Winter and the Sedin twins
postponing their meeting with the Blackhawks not once but twice,
that it helped push him toward a deal with the Canucks in which
Chicago acquired defenseman Bryan McCabe. ``This league, for its
own health, has got to get this thing in order,'' said Murray.
``This was wrong. We can't let it happen anymore. (Their conduct)
made me much more anxious to get away from these people.'' . . .
The Florida Panthers dumped Dino Ciccarelli, Terry Carkner, and
Kirk Muller off their roster. The three made $6.475 million last
year and combined for 33 points. That's $196,212.12 per point for
those of you keeping score at home . . . Has Keith Primeau played
his last game for the Carolina Hurricanes? Possibly. The club
offered Primeau a raise that would have doubled his salary next
season (from $2 million to $4 million). As of July 1, Primeau is a
restricted free agent and general manager Jim Rutherford said
Carolina would match up to a $5 million offer. Primeau reportedly
wants in the neighborhood of $6 million, which Rutherford said is
too much. Don't be surprised to see Primeau traded.

   When he first learned he had been traded from Ottawa to Tampa
Bay, Andreas Johansson was less than happy about going to the worst
team in the league as part of the transaction that had former
Senators GM Rick Dudley taking over the Tampa head job. ``When I
first heard, it came as a shock,'' said the 26-year-old center from
Hofors, Sweden. ``I got mad right away. I know hockey is a business
and I've been traded before but I really liked Ottawa. It's going
to be tough to leave.'' As much as he'll miss his friends,
Johansson, who suffered from a balky knee the final two months of
the season and wound up being scratched by coach Jacques Martin,
knows this could be a positive turn of events. ``This could turn
out to be a good opportunity,'' he said. ``This could be good for
my career.'' It remains to be seen how good it will be for Rob
Zamuner, the Lightning's last original player, who went to Ottawa.
``For seven years, there have been so many ups and downs,'' said
Zamuner. ``It really wasn't a traditional seven years, what with
the Japanese owners and then Art Williams. You really had to be a
professional through all of that. But now everything's going to
turn around and as a player you can sense that. That's the hardest
part of all this.'' Lightning coach/GM Jacques Demers said
Johansson will be moved to left wing to replace Zamuner . . . Wayne
Gretzky and his wife, Janet Jones Gretzky, are expecting a fourth
child early next year. The Gretzkys have an 11-year-old daughter,
Paulina, and two sons _ 8-year-old Ty and 6-year-old Trevor . . .
In a chilling reminder of a tragic event more than two years ago,
Richard Gnida, who was driving the limousine in the crash that
permanently disabled Red Wings defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov and
team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov, was arrested on a charge of
drunken driving in Westland, Mich. Gnida reportedly ran a stop sign
at 2 a.m. and failed a field sobriety test. On June 13, 1997, Gnida
ran onto a median and hit a tree while driving some of the Red
Wings home after a party celebrating their Stanley Cup victory. He
served seven months for driving with a suspended license, his
second offense. He went back to jail in January after violating
conditions of his parole and was released on good behavior in March
. . . What a sickening development: The NHL's decision to go to a
four-on-four format in overtime is nothing short of a disgrace.
Another victory for gimmickry over what is in the best interest of
the sport. Brutal.

FLAWED FINLEY FINISHED QUICKLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Chuck Finley is out of whack, much like the Angels'
season.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran left-hander was knocked around for the third time in
a row in the Angels' 9-7 loss to the Oakland A's on Saturday night
before 50,916 at the Oakland Coliseum, the largest crowd ever to
see the A's play in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was tagged for eight runs (six earned) and eight hits in
31/3 innings, his shortest outing of the season. The mechanical
flaw in his delivery obviously hasn't been corrected because in his
past three starts, Finley has allowed 21 earned runs in 112/3
innings, his ERA rising from 4.18 to 5.52.
</P>
<P>
   The A's knocked him out of the game in the fourth inning with
six runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss for words,'' said Finley, who fell to 4-9. ``The
last three starts have been brutal. Absolutely terrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I've been hammered three times in
a row like this, if ever. Usually when it gets bad it's the seventh
or eighth inning, but I'm not getting to the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out of spring training and he was our No. 1 guy, and
in my opinion he still is our No. 1 guy,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``I'm not a pitching coach, but just from my
experience, big, tall guys can get out of whack easily. Mechanics
are really important, especially with a guy like Chuck. He'll get
it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's performance wasn't unlike the rest of the starters on
the staff in recent days. In fact, only one starter _ Omar Olivares
on June 25 _ has made it through the sixth inning in the Angels'
past 11 games. In those games, the starters' ERA is 8.80 (45 earned
runs in 46 innings).
</P>
<P>
   Finley, though, has become more important considering the loss
of Tim Belcher and Ken Hill to injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to do with the rest of the rotation,'' Finley
said. ``The only urgency I have is to pitch better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense has made an appearance the past two nights
with 27 hits, including 13 Saturday. Darin Erstad had three hits,
and Randy Velarde, Mo Vaughn and Orlando Palmeiro had two each.
</P>
<P>
   Still, wasted opportunities hurt them early. Going into the
game, the Angels were hitting only .241 with runners in scoring
position, including just .230 with runners in scoring position and
two out.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, after singles by Erstad and Vaughn, Garret
Anderson grounded into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning after the Angels had scored twice to take a
2-1 lead, Todd Greene came to the plate with one out and the bases
loaded. With a chance to make it a big inning, Greene instead
popped out and Bret Hemphill grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   The A's tied the game with an unearned run on shortstop Gary
DiSarcina's error in the bottom of the third, then broke it open
with a six-run fourth.
</P>
<P>
   A throwing error by third baseman Troy Glaus got the inning
started, but Finley was responsible for the rest. He gave up a
two-run double to Miguel Tejada and an RBI single to Olmedo Saenz,
which brought out pitching coach Dick Pole.
</P>
<P>
   But on the first pitch after the conference, John Jaha blasted a
three-run homer for an 8-2 Oakland lead.
</P>
<P>
   The A's lead was 9-2 when the Angels tried to climb back into it
in the sixth. Palmeiro hit a two-run double and Erstad got his
third hit of the night, an RBI single to make it 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Worrell relieved A's starter Gil Heredia (4-5), but Velarde
kept the inning going with a single to right. Vaughn followed with
an RBI single and Anderson doubled home another to make it 9-7. But
with the tying runs in scoring position, Jeff Huson, pinch hitting
for Greene, struck out looking at a 3-2 pitch to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Taylor pitched the ninth for the A's to earn his 19th
save.

TEAMS AREN'T THINKING WITH CAP 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``Capped out . . . Up against the cap . . . Cap poor .
. . No room under the cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Cap this.
</P>
<P>
   Salary cap jargon is getting as annoying as hearing ``Have a
good one'' or ``TGIF.'' When Bob Kraft and his fellow owners put
together a $17.6 billion TV deal, the richest in sports history,
this was supposed to be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it has been in terms of NFL owners getting richer, but
the extra money has created headaches for teams constructing their
rosters. ``Capologists'' around the league are bright men, many of
whom have succeeded in other businesses, but many of them have
entered blindly into ridiculous contracts for players not worth the
riches at the expense of having to cut good players.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco 49ers, for example, had to cut almost $20
million off their payroll because their buy-now, pay-later attitude
snuck up on them so quickly. They had to dump guard Kevin Gogan,
defensive end Roy Barker, and tight end Irv Smith to meet budget.
The 49ers did so much renegotiating of contracts to make ``cap
room'' that they left themselves holding a huge bill down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' Andy Wasynczuk refers to it as a credit card that
becomes payable.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Patriots are sometimes criticized for having lost
players such as Todd Collins, Dave Wohlabaugh, and Curtis Martin,
who were basically sacrificed for Max Lane, Todd Rucci, Bruce
Armstrong, Willie McGinest, and Ted Johnson, they are trying to
avoid a bigger hit down the road, such as the one the New York Jets
will likely feel next year and for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, of course, feel they can win now, and there's
certainly something to be said for going for it _ if you make it.
If you don't, you have no Super Bowl to show for it, and then you
still have to pay the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys recently gave Deion Sanders a five-year, $51 million
deal. They are basically committing a third of their payroll to
four players _ Emmitt Smith ($6.8 million), Troy Aikman ($6
million), Darren Woodson ($4.1 million) and Erik Williams ($3.3
million). Those players are old, and the Cowboys will be paying
after the player is gone. It's like having a car that is no longer
useful, but you still have two years left on the loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago we got into the business of up-front bonuses
because it helps you get more talent on the roster, but it's like
using a credit card because you have to have some discipline,''
Cowboy owner Jerry Jones told the Dallas Morning News last week.
</P>
<P>
   Discipline?
</P>
<P>
   Sanders is 34 years old and coming off a foot operation.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman is one concussion away from calling it a career.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's best days are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Every team is in the league is now falling into the trap of
paying huge money to a few players. In some cases it's unavoidable.
The NFL is no different than Major League Baseball, the NHL, or the
NBA in that respect. The problem is when players make big money,
they have to perform at a very high level, or the results are
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a guy is making $5 million, he's got to be twice as good as
the guy making $2 million, or he's killing your team,'' said
Patriots free safety Willie Clay. ``Because if you have players
making that much, you're probably getting rid of good players so
you can pay out those salaries. Do you sacrifice five or six good
players so you can give one or two guys that money?''
</P>
<P>
   When $5 million players such as McGinest and Johnson go down
with injuries, the Patriots have to plug in with Marty Moore or
Greg Spires. The dropoff is huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of pressure on those guys,'' said
Clay. ``Because they have to justify the expense. It's great that
the money is out there and that they're making it, but once you get
that contract, you have to perform even better or it hurts the team
in other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay is right. In '99, McGinest and Johnson have to play better
than ever. When Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy get their big deals,
probably at the expense of above-average players, they, too, must
continue to play at a high level.
</P>
<P>
   On the Patriots, Drew Bledsoe's $7.2 million cap number may be
the only justifiable big number. You would do that one again and
again.
</P>
<P>
   This cap stuff in the era of big money will eventually be solved
by teams that have very bright financial minds. For now, however,
costly mistakes are being made by all teams, and the fans are
paying. They're watching players they've had an affinity for go
elsewhere because an overrated defensive lineman got one of those
five-year, $25 million contracts teams were handing out a couple of
years ago. Most of the guys who got those deals aren't justifying
them.
</P>
<P>
   And because of those deals, teams are ``capped out . . . up
against the cap . . . cap poor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Patriots training camp coming up at the end of the month, a
few things to watch for:
</P>
<P>
   --Third-year free safety Chris Carter will get every chance to
beat out Clay _ at least that's the bug the Patriots are putting in
Carter's ear to give him a spark. Carter showed a bit of
indifference about the offseason workout program (and no, his
absence was not due to his attending medical school. In fact, he
hasn't even applied to medical school). The Patriots feel this will
be Carter's big chance to go from special teams player to starter.
They like his intelligence and ability to learn and to read what's
going on. Clay is in the final year of his deal ($1.8 million), and
the Patriots may feel they can save money here. Unfortunately, the
Patriots have cut too many Clays the past few years and have left
themselves with few leaders on the field and in the locker room.
Also, watch for third-round pick Tony George, who has been told by
Clay, ``This is your job next year.''
</P>
<P>
   --It'll be interesting to see how the Patriots configure their
receiver depth chart. Terry Glenn is a starter if he's OK, but who
will start on the opposite side? Shawn Jefferson is the
hardest-working and the most dependable receiver, but it's obvious
that second-year man Tony Simmons, also a deep threat, could unseat
Jefferson. That leaves Troy Brown, Vincent Brisby, and Sean Morey
to duke it out for playing time. Brown is too valuable not to play
and Brisby keeps getting contract extensions, which makes Morey's
battle for a spot tough. But fear not, Mr. Morey: A receiver or two
or three will likely pull a hamstring before long.
</P>
<P>
   --Just who will be the Patriots' starting running back come
Sept. 13? Some close to Terry Allen feel he's pretty much agreed to
join the Patriots as soon as they free the cap room. Allen, who
will not win a Mr. Congeniality award anytime soon, could be a
temporary solution, and could help break in Kevin Faulk, who is
represented by the same agent, Tank Black. Lamont Warren appears to
be fixed in that third-down slot, which means Derrick Cullors's
days might be numbered, unless he's used as a special teams player.
The Patriots are also giving Harold Shaw, the last of the running
back Shaws, a chance to show what he can do. Also, look for
fullback Chris Floyd to be given a chance to carry the ball.
</P>
<P>
   --In search of much-needed depth, defensive line coach Ray
Hamilton has liked the offseason work of free agent defensive end
Sterling Palmer, who is known more for his run-stopping, though
he's considered quick enough to rush the passer. Problem is he has
bad knees. Also showing a ferocious side was Illinois rookie free
agent nose tackle Garrett Johnson, and undersized end Willie Cohens
from Florida State. The Patriots have to count on the unprovens,
and hope the players with questions surrounding them get their acts
together, or they may not be able to absorb injuries to their
front-line guys.
</P>
<P>
   --Even Wohlabaugh is a little baffled by the outpouring of
warmth since he left the Patriots to become the highest-paid center
in football with the Cleveland Browns. When he was with the
Patriots he felt he was just another guy. Now that he's gone, he's
an All-Pro. To my knowledge he never earned All-Pro honors, but
he's irreplaceable? All of the accolades Wohlabaugh receives are
well-earned because he's a good guy and a good player who played
hurt. What many forget is that three players on the line _
Armstrong, Rucci, and Lane _ were starters when the Patriots got to
the Super Bowl. They have to find two other players. One of them is
Zefross Moss, a steady starter who may not be around when the
season starts because of salary cap issues. If Moss is sacrificed,
left guard Lane could go back to his old position at right tackle,
where he played pretty well for Bill Parcells, a couple of plays in
the Super Bowl against one of the greatest pass rushers in football
history (Reggie White) notwithstanding. Say what you will about
Lane; he's been a loyal guy who has been moved. He deserves a
chance to return to his natural position. And while the football
jury is out on Damon Denson, Ed Ellis, and Jason Andersen, it may
soon carry a positive verdict on Baylor rookie Derrick Fletcher,
who is a pretty imposing figure at 6 feet 7 inches, 370 pounds. Who
replaces Wohlabaugh? Pete Brock, who was a pretty good center in
the league for many years, thinks Andersen can really play, and he
thinks Damien Woody's athleticism is top notch. Woody will have to
disprove criticism of his work ethic, but he's a first-round
talent. By the way, if Woody makes it as a starter and the Patriots
stay with Moss, Armstrong, Rucci, and Lane, the line will be one of
the few in the league with everyone having a cap number over $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   --Todd Collins, who signed a three-year deal with the St. Louis
Rams, was one of the most respected guys on the football field. His
leadership and work ethic will be missed, as will his field savvy,
but few feel uncomfortable about his replacement, Andy Katzenmoyer.
And don't forget, Tedy Bruschi can be an unrestricted free agent
next year, so this season he will either be labeled as a good
all-around player, or a replaceable role player. It's also a big
year for third-year linebacker Vernon Crawford, whom Collins
considered the most talented outside linebacker on the team.
</P>
<P>
   --In the end it all comes down to Bledsoe, anyway. The best news
for the Patriots is that John Friesz can get the job done if
Bledsoe goes down. Even better news for New England is that if
Vinny Testaverde should fall to injury or is ineffective, the Jets
will have to turn to the Patriots' backup quarterbacks from last
season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to those who know, the Patriots' new stadium will
closely resemble the Baltimore Ravens' stadium . . . For the first
year since 1982, the Green Bay Packers' organization was in the
red. In their annual report to 110,000 shareholders, the Packers
spent $154,000 more than they brought in in their fiscal year,
which ended March 31, 1999, in large part because of the $32
million in signing bonuses they gave out . . . What money problem?
Ravens owner Art Modell finds himself in quite a pickle in
Baltimore. He's about $185 million in debt because of his lifestyle
and needs to attract a minority owner. Don't rule out Orioles owner
Peter Angelos, who was involved in the Redskins' sale at one time.
Under NFL bylaws, Angelos may own another pro franchise in his
market. Modell did throw fuel on his money problems when he gave a
five-year, $18.7 million contract (and $6 million signing bonus) to
guard Jeff Blackshear and vowed more long-term signings were on the
way. Modell is trying to get the league to give him a loan and
waive his relocation fee. That doesn't appear to be in the cards.
Also of interest is a grievance filed by Modell on behalf of the
Ravens against the Redskins, claiming that the team stole the
Ravens' star salesman for luxury boxes and club suites, David Cope.
One of the problems is that Daniel Snyder is not officially the new
owner yet, thus making it difficult for commissioner Paul Tagliabue
to rule that Snyder stole Cope. Cope was lured away with a $400,000
salary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are pretty much sold out for the year, including
exhibition games. Only a few single tickets remain for the
exhibition game against the Redskins. The Patriots' waiting list
for season tickets, even after the Hartford hopefuls dropped out,
remains at more than 50,000 . . . According to those associated
with the Patriots' luxury boxes and club-seating sales, the sale of
luxury boxes is ``moving along'' while a plan for the sale of club
seating should be unveiled soon. There's already a waiting list for
those seats . . . One Patriots rookie felt the wrath of strength
coach Johnny Parker when he was caught skipping a few steps in the
conditioning routine. Hell hath no greater fury than Parker scorned
. . . Giants All-Pro cornerback Jason Sehorn, who missed the entire
1998 season after being injured on a kick return, and coach Jim
Fassel are at loggerheads. Sehorn pretty much blew off the Giants'
offseason, including a week of the team's passing camp, which left
Fassel fuming. The Giants want Sehorn around since he wasn't able
to play last season . . . Where have we heard this before? The
Vikings think they can turn former Patriot Devin Wyman into a
serviceable defensive tackle . . . One of the most sought-after
corners out there is former Bengal Ashley Ambrose, torn between
more money in New Orleans (about $2 million) and playing close to
his best friend, Ray Buchanan, in Atlanta, which can't pay him as
much. It's apparent Ambrose is leaning toward the Falcons because
he turned down a $15 million deal from the Chiefs . . . Are the
Bills down on Antowain Smith? That appears to be a logical
conclusion based on their interest in Lawrence Phillips. Like the
Patriots, the Bills are not usually tolerant of those with shady
pasts . . . Interesting case in Michigan, where former Lion coach
Wayne Fontes is trying to make a claim for worker's compensation as
a result of a 1989 sideline hit he took when Lions defensive back
Bennie Blades drove a Viking receiver out of bounds. Fontes
allegedly suffered back and neck injuries, which he claims impaired
his ability to be a top coach and eventually led to his firing in
1996. Fontes, 60, said he still suffers from back and neck pain,
but is able to play golf once a week. If he wins his case, he could
earn up to $555 per week in benefits for the rest of his life . . .
Mike Holmgren lifted linebacker James Willis under the noses of his
old team, the Packers, last week. Willis, who had played for new
Green Bay coach Ray Rhodes in Philadelphia, was about to sign with
Rhodes, who was offering $400,000 plus incentives, when Holmgren
swooped in and took him away, offering the potential of more
playing time . . . Gene Hackman and Keanu Reeves will star in a
movie ``The Replacements'' based somewhat on the Washington
Redskins' replacement team of 1987 during the NFL strike. The movie
is due out in January and shooting has been taking place around RFK
stadium this summer . . . Quarterback Heath Shuler, a former No. 1
draft pick most thought couldn't miss, is likely facing early
retirement, unable to come back from a foot injury he sustained in
New Orleans last year. Shuler was recently cut by the Oakland
Raiders . . . The Rams have been talking to Jeff Hostetler about a
possible spot as a backup quarterback to Trent Green, whom he
backed up in Washington last year. The Rams currently have Kurt
Warner and Joe Germaine penciled in as backups, but neither has
much or any NFL experience . . . The Dolphins are shopping for more
help in their defensive backfield. One quality player still
available that they're considering is former Ram strong safety Toby
Wright . . . We have Flutie Flakes and Jake's Flakes (named after
Cards QB Jake Plummer). What about Drew? How about Bleds-O's?

LORDS HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just in case polite men with short haircuts and federal
badges knock on their hotel doors anytime soon, the Lords of the
Rings have been given a brief rundown on the American legal system
_ and Mr. Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the right to speak with an agent if he asks for an
interview and also to refuse to speak,'' Francois Carrard, the
International Olympic Committee's director general, told the
members at their recent meeting in Seoul. ``You also have the right
to be assisted by a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, which is still investigating the Salt Lake City payoff
scandal, has already interviewed several Lords, including
Switzerland's Marc Hodler, the chief whistleblower. And since
members come to the States frequently (and the executive board will
meet in Salt Lake next year), the IOC wants to make sure they're
ready for the ominous knock on the door. Not all of the members

   As expected, the IOC members rubber-stamped the new ethics code
proposed after the Salt Lake scandal. In short, the Lords can't
solicit or accept anything of value from bid cities, can't have
conflicts of interest, and can't bring the Olympic movement into
disrepute. The old $200 limit for gifts, which was widely ignored
anyway, was scrapped. All that's allowed now are ``gifts of nominal
value in accordance with prevailing local custom.'' In other words,
no jewel-encrusted samurai swords, custom-made shotguns, or live
bulldogs. The IOC also made it easier to essentially boot out
wrongdoers without having to wait until its annual session. From
now on, the 11-member executive board can exclude members pending
expulsion . . . Lost in the shuffle among the vote for the 2006
Winter Games site and IOC reform was a decision to make Olympic
results unchallengeable after three years. That means that the push
to give medals to athletes (like swimmer Shirley Babashoff) beaten
by doped East Germans in the '70s and '80s is formally dead . . .
Can't convince the Swiss newspapers that Sion's loss to Turin as
2006 host was on the up-and-up. ``Sion _ May the Best Candidate
Lose,'' scowled Le Matin. ``It was revenge,'' declared
SonntagsBlick. Revenge, that is, for Hodler fueling the Salt Lake
scandal by claiming a quarter of his colleagues had been on the
take for years. Nonsense, say the Italians, who claim Sion was
overconfident and arrogant and never took Turin seriously.
Meanwhile, Italian skier Alberto Tomba, Turin's star pitchman,
vowed to open 2006 bottles from his expansive wine collection to
celebrate.

   Yes, there was a US outdoor track and field championships last
month. It was merely held a week later than scheduled to avoid TV
conflicts with women's World Cup soccer and golf's US Open. Only a
few surprises and little marquee drama _ Maurice Greene skipped the
100 because he's already automatic for this summer's world
championships in Seville, Spain, Michael Johnson pulled out of the
meet with a quadriceps twinge, and Marion Jones was competing on a
twisted knee. Most notable moments were Regina Jacobs becoming the
first American to pull off the ``Nurmi double'' in the 1,500 and
5,000 and Adam Goucher knocking off US record-holder Bob Kennedy in
the 5,000. Just missing the world team (by .69 of a second in the
1,500) was Brookline's Jonathon Riley, now a Stanford undergrad . .
. Easy preliminary draw for the US men's basketball team (nine NBA,
three collegians) for the regional Olympic qualifier that begins in
San Juan in mid-month _ Uruguay, Canada, Argentina, and Cuba. All
the Americans need do is make the finals (presumably against
Brazil) to get a ticket to Sydney. Since they'll be playing 10
games in 11 days, they're spending minimal time in camp _ a week in
Orlando, Fla., starting Tuesday, with one tuneup against the
Canadians . . . Yet another extension, until mid-September, for the
NHL to make up its mind whether to have its players compete in the
2002 Winter Games. The original February deadline had already been
pushed to August. The sticking points haven't changed _ the league
wants NBC to show games in prime time and wants big games moved
from the E Center to the larger Delta Center.

   Quick intervention for Russian world figure skating champion
Alexei Yagudin, who was booted off the Champions on Ice tour last
month for being drunk and offensive. He's already under a doctor's
care back home to see whether the 19-year-old Yagudin is an
alcoholic or just a party boy with too much money and too little
supervision. After Oksana Baiul's nasty drinking problems after she
won the 1994 gold medal, the skating people are taking no chances.
Yagudin's indiscretions _ racially-offensive remarks _ will cost
him between $25,000 and $50,000, what he would have earned on the
tour's final 16 stops . . . The first US Olympians for next
summer's Sydney Games have already been chosen _ Anna Kozlova and
Tuesday Middaugh will be the synchronized swimming duet . . . No
real upsets in the latest batch of US trials for this summer's
world rowing championships in Ontario. Ian McGowan-Dan Perkins and
Norwood's Carol Skricki-Cindy Brooks won the men's and women's
doubles and the camp boat (Ransom Weaver-Dave Sanderson-Marc
Millard-Sean Groom) won the men's lightweight quad . . . The US is
sending more than 270 athletes in 10 of the 12 sports (all but
soccer and tennis) to the biennial World University Games, which
began Saturday in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. New England competitors
include Kristin Beaney (Wayland and Princeton), Emily Carlsten
(Warwick, R.I., and Florida) and Ann Croose (Old Mystic, Conn., and
Virginia) in track and field, Scoonie Penn (Salem and Ohio State)
and Kevin Freeman (UConn) in men's basketball, Katie Zimbone
(Needham and Arizona) in swimming, and Justin Toman (Wallingford,
Conn., and Michigan) in gymnastics. Eight Olympians, five of them
fencers, are on the roster. The Americans, who've topped the medal
table at the last four WUGs, are expected to dominate again.

SAMPRAS AND AGASSI ARE IN FINAL FORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Well, that settles it. Now we know who's No. 1. All
that's left is a little formality known as the Wimbledon men's
final, which is also an irrelevancy as far as the ATP Tour computer
is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping Patrick Rafter, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, in the
semifinals Saturday, Andre Agassi guaranteed that he will climb
from No. 4 to the top. By beating England's pride and joy, Tim
Henman, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4, Pete Sampras guaranteed that he will
fall from first to third no matter the result on Centre Court
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That makes perfect sense, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   It does to the computer, which places more emphasis on Agassi's
recent report card, especially his French Open triumph, than on the
performance of Sampras, who has established a record by ending the
last six years at No. 1 but in 1999 has won only the Queen's Club
Wimbledon tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who in the past has insisted that preserving his place
at the top and winning Grand Slam events are his top priorities,
didn't seem particularly perplexed by the fact that the bizarre ATP
computations have made such a parlay impossible Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ranking at this point is secondary,'' he said. ``Andre and
I want to hold up the cup, and that's what's on our mind. The
ranking is the ranking, and I'm not concerned about dropping. I'm
more concerned about getting ready for tomorrow and hopefully
winning the Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, he can claim a couple of consolation prizes. Having
won five of the last six Wimbledons, he would displace Bjorn Borg
and Laurie Doherty as the All England Club's most decorated man of
this century. And it would be his 12th career Grand Slam triumph _
joining two Australian and four US Opens atop his mantel _ which
would tie Roy Emerson's all-time record.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, too, has a sense of urgency about Sunday. As unlikely as
it might have seemed, his French conquest made him only the fifth
man ever to win the career Grand Slam. He is seeking to become the
first man since Borg (1980) to win the French Open and Wimbledon in
the same year. But he has only one of each, and he said at the
start of this tournament that he'd like to start acquiring some
companion pieces.
</P>
<P>
   And he, too, wasn't thinking in terms of ratings despite his
astonishing ascendancy to the top from his low of No. 142, where he
plummeted during one of his many phases, the one in question as
celebrity escort/husband of the former Mrs. Agassi, Brooke Shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't advise it to anybody, dropping to 142 in the world,''
said Agassi, who had fallen off the skyscraper from his No. 1 perch
of 1996. ``It's a long way back. It is (gratifying). It certainly
reflects a lot of hard work, but I'm far from satisfied. I've come
here to win. You don't come here just to accomplish a little
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by recent performances, Agassi looks more likely to
achieve his objective. Saturday's win was his 13th straight, and he
dominated the world's No. 2 player, Rafter, whose loss won't affect
his ranking. Agassi has looked invincible throughout the fortnight,
and Rafter was no match for his flaming returns of serve and
baseline lasers.
</P>
<P>
   Having fulfilled both a singles and doubles agenda until the eve
of this match, Rafter could have pleaded fatigue, but he would have
none of that. It was Agassi who made him look tired, said the
always forthright Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was on for him today,'' said Rafter. ``He was very
powerful with everything he did. I know he's capable of doing that,
but he never let me in at all in those first two sets. I was just
totally outplayed. I ran into someone too good on the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Top seed Sampras guaranteed a star-spangled final on the Fourth
of July but wasn't nearly as impressive as his fellow American. For
the second day in a row, he dropped the first set. He got a bye in
the quarterfinals when Mark Philippoussis pulled up lame in the
second set. Saturday Sampras needed to recover after receiving
treatment for a groin strain in the second. He started nailing his
second serves and returning with a vengeance, thus ushering out
sixth seed Henman and extending England's drought without a native
king of its own tournament since Fred Perry, 63 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come back from being a set down,'' Sampras said,
``but once I got that second set, I really felt that was a huge
turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows he can't afford a similar stuttering start Sunday. Then
again, he's won 45 of his last 46 matches here, and the numbers
don't lie. Do they?

TRAMPLED  
 WALKS IN 10TH SINK D-BACKS' BULLPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In what has become a recurring nightmare, the
bullpen marched the Diamondbacks toward another slow death Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Three Arizona relievers combined to give up a single and three
walks in the bottom of the 10th inning that led to a bitter 2-1
loss for the Diamondbacks, who couldn't put away a struggling St.
Louis Cardinals club.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, coupled with San Francisco's sixth straight victory,
dropped the Diamondbacks two games behind the National League
West-leading Giants. May 10 was the last time the Diamondbacks were
more than one game out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's easy to point to the club's embattled bullpen as
the primary culprit for the two-week slide in the standings, a
closer look reveals the Diamondbacks are getting a firsthand look
at the natural growing pains some of their young relievers are
experiencing.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim, who walked two in the top of the 10th, and
Vicente Padilla, who walked Mark McGwire on four pitches with the
bases loaded and ended the game, are 20 and 23 years old,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Making their meteoric climb to the majors more difficult, each
has been in the United States less than three months. Kim is South
Korean, and Padilla is Nicaraguan. The two have combined for 27
minor league appearances _ all of them this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a little stage right now _ with Gregg Olson and
Darren Holmes on the disabled list _ where we have no other choices
now,'' Manager Buck Showalter said. ``Consistency comes from
experience. And the only way to get experience is from
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Toss in Vladimir Nunez, a 24-year-old Cuban defector who arrived
in the United States in 1996, and half of the Diamondbacks' six
relievers have less than one combined year of big-league service
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three have a chance to be outstanding major league
pitchers,'' Showalter said. ``But very rarely does a guy come to
the majors and succeed from the beginning. It comes in phases.
Ideally, we would like to phase them in, like we did with Vladimir
late last year and early this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Padilla, who was signed after he was seen pitching for
Nicaragua's national team last year, stepped into as difficult a
situation as possible Saturday when he entered with two outs, the
bases loaded and McGwire stepping to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Padilla's first pitch, a slider, seemed to cross over the heart
of the plate. But veteran home plate umpire Bruce Froemming saw it
as Ball 1. An obviously disturbed Padilla appeared to become
rattled. His next three pitches, all fastballs, were nowhere near
the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, the more you try to throw a pitch somewhere, the
harder it is to do,'' said Padilla, whose stratospheric 81.00 ERA
is the result of just one-third of an inning pitched.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Padilla and Kim sat motionless for more than 10
minutes, staring blankly into their lockers. As Padilla, who has
been with the big-league club 10 days, searched for answers in his
stall, teammate Omar Daal consoled the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you throw a pitch that's a strike and the umpire doesn't
call it, you have to throw the next one right over the plate,''
said Daal, a Venezuelan native. ``You can't try to find a little
area here or there within the strike zone. Throw it over and win or
lose that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these guys are here, it's because they can pitch. At first,
being here (in the United States) is not that easy. But . . . the
game is the same here as it is in all countries. Whatever language
we speak, we all know the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss spoiled a masterful performance from starter Armando
Reynoso, who threw every imaginable kind of pitch in giving up one
run and two hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks managed to tie the score in the top of the
ninth on a freakish play that ended when Cardinals catcher Alberto
Castillo threw wildly to first base after a rundown. Castillo's
error allowed Matt Williams to easily score from second base and
send the game into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be some situations that are tough,'' injured
pitcher Todd Stottlemyre said of the young relievers. ``These guys
are going to help us win games. They're good. If it was easy, there
would be a lot of major league pitchers out there on the street.'' &QL;

TANK EMPTY, JARRETT CRAWLS TO WIN

 400-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ As he turned laps at a torrid pace during
a practice session Friday afternoon at Daytona International
Speedway, Dale Jarrett accidentally flattened a turtle that was
trying to cross the racing surface to get to Lake Lloyd, the body
of water in the track's infield.
</P>
<P>
   While the mishap caused front-end damage to Jarrett's car, it
seemed to be an omen when Saturday &UR;  &LR; night the NASCAR Winston Cup
points leader was forced to maintain a tortoise pace on the final
two laps _ which were run under caution _ to steer his fuel-starved
No. 88 Ford Credit Taurus to Victory Lane in the Pepsi 400 before a
prime-time CBS audience and a live Daytona crowd of 190,000.
</P>
<P>
   When his car finally sputtered on pit row, prompting his crew to
rush out and push it to Victory Lane, Jarrett realized he might not
have won had he run the final two laps at speed. Jarrett said Dale
Earnhardt, who finished second at Daytona for the sixth time in his
career, would've emerged as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another second place at Daytona,'' said Earnhardt, ``just what
we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a well-executed pit stop for a quick splash of gas during
a timely caution with two laps to go that enabled Jarrett to hold
on for his third victory of the season. His car crawled across the
finish line with nothing more than fumes in the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've been close,'' said Jarrett, who along with earning
$164,965 for the victory extended his lead in the points race over
second-place Bobby Labonte to 177 points (2,674 to 2,497). ``I was
trying to save fuel. I ran out after the checkered on the
backstretch, so it would've been awful close. I think I would've
made it, but, man, it was awful close.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin, who had qualified third fastest during Thursday
night's pole qualifications, was relegated to the back of the field
when he smashed up his primary car in a wall crash along the
backstretch during Friday night's practice session. Martin, who
initially reported some tenderness in his left wrist, wound up
suffering a fracture and had it placed in a cast Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He was forced to start 43d in his backup car, which was the same
one he crashed in February's Daytona 500. He finished 17th
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Pole-sitter Joe Nemechek faded from view after the first dozen
laps of close-quarter action, dropping back to 23d on Lap 44.
Nemechek first surrendered the lead to outside pole-sitter Ricky
Rudd, who led Laps 5-14 before relinquishing it to Rusty Wallace,
who held the lead for the most laps (75).
</P>
<P>
   With 16 laps to go, the field pitted under green-flag
conditions. Jarrett, who along with many of the leaders, came in
for fuel and emerged in first place ahead of Wallace. Earnhardt,
however, was the only driver among the leaders to take on tires, on
the right side, in addition to fuel.
</P>
<P>
   That loomed as a huge advantage when the leaders were bunched up
by the second caution of the night on Lap 147. There was debris on
the track when Kenny Irwin's car tore out of the pits with the gas
catch-can still attached. But Earnhardt's advantage was neutralized
when Jeremy Mayfield spun out in front of heavy traffic as he
exited Turn 4 and prompted the race's third and final yellow,
allowing the field to make pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is special,'' said Jarrett, a two-time Daytona 500
winner, of his first Pepsi 400 victory. ``To be here in Victory
Lane on July 4th weekend, when all of America is celebrating, is
special.''

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The last time he visited Daytona
International Speedway, Dale Jarrett wiped out in the Daytona 500
and limped away from the monster 2.5-mile trioval after finishing
37th. After completing 134 of 200 laps Feb. 14, Jarrett crashed his
red, white, and blue No. 88 Ford Credit Taurus in a Turn 4 melee
and left in 36th place _ a distant 36th place _ in the
all-important Winston Cup points standings.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Daytona for Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's Pepsi 400,
Jarrett arrived as the series points leader and expanded his
cushion to 177 points over second-place Bobby Labonte (2,674-2,497)
with his third victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Did Jarrett ever imagine, after duffing it in February, it was
possible to return to Daytona in July, at the halfway point of
season, as the early leader in the clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah,'' said Jarrett, who leapfrogged from fifth to
first in the points after a May 15 victory at Richmond. ``I mean,
it's a long (season), and you realize how crazy this sport is. I
can't say that I thought we would not have any problems to this
point, but we basically haven't. Since Daytona, the closest we've
come to a problem in a race was at Las Vegas, our only race where
we finished out of the Top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   After his disappointing Daytona effort, Jarrett quickly
rebounded with a runner-up effort at Rockingham, N.C., but suffered
a setback in the third race of the season when he finished 11th at
Las Vegas. ``And that's because we ran out of gas,'' Jarrett said.
``That's the only setback we've really had. Now there have been
days where we've struggled, but we've made something out of it. But
I know we've got the team that's capable of putting together these
type of races and these type of streaks. I just hope that we can
continue, and hopefully the next time we're talking in Daytona,
it'll be about our first Winston Cup championship.''
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of marks would Jarrett give his crew at the halfway
point?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think for a total performance, I guess, as far as
getting the most out of what you got, the guys definitely would
have to get an `A,' '' Jarrett said. ``Can we get better? Yeah, I
think we can be an A-plus team. We can run better. We can finish
fourth or fifth without having to come from 25th to do that. That's
one side we want to improve this second half of the season. On days
when we're struggling to run fifth, maybe we can take those days
and turn them into seconds or firsts.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jarrett were to capture his first Winston Cup championship
this year, he would deliver Ford Motor Co. only its third title
since 1988. The late Alan Kulwicki was the last to do so in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's surprising, especially with all the good Ford
teams they've had over the years, that they haven't been able to
win the championship,'' Jarrett said. ``But hopefully it's
something that's going to change this year.''
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday &UR;  &LR; night Dale Jarrett was halfway home to that goal.
</P>

   Ricky Rudd's self-owned Winston Cup outfit _ Rudd Motorsports _
was thrown for a loss Wednesday afternoon when the veteran driver
learned his No. 10 Ford Taurus had lost its sponsor of nine years,
Tide, to an upstart team being fielded by Cal Wells. Procter &AMP;
Gamble, maker of Tide, offered Rudd the opportunity to continue
driving the Tide car for Wells's team. Rudd, in so many words,
politely declined. ``To anybody that's been around a while, it
doesn't make any sense,'' said Rudd, who seemed embittered by the
fact an upstart operation with no track record stole his sponsor.
``I don't understand it myself. Had they said, ` we're going with
Robert Yates or Rick Hendrick,' or something that is established
and outperforming us this year _ and I even told them, `Hey, guys,
if you've got a chance to go with Mark Martin, Jack Roush, or Jeff
Burton, that's the place to go right now. They've got the hot
team.' But I don't understand this.'' Said Jarrett: ``I'm in no
position to judge what a company does with their money, but a guy
who's won at least one race for 15 or 16 years like Ricky has,
there aren't a lot of people who can say that. They've been in
Victory Lane, which is something a lot of people can't say, then to
go to a totally unproven team, you wonder sometimes exactly where
their strategy is at.'' Tide's move also caught Larry McReynolds
off guard. McReynolds, crew chief for Mike Skinner, had designs of
starting his own Winston Cup team and mistakenly thought he had
convinced Tide to come aboard as a sponsor, but, evidently, Tide
didn't come clean. ``They basically told us everything was right,''
McReynolds groused. ``We had all the I's dotted and all the T's
crossed. They were a little nervous about going with a new team.
But they kind of threw that theory out the window.'' . . . In other
surprising sponsor moves, US Tobacco Co., out of Greenwich, Conn.,
and Valvoline announced they were pulling the plug on their
commitments. Wednesday, US Tobacco announced it was not renewing
its Skoal Racing sponsorship with Andy Petree Racing next year due,
in large part, to the company's compliance obligations under the
Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement signed last year.
Garnis Hagen, VP of marketing and promotion for US Tobacco, said
the company's ``departure as a team sponsor _ whose span of 18
consecutive seasons is second only to STP _ marks a change in
direction, but not in our company's belief in the sport of NASCAR
and its legion of adult race fans.'' Friday, Valvoline announced it
was pulling out of open-wheel racing, leaving CART owner Derrick

   Juan Montoya continued his hot streak in the CART FedEx
Championship Series by winning last week's Medic Drug Cleveland
Grand Prix at Burke Lakefront Airport. Montoya, the 23-year-old
Colombian whiz kid, staved off a hard-charging de Ferran and
overcame wet and wild conditions at the rain-soaked 2.106-mile
temporary road course to record his fourth triumph of the season .
. . Montoya's first victory at Cleveland wound up being his last
when the race's promoter, IMG Motorsports, bolted from the CART
series and signed a deal with the Indy Racing League to become an
oval event in 2000. CART officials moved quickly to shore up the
loss on its schedule by announcing a multiyear contract extension
with the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. ``It was CART's desire to
continue to race at Cleveland, and it is unfortunate we could not
come to an agreement,'' said Andrew Craig, CART chairman and CEO. .
. . As part of his comeback from a serious right leg fracture
suffered in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona, Andy
Santerre, the 30-year-old native of Cherryfield, Maine, will
attempt to qualify for two Busch North Series events at New
Hampshire International Speedway and Watkins Glen. Santerre will
attempt to qualify for the Pennzoil/Replacement Auto Parts 100 at
NHIS. ``I always love racing at Loudon,'' said Santerre, whose plan
is to gain more seat time in the Busch North cars so that he can
make up for lost time. ``I consider it my home track, and I have
more laps around that track than probably any other Busch Series or
Winston Cup driver.''

PADEN PROVES TOUGH ON OUT-OF-TOWNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE _ Forget about Indiana. Downey's Steve Paden showed
they can race in California, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paden proved the point by winning Saturday night's USAC Western
Midget series feature race before 5,434 at Irwindale Speedway, a
midget event that included some of the top drivers from Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to beat those guys from Indiana,'' Paden said,
referring to national midget standout Tracy Hines of Newcastle,
Ind. ``That's where we all want to be, so to run with those guys
and beat those guys, that says a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Other feature winners were 16-year-old sensation Josh Wise in
USAC TQ Midgets and Reedley's Jim Tartaglia in CAM 360 Super
Modifieds.
</P>
<P>
   Neither were as dominant as Paden, who the final 21 laps and won
by 2.126 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first time I've run this car,'' Paden said. ``I
was just feeling it out and watching the lines everyone else was
taking. I don't like to lead early on, once I saw where everyone
was, that's when I picked it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Points leader Mark DeBeaumont finished second, with Bobby Boone
third. Wally Pankratz, who qualified second, finished 18th,
retiring with a mechanical problem. Hines, who set a track record
in qualifying, finished 18th after suffering an engine failure
after four laps.
</P>
<P>
   Tartaglia, who qualified second, took advantage of a late
caution to win the 25-lap feature.
</P>
<P>
   Tartaglia trailed leader Jim Birges by nearly 10 car lengths
when Willie Northamer blew an engine, bringing out the caution on
lap 15.
</P>
<P>
   Birges got the jump on the restart, but Tartaglia quickly closed
the gap and passed him for the lead between turns 3 and 4 on lap
18.
</P>
<P>
   Birges, not fazed, reclaimed the lead on the backstretch. But
Tartaglia responded a second time and went low in turn 3 to take
the lead for good on lap 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to credit the crew,'' Tartaglia said. ``The car was
just perfect. It would stick wherever I put it. I was just lucky
enough to drive it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tartaglia took it from there, leading the final six laps before
winning by 2.79 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is just awesome,'' Tartaglia said. ``It's one great
race track and I'm glad I won here.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise showed his ability to come back as well. He started sixth,
then took advantage of a caution on lap nine to take the lead for
good. Wise, who won here in May, took the lead on the restart,
going low between turns 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   He then dominated the final 11 laps before beating Greg Edenholm
at the finish by 1.205 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to be patient, said Wise, who narrowed the
gap between him and TQ Midget points leader Randi Pankratz.
``(Edenholm) was having a little problem on the restarts. He did a
little bobble and I was able to get by him.''

 &HT;    Appalachia residents pull themselves out of poverty's pit
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MCKEE, Ky. _ Tracy Bingham and her family grew up like many
around here. The rugged Appalachians corralled them, funneled them
to tobacco fields then cut them off from the economic explosion
that has roared through the South this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But, slowly, like the mountains themselves, the economic
landscape is shifting. Patches of homegrown commerce poke through
heavy layers of poverty in Jackson County.
</P>
<P>
   In between valley tobacco, abandoned Chevy pickups and rocky
outcrops next to winding two-lanes, a new convenience store springs
up here, a tax office there.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham's 18-year-old daughter, Misty, didn't like her options
after high school _ a minimum-wage factory job or boring college
courses. So in March, mother and daughter opened a combination
bakery-photo studio.
</P>
<P>
   Visions &AMP; Sugarplums isn't about to challenge, say, Pepperidge
Farms. The shop might not make money for another three months in a
county where the U.S. Census says nearly four of every 10 people
live in poverty. Still, the Binghams breathe hope into Appalachia
as business owners in a land commerce forgot.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was scheduled to visit Jackson County and
other parts of eastern Kentucky today as he starts a six-state trip
designed to encourage industry and entrepreneurship in America's
poorest communities. Clinton is courting congressional votes for
his New Markets Initiative. The plan proposes corporate tax credits
for companies that invest in what he calls the country's ``untapped
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Not since Lyndon Johnson came to the Kentucky Highlands 35 years
ago has a presidential visit focused on Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says we've made a mark,'' said Bingham, the wife of a
tobacco farmer. ``They know we're out here. We do matter, and there
is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Clinton announced that Jackson and two other Kentucky
counties qualified for one of the nation's first rural
``empowerment zones.'' The anti-poverty program made available $40
million in federal grants and tax incentives for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   There's been some success. Jackson County's unemployment rate
has plummeted. A police department will be built. A new theater and
new sewer system are planned. More business prospects are calling,
including an Internet company whose parent firm is in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   But empowerment zones promised more than jobs, which come and
go. The bigger promise was giving a voice to residents who had been
left out while the community broke down. Some Jackson County
residents claim the zone lets small-town bosses wield control like
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's perfect, because nothing is,'' said Mary
Purkey, a McKee native and Jackson County's third empowerment zone
administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Purkey's customers include the Binghams. Now, they hope to find
better lives in French vanilla cakes and the one-room photo studio
next to the display case of crullers, raspberry pastries and
bourbon balls.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Bingham, 39, funded her start-up with a $20,000
``microloan'' to pay for her $500-a-month lease, freezers, stoves
and refrigerators. The money came from the empowerment zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been decorating cakes out of my home for 10 years but
couldn't think of starting my own business,'' said Bingham, a
full-time aide for the county school board. ``I really couldn't
afford to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She keeps her day job for the health insurance. Bingham gets off
work at 4:30 p.m., comes to the shop and bakes sometimes till
midnight. A part-time cashier, Misty Bingham shoots prom photos and
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year will be hard, but we just hope to build on
that,'' Tracy Bingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Her business would have been plum crazy 10 years ago. Decades
before that, coal companies in neighboring towns had gone bust.
That meant farmers who had been lured away by more money in a month
than they could make in a year returned to their fields in isolated
Jackson County.
</P>
<P>
   Towns failed to build their own tax bases, leaving them unable
to fund basic services. Coal money stopped flowing into school
systems, and now nearly half the residents in the Kentucky
Highlands don't have a high school education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any factories. Nobody had any money,'' Bingham
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, Jackson County's unemployment rate raged at
24 percent, poverty hung like a heavy fog and the Wal-Mart 30
minutes away killed local clothing stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of development that occurred produced a dependency on
these companies to provide services,'' said Ron Eller, director of
the Appalachian Center at the University of Kentucky. ``There's a
myth that Appalachia is poor from the lack of development. It's
just that the development patterns bypassed rural places like
Jackson County.''
</P>
<P>
   The president will fly to the Mississippi Delta on Tuesday to
tour another empowerment zone. Clinton might have ventured deeper
into Appalachia but the closest airport that could accommodate Air
Force One was in Lexington. He's travelling by helicopter to seven
other Kentucky counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a statement unto itself,'' Eller said.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of making life better, economic expansion in the
mountains has produced deep growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   The zones were designed to draw visions from the whole
community, not just traditional small-town cronies. However, a 1997
report by a Jackson County citizens group assembled to monitor the
empowerment board concluded that grass-roots participation was
discouraged by longtime insiders who pushed their own agendas.
Meetings that were supposed to be open were conducted secretly, and
residents rarely showed up when the meetings were public.
</P>
<P>
   The county administrator at the time, since voted out of office,
responded then that anyone who would say that ``has to be not just
ignorant but completely stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tremors, Jackson County seems to be climbing out of
its hole. Unemployment stands at 4.1 percent. The roll of welfare
families in the county has fallen nearly 80 percent the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not been easy,'' said Purkey, the county empowerment zone
administrator. ``We've had a generational pocket of poverty. It
descended on us in the 1940s and kept us there. People couldn't
learn how to get out. Instead of a helping hand they had a handout.
People just accepted poverty as a lifestyle, `I'll go get my food
stamps today.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Purkey's father grew tobacco and ran a grocery store. What he
couldn't buy he traded for with saws, pigs, tires _ whatever was on
the farm. The family got by all right but Purkey didn't realize how
poor they were till she traveled with a friend to Ohio and saw a
house with hallways. Her childhood house had four big rooms shared
among five siblings. ``We didn't have hallways. We had doorways,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   McKee (population 1,000) now boasts a plastics factory that
makes field vests for U.S. Marines, video rental stores and the
brand-new Deer View convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround began in 1985 when Mid-South Electrics opened a
plant in a Jackson County tobacco field. With 800 workers, the
company is the county's largest employer. It has taken out nearly
$2 million in empowerment zone loans. It is expected to be the
first stop on Clinton's tour.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor is JCR Industries Inc., a company that trains
people others have given up on. Some are uneducated while others
just don't know the basics it takes to keep a job _ showing up on
time, showing up every day, combing your hair. Most prospects are
referred by social agencies.
</P>
<P>
   JCR teaches skills that transfer to the factory floor _ sewing,
plastic injection, wire harnessing. The company moved into a $1
million building funded by the empowerment zone and now employs 100
people.
</P>
<P>
   Darlene Wilson, 40, has worked there for a year. Just before
coming to JCR, the electricity and water had been cut off at her
two-bedroom house. She married at 16, has four kids, and was about
to tumble into Appalachia's deepest crevice, a hole filled with
generations that followed generations of poor.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, James, worked odd jobs because he lacked education.
Wilson, whose parents received food stamps when she grew up, failed
her GED, has no driver's license and depends on public transit.
</P>
<P>
   In her new job, Wilson has learned to fasten a terminal at the
end of a strand of wires that is used in telephone handsets.
Minimum wage goes a long way in paying bills, even letting Wilson
splurge on a few new dresses for church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel good about myself that I'm being trained,''
Wilson said. ``I've always had hope.

`OUT FOR GOOD': TRACING THE RISE OF THE GAY RIGHTS MOVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Stephen O. Murray is the author of ``American Gay'' and a
dozen other books.) 
(Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By STEPHEN O. MURRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At its best, ``Out for Good'' vividly reports the activism and
intramural conflicts of the 1970s gay and lesbian movement. The
middle of this book is superb, but its frame weakens it. To end
with the funeral of a Los Angeles political patron, Sheldon
Andelson, in 1987 is peculiar. An epilogue about Bill Clinton's
campaign promises of 1992 is even stranger.
</P>
<P>
   Neither phenomenon makes sense as the climax of the gay and
lesbian movement. Was the goal of the historical figures discussed
in this book only to be a rarely greased cog in the Democratic
Party? For some, it was. But there were and are gay and lesbian
congeries of activist sex radicals, socialists and gay
libertarians, not just caucuses of the Democratic Party. The
authors, Dudley Clendinen, an editorial writer for The New York
Times, and Adam Nagourney, a metropolitan reporter for The Times,
largely ignore the many disparate groups of gay and lesbian
advocates seeking broad social or political changes to dote on
those seeking to be part of one political party.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the book with the Stonewall Inn ``riot'' may make sense
for an account of New York gay politics, but other than a symbol,
little developed from it. (Even for New York City, another raid _
on the Snake Pit later in the summer of 1969 _ was more
consequential for political organizing.) Before Stonewall, San
Francisco provided models and precedents both of impolite public
protests and of working with and within government for recognition
and protection.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly plenty in the book about San Francisco and
Los Angeles politics in the 1970s and '80s, but the foundational
role of gay organizing in those cities is ignored to repeat the
familiar tale of what was a false start in New York. Perhaps the
best indicator of New York's nonleadership is one the authors note.
The first municipal gay rights ordinance in the nation was
introduced in the New York City Council on Jan. 6, 1971. One was
enacted 15 years, two months and 14 days later _ following three
states, 11 counties and 48 other cities.
</P>
<P>
   After the unfortunate choice of an opening point, ``Out for
Good'' is actually less New York-centered than other histories of
the gay and lesbian movement during the '70s and '80s. It includes
richly detailed accounts of battles in Minnesota and Miami and of a
1973 fire bombing in New Orleans, though the major focal points are
California, Boston, New York and Washington. After detailed
accounts of the 1977 repeals of gay rights ordinances in Miami and
St. Paul, the authors mention but do not tell the story of the
first success in combating such a campaign (in Seattle in 1978).
</P>
<P>
   The authors also provide the perspectives of many female
leaders, both lesbian separatists and those eager to take over
organizations and to control resources mostly supplied by men. Yet
there is hardly anything about lesbian mobilizations around such
issues as child custody.
</P>
<P>
   The multiple narratives within the book are character-driven.
This makes it engaging reading. There are plenty of villains (most
of them egomaniacs), some heroes and heroines, and strong plot
lines about particular battles. The overall line of development is
obscure, not least because the book's two endings are so arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   With so many would-be leaders and so few followers of any
particular one, the authors' focus on those who commanded some
media attention at one time or another is predictable. Most of the
figures of the gay and lesbian movement who were prominent burned
out from infighting, were singed by attacks (often very personal
ones) or faded away from exhaustion. Many have died since 1992,
when work on this book began. Anyone interested in the perspectives
of earlier prominent figures in the gay and lesbian movement has to
be grateful for the prodigious efforts the authors made in
interviewing 330 people (some multiple times), and to hope that
their records will be available to future researchers.
</P>
<P>
   A truly definitive history, which the authors twice claim in the
introduction to have produced, has to look beyond celebrities and
leaders to those who worked out of the spotlight and to the ``free
riders'' _ that is, the many people who gained from movements to
which they contributed no time or energy. A definitive history
would also have to provide a clearer analytical framework.
</P>
<P>
   Along with individual profiles, a definitive history of the
American gay and lesbian movement needs to compare this movement
with those in other countries and with other contemporary movements
in the United States. The civil rights movement and the Christian
right are two with direct relations to the gay and lesbian
movement, and offer useful comparisons of relative success, amount
of infighting, frequency of schisms and so on. This lack is
especially surprising because Clendinen has written extensively
about the Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   But systematic comparisons would make the book even longer and
might not interest those who thrive on gossip about celebrities
(even mostly forgotten minor-league ones). Instead of jettisoning
background before Stonewall, the authors should have removed the
account of mobilizations around AIDS. Their account is more
reliable and far better substantiated than Randy Shilts', but there
are other, better analyses of AIDS activism (e.g., the second half
of Steven Epstein's ``Impure Science''). The authors dwell at
inordinate length on David Goodstein, who published The Advocate
for most of the years between 1975 and 1985 and repeatedly failed
to shape gay movement strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As prodigious as their interviewing efforts were, as interesting
and reliable and well documented as their reporting is, and as well
written as this book is, a more sweeping history not only of gay
politics but also of gay culture can be found in ``The Other Side
of Silence,'' by John Loughery. ``Out for Good'' is the best
history of gay mobilizations during the 1970s and useful on the
early '80s, but Loughery's more analytic history, with its longer
time frame, remains the best book so far available on the emergence
of 20th-century American gay culture and politics.

AFTER UPHEAVALS AT CNN, AN EXECUTIVE STILL STANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Richard N. Kaplan, the president of CNN/U.S.A., it has been,
to say the least, an intense year of news, both on the air and off.
</P>
<P>
   First came the fiasco known as ``Tailwind,'' a report about the
alleged use of nerve gas by U.S. forces in Vietnam, which appeared
on the initial edition of Kaplan's creation _ the news magazine
series ``Newsstand.'' The ``Tailwind'' report was retracted one
year ago this week, with an abject apology to the viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Then the three-night-a-week ``Newsstand'' fell flat in the
ratings and its future became the subject of wide speculation both
in and outside CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Finally came the Lou Dobbs episode. CNN lost its star in June,
the anchor of its big moneymaker ``Moneyline News Hour,'' when
Dobbs left for an Internet venture and article after article cited
Dobbs' tense relationship with Kaplan as a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after the year of turmoil, Kaplan is still standing and
is readying a plan to revamp the ``Newsstand'' format, which he and
Tom Johnson, the chairman of the network, are expected to present
soon to Ted Turner, the CNN founder and now vice chairman of its
parent company, Time Warner. ``I feel Rick has provided splendid
leadership,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   His critics inside CNN say Kaplan still has not come up with an
overall plan to find answers to one of CNN's biggest continuing
problems: generating ratings for CNN during slow news periods. But
he is generally credited with making a number of improvements,
including a total redesign of CNN's on-air look, consolidation of
its news anchors to improve quality and the elimination of repeats
in the network's hourly news cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The changes initiated by Kaplan have included bringing in news
anchors like Jeff Greenfield, Judd Rose, and Willow Bay, reducing
the number of daily anchors from 26 to 12, building separate staff
for each of the day's hourlong news segments, and increasing the
number of special reports turned out by the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made steady progress every week on all sorts of little
things,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the big things that got most of the notice. Dobbs was
one of the most important figures at CNN, not only because he was
the president of its financial news network, CNNfn, but because
``Moneyline'' brought in the biggest per-commercial price of any
show on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs declined to tie his departure directly to his differences
with Kaplan. But Kaplan acknowledged that ``there was tension''
between him and Dobbs. ``We were clearly different people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he had been thrust into the middle of the dispute
between the two men, which he called ``a clash of two dynamic
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   The main area of disagreement, Johnson said, was Dobbs'
conviction that Kaplan's ``Newsstand'' franchise was sucking up
financial resources that could have been going to CNNfn. ``Lou
really believed that,'' Johnson said. ``But he was mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan said money allocated to ``Newsstand'' was in a totally
separate budget that was never available to CNNfn, a point
supported by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But the focus on resources being directed toward ``Newsstand''
only underscored what one CNN executive, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, called ``the little secret'' inside the network: that
``Newsstand'' has not performed up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a politically sensitive subject at CNN,'' the
executive said. ``Nobody has said much about it. It's a little like
criticism in the Kremlin. The one person who criticized it was Lou
Dobbs. But the show has really had zero impact, and it has been
losing millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings for the series have certainly been low, and they got
even worse when Kaplan decided to move the show from a starting
time of 10 p.m. to 8 p.m. But he argued that an audience for any
show in television ``takes time to build.'' He said, ``It's about
continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   When he created the three-weekly edition of ``Newsstand,''
Kaplan was taking advantage of the associations with magazines also
owned by Time Warner. The shows are produced in conjunction with
Time, Fortune and Entertainment Weekly. Kaplan said he was
attempting to create ``appointment shows'' for the network.
</P>
<P>
   That had become a priority for CNN because the network's ratings
_ and profits _ tend to rise and fall with the tides of breaking
news. During big stories, the network does well; in slow news
periods, it struggles. Now that CNN has competition from both MSNBC
and Fox News, it is even more important to generate more dependable
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said CNN prized its reputation as the breaking-news
network. ``But I am not content simply being the breaking-news
network,'' he said. ``I really want us to have other shows that
people come to us for that are still within the news category.''
</P>
<P>
   But both executives conceded that it was possible viewers had
such built-in expectations that CNN would be reporting on the news
every hour that a preproduced news magazine might not be what they
were looking for. ``Viewers tuning in to see Kosovo may not want to
run into `Entertainment Weekly,''' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kaplan nor Johnson would say specifically what changes
they had in mind for the series. Johnson would only say, ``We may
be looking at doing segments of these shows inside other news
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kaplan disputed the charge that `Newsstand'' had been an
unusually expensive project to mount. He said that the three
editions of ``Newsstand'' cost less than a single edition of any
news-magazine program on a broadcast network.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is an area Kaplan is intimately familiar with, because he
was the original executive producer on ABC's ``Prime Time Live.''
He also served as executive producer on both ``Nightline'' and
``World News Tonight'' for ABC, winning more than 30 Emmy awards,
four Alfred I. Dupont-Columbia University Journalism Awards and
numerous other journalism prizes during his tenure at ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the credentials that induced Johnson to recruit Kaplan
so aggressively. He said he had worked on bringing Kaplan to CNN
for more than two years before he finally agreed to join the
network in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of the ill-fated ``Tailwind'' report on the
very first edition of the Time/CNN Sunday night edition of
``Newsstand,'' some CNN staff members engaged in serious debate
about Kaplan's future at the network.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson defended Kaplan then and he continues to now. He said
that while the ``Tailwind'' incident ``hurt badly,'' it ``hurt all
of us,'' and not merely Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who worked on that report were at CNN long
before Rick arrived,'' Johnson said. He added that he believed the
network was now past the fallout from the incident, and cited a
recent poll that showed 70 percent of the public saying they
trusted CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he continued to trust Kaplan. ``We are a much
stronger channel journalistically now,'' Johnson said. And, as if
to tamp down any doubt that might remain, Johnson added the
endorsement of the vice chairman and chairman of Time Warner for
good measure: ``Ted Turner and Gerry Levin feel the same way.''

   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ When it comes to portents of gloom, doom and
despair, the record industry has lately been ticking off a litany
of threats, real and imagined, posed by the Internet: Bands selling
new albums directly over the Net; independent artists and labels
posting thousands of music files online; music piracy on the Web,
and online audio sites creating vast libraries of tunes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the major labels show no signs of ceding their reign
over the music business. In fact, despite a few early setbacks and
some critical hurdles ahead, the recording industry now seems
intent on taking a leading role in digital distribution.
</P>
<P>
   That fact was underscored by the announcement last week that
recording, technology and consumer electronics companies had agreed
to standards for protecting music copyrights in online music sales.
In the last 18 months, the major labels have waged a remarkably
successful war against piracy on the Net, using their music
libraries and stables of popular artists as tools to persuade
technology companies to cooperate, and have positioned themselves
to dominate the digital music era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen months ago, people in the tech community told me I
was crazy to think we could develop an online music business'' that
protected copyright interests of artists and labels, said Hilary
Rosen, president and chief executive of Recording Industry
Association of America, which represents the five major record
labels _ Sony, Universal, Warner, BMG and EMI. But today, she said,
it was clear that ``we're moving out of the piracy era into a more
legitimate marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nathanson, a music industry analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co., said the standards announced last week by the
Secure Digital Music Initiative, a consortium representing the
recording, consumer electronics and computer industries, would not
mean a ``slam dunk'' for the labels to sell music online. Still to
be resolved, he noted, are pressing business model and technology
questions. But, he asserted, the industry had managed to dominate
the debate with its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collective good of these five companies overruled any
other competing interest,'' Nathanson said.
</P>
<P>
   That will become more apparent to consumers this fall, when the
major labels, which sell 85 percent of music in the United States,
begin putting their libraries online. They hope to have their
products in place for the Christmas season, when portable digital
players hit the market en masse, signaling the movement of online
music into the mainstream and creating new demand for downloadable
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not quieted cries from the nearly $14 billion
record industry that Internet piracy _ illegal copying and
downloading of music in cyberspace _ is costing labels and artists
tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last week of the consortium standards _
guidelines for preventing portable devices from playing illegally
obtained music _ complements the recording industry's continuing
effort to educate the public about music piracy and to crack down
on it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the industry has spent more than $1
million on an information campaign, predominantly at universities,
in an effort to persuade campuses to take steps to prevent piracy
and to persuade students not to participate in illicit swapping of
music files. Ms. Rosen said more than 200 universities had joined
RIAA's effort to discourage students from using campus computers or
Internet connections to make illegal copies of recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has also wielded a stick. Ms. Rosen said RIAA had
forced the shutdown of some 2,000 sites offering pirated copies of
music _ songs copied from commercial compact disks and uploaded to
the Internet _ by sending cease and desist letters to the Internet
service providers that hosted the sites. ``It used to be each day
our surfers would come and there would be hundreds of sites to go
after,'' she said. ``The number is significantly lower.''
</P>
<P>
   To others, the state of piracy remains a matter of debate.
Joanne Marino, chief executive and editor of Webnoize, an online
new-media and music industry publication, said last week that
piracy facilitated by Web sites appeared to have declined
significantly. But she said it was growing in other Internet
channels, including songs being exchanged as e-mail attachments or
made available in chat rooms or on Internet file-transfer, or FTP,
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Marino said a recent Webnoize survey of 2,000 college
students showed that digital downloading of music was increasing.
She said that from December 1998 to April, the survey found a 3,000
percent jump in the number of students who said they had downloaded
250 or more music files.
</P>
<P>
   But a more persuasive restraint to piracy than any single effort
by the music industry is consolidation in the online entertainment
industry, with larger, more established companies buying smaller
Internet start-ups. Among recent deals, America Online acquired the
online radio site Spinner.com; MTV's parent, Viacom, purchased
Imagine Radio, and Yahoo announced plans to acquire Broadcast.com.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Morgenstern, senior vice president for new media at the
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, or ASCAP,
which collects royalties for copyright holders, said that these
bigger companies were eager to play by established copyright rules.
And, he added, ``As more and more start-ups are interested in going
public, they are likely to take care of the rights situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That transition is likely to be sealed by the consortium
standards.
</P>
<P>
   So how did the music industry persuade technology companies and
consumer electronics makers to play along?
</P>
<P>
   Technology companies say they realized that the online music
market could become huge _ but only if the music companies agreed
to participate and to put their libraries online. That meant
acceding to the industry's demand that portable devices and desktop
computers be prevented from playing music downloaded illegally from
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative was to ``change the power structure of the
industry,'' said Phil Barrett, senior vice president for media
technologies at RealNetworks Inc., maker of Real Player. ``I'm not
sure it's a good thing, and it's not an easy thing. Creating a
marketplace that's easy is paramount. Without it, you don't have an
industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barrett, who sat in on the consortium talks, described them as
``surprisingly cooperative.'' But not all parties walked away with
a good taste in their mouths. Some Internet music companies that
post songs of independent labels and musicians said the major
labels had co-opted computer and electronics companies to brake the
momentum of the Net as an alternative source of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attempt to maintain control of distribution,'' said
Steve Grady, vice president for marketing for Emusic.com, a Redwood
City, Calif., company that sells 6,000 tracks by independent
artists. Grady said the industry may find that the train has
already left the station and that it will not be simple to create
technology that protects copyrights without hindering the
tremendous flexibility the Net now provides in permitting people to
trade, download, store and play music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet consumers have already chosen the operating
system for downloadable music. Right now, that's MP3,'' he said,
referring to a type of audio file that has frustrated the music
industry because it can be easily pirated.
</P>
<P>
   While members of the recording industry are expressing newfound
optimism, they also assert that the technological and business
challenges ahead will be steep. Larry Kenswil, president for
electronic commerce for Universal Music Group, the largest record
company, said the company planned to be online by Christmas but
that a ``full-fledged launch'' might happen only next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes an amazing amount of work to prepare the content,''
he said.

<P>
   The flags are out, the barbecues smoking, but this Fourth of
July in America has an odd feel about it. It seems more like Labor
Day 2000, the date next September that will kick off the
presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The two front-runners, Al Gore for the Democrats and George W.
Bush for the Republicans, are all but nominated and anointed. There
seems almost no point in dragging things on for another 14 months,
through tedious caucuses and primaries and party conventions.
Surely it's all over now.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent inevitability of these two candidates springs,
first, from money. Gore raised $18.5 million in the first half of
this year, scaring off all his rivals except Bill Bradley, a former
senator from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush raised $35.5 million, a record. And both have netted
almost all the political endorsements that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus armed, they will proceed into primary elections in which
three big, delegate-rich states _ California, New York and New
Jersey _ have moved up their vote to March 7, much earlier than
usual.
</P>
<P>
   If these three plump for the same candidate, the parties'
nominations will be tied up then and there.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets are not impossible, of course. On the Democratic side,
Gore _ for all his attempts to distance himself _ may find he
cannot shake the disreputable shade of Bill Clinton, and may suffer
more than he supposes from Bradley's popularity in the states that
vote on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, where ten rivals are squeaking around
him, George W. may yet be tripped up by his rakish past or by his
father's old ailment, foot-in-mouth disease.
</P>
<P>
   For both men, the close embrace of their party establishments
may damage them with voters. But by the same token, it is hard to
imagine _ short of giant scandal _ that either party will now
abandon the candidate on whom it has staked so much.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, this turn of events seems depressingly
undemocratic. The political debate has apparently ended before it
has even begun.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Republicans and left-wing Democrats alike are
dismayed, even furious, that the field has been left to two bland
centrists whose mottoes (Bush's ``compassionate conservatism'' and
Gore's ``practical idealism'') seem no more than vapid mush.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fears are misplaced. Yes, there will probably be two
centrist nominees; but that has very often been the result of the
primary process in recent years. Looking beyond the primaries to
the election itself, the prospects are as tantalizing _ and as
unpredictable _ as they have ever been.
</P>
<P>
   First, the candidates themselves. It is true that both are,
broadly speaking, centrists, but important distinctions are
emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is a meddler, whereas Bush believes in keeping government
in check; Bush is an unabashed free-trader, but Gore hedges his
enthusiasm with conditions; Bush has pledged not to raise taxes,
Gore has kept his powder dry.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, these positions mean little to voters lulled
along on the eighth year of an economic boom. And Alan Greenspan's
decision this week to raise interest rates by just a quarter of a
point, never mind that it was the first increase for two and a half
years, will do little to disturb their equanimity: the change had
been widely expected and when it came the markets applauded
politely.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fact remains, labor markets are too tight to avoid
wage-pressure indefinitely; and Wall Street remains exuberantly
overextended. These are risks.
</P>
<P>
   By election day, voters may well be asking themselves which
candidate, Bush or Gore, will do less harm to the economy. Looking
further ahead, voters must ask which man can meet the country's
biggest social-policy challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Two of America's costliest entitlement programs, Medicare
(health care for the elderly) and Social Security (pensions), will
go bust within a generation if they are not reformed. Both need
thoroughgoing change, not tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   Such change is made possible by budget surpluses that may be
$500 billion larger than estimated just last February. But it is
not yet clear which candidate would be braver.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is more inclined to keep Medicare and Social Security
solvent by spending budget surpluses on them. Bush may be willing
to privatize Social Security by introducing individual retirement
accounts (as The Economist would like) but he may well succumb
instead to an across-the-board tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   So this election is wide open and its effects long-lasting; and
not just in respect of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the
Republican majority is so slender that it might well be overturned
_ and popular loathing for the House Republicans means they could
suffer on election day even if Bush triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   If either candidate has coattails that reach right down to state
level, he can influence the party balance in the state legislatures
which, after 2000, will be redrawing the lines of congressional
districts (hence affecting future elections).
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, whoever wins will have the chance to change the color of
the Supreme Court. At present, the court has a very narrow, but
highly active, conservative majority which has been working, most
notably, to change the balance of power between the federal
government and the states.
</P>
<P>
   With two or three retirements likely to come in the next
presidential term, the conservatives could either be strengthened,
under Bush, or, under Gore, consigned to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In all these ways, the election of 2000 could prove more
exciting, and more decisive for the course of America, than many
before it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Gore and Bush caravans roll remorsely on, crushing
all before them; even if next year's primaries have all the
suspense of a seaside Punch and Judy show; even if neither
candidate puts a foot wrong (and that makes a lot of even-ifs), the
American political scene has seldom been so open to change.
</P>
<P>
   There is everything to play, and vote, for. &QL;

<P>
   Even if the Gore and Bush caravans roll remorsely on, crushing
all before them; even if next year's primaries have all the
suspense of a seaside Punch and Judy show; even if neither
candidate puts a foot wrong (and that makes a lot of even-ifs), the
American political scene has seldom been so open to change.
</P>
<P>
   There is everything to play, and vote, for. &QL;

DUPED EDITORS SHRUG OFF CONCERNS OVER PROMINENT PLAY FOR RUNAWAY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalists are often accused of being cynical. But you wouldn't
have known it last week.
</P>
<P>
   Bewitched by a 13-year-old Honduran boy's virtuoso fabrications,
every news outlet in New York passed along his fanciful tale: that
he had lost his immediate family in the mudslides caused by
Hurricane Mitch; that his father had sent him a letter with money
to bring him to New York and instructions to meet outside La
Guardia Airport; that he had traveled 3,200 miles to New York, by
hitchhiking and taking a bus, in search of a father he had never
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Hello, sweetheart. Get me rewrite! The New York news media,
reputed to eat nails for breakfast and disbelieve its various
mothers, swallowed it whole. On the kind of day that harked back to
the era of journalism romanticized in the Ben Hecht play ``The
Front Page,'' reporters clamored for details. And they found
confirmation everywhere they turned. Kind cafeteria patrons in
Florida had helped the boy. So had a Bronx livery driver. Most of
all, the police said they believed it.
</P>
<P>
   Even the neutral language of slugs _ abbreviated article names
used in newsrooms _ reflected the appeal of the young tale spinner.
``Boy's Quest'' was the slug The Associated Press gave its initial
article. Like the accounts themselves, it was poignant _ not to
mention false _ as reporters for Newsday and the AP discovered on
Tuesday when they visited the village of San Buenaventura, where
the boy, Edwin Daniel Sabillon, once lived with his grandmother. It
turned out that the boy's father had recently died and the boy had
been living with an aunt in Hialeah, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   If there was no joy in the city's newsrooms at the discovery,
there was little self-flagellation either. Stuart Marques, The New
York Post's managing editor, said the story should have been
questioned. ``I don't know what the lessons are,'' he said. ``You
don't want to always be so cynical. To say, `Oh, this kid is
pulling our legs.' The first reaction is to help the kid. Your
heart goes out to him. I think I'd rather be burned once in a while
than have no heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Purnick, the metropolitan editor of The New York Times,
which, like the Daily News, published the account on its front
page, said: ``I don't see this as a major black eye for the media.
I know that's the temptation. But I don't see it. Thanks to the AP,
we self-corrected pretty quickly. Other than putting a line in here
and phrase in there, we couldn't have done anything differently.
Ideally, we check out every fact we can _ but we couldn't.
Everything was pointing to this account being true.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with reporters who covered the story and their
editors revealed crucial obstacles to fact-checking. Most
importantly, the primary source, Edwin Sabillon, was unavailable,
so reporters fell back on the people he spoke to _ all of whom were
themselves fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the New York City Police Department had alerted
police-beat reporters to the boy's existence early on Monday
morning. When City Hall learned of the media interest in the story,
it clamped down on information. But there were leaks, some
reporters said, from people who seemed to be in the know.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the leaks indicated that there were documents partially
corroborating the boy's story. Messages were passed implying that
the police had read the letter the boy's father had supposedly sent
_ a letter that, it seems now, did not exist. Reporters received
strong hints that a firm that wires money to Central America had
confirmed it had sent money from the father, Grevis Sabillon, to
his son, and was searching its records for documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Edwin Sabillon is a child, and children tend to get the
benefit of any doubt _ particularly children who are suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect children to be as deceptive as this young boy
was, on such a grand and inventive scale,'' said Arthur J. Browne,
the senior managing editor of the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had fictionalized the minor details, he may have gotten
caught a lot easier,'' Browne said. ``The story was so larger than
life, and he had just enough of the brush strokes to make it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Moss, a professor at New York University who runs the
university's Urban Research Center, said the boy's account was a
parable that fit neatly into the symbolic shorthand that most
people use to understand events. ``Honduras became a symbol of
disaster,'' he said. ``Then there's immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Everybody wants to believe good news about New York.
This reinforced the mythology that people are dying to come here,
and when they get here, it welcomes them. Everyone wanted to
believe.''
</P>
<P>
   What three of the five major print outlets failed to do,
however, was telegraph prominently that, essentially, the boy was
the sole source for many crucial details. Only the New York Post
and the AP explicitly gave sources _ ``officials'' or ``the
police'' _ for the basic facts at the top of their articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone probably would have been well advised to use words
like `the boy says,' or `the boy says and the proper authorities
have invested it with a great deal of credibility,' '' Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Purnick agreed. ``In retrospect, of course, we should have
attributed'' the account. But even that ``wouldn't have changed the
tone'' of the final article, she added.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the best place to check the boy's tale was the
Honduran village where his grandmother lived. Newsday and the AP
were the only news organizations that moved quickly to get
reporters there _ though not, their editors say, because they were
skeptical of the boy's account. They simply wanted a good follow-up
article.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday morning, Newsday's reporter, Geoffrey Mohan, was in
the village of San Buenaventura, hearing the boy's grandmother and
uncle contradict the story. On Tuesday afternoon, Freddy Cuevas of
the AP was in the same place hearing the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' Browne said, ``this was not an error that causes
any harm. If anything, it's a misdemeanor of the heart. ''

BOOKSELLER IS READY TO OFFER TEXTBOOKS ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ky., Ill., Alaska, Texas, Colo.)  (lb) 
 By LISA GUERNSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An online bookshop has a new offer for college bookstores that
are struggling with the fickle business of textbook sales: Why not
let us sell those books for you instead?
</P>
<P>
   The company, Varsitybooks.com, plans to announce this week that
it has signed contracts with nearly a dozen small universities,
colleges, preparatory schools and distance-education programs to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the arrangements mean that schools are completely
closing their book-selling operations and sending their students to
the company's Web site to buy their textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   In each deal, the institutions will earn an undisclosed
percentage from the sale of each book through the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can outsource this and quite literally shut the door on
their bookstores,'' said Eric Kuhn, the president and chief
executive of Varsitybooks, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, students in large campus towns have always had the
option of buying textbooks from bookstores off campus, if they
could find ones that stocked the books they needed. But for
colleges, particularly smaller ones, there is an allure to turning
over sales of the textbooks that teachers order for their courses.
Textbook sales are the least profitable part of the business of
running a college store, according to the National Association of
College Stores.
</P>
<P>
   And the squeeze is becoming worse, some store managers say, now
that they are facing competition online from merchants like
Varsitybooks and other Internet start-up companies such as
Bigwords.com, in San Francisco, and Ecampus.com, in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this tough business environment, though, Jerry Buchs, a
spokesman for the National Association of College Stores, said that
most universities were not ready to relinquish their book selling
to an online company. Instead, he said, they will try to establish
a Web presence while maintaining their physical stores to provide
``one-on-one customer service.''
</P>
<P>
   Follett, a bookstore chain based in River Grove, Ill., is taking
that approach. It has built a Web site, www.efollett.com, that
provides online ordering for 600 brick-and-mortar stores that it
already manages and for about 150 others that pay Follett to be
part of its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Varsitybooks' Web site, which opened last summer, features book
lists from more than 200 colleges _ although, until now, not as the
exclusive sales agent for the schools.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the 11 institutions that have been willing to entrust
Varsitybooks with their textbook sales operations are small private
universities like Alaska Pacific University, preparatory schools
like St. Agnes Academy in Houston and distance-education programs
like ISIM University in Denver.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kuhn started the company with Tim Levy, a friend from his
law-school days at George Washington University. The men, both in
their 20s, said they wanted to give students an alternative to the
bother of standing in line for textbooks. They made a deal with
Baker &AMP; Taylor, a huge textbook distributor in Charlotte, N.C., to
fulfill orders placed through Varsitybooks.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Pacific University in Anchorage is one of the four-year
institutions that have signed up with Varsitybooks. Brian Douglas,
the university's assistant business manager, said he had asked for
the company's help in part because students were already starting
to shop online.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't participate, it is going to happen anyway,''
Douglas said. ``We'd rather do it in an organized fashion that
helps our students.''

   It flutters over every public building, and above thousands upon
thousands of suburban front doors; children salute it at school;
soldiers stand to attention before it; in its presence even
presidents sometimes shed a tear.
</P>
<P>
   There is surely no flag in the world quite as famous, quite as
instantly recognizable, as the ``stars and stripes'' _ ``Old
Glory,'' as Captain William Driver named it when in 1831 he set
sail from Salem, Mass., for the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign malcontents (be they Iranians under Ayatollah Khomeini,
or Serbs under Slobodan Milosevic) may detest it, but good-hearted
Americans worship it.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as on every July 4th, they will show their faith
by the millions as they variously sing and screech their way
through Francis Scott Key's ``The Star Spangled Banner.''
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly does this profession of faith mean? ``Nothing
is more embarrassing in the ordinary intercourse of life,'' wrote
Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, ``than this irritable patriotism of
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Since ``chauvinist'' derives from a Frenchman, this is perhaps
an example of the pot calling the kettle black. But it is easy for
non-Americans to see what de Tocqueville had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Most foreigners reserve their vocal outbursts of patriotism for
tennis matches and other forms of symbolic warfare. Americans are
less discriminating.
</P>
<P>
   Of course they love their sports teams, which is why much of the
televised Olympics coverage, for example, was edited to show the
American competitors in the best light _ regardless of reality in
some far off, foreign stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But is it really necessary for the typical television commercial
to proclaim that a breakfast cereal or a headache pill is
``America's favorite?'' Would sales plunge if it were also known to
be Mexico's favorite?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they would, given the average American's disdain for his
southern neighbor, although other foreigners do better: some TV
commercials proudly proclaim a product's ``European'' design.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying question is why the nationality has to be
defined in the first place _ and whether the constant allusion to
patriotism devalues it.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, depends on what you mean by patriotism.
``Our country, right or wrong'' is a definition that would make a
traitor of every American who disapproved of the Vietnam war _
which seems a bit harsh not just on ``Hanoi Jane'' Fonda but also
on the draft-dodger at present residing in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The better definition is surely a belief in those
characteristics that make America the envy of the world: the rule
of law; the democratic process; and the rights of the individuals
to believe and say whatever they wish.
</P>
<P>
   It is heartening that in a recent poll by the Pew Research
Center, the top three reasons cited for America's success are the
Constitution, free elections and free enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   How disheartening, then, that the great majority of Americans
apparently believe these strengths will be diminished unless the
star-spangled banner _ a piece of cloth with 50 stars and 13
alternate stripes _ is protected by law from burning and other acts
of ``desecration.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, the House of Representatives voted
305-124 for a constitutional amendment saying: ``The Congress shall
have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of
the United States.'' All the states except Vermont have passed
similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, if just two senators in Washington change their
minds, there will be enough votes in the country's legislatures to
amend the Constitution for only the 28th time in two centuries. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lest theory become reality, Americans would do well to consider
why the flag is not protected in the first place. On two occasions,
in 1989 and 1990, the Supreme Court has ruled that to desecrate the
flag is a right protected by the first amendment's guarantee of
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really sensible to limit that right for the sake of a
symbol? And how exactly would ``desecration'' be determined? There
have been only 70 or so political acts against the flag in the past
decade, but the image of the flag has been debased on coffee mugs
and T-shirts by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   By definition symbols convey meaning, and people therefore
tamper with them at their peril (witness the mixed emotions of race
and tradition when the Confederate flag is flown in the South, or
the horror when some white supremacist burns a cross or daubs a
swastika).
</P>
<P>
   But the flag that has represented the Union ever since 1777 will
be truly threatened only if Americans start tampering with their
idea of patriotism. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country right or wrong'' is a definition that
traditionally implied a willingness to die for America and its
values.
</P>
<P>
   In the First World War that meant some 114,000 American
servicemen sacrificed their lives in a conflict that was
essentially Europe's; in the Second World War, the American toll
was 292,000; in Korea it was 54,000; in Vietnam it was 58,000; and
in the Gulf war it was 383 (235 of them from accidents, training
deaths or ``friendly fire'').
</P>
<P>
   But what was it in Kosovo, supposedly the first war waged by
America solely for the humanitarian and civil ideals it holds dear?
The answer is that not one American lost his or her life in combat
(though two died in a helicopter accident).
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton asserted that because of America's
values, it was America's duty to go to war; yet, from the
beginning, he declared his unwillingness to put ground troops ``in
harm's way,'' as Captain John Paul Jones once put it when fighting
the British.
</P>
<P>
   War was to be a high-tech affair, waged from 15,000 feet above
the ground and pictured on the nation's TV screens almost as a
video game. This is not to belittle the skills of the high-tech
warriors, but it does raise an interesting question.
</P>
<P>
   If something is not worth dying for, can it still be worth
fighting for?
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters like to argue that America's patriotism is alive
and well, and that it has recovered from its post-Vietnam malaise
(some 70 percent of Americans polled last year considered
patriotism ``very important,'' compared with only 43 percent in
1976).
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that in the Vietnam era patriotism was put to
the test, and was genuine on both sides of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's patriotism too often seems for show, a
matter of waving the flag as if that alone will sustain America as
the land of the free and the home of the brave. &QL;

of ``desecration.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, the House of Representatives voted
305-124 for a constitutional amendment saying: ``The Congress shall
have the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of
the United States.'' All the states except Vermont have passed
similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, if just two senators in Washington change their
minds, there will be enough votes in the country's legislatures to
amend the Constitution for only the 28th time in two centuries. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (175-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lest theory become reality, Americans would do well to consider
why the flag is not protected in the first place. On two occasions,
in 1989 and 1990, the Supreme Court has ruled that to desecrate the
flag is a right protected by the first amendment's guarantee of
free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Is it really sensible to limit that right for the sake of a
symbol? And how exactly would ``desecration'' be determined? There
have been only 70 or so political acts against the flag in the past
decade, but the image of the flag has been debased on coffee mugs
and T-shirts by the millions.
</P>
<P>
   By definition symbols convey meaning, and people therefore
tamper with them at their peril (witness the mixed emotions of race
and tradition when the Confederate flag is flown in the South, or
the horror when some white supremacist burns a cross or daubs a
swastika).
</P>
<P>
   But the flag that has represented the Union ever since 1777 will
be truly threatened only if Americans start tampering with their
idea of patriotism. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country right or wrong'' is a definition that
traditionally implied a willingness to die for America and its
values.
</P>
<P>
   In the First World War that meant some 114,000 American
servicemen sacrificed their lives in a conflict that was
essentially Europe's; in the Second World War, the American toll
was 292,000; in Korea it was 54,000; in Vietnam it was 58,000; and
in the Gulf war it was 383 (235 of them from accidents, training
deaths or ``friendly fire'').
</P>
<P>
   But what was it in Kosovo, supposedly the first war waged by
America solely for the humanitarian and civil ideals it holds dear?
The answer is that not one American lost his or her life in combat
(though two died in a helicopter accident).
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton asserted that because of America's
values, it was America's duty to go to war; yet, from the
beginning, he declared his unwillingness to put ground troops ``in
harm's way,'' as Captain John Paul Jones once put it when fighting
the British.
</P>
<P>
   War was to be a high-tech affair, waged from 15,000 feet above
the ground and pictured on the nation's TV screens almost as a
video game. This is not to belittle the skills of the high-tech
warriors, but it does raise an interesting question.
</P>
<P>
   If something is not worth dying for, can it still be worth
fighting for?
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters like to argue that America's patriotism is alive
and well, and that it has recovered from its post-Vietnam malaise
(some 70 percent of Americans polled last year considered
patriotism ``very important,'' compared with only 43 percent in
1976).
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that in the Vietnam era patriotism was put to
the test, and was genuine on both sides of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, today's patriotism too often seems for show, a
matter of waving the flag as if that alone will sustain America as
the land of the free and the home of the brave. &QL;

TV REVIEW: THE PALESTINIAN CASE, PASSIONATELY TOLD
</HEADLINE>

 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Said, America's foremost Palestinian patriot and
polemicist, sets forth Monday night on a journey ``In Search of
Palestine.'' He carries a heavy load of memories of a homeland that
was taken by force, leaving many of its people in refugee camps or
under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he goes, Said finds fellow Palestinians being abused by
Israeli settlers and authorities. Their history, as he tells it,
began with ``the catastrophe'' of 1948, when hundreds of Arabs were
killed and thousands of others lost their homes and property to the
conquering Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In this hourlong BBC production, the prolific writer and scholar
sets aside his intellectual credentials and makes little attempt at
evenhanded reporting as he concentrates on his family's loss and on
what he sees as the continuing afflictions of the Palestinians.
Everywhere, the camera finds symbols of Israeli power: the guns and
bulldozers used to repress peaceable Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from his account is any acknowledgment that there may be
an Israeli side to the area's tumultuous history. Despite
expressions of sympathy from friendly Israelis, Said finds mainly
oppression by Jews and indifference by most of the world to what he
condemns as prevailing injustice: the years of expulsion, uprooting
and destruction, with no alleviation in sight. Arabs, he says, have
been demonized, while the ``barbaric, inhuman'' actions of the
Israelis go uncriticized.
</P>
<P>
   Said holds out little prospect that the Oslo accords will do
anything to improve the Palestinians' plight. As he sees the
situation, the new Palestinian authority is cooperating in holding
down the indigenous population; the land of his childhood is gone
forever. The viewer need not accept Said's sad and bitter polemic
as the whole story, affected as it is by his passion over the world
his people have lost.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ No, the people of Washington state are not all
Microsoft millionaires or comfortably middle-class Boeing
machinists. Just now, thousands of migrant workers are laboring to
harvest cherries.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lucrative crop, worth more than $1,800 a ton to
growers. Picking is a skilled job, requiring nimble fingers to keep
the stalk attached to the fruit and avoid damage to the tender
cherry bud just above. It also entails rising at 4:30 a.m. and
working well into the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Pickers earn between $2.50 and $4 a box. If a picker skips lunch
and works until dark, he can get perhaps $80 or $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the work has been made even tougher. Thousands of
workers who formerly camped in makeshift but at least convenient
camps on growers' farms are now scrambling to find shelter in
forests, beside rivers, or in private or state-run campgrounds,
many of them far away from the cherry orchards.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: federal regulators at the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) ruled in May that the growers' camps
were not clean or safe enough. But no alternatives have been
provided.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they were caught off-guard by OSHA's
decision. This assertion is somewhat undercut by the fact that, two
years ago, the courts ruled that the state could not use camps that
failed to meet federal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the state had been using farm camps as a stopgap
until better housing could be found not only for cherry pickers but
also for pluckers of the state's apples, pears and peaches.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA, for its part, waited until pickers were heading to
Washington state from as far away as Texas before clamping down. By
that time, 5,000 pickers were already hunting for places to stay;
up to 1,600 more have since arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The 60,000 or so farm workers of Washington state, many of whom
are Latinos speaking little or no English, are all but powerless.
</P>
<P>
   The farming-dependent eastern half of the state (Republican and
conservative) stoutly resists efforts by the western half
(Democratic and liberal) to improve things.
</P>
<P>
   The result is misery for pickers in small towns such as Mattawa,
on the banks of the Columbia River near the center of the state.
</P>
<P>
   A thin crop caused by a cool spring has kept down the number of
pickers, but even so many are living in awful conditions, without
electricity, running water, toilets or even ways of keeping their
modest property safe during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, whose road-weary workers are sluggish on the job, are
not happy either. But many growers seem to realize that a bit more
of their profits had better be spent on the workers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, growing cherries is proving so profitable that the
amount of land used for it has doubled in the past decade, and may
double again in the next. That will mean some 30 billion cherries
needing to be picked in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   The pickers whose hands reach into the trees will need a place
to live. &QL;

<P>
   Pickers earn between $2.50 and $4 a box. If a picker skips lunch
and works until dark, he can get perhaps $80 or $100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the work has been made even tougher. Thousands of
workers who formerly camped in makeshift but at least convenient
camps on growers' farms are now scrambling to find shelter in
forests, beside rivers, or in private or state-run campgrounds,
many of them far away from the cherry orchards.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: federal regulators at the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) ruled in May that the growers' camps
were not clean or safe enough. But no alternatives have been
provided.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they were caught off-guard by OSHA's
decision. This assertion is somewhat undercut by the fact that, two
years ago, the courts ruled that the state could not use camps that
failed to meet federal requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the state had been using farm camps as a stopgap
until better housing could be found not only for cherry pickers but
also for pluckers of the state's apples, pears and peaches.
</P>
<P>
   OSHA, for its part, waited until pickers were heading to
Washington state from as far away as Texas before clamping down. By
that time, 5,000 pickers were already hunting for places to stay;
up to 1,600 more have since arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The 60,000 or so farm workers of Washington state, many of whom
are Latinos speaking little or no English, are all but powerless.
</P>
<P>
   The farming-dependent eastern half of the state (Republican and
conservative) stoutly resists efforts by the western half
(Democratic and liberal) to improve things.
</P>
<P>
   The result is misery for pickers in small towns such as Mattawa,
on the banks of the Columbia River near the center of the state.
</P>
<P>
   A thin crop caused by a cool spring has kept down the number of
pickers, but even so many are living in awful conditions, without
electricity, running water, toilets or even ways of keeping their
modest property safe during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, whose road-weary workers are sluggish on the job, are
not happy either. But many growers seem to realize that a bit more
of their profits had better be spent on the workers.
</P>
<P>
   After all, growing cherries is proving so profitable that the
amount of land used for it has doubled in the past decade, and may
double again in the next. That will mean some 30 billion cherries
needing to be picked in the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   The pickers whose hands reach into the trees will need a place
to live. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are few stranger alliances in America's
culture wars than the one between nativists and multiculturalists
on the subject of assimilating immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Nativists such as Pat Buchanan, a perennial presidential
contender, argue that the great American assimilation machine is
broken beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants arrived in such quantities in the 1980s and 1990s
that they can seclude themselves in ethnic enclaves rather than
merging into the mainstream. And the growing ease of communications
means that they have no need to loosen their ties with their old
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians who passed through Ellis Island at the turn of the
century had little hope of seeing their motherland again; the
Mexicans who these days get off the bus in downtown Los Angeles can
watch Mexican television, keep in contact with their relatives by
telephone or even, on special occasions, video conference, and
return home for several weeks a year.
</P>
<P>
   The multiculturalists who dominate the country's universities
and pressure groups agree with the nativists' premise but go on to
draw radically different conclusions. ``Mainstream America'' was
never anything more than a code word for racial oppression, they
argue.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of millions of unassimilated immigrants is requiring
America to abandon the old notion of a melting pot and turn itself
instead into a ``gorgeous mosaic'' in which distinctive ethnic
groups still manage to make a whole.
</P>
<P>
   A brief visit to Huntington Park, a small city south of central
Los Angeles, suggests that there is something to this argument.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 Huntington Park was such a white stronghold that blacks
in nearby South Central used to say that they had to cross the
Mason-Dixon line in order to visit it. But now it is almost
entirely Latino.
</P>
<P>
   The main street, Pacific Boulevard, looks as if it has been
flown in ready-assembled from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Record shops blast Latin crooners into the street. Toy shops
sell Mexican party games called pinatas. A huge number of shops
specialize in bridal gowns and children's clothes. In El Gallo
Giro, a huge fast-food joint, crowds of women make tortillas behind
the counter.
</P>
<P>
   But take a closer look at Huntington Park, and you begin to see
signs of assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   Street vendors sell hot dogs as well as tamalitos. The
hottest-selling pinatas look like Teletubbies. One of the newest
additions to the high street, Solano's Shoes, caters to youth
subcultures rather than ethnic tastes: 20 percent of its customers
are black.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the houses in the residential districts are immaculately
kept, suggesting that they are owned rather than rented; the
schools offer adult classes in English, citizenship and parenting.
The city mayor, Rosario Marin, even acted as a spokesman for the
former Republican governor, Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   So which is the real Huntington Park?
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Rodriguez, a fellow at the New America Foundation whose
earlier researches have decisively changed the understanding of
Latino experience in the United States, has added a new element to
the assimilation debate: facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   These facts and figures are mostly drawn from the 1990 census,
which remains the best available snapshot of the American
population, but they are also supplemented by later data.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez says it is wrong to measure assimilation against
impossible standards. Immigrants have always taken time to move
into the mainstream, both geographically and culturally.
</P>
<P>
   And assimilation has always been a two-way process, with each
new wave of immigrants contributing something to what it means to
be American, from Jewish humor to German beer.
</P>
<P>
   The proper measure of assimilation is not whether ethnic groups
have cut their ties to their homeland completely, but whether they
have put down roots in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez argues that if you look at the four most important
measures of ``roots'' _ citizenship, home ownership,
language-acquisition and intermarriage _ then assimilation is going
on much as it always has.
</P>
<P>
   American citizenship has never been an automatic choice for
immigrants: only about half of the people who arrived in the United
States at the turn of the century chose to become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, 40 percent of immigrants were naturalized. But this
proportion is likely to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The longer immigrants stay in the United States, the more likely
they are to become citizens: only 23 percent of those who arrived
in the early 1980s were naturalized by 1990, compared with 41
percent of those who arrived in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   And the recent anti-immigrant campaigns in California and
Congress have, paradoxically, inspired the greatest rush to
naturalization in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, there was a 212 percent increase over the previous year
in the number of Mexican immigrants who became citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Home ownership is another powerful symbol of attachment to
American life. Half of all immigrant homes were owner-occupied in
1990. This is a much lower figure than the one for native-born
Americans. But the longer immigrants stay in the country, the more
likely they are to join the home-owning classes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, 75 percent of immigrants who had been in the United
States for at least 25 years owned their own homes, compared with
70 percent of native-born Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The figures for intermarriage and language-acquisition are
equally heartening from an assimilationist point of view.
</P>
<P>
   By the third generation, a third or more of Latino and Asian
women are marrying outside their ethnic group. In 1900, a quarter
of immigrants could not speak English; in 1990, the figure was only
8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than three-quarters (76 percent) of immigrants spoke
English ``with high proficiency'' within ten years of arriving; and
almost all their children spoke English either well or exclusively.
Almost half the children of Asian immigrants can speak only
English.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Rodriguez has to say is common sense. The United
States is the most culturally powerful nation in the world,
striking terror into chauvinists from Paris to Tehran; it is hardly
surprising that it should be able to absorb people within its own
borders, particularly since most people come to the United States
with the express purpose of getting ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps not surprising either that nativists should ignore
common sense: in the end, much of their objection to immigration is
based on race.
</P>
<P>
   But why multiculturalists should seek to deny the obvious is a
subject worthy of study in itself. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO _ Through all the unhappy turbulence of Latin America's
recent economic history, two countries have shone radiantly, Chile
and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, economic growth has averaged 7 percent per year since
1990, income per person has almost doubled and annual inflation has
fallen from 27 percent to under 5 percent _ all mainly thanks to
the market policies adopted by General Augusto Pinochet's
dictatorship and maintained by its democratic successors.
</P>
<P>
   And Colombia, despite mounting political violence, managed to
sustain growth averaging 4.1 percent a year from 1984 to 1997,
chiefly because of its consistently prudent policies.
</P>
<P>
   In different ways, both countries have been models for the
region. This year most of Latin America is suffering recession,
mainly because of low prices for exports of raw materials and
investors' retreat from emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is recovering more quickly than expected after its
January devaluation, and Mexico is still growing, thanks to its
close links to the booming economy in the United States. But
elsewhere, recent data suggest that the slump will be deeper and
longer than forecast, with little recovery until next year.
</P>
<P>
   This time the region's two model economies have not been spared.
Both are in recession _ for the first time since the early 1980s in
Chile and, remarkably, since the 1930s in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But Chile's problems look far more manageable than those of
Colombia. Chile's economy came to a halt a year ago; since
September, it has been shrinking, compared with the same period in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In May, unemployment reached 10 percent, its highest level in a
decade. The main reason: the collapse in Asia's demand for copper,
which accounts for about two-fifths of Chile's exports, and whose
price has fallen to its lowest level since the 1930s (though
recovery may now be under way).
</P>
<P>
   To that, add bad luck and policy mistakes. One of Chile's worst
droughts this century has affected the (mainly hydroelectric) power
industry; energy shortages shaved at least 0.7 percent from GDP
between January and March.
</P>
<P>
   And Chile's exports of manufactures have suffered from recession
in Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, President Eduardo Frei's officials had confidently
predicted that Chile, with its budget surplus and solid
international reserves, would easily weather the storm. But
domestic consumption, fueled by new prosperity, was increasing well
ahead of income, while higher investment was financed largely by
foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   The current-account deficit rose to a worrying 5.4 percent of
GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Having stoked an overheated economy with interest-rate cuts, the
Central Bank eventually had to douse it. It squeezed liquidity so
sharply last year that commercial banks almost stopped lending.
</P>
<P>
   With a presidential election in December, the government is now
trying to speed recovery. On June 21 Frei announced a spending
package, designed to stiffen the sagging construction industry and
tide small businesses over the next few rough months.
</P>
<P>
   To help out, the supposedly independent Central Bank cut
interest rates for the tenth time since October. Business leaders
cheered. Critics fear that the new measures, which will not have an
effect for several months, could fuel more overheating next year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Chile can no longer take rapid growth for
granted. It may already have harvested most of the benefits of the
structural reforms of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The task for the next president (likely to be Ricardo Lagos, a
moderate social democrat) will be to reduce his country's
dependence on copper, by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   And Chile may find itself more dependent on international
financial markets. In the past, it has taxed short-term inflows of
foreign capital to reduce its vulnerability to sudden outflows. But
domestic savings, stuck at 20-24 percent of GDP, are too low to
finance another decade of growth on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos says that 7 percent growth is possible from 2001,
providing savings increase to 28 percent of GDP. But higher savings
are a consequence more than a cause of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are more cautious. Leonardo Suarez of Larrain
Vial, a Santiago stockbroker, forecasts growth of less than 5
percent per year for the next decade. Not bad, but no longer in the
supermodel class.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's decline is more marked, and its causes more complex.
The immediate issue is the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $220 million of its $8.7 billion of reserves in
two days, on June 27 President Andres Pastrana's government in
effect devalued the currency by 10 percent, by lowering (and
widening) the band in which it trades.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just as Richard Grasso, the chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange, was visiting a leader of Colombia's
FARC guerrillas, to give him ``a tutorial,'' he said, ``on...(the)
democratization of capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the peso did not immediately sink to the floor of its new
band, it is by no means certain that the new rate will hold.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's recession is more severe than Chile's: output has
been falling since the middle of last year, and may shrink by up to
2.5 percent this year (though the official forecast is of 0.5
percent growth).
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the main cities now stands at almost 20 percent,
up from 12 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The government has no appetite for increasing interest rates (as
it did last year) to fend off any further attack on the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The international credit-rating agencies have indicated that
they may deprive Colombia of its coveted ``investment grade''
(low-risk) rating.
</P>
<P>
   What has driven Colombia's economy into its worst mess in almost
70 years?
</P>
<P>
   Decentralization of public spending has undermined traditional
fiscal prudence; so too, did Pastrana's predecessor, Ernesto
Samper.
</P>
<P>
   Under his government, between 1994 and 1998 Colombia borrowed to
spend: the public finances moved from balance to a deficit of 3.8
percent of GDP, while the current-account deficit ballooned from
4.5 percent of GDP to 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, an intensifying guerrilla war has
undermined investment and confidence. An earthquake in January
shook the main coffee-growing region. The woes of neighboring
Venezuela and Ecuador have hurt exports. And banks have been hit by
a surge in bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of recovery depend partly on financial reform. Officials
claim that a scheme to help private banks clean up their balance
sheets is at last starting to work.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the private banks managed to make a profit in April and
May, says Juan Carlos Echeverry at the national planning
department.
</P>
<P>
   The government also proposes to bring in further fiscal reform.
That may not be easy _ especially since Pastrana must try to
satisfy demands for more social spending as he tries to persuade
his country's guerrillas to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   How he must envy Frei, who, thanks to Chile's fiscal virtue, can
afford to speed recovery though pump-priming, and whose political
difficulties seem minor. &QL;

ATTENTION GRABBERS IN A CULTURAL OUTPOURING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C.)  (nk) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The words of Hitler rang out the other night
over Lower Sproul Plaza, on the campus of the University of
California at Berkeley. OK, it was part of a play, ``The Resistible
Rise of Arturo Ui,'' by Bertolt Brecht, in the first American
appearance by Brecht's own company, the Berliner Ensemble. (And it
 &UR; was &LR;  Berkeley.) Still, it was a little startling, even for a
visitor to the Bay Area bent on attending a number of events, each
of which, in its way, was attracting attention for the disjointed
cultural elements it brought together.
</P>
<P>
   The classical extravaganzas _ the San Francisco Symphony's
Stravinsky festival and the San Francisco Opera's Wagnerian
``Ring'' _ that commandeered the cultural headlines here in late
spring yielded the spotlight to more cross-cultural fare. For one
thing, on June 16, near downtown in the not-so-long-ago downtrodden
area south of Market Street, the Sony Corp. opened Metreon, a
mammoth (350,000 square feet) $85 million indoor entertainment
complex that is not a food court, not a theme park and please not a
mall, employees say, though Metreon has elements of all three.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first weekend, more than 150,000 people had
passed through the doors, heading for one of the 15 movie theaters
plus the Imax theater, several restaurants and retailers (including
the first Microsoft store, which has, among other things, a display
informing people they can plan a wedding with technology products)
and three ``interactive attractions'' for children. Well, mostly
for children.
</P>
<P>
   One is based on David Macaulay's book ``The Way Things Work''.
The second recreates, on a large scale, the Maurice Sendak fable
``Where the Wild Things Are.'' And the third, half video arcade,
half flight deck of the Starship Enterprise, is known as the
Airtight Garage, a high-tech game room (with a bar) whose video
displays are drawn from the work of Jean Giraud, the graphic
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the crowds _ the place was overflowing with
teen-agers and families on a midweek midafternoon _ it makes vast
sense as a commercial enterprise. The oddity is in its location,
just across the Yerba Buena Gardens from the San Francisco Museum
of Modern Art, the two buildings now the twin pillars of a
flowering arts district that a mere five years ago was a wasteland
but that now includes the Moscone Center, a convention center and a
performance hall and is awaiting completion of a Jewish museum and
a Mexican museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was wino country,'' said David A. Ross, the executive
director of the modern art museum, still somewhat amazed, like many
San Franciscans, at the changes being wrought in the neighborhood.
He spoke over dinner at Montage, Metreon's upscale restaurant,
where a screen above the table was showing an excerpt from a
surreal video by the artist Bill Viola, subject of a 25-year
retrospective currently featured at the museum across the square.
Ross had just emerged from the Airtight Garage, and the contrasting
uses of imaginative video had not escaped him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely sets up an alpha-omega situation in which the
uses of advancing technology are shown at their extremes,'' he
said. ``Viola creates an immersive, emotional and spiritual
response, a quiet zone, and Metreon is about generating a maximum
of excitement, interactive and enervating.'' Realizing he sounded a
bit grudging in his enthusiasm, he continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be less than honest if I said I hadn't been looking
forward to this place opening,'' he said, ``looking forward to what
businesses can do with technology, finding new ways of thrilling
us. That's how the movie business got started.''
</P>
<P>
   Metreon predicts that 5 million to 7 million people will pass
through its attractions annually, dwarfing the 800,000 who visited
the museum last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still are telling the story of modern art in an enjoyable
way,'' said Ross, whose first museum job, at the Everson Museum in
Syracuse, N.Y., in the early 1970s, was as curator of video art. He
sounded only a tad jealous. ``But let's face it. We're not an urban
entertainment center.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he predicted that the crowds drawn to the area by Metreon
would increase visitors to his museum enough that he would end up
expanding museum hours to encourage and accommodate the crossover.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk from Metreon, at the Geary Theater, around the
corner from the tourist mecca of Union Square, the American
Conservatory Theater was presenting ``Tartuffe,'' in a production
directed by Charles Randolph-Wright, who reimagined the
17th-century French farce among upper-class blacks in Durham, N.C.,
in the 1950s. Moliere's charlatan man of the cloth is not entirely
transfigured in the guise of a hypocritical black cult figure out
to claim the virtue of rich women and the purse of rich men, all in
the name of God.
</P>
<P>
   Played with jaunty ribaldry by a largely black cast speaking the
cleverly singsong verse translation of the poet Richard Wilbur with
a varying commitment to formal diction, and closing with the Frank
Sinatra recording of ``Love and Marriage'' made familiar to a
contemporary generation by the sitcom ``Married With Children,''
the production sought actively to meld comic sensibilities three
centuries apart. ``Reverend Ike meets Dracula'' is how the director
described it; Moliere meets the WB network would also be apt.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, perhaps, to judge by some eavesdropping after one
midweek performance, audiences left the theater either appalled or
tickled. Among the latter was Jessica Milner Davis, a professor of
theater and film studies at the University of New South Wales in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was brilliant,'' she said. ``Totally faithful to
Moliere's original spirit.''

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO _ Through all the unhappy turbulence of Latin America's
recent economic history, two countries have shone radiantly, Chile
and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, economic growth has averaged 7 percent per year since
1990, income per person has almost doubled and annual inflation has
fallen from 27 percent to under 5 percent _ all mainly thanks to
the market policies adopted by General Augusto Pinochet's
dictatorship and maintained by its democratic successors.
</P>
<P>
   And Colombia, despite mounting political violence, managed to
sustain growth averaging 4.1 percent a year from 1984 to 1997,
chiefly because of its consistently prudent policies.
</P>
<P>
   In different ways, both countries have been models for the
region. This year most of Latin America is suffering recession,
mainly because of low prices for exports of raw materials and
investors' retreat from emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is recovering more quickly than expected after its
January devaluation, and Mexico is still growing, thanks to its
close links to the booming economy in the United States. But
elsewhere, recent data suggest that the slump will be deeper and
longer than forecast, with little recovery until next year.
</P>
<P>
   This time the region's two model economies have not been spared.
Both are in recession _ for the first time since the early 1980s in
Chile and, remarkably, since the 1930s in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   But Chile's problems look far more manageable than those of
Colombia. Chile's economy came to a halt a year ago; since
September, it has been shrinking, compared with the same period in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In May, unemployment reached 10 percent, its highest level in a
decade. The main reason: the collapse in Asia's demand for copper,
which accounts for about two-fifths of Chile's exports, and whose
price has fallen to its lowest level since the 1930s (though
recovery may now be under way).
</P>
<P>
   To that, add bad luck and policy mistakes. One of Chile's worst
droughts this century has affected the (mainly hydroelectric) power
industry; energy shortages shaved at least 0.7 percent from GDP
between January and March.
</P>
<P>
   And Chile's exports of manufactures have suffered from recession
in Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, President Eduardo Frei's officials had confidently
predicted that Chile, with its budget surplus and solid
international reserves, would easily weather the storm. But
domestic consumption, fueled by new prosperity, was increasing well
ahead of income, while higher investment was financed largely by
foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   The current-account deficit rose to a worrying 5.4 percent of
GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Having stoked an overheated economy with interest-rate cuts, the
Central Bank eventually had to douse it. It squeezed liquidity so
sharply last year that commercial banks almost stopped lending.
</P>
<P>
   With a presidential election in December, the government is now
trying to speed recovery. On June 21 Frei announced a spending
package, designed to stiffen the sagging construction industry and
tide small businesses over the next few rough months.
</P>
<P>
   To help out, the supposedly independent Central Bank cut
interest rates for the tenth time since October. Business leaders
cheered. Critics fear that the new measures, which will not have an
effect for several months, could fuel more overheating next year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Chile can no longer take rapid growth for
granted. It may already have harvested most of the benefits of the
structural reforms of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The task for the next president (likely to be Ricardo Lagos, a
moderate social democrat) will be to reduce his country's
dependence on copper, by fostering innovation and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   And Chile may find itself more dependent on international
financial markets. In the past, it has taxed short-term inflows of
foreign capital to reduce its vulnerability to sudden outflows. But
domestic savings, stuck at 20-24 percent of GDP, are too low to
finance another decade of growth on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Lagos says that 7 percent growth is possible from 2001,
providing savings increase to 28 percent of GDP. But higher savings
are a consequence more than a cause of growth.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are more cautious. Leonardo Suarez of Larrain
Vial, a Santiago stockbroker, forecasts growth of less than 5
percent per year for the next decade. Not bad, but no longer in the
supermodel class.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's decline is more marked, and its causes more complex.
The immediate issue is the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $220 million of its $8.7 billion of reserves in
two days, on June 27 President Andres Pastrana's government in
effect devalued the currency by 10 percent, by lowering (and
widening) the band in which it trades.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came just as Richard Grasso, the chairman of
the New York Stock Exchange, was visiting a leader of Colombia's
FARC guerrillas, to give him ``a tutorial,'' he said, ``on...(the)
democratization of capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the peso did not immediately sink to the floor of its new
band, it is by no means certain that the new rate will hold.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's recession is more severe than Chile's: output has
been falling since the middle of last year, and may shrink by up to
2.5 percent this year (though the official forecast is of 0.5
percent growth).
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the main cities now stands at almost 20 percent,
up from 12 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The government has no appetite for increasing interest rates (as
it did last year) to fend off any further attack on the currency.
</P>
<P>
   The international credit-rating agencies have indicated that
they may deprive Colombia of its coveted ``investment grade''
(low-risk) rating.
</P>
<P>
   What has driven Colombia's economy into its worst mess in almost
70 years?
</P>
<P>
   Decentralization of public spending has undermined traditional
fiscal prudence; so too, did Pastrana's predecessor, Ernesto
Samper.
</P>
<P>
   Under his government, between 1994 and 1998 Colombia borrowed to
spend: the public finances moved from balance to a deficit of 3.8
percent of GDP, while the current-account deficit ballooned from
4.5 percent of GDP to 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, an intensifying guerrilla war has
undermined investment and confidence. An earthquake in January
shook the main coffee-growing region. The woes of neighboring
Venezuela and Ecuador have hurt exports. And banks have been hit by
a surge in bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of recovery depend partly on financial reform. Officials
claim that a scheme to help private banks clean up their balance
sheets is at last starting to work.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the private banks managed to make a profit in April and
May, says Juan Carlos Echeverry at the national planning
department.
</P>
<P>
   The government also proposes to bring in further fiscal reform.
That may not be easy _ especially since Pastrana must try to
satisfy demands for more social spending as he tries to persuade
his country's guerrillas to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   How he must envy Frei, who, thanks to Chile's fiscal virtue, can
afford to speed recovery though pump-priming, and whose political
difficulties seem minor. &QL;

 SAN FRANCISCO: original spirit.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Davis was in town to deliver a paper on styles of humor in
literature at the International Humor Conference, which was held
last week at Holy Names College across the bay in Oakland. An
annual gathering (the first was held in Cardiff, Wales, in 1976) of
academics who study humor _ only some of whom, even they will
admit, are funny _ is a funny notion in itself, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But the range of papers, from the blindingly arcane (``Indecency
or Innovation? Sexual and Esthetic Transgression in Early
20th-Century Comic Drama by Women'') to the sociologically
semirelevant (``Clinton Jokes as a Window to American Culture'') to
the seemingly useful (``Humor's Link to Reduced Substance Use by
Early Adolescents'') in disciplines encompassing psychology,
literary history, physiology and pop culture studies, made an
interesting case for a still-nascent and not entirely accepted
academic field of study. There were more than 200 attendees from 30
states and 21 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two purposes for the conference,'' said Martin D.
Lampert, this year's organizer, a psychology professor at Holy
Names. ``To bring researchers together, so people doing theater
work, psychology work, medical work, can share ideas and build a
discipline. And to bring attention to the field, so people begin to
think of it as something relevant to study.''
</P>
<P>
   A day of traipsing about from session to session turned up a few
good jokes (mostly dirty) and a few genuinely amusing if
extraordinarily narrow fields of interest. In the latter category
was ``A Good Start: Death Wish Jokes and the American Legal
Profession,'' in which Marc Galanter, a law professor at the
University of Wisconsin, disclosed that of the 23 extant jokes that
urge or celebrate the killing of lawyers (e.g., ``What do you call
6,000 lawyers at the bottom of the ocean? A good start''), 19 were
created after 1980, which reveals something or other about the rise
in a national antipathy toward lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the back of the room was John Elman, a 64-year-old
insurance salesman (and nonpracticing lawyer) from Palo Alto, one
of the few nonacademics at the conference. In an interview he
summed things up rather nicely. ``I came here to learn,'' he said.
``I didn't come here to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that same evening, a mere bellowing bullhorn's distance
from the Vietnam-era birthplace of the free speech movement, that
an actor, making an unannounced appearance at a microphone on the
roof of Zellerbach Hall, declaimed excerpts from Hitler's public
addresses to an initially perplexed crowd of early-arriving
theatergoers and others who were just passing through Lower Sproul
Plaza. Many did double takes at the earnest, exhortatory calls for
German unity and eerie praise for the Nazi's elite formations.
</P>
<P>
   ``SS?'' cried a man, standing on the plaza. ``Did he say SS? Are
you listening to that? He ought to get the hell out of here. That's
how it all started.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was, as it happened, the point. The actor, an American,
Christopher Peak, speaking in English, had been engaged by the
Berliner Ensemble, the German theater troupe founded by Brecht in
1949, which made its first appearance in the country last Thursday.
And this was the company's way of opening its production of
``Arturo Ui,'' Brecht's viciously comic parable of the ascension of
Nazism in Germany, which places heavy emphasis on the parallels
between the seduction of an audience by a commanding actor and the
more sinister seduction of a nation, willing to suspend its
disbelief, in the thrall of a commanding leader.
</P>
<P>
   The play, set in Depression-era Chicago, is the story of Arturo
Ui, an Al Capone-ish figure bent on taking over the city's
greengrocers' union. He is played with cartoonishly physical
villainy by Martin Wuttke, who begins the show on all fours,
panting like an overexcited German shepherd, and as the show
proceeds, rises _ literally and metaphorically _ to a
goose-stepping, self-appointed master of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Highly stylized and visually stunning, the production used
music, from Shubert lieder to strident American rock-and-roll; the
evil comic intent was clear from the stagecraft. Unhappily for some
in the restless audience, it had to be. The text was performed in
German, and though supertitles were provided, they were at a height
that made it impossible to take in the action and the text in a
single glance. Nonetheless, it was an important occasion; the
company moves to Los Angeles for four performances at the Freud
Theater at UCLA, after which it is to be essentially disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, most in the theater got the message, as did the
horrified man on the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I get it,'' he said, after the stagecraft had been
explained to him. ``Always remember, never forget. Right?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the geeks shoving their way into New York's Javits
Convention Center for last week's PC Expo saw only the usual
cornucopia of computing delight.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the message of the PC industry's annual extravaganza
was that everything is getting smarter, faster, cheaper. Never has
the strength of Moore's Law _ that computing power will double
every 18 months _ seemed to be more gloriously affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Those prepared to look harder might, however, have seen the
writing on the wall for PC makers. Though they will sell more
machines in the next few years, 1999 may prove the high-water mark
for revenues in the industry's American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   As for profits, even in today's market they are hard to come by
_ witness recent losses at Compaq, the word's biggest PC maker.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of Compaq's difficulties are unique, stemming from
its acquisition of Digital in 1998, few of its competitors are
thriving either. Both IBM and Hewlett-Packard have struggled to
make money from PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dell, the acknowledged pacesetter, has found its margins
under pressure since it began to sell cheap PCs for the first time
earlier this year. As for most of the rest, don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   These low profits partly reflect overcapacity and competition
for market share. But PC makers are also worried that the
relentless cycle of upgrades, stoked by marketing and technology,
is losing steam.
</P>
<P>
   The main cause is the Internet, the very phenomenon that many
believed would be their greatest opportunity. Now, some Internet
service providers (ISPs), such as America Online, are even giving
PCs away.
</P>
<P>
   The shock is all the greater because the past 12 months have
been exceptional. Demand from businesses has been driven by the
need to replace older PCs that were vulnerable to the millennium
bug.
</P>
<P>
   In the consumer market, the Internet bandwagon is driving all
before it, with first-time buyers, now the main engine of sales
growth, accounting for 27 percent of all unit sales, according to
Forrester Research, a high-tech consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more households that already have one machine
will buy another to ease the competition for mouse-time between
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester predicts that this year American consumers will buy
16.9 million new PCs _ 17 percent more than last year _ raising
household penetration to 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, both business users and consumers are increasingly
happy to buy cheap ``good enough'' PCs without the latest, fastest
and most expensive chips from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite raging demand, average prices of both business and
consumer PCs will tumble by about 14 percent this year. As a
result, total revenues will be only 2-3 percent higher than in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That is an awful omen for next year. Few businesses will be
replacing the more-than-adequate machines they have just bought.
And the recent flood of consumer buyers will subside.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining first-timers are likely to be more resistant to
the complexity and expense of PCs, and to the cost of using the
Internet. Meanwhile, supply will overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Having ramped up production over the past couple of years, Intel
and its low-price competitors such as AMD will not be able to scale
it back at multibillion dollar chip plants, and will swamp the
market, cutting chip prices even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester reckons that next year's PC-industry revenues in
America could be as much as $8 billion _ or 14 percent _ lower than
they were in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There may be little recovery in later years, because falling
prices will offset modestly growing sales.
</P>
<P>
   IDC, another forecaster, thinks that the average price of PCs
will fall less dramatically than Forrester expects. Even so, it too
reckons the value of business and home desktop PC sales will be no
higher in 2003 than it is today. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 425 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The PC market has seen boom and bust before. The difference this
time is the absence of what was the main impetus for PC sales in
the past: the need for frequent upgrades to run the evermore
sophisticated products of the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Users have little reason to change the PCs they have bought over
the past year. The latest release of Microsoft's Office, a suite
that includes such programs as Word, Excel and Powerpoint,
demonstrates that software developers cannot think of any useful
new features that require more than the computing power of current
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Games run better and more reliably on dedicated consoles such as
PlayStation and Nintendo. Sony's PlayStation 2, to be launched next
year, will even rival the consumer PC by adding a web-browser,
e-mail and a digital video-disc-drive, which, among other things,
will enhance the machine's storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But the real rebel against the tyranny that says PC owners must
always upgrade is the Internet itself. Very little web content will
require PC owners to buy new hardware; every new website will
prolong the life of existing hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Websites depend on attracting as many visitors as they can.
Nobody would want to limit the appeal of their sites by designing
them to work properly only on the fastest PCs.
</P>
<P>
   If users have spare money to devote to computing, they are more
likely to spend it on increasing the bandwidth of their connection
or on staying online for longer, both of which will benefit ISPs
and cable operators rather than the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dell says that people typically upgrade their PCs six
months after getting a broadband connection, even today's cheaper
PCs can cope with the fastest cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Eric Schmitt says that users are likely to spend
whatever money they have left over on something that makes a
difference, such as a snazzy flat-panel screen or a rewritable
CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   By the time firms get around to replacing the PCs they have
bought in the past 12 months, corporate computing will have been
transformed. As firms rush to become e-businesses, client/server
computing, which put the PC at its core, is giving way to Internet
computing, in which applications and data run entirely on servers.
</P>
<P>
   When little is asked of the PC other than to gain access to
these servers by means of a browser, users will not be able to spot
much difference between old PCs and new ones. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for the PC industry? In a single word,
pain. Internet computing will lead to lots of portable ``thin
clients'' that will be inexpensive alternatives to laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop PCs will remain competitive, but only because of their
amazing cheapness. Less mature markets in Europe and Asia will
absorb some of the overcapacity, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   The same market dynamics apply there too: after all, the
Internet is nothing if not global. So the PC firms will have to
learn new tricks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's success with the novel design of its iMac shows one way
to go. Super-efficient direct sellers such as Dell and Gateway are
starting to sell other electronic devices and are even determined
to become ISPs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Michael Dell, Dell's founder, said that he means to
start his own service. Gateway, for its part, is in talks to buy
EarthLink, a rival of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, technology heavyweights such as IBM and
Hewlett-Packard might question whether they should stay in such a
commodity business at all. IBM already makes more money selling its
technology to firms like Dell than it does flogging its own PCs.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft and Intel, the two halves of the Wintel monopoly,
life also seems likely to grow harder.
</P>
<P>
   The $50 that Microsoft extracts for each copy of the Windows
operating system will look increasingly egregious. With the Justice
Department watching, Microsoft will be wary of exploiting its
monopoly to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial versions of Linux, an increasingly popular
alternative operating system, also give PC makers a stick with
which to beat Microsoft _ if they feel brave.
</P>
<P>
   As for Intel, it must now realize that merely accelerating its
product introductions is not working. Intel will doubtless pack a
lot of its chips into new Internet devices, so long as it prices
them cheaply. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,375. SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   But it is vital for the Wintel pair's margins that firms rush to
buy servers running Microsoft's industrial-strength, but delayed,
Windows 2000 and Intel's equally late 64-bit successor to the
Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the market leader? Poor Compaq falls halfway between
an IBM that sells technology and services and a Dell that is a
slick build-to-order assembler, a condition that selling its
AltaVista search engine has done little to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's chairman and acting chief executive, Ben Rosen, may
even feel that he did Eckhard Pfeiffer a favor when he sacked him
in April. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of the geeks shoving their way into New York's Javits
Convention Center for last week's PC Expo saw only the usual
cornucopia of computing delight.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the message of the PC industry's annual extravaganza
was that everything is getting smarter, faster, cheaper. Never has
the strength of Moore's Law _ that computing power will double
every 18 months _ seemed to be more gloriously affirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Those prepared to look harder might, however, have seen the
writing on the wall for PC makers. Though they will sell more
machines in the next few years, 1999 may prove the high-water mark
for revenues in the industry's American heartland.
</P>
<P>
   As for profits, even in today's market they are hard to come by
_ witness recent losses at Compaq, the word's biggest PC maker.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of Compaq's difficulties are unique, stemming from
its acquisition of Digital in 1998, few of its competitors are
thriving either. Both IBM and Hewlett-Packard have struggled to
make money from PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dell, the acknowledged pacesetter, has found its margins
under pressure since it began to sell cheap PCs for the first time
earlier this year. As for most of the rest, don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   These low profits partly reflect overcapacity and competition
for market share. But PC makers are also worried that the
relentless cycle of upgrades, stoked by marketing and technology,
is losing steam.
</P>
<P>
   The main cause is the Internet, the very phenomenon that many
believed would be their greatest opportunity. Now, some Internet
service providers (ISPs), such as America Online, are even giving
PCs away.
</P>
<P>
   The shock is all the greater because the past 12 months have
been exceptional. Demand from businesses has been driven by the
need to replace older PCs that were vulnerable to the millennium
bug.
</P>
<P>
   In the consumer market, the Internet bandwagon is driving all
before it, with first-time buyers, now the main engine of sales
growth, accounting for 27 percent of all unit sales, according to
Forrester Research, a high-tech consultancy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, more households that already have one machine
will buy another to ease the competition for mouse-time between
family members.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester predicts that this year American consumers will buy
16.9 million new PCs _ 17 percent more than last year _ raising
household penetration to 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, both business users and consumers are increasingly
happy to buy cheap ``good enough'' PCs without the latest, fastest
and most expensive chips from Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite raging demand, average prices of both business and
consumer PCs will tumble by about 14 percent this year. As a
result, total revenues will be only 2-3 percent higher than in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That is an awful omen for next year. Few businesses will be
replacing the more-than-adequate machines they have just bought.
And the recent flood of consumer buyers will subside.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining first-timers are likely to be more resistant to
the complexity and expense of PCs, and to the cost of using the
Internet. Meanwhile, supply will overflow.
</P>
<P>
   Having ramped up production over the past couple of years, Intel
and its low-price competitors such as AMD will not be able to scale
it back at multibillion dollar chip plants, and will swamp the
market, cutting chip prices even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester reckons that next year's PC-industry revenues in
America could be as much as $8 billion _ or 14 percent _ lower than
they were in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   There may be little recovery in later years, because falling
prices will offset modestly growing sales.
</P>
<P>
   IDC, another forecaster, thinks that the average price of PCs
will fall less dramatically than Forrester expects. Even so, it too
reckons the value of business and home desktop PC sales will be no
higher in 2003 than it is today. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 425 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The PC market has seen boom and bust before. The difference this
time is the absence of what was the main impetus for PC sales in
the past: the need for frequent upgrades to run the evermore
sophisticated products of the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   Users have little reason to change the PCs they have bought over
the past year. The latest release of Microsoft's Office, a suite
that includes such programs as Word, Excel and Powerpoint,
demonstrates that software developers cannot think of any useful
new features that require more than the computing power of current
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Games run better and more reliably on dedicated consoles such as
PlayStation and Nintendo. Sony's PlayStation 2, to be launched next
year, will even rival the consumer PC by adding a web-browser,
e-mail and a digital video-disc-drive, which, among other things,
will enhance the machine's storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   But the real rebel against the tyranny that says PC owners must
always upgrade is the Internet itself. Very little web content will
require PC owners to buy new hardware; every new website will
prolong the life of existing hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Websites depend on attracting as many visitors as they can.
Nobody would want to limit the appeal of their sites by designing
them to work properly only on the fastest PCs.
</P>
<P>
   If users have spare money to devote to computing, they are more
likely to spend it on increasing the bandwidth of their connection
or on staying online for longer, both of which will benefit ISPs
and cable operators rather than the PC industry.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dell says that people typically upgrade their PCs six
months after getting a broadband connection, even today's cheaper
PCs can cope with the fastest cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester's Eric Schmitt says that users are likely to spend
whatever money they have left over on something that makes a
difference, such as a snazzy flat-panel screen or a rewritable
CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   By the time firms get around to replacing the PCs they have
bought in the past 12 months, corporate computing will have been
transformed. As firms rush to become e-businesses, client/server
computing, which put the PC at its core, is giving way to Internet
computing, in which applications and data run entirely on servers.
</P>
<P>
   When little is asked of the PC other than to gain access to
these servers by means of a browser, users will not be able to spot
much difference between old PCs and new ones. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for the PC industry? In a single word,
pain. Internet computing will lead to lots of portable ``thin
clients'' that will be inexpensive alternatives to laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Desktop PCs will remain competitive, but only because of their
amazing cheapness. Less mature markets in Europe and Asia will
absorb some of the overcapacity, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   The same market dynamics apply there too: after all, the
Internet is nothing if not global. So the PC firms will have to
learn new tricks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's success with the novel design of its iMac shows one way
to go. Super-efficient direct sellers such as Dell and Gateway are
starting to sell other electronic devices and are even determined
to become ISPs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Michael Dell, Dell's founder, said that he means to
start his own service. Gateway, for its part, is in talks to buy
EarthLink, a rival of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, technology heavyweights such as IBM and
Hewlett-Packard might question whether they should stay in such a
commodity business at all. IBM already makes more money selling its
technology to firms like Dell than it does flogging its own PCs.
</P>
<P>
   For Microsoft and Intel, the two halves of the Wintel monopoly,
life also seems likely to grow harder.
</P>
<P>
   The $50 that Microsoft extracts for each copy of the Windows
operating system will look increasingly egregious. With the Justice
Department watching, Microsoft will be wary of exploiting its
monopoly to the fullest.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial versions of Linux, an increasingly popular
alternative operating system, also give PC makers a stick with
which to beat Microsoft _ if they feel brave.
</P>
<P>
   As for Intel, it must now realize that merely accelerating its
product introductions is not working. Intel will doubtless pack a
lot of its chips into new Internet devices, so long as it prices
them cheaply. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 1,375. SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   But it is vital for the Wintel pair's margins that firms rush to
buy servers running Microsoft's industrial-strength, but delayed,
Windows 2000 and Intel's equally late 64-bit successor to the
Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the market leader? Poor Compaq falls halfway between
an IBM that sells technology and services and a Dell that is a
slick build-to-order assembler, a condition that selling its
AltaVista search engine has done little to remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's chairman and acting chief executive, Ben Rosen, may
even feel that he did Eckhard Pfeiffer a favor when he sacked him
in April. &QL;

<P>
   How much will the battle to tame year 2000 computer problems
cost? When will computer malfunctions hit? Which countries or
industries are furthest along _ or furthest behind _ in dealing
with the year 2000 challenge?
</P>
<P>
   One name comes up repeatedly when such questions are posed:
Gartner Group Inc. From congressional hearings to corporate
boardrooms, year 2000 progress reports and risk assessments often
begin, and sometimes end, with Gartner's research. The consulting
firm's thousands of information-technology clients include not just
the business elite but foreign governments ranging from economic
powers like Japan to the sorely distressed like Russia and
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   That gives the use of Gartner's year 2000 projections the same
cachet that went with corporate decisions to buy IBM computers in
the 1960s, even though many year 2000 experts say Gartner's
research process raises as many questions as it answers.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner's year 2000 star rose rapidly after a 1996 congressional
hearing when it suggested that American companies might spend as
much as $600 billion finding and dealing with end-of-century
computer flaws, making it the first prominent
information-technology firm to put a hard, eye-opening number on
the problem in a public forum.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting publicity encouraged the firm, based in Stamford,
Conn., to expand its research on the subject; today, its rankings
and data permeate year 2000 print and broadcast reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I took Ronald McDonald and put a Gartner suit on him, he'd
be interviewed by all the big media outlets for Y2K expertise,''
said William Ulrich, a consultant based in Soquel, Calif., using
the popular shorthand for year 2000 issues.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent figure in the Gartner suit on a given day is
often Louis Marcoccio, the company's director of year 2000
research. A 52-year-old computer-management veteran with an MBA, a
law degree and teaching credentials to go along with three
engineering degrees, Marcoccio's life is a whirl of speeches at
year 2000 conferences, private consultations with Gartner clients,
and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   He talks to scores of journalists each week, often for foreign
audiences. One recent week included television broadcasts in Japan
and Israel and a radio program in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had requests to be in movies, and a Canadian rock group
wanted to dub me over one of their songs,'' Marcoccio said, smiling
with a mixture of amusement and dismay at the idea that year 2000
mania could bring a conservatively attired consultant such brushes
with celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   For all the attention, though, year 2000 issues are such a small
part of Gartner's overall consulting business that it is almost
irrelevant to investors, according to analysts who follow the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner says the sale of year 2000 research and advice will
bring in less than $8 million of the $750 million in total revenue
that Wall Street is projecting this year. The eight full-time year
2000 analysts represent just 1 percent of the 800
information-technology specialists working for Gartner worldwide.
Most clients get the research at bargain rates as an addition to
other research services.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner's stock is down 37 percent in the last 12 months,
compared with a 13 percent climb in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index. It has lagged behind the market's rise because of concerns
about the growth prospects of the rest of the business and, more
recently, about a complicated financial restructuring and stock
buyback plan scheduled during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   But however puny from the perspective of the balance sheet,
Gartner's year 2000 effort speaks to giant fears about the
inability of some computers, programs and electronic devices to
handle dates after Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner had been advising clients since the late 1980s to get to
work on year 2000 issues, though it was not until 1993 that it
tried to analyze the extent of the potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they were startled when the analyst they
hired, Kevin Schick, came up with a cost estimate of $300 billion
to $600 billion. Schick, who left Gartner in 1996 and later founded
Enterprise Solution Partners, an Internet publisher in Chicago,
said he had simply put together Gartner estimates of the lines of
computer code in use with data on the average cost of hiring
outside programmers to repair faulty mainframe-computer software.
</P>
<P>
   It later became apparent that lines of code were too crude a
measurement to accurately project a company's year 2000 costs. In
addition, computer users surprised Gartner and most other experts
by doing most of their repairs internally instead of hiring outside
contractors, which cut their reported costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way spending could get to the upper limits they
calculated,'' said Thomas Oleson, head of year 2000 research for
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Gartner estimate has never completely yielded
the spotlight that it gained in the 1996 congressional testimony,
in part because its scope was changed. Today it is used as a
worldwide figure, not, as Schick had calculated, the cost for the
United States alone, and it includes expenses overlooked in the
original estimate, like testing.
</P>
<P>
   Later, more cautious projections, like Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter's recent estimate that the information technology bill in
the United States would be less than $86 billion, still attract far
less notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are first, and you are recognized as a big provider
of data, you are going to catch people's attention,'' said James
Woodward, head of the year 2000 practice for CAP Gemini America in
New York, a consulting and software repair firm that has sponsored
independent research on year 2000 programs at big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner's influence also rests in part on its business strategy.
Because it is known for selling assessments and visions of where
technology is going rather than particular products, many computer
users see it as an independent voice with no ax to grind, like
Consumer Reports looking at television sets or autos.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Several smaller competitors, like Giga Information, Jupiter and
Forrester Research, offer similar independence but lack Gartner's
global reach and huge stable of big-name clients. Gartner, which
was founded in 1979, has 9,100 corporate and government clients.
</P>
<P>
   But Gartner, like other year 2000 researchers, relies heavily
even today on unverifiable reports by computer users of their plans
and progress in dealing with these problems. Ideally, data would
come from much more thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes two or three weeks of a consultant's time to find out
where a large company really is on Y2K,'' said Bruce Hall, who was
Marcoccio's predecessor at Gartner and is now vice president at
Trigent Software, a company in Southborough, Mass., that uses
offshore programmers to help companies do year 2000 repairs and
other software projects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gartner's research extends far deeper than the written
questionnaires that many others rely on.
</P>
<P>
   The basis for many of its rankings now, according to Marcoccio,
is quarterly polling of 15,000 companies in 31 nations by 11
universities that do the work in exchange for free consulting
services. The companies are asked 330 questions in long phone
interviews, which are considered more reliable than written
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   The results are then cross-checked against a variety of public
and private reports and made available to other Gartner analysts
for review.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner does not disclose the rankings of individual companies,
but private clients can get breakdowns of how different industries
are doing, country by country, and in comparison with clusters of
clients that Gartner Group views as leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gartner's methodology leaves something to be desired, but it's
as good as it gets,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at
Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. ``At the end of the day, they
are the only game in town when it comes to global assessments.''
</P>
<P>
   Not really. For global assessments and many other year 2000
measures, multinational companies and industry groups have recently
put together private research efforts that have better or more
recent information than Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   Many large banks and other financial institutions, for instance,
take part in Global 2000, which has a 22-member committee headed by
James Devlin of Citibank that updates country assessments every
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We became more positive on Japan and Germany well ahead of
Gartner,'' Devlin said, citing one difference. But Global 2000, at
the request of government regulators and several key members, keeps
most of its research private. Gartner's results are more widely
available and are based on more data, Devlin said.
</P>
<P>
   That makes them subject to disproportionate influence, according
to some year 2000 experts. ``At a minimum, if you are a Y2K
coordinator in a foreign country, you need to know what Gartner is
saying about you,'' said Bruce McConnell, head of the World Bank's
recently formed International Y2K Cooperation Center in Washington
and a critic of the weight often given to Gartner Group ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Gartner readily concedes that those it rates have every right to
be concerned about how its research _ especially the public
summaries of it _ is being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things are meant to be a flag, not a basis for
decisions,'' Marcoccio said. He added that Gartner constantly warns
clients that a low rating for a country is a signal for them to
look more closely at their exposure, not a reason to pull out.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new, innocuous-looking consumer electronic device known as a
personal video recorder is not much different in nature from the
video cassette recorder, and very few of them have been sold to
date.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, an increasing number of executives at television
networks and advertising agencies have their ears nervously on
alert, wondering if the tiny rumbling noise now coming from this
machine is really the first, feint echo of a seismic event, one
that will reshape the economic landscape of the television
industry.
</P>
<P>
   They are also wondering if the best approach may to be co-opt
these machines, adopting them for their own purposes by going into
business with the companies selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Little has been said publicly about the coming of the PVR, and
several senior executives at broadcast networks and big advertising
agencies said in interviews they knew little or nothing about the
machine. But for those who have looked into PVR's and what they can
do now and have the potential to do, the reactions ranged from
acknowledgment that significant changes are coming to predictions
of nothing less than the end of conventional television as it has
existed for a half century.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the executives at the two companies pushing this new
technology, ReplayTV and Tivo, are not hesitant to predict a
dramatic impact from their machines, which use the equivalent of a
computer hard disk and are able to store between 14 and 30 hours of
television programs and record many shows at the same time. The
machines do not permit viewers to build libraries of shows, but
they can be hooked up to existing VCR's to make copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just think everything is going to change,'' said Michael
Ramsay, the president of Tivo. ``This is revolutionary change. It's
a massive play.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the machines have the potential to give people broad
control over their television viewing, by organizing schedules of
shows according to personal choice and taste. That means viewers
could watch what they want when they want, not bound by the
timetable of any continuous network schedule. And by making it far
easier to skip commercials, the new machines could threaten the
main revenue stream for most commercial networks.
</P>
<P>
   Because ReplayTV and Tivo are both still seeking investors, it's
not surprising that they are making grand forecasts. What's
remarkable is that numerous network executives seem to agree with
them. As Robert A. Iger, the chairman of Walt Disney's ABC Group,
put it, ``Replay and Tivo will have an impact on the business that
is really significant.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the advertising side, Bruce Benson, the executive vice
president of corporate strategy for Young &AMP; Rubicam, said: ``I
think it will absolutely change the habits of people watching
television. If it gets penetration, it will create a dramatic shift
in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic assessment of the potential for ReplayTV and
Tivo has been made by Josh Bernoff, a media analyst for Forrester
Research. Bernoff, who issued a full report on PVR's earlier this
year, said, ``I declared the end of network television.''
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Bernoff predicted that in 10 years 80 percent of
homes would have a PVR, that viewing of commercials would be cut in
half, that without ad revenues to cover production costs most
quality programs would be sold by studios or even program creators
to viewers on a pay-per-view basis, and that free network channels,
bereft of big advertising revenue, would be left with what he
called ``the dregs'' of programming.
</P>
<P>
   Not every assessment is nearly so dire. Indeed, some network
executives see potential new revenues in the machine through
specialized paid programs recorded during off hours or on new
digital channels. And some question whether ReplayTV and Tivo, in
predicting revolution, are misreading how viewers watch television:
as either passive lumps not sure what they want until they notice
that it is on, or as reflexive hunters for new, unanticipated
viewing alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The channel surfer watching two or three programs more or less
simultaneously will not be served by a machine offering choices in
playback mode.
</P>
<P>
   Garth Ancier, the president of NBC Entertainment, who uses a
ReplayTV machine in his home, said: ``I'm not finding a radical
shift in the way I view. I tend to like to explore a lot on my
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Another question might be the installation, which involves
hooking the machine to a cable box, a VCR, a television and a phone
line. Even by Tivo's estimates, the process takes almost an hour to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ancier conceded that many of the machine's implications
``scare the heck out of me.'' Tom Freston, the chairman of Viacom's
MTV Networks, said: ``I hate to think about Replay and Tivo. We
kind of like the world the way it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson of Young &AMP; Rubicam said, ``I think conventional
television, while not quite dead, is going to do a slow death
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Tivo and ReplayTV are stirring this kind of
impassioned reaction is they open the possibility for viewers to
vastly expand the selection of programs they can watch, by adding a
host of choices they themselves select, while at the same time
making it easier than ever to avoid the commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The PVR records programs easily off live television and from a
vast menu of selections that the machine itself organizes for the
viewer through an automatic wee-hours-of-the-morning phone call
made to a company service center to download program-listing
information. Compared to a videocassette recorder, the PVR makes it
easy to record a show during an interruption. If the phone rings,
you can push record, and when you return, rewind and pick up the
show where you left it while the rest of the show is still being
recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Users have found the machines especially good at organizing
options for the increasingly busy and choice-laden viewer. Viewers
can express preferences in programming, choose themes for programs
to be recorded _ like Harrison Ford movies, all baseball games,
every syndicated episode of ``Seinfeld,'' programs about World War
II _ and insure that every weekly original episode of a favored
series will be recorded with just a single flick of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Tivo even establishes viewer profiles and starts recording shows
according to previous preferences (though Bernoff, the media
analyst, conceded that a lot of cooking shows once turned up on his
menu because he happened to watch one cooking show for 15 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The machines, developed by the two Silicon Valley- based
companies in only the last 18 months, take advantage of
developments in both computer chip and disk drive technology. Both
use a remote control and on-screen menu interface, which both call
a ``portal,'' to organize viewing options. And both require that
the device be linked to the phone line so that it can make the call
to the service center for listings, usually at 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Both concede that few units have been sold to date, mainly
because they have been available only through specialized sales,
like on the Internet. But they will soon be in electronics stores.
The cost ranges from $499 to $1,499, depending on the system and
the number of recording hours.
</P>
<P>
   Tivo's machines are being built by Royal Philips Electronics of
the Netherlands, ReplayTV's by Panasonic, a unit of Matsushita
Electric Industrial of Japan. Both manufacturers have equity
stakes. Other PVR makers, including Sony and Thomson's RCA, are
expected to sign deals soon. In all cases the manufacturers are
likely to soon begin building the devices into new TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to the industry, both Tivo's and
ReplayTV's units contain buttons that enable viewers to skip
commercials far more easily than ever; ReplayTV's is a 30-second
skip button. Tivo has a more conventional but very quick
fast-forward button.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have recently moved to play down their
commercial-skipping capabilities, largely because they are actively
seeking partners in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the compromises may reach a point where the consumer's
interests are sacrificed to the need for deep-pocketed industry
partners. A senior PVR executive said his company had expressed a
willingness to disable its commercial skipping capability in
exchange for deals with networks and advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   But Young &AMP; Rubicam's Benson conceded such a decision might lead
to ``tension between what the consumer wants and what the
broadcaster and advertisers want.'' It also may draw competitors
not so willing to align themselves with the television industry.
Bernoff, the Forrester analyst, said he expected numerous entrants,
including one major player, soon.
</P>
<P>
   Tivo has already made an equity deal with NBC, a subsidiary of
General Electric, and is courting other network partners. ReplayTV
is talking with NBC _ a senior NBC executive said NBC would
probably take a 5 percent stake in each company _ and other
networks.
</P>
<P>
   NBC initially passed on ReplayTV because its 30-second skip
button seemed much less industry-friendly. Tom Rogers, the
president of NBC Cable, said, ``The Tivo model did not seem
antithetical to advertiser-supported networks.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives from both companies are now overtly conciliatory to
networks and advertisers. Ramsay of Tivo said: ``We want to make
the ads more relevant. We're trying to embrace the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Layne Britton, the executive vice president of ReplayTV, said
that the company, too, was seeking equity partners in the industry
and added: ``We're not trying to disenfranchise the networks. We
have no incentive to build a business by destroying conventional
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably bringing in networks as partners will insure that
some of the worst fears will not materialize. One fear of several
network executives is that the two companies would make their own
deals with advertisers so that a Coca-Cola commercial, say,
imbedded in the machine's hard disk, would be placed on a specific
show, like ``Ally McBeal,'' when it is replayed on the PVR.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay said that within about a year the machines would indeed
have the capability to insert their own commercials, ``but we plan
to do it in partnership with the network.''
</P>
<P>
   Britton said ReplayTV would look to sell advertising on its
preview channel and that possibly the bottom third of a screen
might be used for ``banner advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Tivo already has a deal with General Motors that could lead to
customized advertising on the PVR. If, for example, the unit knows
a home has a family of five, it could play a commercial for a GM
van in the spot during an episode of, say, ``E.R.,'' where GM has
purchased the commercial time from NBC. But if the home is occupied
by a 25-year-old man, it might instead play a Corvette commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Networks foresee possible new revenue streams in the device,
especially after they add digital channels in the future.
Specialized programs could be offered on these secondary channels
for fees _ programming ranging from customized ESPN highlights to
episodes of some favorite series that had been censored on the
broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers of NBC said networks could customize promotions for the
PVR's preview channels to build interest in an upcoming series. But
he emphasized, ``The network is still going to be the great creator
of original first-run programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Several executives said advertisers would turn increasingly to
product placements in programs. Even some network executives agree
this is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Benson of Young &AMP; Rubicam said that while advertisers had reason
to be afraid, he was convinced that ``consumers in the end will
tolerate some level of advertising instead of paying the cost of
all this entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the prospect of a world of so much pay-per-view
programming ``is either anti-American or totally American,
depending on how you look at it,'' Ancier of NBC said.
</P>
<P>
   Among several others he remains skeptical that the industry will
be shaken. They cited previous innovations that were supposed to
alter television forever, like the VCR and video games. Britton of
ReplayTV, perhaps seeking to tamp down some of the wilder
speculation, said, ``Television is an extremely resilient
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ancier expressed a prevailing industry sense of uncertainty
about issues ranging from how a younger generation will adapt to
the device to what improvements will be made in the machines in
coming years. He said: ``I just don't know. It is still a fairly
dumb machine. How smart is the interface going to get? Who knows?''

   All at once it got very serious. Ken Newport looked up from the
600-page document he had printed from the Internet. He had been
ploughing through its interminable ramblings about horsemen and
brides, scrolls and seals, beasts and Babylon, demon armies and
divine punishments. But then something clicked.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant, he realized with a sudden chill, was blazing gun
battles, burning buildings and more dead children.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of Waco were looking for a repeat of the awful
inferno in which some 80 people died in the siege of their
headquarters in Texas six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, did an unknown academic from Liverpool like
him go about contacting the FBI? It had all begun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newport is a theologian who, for the past two years, has
been gathering material for an academic volume on how groups
throughout history have interpreted Revelation, the final book of
the Bible which is consumed with surreal visions about the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, he discovered, those who became
obsessed with the Apocalypse became filled with the conviction that
it was a timetable of real events and that the end was about to
come in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baptist, Benjamin Keach, thought it would
happen in 1689. One of the founders of Methodism, Charles Wesley,
thought Doomsday would be 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most famously, the American preacher William Miller
gathered his followers around him on Oct. 22, 1844, all having sold
their worldly possessions, quit jobs and moved to upstate New York,
which was where Christ was due to return.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Branch Davidian cult at Waco, under their
wild and charismatic leader David Koresh, were seized with the same
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more. From time to time there appeared a
group that was not simply content to wait for Armageddon. They saw
it as their duty to provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in gathering material on the history of the Branch
Davidian cult that he came across evidence that Koresh's
successors, who style themselves the Students of the Seven Seals,
are engaged upon a process whose logic seems to be taking them
remorselessly to the creation of another Waco _ sometime between
now and Friday Aug. 6, when they are convinced that the world will
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his neat modern study at Liverpool Hope University
College, amid racks of box files and a world away from the madness
of Waco, Dr. Newport began to correspond _ by letter and e-mail _
with the new generation of Branch Davidians, who have fled Texas
and are now dispersed throughout the U.S. and UK.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted them through their websites and by writing to the
seven members who are in American jails, serving a total of 238
years between them. Slowly he began to piece together the story
which has so unnerved him. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The first piece in the jigsaw went back to Oct. 23, 1844 _ the
day after the world didn't end as William Miller had predicted. It
was then that his followers began the long process of coming to
terms with what they dubbed The Great Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several new groups which sprang from the disillusioned
Millerites was the Seventh Day Adventists, whose recruits included
one John Kellogg, who developed for his brethren a special
vegetarian breakfast food called corn flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a movement doomed to schism. A washing machine
salesman called Victor Houteff led a breakaway called the Davidian
Seventh Day Adventists. And after Victor's wife and successor
Florence gathered the movement's 940 members together for another
unsuccessful Doomsday on April 22, 1959, it split again, with Ben
Roden and his wife Lois forming the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the succession should have passed to their son
George. But by then David Koresh was on the scene and things began
to turn from the merely eccentric to the downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the leadership issue, Ken Newport discovered, George
Roden dug up the remains of an 85-year-old Davidian who had died
some 20 years earlier, and challenged Koresh to a Resurrection
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   A gun battle ensued and, though the police arrested everyone, no
one was convicted _ though George was given six months for contempt
of court for threatening the judge with plagues and herpes.
</P>
<P>
   George was later sent to an asylum after drawing a third
Davidian into a row over whether George or Koresh had been chosen
by God to be the seventh and final angel named in the Bible; when
the third man insisted it was neither of them but him, George
chopped him up with an axe.
</P>
<P>
   But it was none of this which prompted the Davidians' letters
and e-mails to Ken Newport suddenly to halt. Nor was it his
questions about the awful events at Waco, at which the FBI
acquitted themselves so poorly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cult members began to get wary when Dr. Newport started to
ask about their belief that Koresh is due to return from the dead
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Their massive documents on the Web revealed that a code-breaking
of a combination of dates in Revelation and the prophetic book of
Daniel suggested that Koresh would return on Aug. 6, at the head of
200 million horsemen (see Rev. 9:16) to cleanse the earth and
slaughter the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Those of Koresh's followers who were not consumed in the flames
of Waco were to prepare for the event under the guidance of a
Davidian by the code name of The Chosen Vessel.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Ken Newport began to find out who this might be that
all communication was ended with a final e-mail: ``We perceive now
that you are not a seeker after the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Newport continued to comb through what had already been
made available to him. The conclusions he was forced to make
disturbed him.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors to join Koresh's divine army they, too, would
have to be dead before Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no reference to self-sacrifice in any of the
documentation. Rather there was the suggestion that the remnant,
under the direction of The Chosen Vessel, would have to be killed
by the same forces who killed Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic is clear,'' says Dr. Newport. ``It all makes perfect
sense if you take on board the hypotheses they start with. It is
entirely possible that they are provoking some horrendous
confrontation with the U.S. authorities.'' His estimate is that
around 40 to 50 individuals might be involved in such an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the world, security services have decided they have to
take this kind of thing seriously. The propensity of cults to turn
fantasy into grim reality is evident from a mere recital of names
like Jonestown, the Solar Temple, Heaven's Gate, Aum Shinri Kyo.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Israel recently expelled 14 members of a
Denver-based Doomsday sect called Concerned Christians, accusing
them of plans to attack the al-Aqsa mosque in an attempt to spark
off the apocalyptic war of Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   In the UK, the anti-terrorism squad is alive to fears that a
fanatical U.S. group has targeted the Millennium Dome for attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, the FBI is monitoring groups it fears are storing
explosives for some millennium outrage. &QL;

<P>
   Perhaps they have learned the lessons of Waco. When I contacted
them in Washington recently, their cults department was remaining
taciturn. The FBI knows that its strategists made fools of
themselves over Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they taken the trouble to find out anything about what was
going on in the heads of those in the Waco compound, they might
have defused the whole situation peacefully,'' says Ken Newport.
Instead, their actions seemed calculated to produce the worst
possible outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonization of the U.S. government which is found
ubiquitously in Seventh Day Adventist sources predisposed members
of the Branch-Davidian movement (nearly all of whom, including
Koresh himself, were drawn from the Adventist church) to view the
siege of their headquarters by the FBI as of apocalyptic
significance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorities added to such a perception by shining
unceasing lights into the compound, playing demonically loud music
alternately punctuated, one Waco survivor claimed, with the sound
of rabbits being slaughtered and of Tibetan monks chanting.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into the weird end-of-the-world scenario of those
final chapters of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dealing with a group which believed that, just
before the end of the world, the great Satanic power would seek to
destroy the last faithful remnant of God's people,'' says Dr.
Newport.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ H.K. Desai, president and chief executive of
Qlogic Corp., has a ready answer when asked what he thinks of his
competitor, Emulex Corp. ``In my culture,'' quips Desai, a native
of India, ``we are not allowed to say bad things about our
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Qlogic was indeed part of Emulex until a 1994 spinoff, and even
today the companies occupy adjacent buildings in Costa Mesa,
Calif., sharing a courtyard, a conference room and a Ping-Pong
table. But parent and child are now becoming head-on competitors in
one of the hottest new areas in computer data storage.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are vying for leadership in fiber channel
technology, a new industry-standard approach to high-speed data
transfer between computers and separate data-storage disk drives.
With corporations needing ever faster access to larger amounts of
data, particularly to run Web sites, fiber channel sales look set
to soar.
</P>
<P>
   The shares of both companies, in fact, have already soared.
Qlogic stock has rocketed from less than $14 a year ago, closing
Friday at $139.50, while Emulex shares have zoomed from less than
$6 to Friday's close of $103.
</P>
<P>
   Other fiber channel companies have also captured investor
enthusiasm. Brocade Communications Corp., a San Jose, Calif.,
company that makes switches for networks that connect disk drives
to computers, went public at $19 a share on May 24. On Friday, its
shares closed at $103.75.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber channel is viewed by many in the computer industry as the
likely successor to the existing, longtime standard known as the
small computer systems interface _ written inelegantly as SCSI and
pronounced even more inelegantly as ``scuzzy.'' As its name
implies, fiber channel uses optical fibers for high speed
transmission, although there is also a more limited version that
uses copper wires.
</P>
<P>
   Fiber channel allows data to flow at 1 billion bits per second,
somewhat faster than SCSI. But its real advantage is flexibility.
SCSI is limited to 15 data storage devices, all within a few yards
of one another. Fiber channel can connect hundreds, and the disk
drives can be as far as six miles away from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   That flexibility is allowing corporations to link disk drives in
what is being called a storage area network, or SAN.
</P>
<P>
   With SCSI systems, each data storage device, usually an array of
disk drives in a single box, is connected to a single computer that
is known as a server and might be shared by many users. With a SAN,
multiple servers can connect directly with any disk drive array,
avoiding bottlenecks and providing redundancy in case one server
malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more of the storage is going into mission-critical
applications _ things connected to the Internet that have to be
available 24 hours a day,'' said Robert Gray, a research director
at International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   EMF Associates, a market research and consulting firm in Half
Moon Bay, Calif., projects overall sales of fiber channel equipment
to mushroom to $23 billion in 2002 from $3.5 billion in 1998. Much
of that will be for the data storage devices themselves. Another
big part will be switches that direct traffic between drives and
servers in the storage area network, such as those made by Brocade,
Ancor Communications of Minnesota and Gadzoox Networks Inc., a San
Jose, Calif., start-up company.
</P>
<P>
   Qlogic and Emulex make circuit boards known as host adapters,
which enable computers to be connected to fiber channel networks.
That is still a relatively small part of the business, worth about
$80 million last year, according to International Data.
</P>
<P>
   But those sales are expected to grow to $800 million by 2002.
And for small companies like Qlogic and Emulex, with annual
revenues around $100 million, that is a big market indeed. Right
now, they are the leaders along with Jaycor Networks Inc., a
privately held company in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Qlogic and Emulex did not see themselves as competitors when the
spinoff occurred. Qlogic was the semiconductor division of Emulex,
a company that originally made disk storage products for Digital
Equipment Corp. minicomputers. But Emulex got out of that business
in the late 1980s and began selling circuit boards to connect
printers to networks. It decided it no longer needed its own
semiconductor division, and so it cut loose Qlogic.
</P>
<P>
   Emulex has had the tougher time of the two. With its other
businesses shrinking, Emulex bet its future on fiber channel,
bringing out its first products several years ago. But only
recently has the growth from its fiber channel products been enough
to offset declines in its other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company had revenues of $18.2 million in the quarter ended
in March, up 21 percent from $15 million a year earlier. But sales
of fiber channel products more than doubled, to $11.2 million, and
accounted for 62 percent of total sales. Net income was $1.36
million, compared with a loss from restructuring charges a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Qlogic _ the ``Q'' is said to stand for quality or quickness _
was making chips and circuit boards for the SCSI system.
</P>
<P>
   Desai, who was Qlogic's head of engineering, left in May 1995,
unhappy with the company's direction. Three months later, with the
company losing money, he returned as chief executive. He ended
retail sales and began development of fiber channel products.
</P>
<P>
   Profits have risen for 15 consecutive quarters and Qlogic raced
past its former parent in sales and market value. Qlogic has a
market capitalization of $2.5 billion, compared with Emulex's $840
million.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Qlogic's fiber channel business accounted for only $7.3 million
of its $35.1 million in revenues in the March quarter. It does not
break out profits by product line, but Desai said the fiber channel
business was profitable. And even though the SCSI business is still
growing, the fiber channel business is growing faster, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is enamored of fiber channel. Adaptec Inc., the
leader in the SCSI business, sold its fiber channel business to
Jaycor Networks, although it retains a small stake in Jaycor.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Frymyer, a spokesman for Adaptec, said that two new data
input/output technologies under development could compete with
fiber channel. One is Future I/O, supported by Compaq Computer,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM and other companies. Another is Next
Generation I/O, supported by Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Another risk for Emulex, Qlogic and Jaycor is that big computer
and disk drive makers might decide to make their own adapter cards,
as Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard are doing to some extent,
rather than buy from outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now there is plenty of business for both Qlogic and
Emulex, and they say their rivalry is friendly. ``It's more like a
family type of feuding,'' Desai said. ``We still have a lot of
respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with their businesses so clearly converging, one
wonders whether the spinoff was necessary in the first place. But
the executives express no regrets. ``I don't think we'd be where we
are today if we hadn't been independent companies,'' said Paul
Folino, the president and chief executive of Emulex. ``It allowed
us to get there faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, for shareholders it has been a good deal. An owner of
one share of Emulex worth $12 before the spinoff would now own one
Emulex share and two Qlogic shares worth a total of $382.
</P>
<P>
   Executives also dismissed any thought of combining again. In any
case, that will get harder. Qlogic, in need of more space, is about
to cut the final apron strings by moving to a new, larger
headquarters elsewhere in Orange County. Parent and child will
continue to compete in the marketplace but no longer at the
Ping-Pong table.

PATENTS: RAPID LAUNCHING OF FIREWORKS; DISPOSING OF CONTRABAND;
AWARDS FOR INVENTORS; FIREWORKS FOR CHRISTMAS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Md., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American inventors have been in pursuit of pyrotechnic
perfection ever since fireworks were shot off in 1777 during the
very first Fourth of July celebration in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney resorts, of course, like to shoot off fireworks even
when it's not the Fourth of July. Kyle Poor and John Sogge, two
inventors who are based in Orlando, Fla., and affiliated with Walt
Disney Co., were recently granted a patent for a type of Roman
candle that launches high-altitude fireworks in quick succession.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, according to the patent, a Roman candle launches from
eight to 12 fireballs from a cardboard tube every three to six
seconds, with the fireballs, or ``stars,'' reaching a maximum of
150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Poor and Sogge have patented a new type of launching tube in
which stars are propelled out of the tube by pressured gas rather
than by ignited black powder. The stars either can be coated with a
combustible material, so that they ignite by friction as they are
forced from the tube, the inventors state, or can be lighted by a
flame as they pass through the tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``The launcher is capable of launching a plurality of the
fireworks projectiles at a rapid rate of fire, up to six shots per
second or more,'' the patent says. ``Furthermore, the launcher is
capable of launching the fireworks projectiles at relatively high
altitudes approaching 300 feet or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor and Sogge received patent 5,917,146, which was assigned to
Walt Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Helping Get Rid of Dangerous Stuff
</P>
<P>
   Randall Paul Voorhees and Joseph Ernest Voorhees, two
Pennsylvania inventors, have come up with a new way for
law-enforcement agencies to dispose of combustible contraband such
as ammunition and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   The inventors note that their ``portable armored incinerator for
dangerous substances'' is an improvement over the method currently
favored by law-enforcement agencies, which involves ``digging a
pit, placing the contraband in the pit, pouring gasoline or other
flammable liquid over it, and setting it afire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Voorheeses' mobile incinerator has armored walls made with
steel plates and reinforced by steel channel beams, which insulate
the incinerator, from explosions created by burning such material.
</P>
<P>
   ``This invention eliminates the need for hazardous
transportation of explosive substances that are to be destroyed, as
the invention can easily be brought to the site where they are
located,'' the patent says.
</P>
<P>
   It also reduces the amount of pollution emitted, according to
the inventors. ``The primary and secondary combustion chambers
minimize pollution from the incineration by ensuring that there are
no unburned combustible airborne particles or vapors emitted,'' the
patent says.
</P>
<P>
   The Voorheeses received patent 5,727,481.
</P>
<P>
   Group Names Inventor of Year
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Intellectual Property Owners Association, in
Washington, bestowed its Inventor of the Year Award on Dr. Curt
Civin, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   Civin isolated the CD34 monoclonal antibody, which made it
possible to separate stem cells _ the grandmother cells of the body
which give rise to all manner of progeny cells _ from the body's
mature cells. By using the antibody, Civin was able to develop a
refined version of bone-marrow transplantation for cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Civin's discovery has ``revolutionized basic research and
provided many new options in cancer therapy, and particularly
bone-marrow transplantation,'' said Dr. Martin Abeloff, director of
the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Association also gave Distinguished Inventor Awards to
researchers at Genentech and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Vehar, Richard Lawn, Daniel Capon and William Wood of
Genentech were acknowledged for their work in developing a
treatment for hemophilia patients that is free from HIV and
hepatitis contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Meyerson, director of telecommunications technology at
IBM, was recognized for his role in developing silicon germanium
transistors, which operate faster than ordinary silicon devices.
</P>
<P>
   Fireworks for Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of Christmas in July. But July in Christmas?
</P>
<P>
   John Fuu Liu, an inventor in Huntington Beach, Calif., has
patented Christmas-tree lights whose bulbs look like miniature
firework displays. Inside the bowl-shaped bulbs are fiber-optic
sticks whose tips flash on and off, thus simulating fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Liu received patent 5,865,533.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: IMPROVING DIALOGUE ON THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENISE CARUSO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to the Internet, as some very wise person has noted, we
have at least disproved the old saw about a thousand monkeys at a
thousand keyboards eventually producing a Shakespeare play.
</P>
<P>
   And all the millions of nodes in all the broadband,
packet-switched, fully synchronous networks in the world apparently
cannot prevent people from exchanges that are the digital
equivalent of ``Your mother wears Army boots.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet snobs may be inclined to dismiss the inanity of most
public conversations on the Web as irrelevant in their larger, more
commercial vision of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But others, noting a seemingly insatiable appetite for public
messaging, argue that the future of even the commercial Internet
depends on making this crucial component more satisfying for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   To move people beyond the graffiti-esque quality of much online
messaging, they are developing software and discussion practices
that encourage computer users to talk to, rather than at, each
other. One of the most innovative ideas for creating value and
relevance in online conversation is coming from the world of
documentary film.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Weiss is a longtime independent filmmaker and past producer
of the highly regarded PBS television series ``P.O.V.,'' which
addresses controversial topics in American culture _ abortion,
Vietnam, death and dying, gay life, ageism, school prayer _ by
allowing people to tell their own stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.O.V.,'' an acronym for ``point of view,'' started online
salons to encourage postprogram conversation. One particularly
remarkable response _ to a program on the Vietnam War Memorial _
drove home for Weiss the potential of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   The theme for the Vietnam discussion sprang from Weiss'
realization that his ``whole life had been changed'' by the values
he learned in the anti-war movement of the 1960s and early '70s.
Whether people were for or against the war, had gone to Vietnam,
stayed home or come to America as refugees, he said, ``I realized
that there was a whole generation who had never reflected on how
their lives since the war had changed.''
</P>
<P>
   This theme _ notably sidestepping the polar arguments of the
last 25-plus years _ drew thousands to the site, creating 225
topics for discussion, each with 300 or 400 messages. ``We had vets
who said they learned more in that forum than they had in 25 years
at the veterans' hall,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   He says the success of the Vietnam forum inspired him to create
a nonprofit organization, Web Lab (www.weblab.org), that is
developing new models for online media and sponsoring projects that
bring ``fresh perspectives and new voices'' to the discussion of
public issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Web Lab software now under development will allow the
creation of highly structured online dialogue, using standard
bulletin-board technologies and features. But though the basic
technologies are standard, Web Lab's enhancements are not.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people interested in joining a Web Lab discussion
group must first complete a detailed registration form. The
software gathers these registration forms and sorts them by
categories, and when all the slots in a forum are filled, it spits
out an e-mail message to inform people that their group is ready to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Each group is limited to 60 or 70 people _ only about a third of
whom typically post messages _ to keep the conversation manageable.
But once the groups have started, Weiss and his team stay out of
the way, letting the group manage itself. ``Our function is
monitoring, not moderating,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Web Lab will produce the online discussion for
PBS' ``American Love Story,'' a five-episode ``P.O.V.'' program
about an interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss says Web Lab is already gathering people's stories on the
Web Lab site. And although he acknowledges that the discussion will
obviously include racial issues, Weiss says the theme _ again,
sidestepping the usual polarity of conversations about race _ is a
more universal question: ``How do couples negotiate their
differences?''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating differences is the key to online discussions and to
relationships, says Benjamin Barber, director of the Walt Whitman
Center for the Culture and Politics of Democracy at Rutgers
University.
</P>
<P>
   Barber, in conjunction with the Yale University Information
Society Project, has started Civic Exchange: Strong Democracy in
Cyberspace, a project based in part on the theories he developed in
his book on participatory democracy, ``Strong Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Financed by the Markle Foundation, Civic Exchange
(www.law.yale.edu/infosociety) is building an online environment
designed to reinvigorate the ideals of thoughtful democratic
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to address the dilemma that technology moves
people too fast,'' Barber says. ``It's an impediment to democracy,
which should be slow and deliberative. So we're trying to install
speed bumps on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the same kind of paradox exists for the Internet that
has always existed in the practice of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, democracy is about doing it yourself, he said.
``But to turn self-interested, narcissistic individuals into free
citizens takes education, acculturation and some sense of external
authority,'' to give them enough discipline to be responsible and
free.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Similarly, the Internet is designed to maximize speedy
do-it-yourself communication, without the intervention or hierarchy
of authority or even mediators.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes it appear more democratic,'' Barber said.
``But as we've seen, instead of knowledge, you get raw information.
Instead of informed opinion, you get private prejudice. Instead of
common ground, you get divisive private interests. So it isn't
democracy; it's anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet any introduction of editors or monitors is perceived as
undemocratic. Barber and his Yale partner on the project, Beth
Noveck, hope to bridge that dichotomy by inventing a new genre of
online discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Their Civic Exchange software will require that participants
answer a few questions before they gain access to the discussion
area. And when participants are in the discussion site, there are
stringent rules. ``But,'' Barber said, ``with the participation of
the others in the group, you can remake the rules or modify them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unchangeable, though, is a rule imposed by the software itself:
The group must elect its own moderator. Barber says this single
feature alone may solve the dilemma of online anarchy vs. democracy
_ if not for the Internet writ large, at least for those seeking
meaningful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the go-go culture of the Internet will slow down for
Civic Exchange's speed bumps is uncertain. But what drives the
group is the attempt to harness the network's strengths to people's
needs, instead of vice versa. ``It's about using the architecture
to your advantage, but not being victimized,'' Ms. Noveck says.
``At the very least, we shouldn't be bullied by it.''

 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stalin has issued the order to arrest and execute the
most prominent Jewish writers in the Soviet Union. Through a
clerical error, one of the 27 men arrested is an unknown,
unpublished writer named Pinchas Pelovits. In the tragicomic fable
``The 27th Man,'' the forlorn Pinchas _ a Zelig among the immortals
_ writes a story that the other captives applaud. Facing death, he
finally finds an audience.
</P>
<P>
   With its folkloric atmosphere and its mordant humor, ``The 27th
Man'' could have been written by I.B. Singer or, were it not for
the era in which it takes place, by Nikolai Gogol. It is actually
the work of a 29-year-old American, Nathan Englander, and appears
in his first book, ``For the Relief of Unbearable Urges.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, published by Alfred A. Knopf, is a collection of nine
stories about Orthodox Jews in extreme circumstances _ in the
Soviet Union, Israel and Brooklyn. The characters face and
sometimes overcome spiritual, moral and sexual crises.
</P>
<P>
   In another story, ``The Tumblers,'' a group of Polish Jews from
the legendary town of Chelm are deported to Auschwitz during World
War II and accidentally get on the wrong train. They save their
lives by joining a troupe of traveling gymnasts and quickly master
the art of acrobatics. In ``Reb Kringle,'' an Orthodox Jew who
works as a department store Santa Claus finally comes to terms with
his unorthodox predicament.
</P>
<P>
   In a Kafkaesque moment, a Protestant New Yorker riding in a
taxicab suddenly undergoes a magical conversion: He becomes Jewish.
And in the title story, a man in Tel Aviv whose wife no longer
wants to have sexual relations with him goes to his rabbi, who, as
special dispensation, gives him a prescription to visit a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Recently published, the collection has received glowing reviews.
In The New York Times Book Review, James E. Young characterized it
as ``a revelation of the human condition.'' One of the surprising
things is that the work, so seemingly esoteric, is also proving to
be popular with a wide audience. It has already gone into its sixth
printing.
</P>
<P>
   Englander said he was amazed by the reaction. As he said in a
recent luncheon interview at the Union Square Cafe, ``It's as if
I've done something sly by writing literary short stories about
Hasidim.'' When people approach him about buying the movie rights
to the stories, he feels as if he is walking in a dream: ``It's a
master case of the impostor complex. I might wake up and be asked
to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   For the book, he received an advance that was somewhat less than
the reported $350,000 but still high for a collection of stories.
That was Englander's first surprise. He said, ``I would have been
happy if Knopf had just given me a complete set of Everyman's
library,'' adding a stipulation, ``if they could have shipped it to
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Englander, who grew up in West Hempstead on Long Island, now
lives in Jerusalem, and in that is one of the many paradoxes of his
life. It was in Israel that he became a secular Jew, or, as he also
describes himself, ``a God-fearing atheist.''
</P>
<P>
   Born into an Orthodox Jewish family in an Orthodox Jewish
community, he studied at a yeshiva through his high school years
and observed all religious rules and traditions. He wore a
yarmulke, and his hair was short though with long sideburns.
Everybody he knew was Orthodox: ``I played on Orthodox baseball and
basketball teams.''
</P>
<P>
   In almost all respects, he was the perfect picture of the
yeshiva boy. ``I was a believer,'' he said. ``I was a little
zealot. I would have been terrified to walk through the doors of a
public school.''
</P>
<P>
   But he had theological questions, and they remained unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   After school, he watched television for hours every day. For
him, television provided an alternative and seemingly unattainable
reality. Except for that, and for one yeshiva teacher who
introduced him to Camus and Freud and encouraged his early attempts
at writing, his life was isolated and rarefied.
</P>
<P>
   During summers he commuted to Manhattan, where he worked for a
relative who was involved in arbitrage. It was expected that he
would continue his Orthodox education and then become a
stockbroker. Instead, at his insistence, he entered the State
University of New York at Binghamton for a liberal arts education.
</P>
<P>
   In his junior year he went to Israel, his first trip outside the
United States, and he was transformed by the experience.
Encountering secular Jews in Israel was a cultural shock. That year
he forsook his religious training, removed his yarmulke and let his
hair grow. Striking-looking with deeply set dark eyes, he now has
wild black locks: he could be a portrait subject for Edward
Burne-Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Immersing himself in literature and in the world around him, he
started to discover himself a writer. He took Orthodox Jews as his
subject, approaching them from his new perspective with skepticism
as well as a degree of lingering sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   At 22, he wrote the first version of ``The 27th Man.'' Although
the story is fictional, it has a basis in that ``Stalin executed 26
Yiddishists in the summer of 1952,'' he said. There is confusion
over the actual event: In some accounts, the writers were shot, in
others they were hung. ``I saw this terrible romantic irony that
all the writers were executed without their last story being told.
I felt that somebody should write them a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing it, he showed it to a friend's mother, who was a
children's book editor, and she became his private editor, guiding
him through successive rewrites, which he did over five years. She
also prodded him to go to graduate school. Reluctantly he applied
to the University of Iowa's Writers Workshop. He was admitted and
plunged into writing fiction.
</P>
<P>
   One day he drove Lois Rosenthal, the editor of Story magazine,
to the airport, and she asked if he had any stories to show her. He
had three with him, ``For the Relief of Unbearable Urges,'' ``Reb
Kringle'' and ``The 27th Man.'' All were published in Story, the
first one in 1996, and he acquired an agent, Nicole Aragi, who just
happened to be Arab.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Having been charmed by Jerusalem, Englander decided to move
there. Admittedly, the choice was odd considering that he was no
longer a religious Jew. Partly it was accidental. ``If I spoke
Italian, I might be in Rome, but I fell in love with Jerusalem,''
he said. ``I've had a real education there,'' one that has been
political as well as cultural. At one point, he began reading
Gogol, who ranks high among his literary influences.
</P>
<P>
   He writes six days a week. ``On the seventh day I rest,'' he
said, explaining that for several years that day was Tuesday and
now it is Friday. Generally he spends from six months to a year on
a story, and with each one he tries to hold to the logic of the
world he has created.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``The Tumblers,'' he was careful to be
historically accurate, except about the acrobatics. To avoid
second-guessing from professionals, he invented his own moves,
which have the sound of S.J. Perelman: Full Twisting Voltas, a Half
Hanlon and a Soaring Angel.
</P>
<P>
   Because his stories speak frankly about the Orthodox, he was
fearful that there would be an adverse reaction when the book was
published and he came back to the United States for a book tour.
``I assumed people would not even open the book and I would be
vilified,'' he said. But so far he has encountered no such
criticism, and Orthodox Jews, some from his hometown, have attended
his readings in various cities.
</P>
<P>
   After one reading, a friend from Long Island told him that he
had a different perception of their childhood: ``He found the world
_ our community, our school _ very nurturing.'' For Englander, it
was restrictive and binding. And for him it was another paradox:
``I left this world and now, in a sense, I've gotten it back. At
every reading I have different reunions with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Within his religious family, he maintains his secularity and
found particular support from his mother, who reads the stories in
various drafts and to whom the book is dedicated.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing his fiction, he said: ``It's an exploration of
people pushing against the boundaries of their world. For me, the
book is about identity issues, about those boundaries,'' and about
the bearing of unbearable urges. ``I think there are rights and
wrongs in the world, but it's a lot more complicated now that I've
given up on a very strict belief system.''
</P>
<P>
   While still writing stories, Englander has also been working on
a historical novel about Argentina. He spent several months there
in 1991. ``A lot of elements fascinated me: There were Nazis, a
military government, Jewish gauchos _ everything I could want, all
the irony I need.'' Though Orthodox Judaism continues to be his
literary preoccupation, he does not exclude the possibility that
eventually he may diversify his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   For the present, people still marvel at his emergence from such
a cloistered environment with his imagination intact. ``They want
to know how I could have left this community,'' he said. ``Wouldn't
it be a miracle if everyone born into a world stayed in that world,
if every Mormon stayed a Mormon. But people change and find
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his childhood in West Hempstead, a special slice
of suburbia, he said: ``I'm a fourth-generation American. I lived
in a shtetl with strip malls around it. Everything was so
forbidden. But when you know nothing else, it gets to be a real
adventure to find another world.''

BARAK, FORMING DOVISH CABINET, MAKES LEVY FOREIGN MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak took a few more
steps Sunday toward completing what looks like a strongly dovish
Cabinet, appointing David Levy to be foreign minister for the third
time.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, 61, a white-haired veteran of Israeli politics, made his
own appointment public after emerging from a session with Barak.
The prime minister-elect met all day with top members of his One
Israel party, a reconstituted version of Labor, to mete out
ministries _ those still available after he reached a coalition
agreement with six other political parties last week.
</P>
<P>
   A political moderate, Levy has said he strongly favors trading
land for peace and moving quickly forward to resume negotiations
with the Palestinians and with Syria. Palestinian officials
welcomed news of his appointment, although Palestinian and Israeli
analysts say they expect that Barak will be guiding foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Levy himself acknowledged as much in a radio interview Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister makes the policy and the foreign minister
carries it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and his new government will be sworn in on Wednesday,
ending what will have been a seven-week limbo period in which
Benjamin Netanyahu, the outgoing prime minister, and his Cabinet
lingered on.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging picture of Barak's Cabinet shows an overwhelming
majority of doves, with not even a handful of old-time hawks.
Because of this, it should not be an ordeal for Barak to line up
his Cabinet behind him on peace agreements, as it was for Netanyahu
_ if the new prime minister maintains good political relations with
his ministers.
</P>
<P>
   As it is shaping up, the 18-member Cabinet will be male except
for Dalia Itzhik of the Labor/One Israel Party, whose appointment
is definite although it is not clear to what post. The Cabinet will
mostly consist of men over age 50.
</P>
<P>
   And, with seven parties representing left, right, secular and
religious, it will be an ideological smorgasbord _ which some
experts find reflective of a sea change in Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The composition of Barak's government proves that the grand
ideologies in Israel have died, or at least are dying, quietly and
out of the spotlight,'' Sever Plotzker, a veteran analyst, wrote in
the newspaper Haaretz. ``There was almost no disagreement on the
new government's guidelines; on how to divide the pie, who gets
what and how much, there was plenty of disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Institutionally, the Israeli foreign minister, unlike the
American secretary of state, has been weaker than the defense
minister _ with the exception of the outgoing foreign minister,
Ariel Sharon, who quickly became the most powerful figure in
Netanyahu's government after his appointment early last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Because Barak will serve as his own defense minister, his
foreign minister will technically be second in command. Some doubt
that Levy, who is not considered a visionary, will play a profound
role.
</P>
<P>
   But others believe that Levy will do some battling for control
of policy _ especially if Shimon Peres, the former prime minister,
is appointed to what would be a newly created post of minister of
regional development, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, who was born and reared in Morocco, rose to prominence in
the 1960s as both a municipal and union leader in the construction
trade.
</P>
<P>
   He became an Israeli legend as one of the first North African
immigrants _ and the rare blue collar worker _ to battle his way
into the country's elite. And his rise, which was accompanied by
much mockery from that same elite, mirrored the transformation of
the Sephardic working class into a pivotal electoral bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1968, Israeli leaders have seen Levy as an essential ally
at least partly because he is a Sephardic Jew and considered a key
asset in getting out the vote of his fellow immigrants from North
Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Barak's One Israel party during the campaign, and
played a major role in persuading many longtime members of
Netanyahu's Likud Party of Middle Eastern origin to abandon their
party for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Levy was first elected to the Parliament in 1969, when he was
31, and he has served continuously ever since. His mentor, the late
Menachem Begin, considered him a political natural, and took him
under his wing in the conservative Herut Party, which later became
Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Levy assumed his first Cabinet post, minister of housing, when
Begin became prime minister in 1977. But he opposed Begin's war in
Lebanon in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Yitzhak Shamir appointed him foreign minister for
the first time, the appointment was scoffed at because of Levy's
lack of diplomatic experience and his only rudimentary knowledge of
English. Shamir himself, who made the appointment under political
pressure, was not a big fan, and kept his own foreign minister out
of his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, though, some critics were turned around by what
seemed to be Levy's instinctive diplomatic skills _ although
criticism of his administrative skills and what was perceived as
his thin-skinned ambition dogged him through both of his previous
terms.
</P>
<P>
   He formed his own party, Gesher, in 1995, as a social issues
party representing Sephardic immigrants. Gesher joined forces with
Netanyahu the following year, just as it melded into One Israel
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Levy served as Netanyahu's foreign minister for most of his
abbreviated tenure as prime minister, but quit in January 1998. He
said he was frustrated with the prime minister's political conduct
and with the stagnation of the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Among other key appointments announced so far: Natan Sharansky,
the Russian immigrant leader, will be the interior minister; Yossi
Sarid, leader of the leftist Meretz Party, will be the education
minister; Yitzhak Mordechai, the former defense minister, will be
the transportation minister; and Shas, the ultra-Orthodox Sephardic
party, will have the health, infrastructure and labor ministries.
</P>
<P>
   It was still unclear Sunday night who would hold the key post of
finance minister.

   APPALACHIA _ MCKEE, Ky. _ Tracy Bingham and her family grew up
like many in these parts. The rugged Appalachians corralled them,
funneled them to tobacco fields then shielded them from the
economic explosion that's roared through the South in the 1990s.
But, slowly, like the mountains themselves, the economic landscape
is shifting. Snatches of homegrown commerce poke through heavy
layers of poverty in Jackson County. Bingham opened a bakery in
March and now searches for prosperity and a better way for her two
kids in French vanilla cakes and the one-room photo studio her
daughter opened next to the display case of crullers, raspberry
pastries and bourbon balls. In some ways, she's a symbol of the new
Appalachia, an entrepreneur in a land that commerce forgot. Today
in Jackson County and other parts of eastern Kentucky, President
Clinton starts a six-state trip designed to encourage industry and
entrepreneurship in some of America's poorest communities.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Exceptionally hot and humid weather will grip much of the East
Monday and Tuesday as a large high pressure system, extending from
the earth's surface up to 20,000 feet, strengthens over the region.
Near the ground, the clockwise circulation around the high will
direct sultry air from the lower Mississippi Valley into the
Northeast. Hazy sunshine and breezes from the southwest, warming on
descent from the Appalachians, will promote near-record heat from
eastern Virginia to eastern Massachusetts. Indeed, afternoon
readings will exceed 100 degrees from Washington to Boston,
including metropolitan New York and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Currents of sinking air associated with the expansive high
pressure will limit rainfall over most of the East. Isolated
afternoon thunderstorms may form, however, in the Appalachians and
near the Southeast coast where developing sea breezes undercut and
lift the muggy air.
</P>
<P>
   A disturbance traveling along the southern flank of the jet
stream will spark clusters of thunderstorms near the Canadian
border, especially over the northern Great Lakes and in northern
New England. Some of the storms will contain prolific rain and
damaging wind gusts.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal temperatures and ample sunshine will cover the West
Monday. An exception will be near portions of the Pacific coastline
where gentle onshore breezes bring patches of morning low clouds.
Additionally, scattered clouds and spotty afternoon thunderstorms
will accompany a plume of moisture streaming into the Southwestern
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: Hot Sounds
</P>
<P>
   Heat waves are noisy. Near busy airports, the number of
complaints about noise from commercial jets increases during hot
weather. As temperatures rise, the density of air decreases as air
molecules move faster and spread farther apart. The relatively low
density of hot air reduces aerodynamic lift. As a result, large
jets take longer to climb after take-off, exacerbating noise
problems in residential areas along flight paths. With temperatures
rising toward 100 degrees over much of the Northeast early this
week, the hot sounds from jet engines will reach a crescendo at
major airports.
</P>
<P>
   EXTENDED FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Thursday: A cool front preceded by thunderstorms will
lessen the heat and humidity in the Northeast. The Middle Atlantic
states will stay hot. Sultry weather with scattered thunder will
prevail in the Southeast. Meanwhile, most of the Plains will be hot
with little rain. A resurgence of heat and humidity will promote
thundery conditions in the upper Middle West. Most of the West will
be hot with ample sun. The Northwest will be seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Saturday: Heat and humidity will increase in most of the
Northeast. Farther west, strong thunderstorms will precede a cold
front from the Great Lakes to the central Plains. In the wake of
the front, the northern Plains will be cooler and drier. Showers
will become more numerous in the sultry air over the Southeast.
Afternoon thunder will be common over the central and southern
Rockies. Otherwise, the West will be sunny and very warm.

   SEOUL _ North Korea has softened its enemies in the South using
a weapon that no one could have imagined during the long years of
North-South confrontation _ cold noodles, Pyongyang-style.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans are shipping buckwheat, bean paste and liquor
here to satiate the appetites of South Koreans yearning for a taste
of life above the Demilitarized Zone that still divides the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The food is arriving here at a time when millions of North
Koreans survive on tree bark and the husks of corn kernels and the
country is getting millions of tons of emergency food aid from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer is an unabashedly capitalist entrepreneur whose
Okryukwan Restaurant takes its ingredients, cuisine _ and name _
from the original restaurant founded on orders from the late North
Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting 10 tons of buckwheat a month for noodles,'' said
the owner, Kim Young Baek, who sees the venture as a marriage
between his own capitalist drive to open up North Korea and North
Korea's need for hard cash. ``We don't think about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all in accordance with the ``sunshine policy'' promoted
by President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea to reduce border tensions
after years in which South Korea's national security law forbade
the least sign of Pyongyang influence in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   These days, bags shipped from the North Korean port of Nampo to
the South Korean port of Inchon litter the office of the Okryukwan.
Their labels clearly say ``DPR Korea'' for Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, a name banned in Seoul in print until a year or
so ago.
</P>
<P>
   The original Okryukwan in Pyongyang used to dish up 10,000 daily
servings, but now serves just occasional foreign visitors and VIPs,
Kim said. His own Okryukwan, meanwhile, can hardly cope with the
crowds lined up at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Customers try not to think of the horrors of the Korean War or
the current suffering of starving North Koreans as they wait
happily for a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the North Koreans, but what can you do?''
asked Eum Seong Jin, a university student, standing in line with a
couple of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beside him, Shin Hyun Joo, working for an American company,
contrasted her response to the North with that of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents' generation went through the Korean War,'' she
said. ``Many left families behind in the North. They have strong
feelings. We don't have those feelings. It's like it's a different
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, all 360 seats on three floors were filled with diners
tucking in on the famous cold noodles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes this place special is we know the recipe is
straight from Pyongyang,'' said Kim Ok Ja, visiting the restaurant
with her husband. ``The flavoring is different.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the result of the culinary skills of two employees: a
chef who holds a Japanese passport and was trained at the Okryukwan
in Pyongyang, and a defector who once worked at another restaurant
in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're training all our 27 cooks,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   To further guarantee authenticity, he has purchased hundreds of
chopsticks, ceramic spoons, plates and bowls from the North, all
displaying the label of the Okryukwan Restaurant. Some of them bear
the initials ``DPRK'' on the bottom. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who has been importing metal products from the North for
eight years, sees the restaurant as setting three precedents:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1991, when there was the first economic cooperation
between North and South, all the business was in the North,'' he
said. ``This is the first such business in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now all economic transactions between North and South
were based on crops and raw materials,'' he said. Now Koreans ``can
feel real cooperation since this is a service sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang, he added, ``is going to register the name of
Okryukwan in the South,'' and the South Korean government has
promised to accept it. ``That means, if a South Korean company
wants to sell anything in the North, North Korea will register its
brand as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attributes help account for the restaurant's popularity
among South Koreans curious about life in the North. &QL;

   He has the permission of the South Korean government, eager to
push reconciliation with the North, as well as the cooperation of
North Korean authorities, eager to export their products.
</P>
<P>
   The question, however, is how long supplies can last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the food shortage problem in the North, we
anticipate that the supply will not be stable,'' said Kim, who has
asked for three shipments of buckwheat a month as well as a ton a
month of mung bean, used in Pyongyang-style pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   He talks every day to representatives of a trading company in
North Korea, patching calls through Tokyo. A Korean-Japanese
company handles the paperwork for shipments that Pyongyang still
does not want to recognize as moving directly to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure where they get the buckwheat and the mung bean,''
Kim said, but he believes the North Koreans buy it on a free market
that has grown as government agencies break down. &QL;

   In the meantime, Okryukwan attempts to live up to the reputation
of its namesake in Pyongyang. A painting of the original Okryukwan,
made by a North Korean artist, adorns the outside wall.

   There are no signs, however, of Kim Il Sung, the longtime North
Korean leader who ordered the establishment of the Okryukwan in the
early 1960s, or his son and heir, Kim Jong Il. ``We are completely
non-political,'' Kim, the restaurant owner, emphasized. &QL;

<P>
   COMMERCE CITY, Colo. _ To the typical ``four-wheeler'' _
truck-driver slang for motorists _ the image of the American truck
stop is a grungy, tobacco-infused place serving chicken-fried steak
and 48-hour coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But as they zoom down I-70 toward the Rockies this weekend,
travelers might be tempted to brake for the new truck stop built by
Travel Centers of America endowed with architectural fireworks:
ribbed aluminum (a nod to the American diner), a huge striped
awning (the traditional sign of welcome) and the ultimate highway
seducer _ neon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reminds me of Disneyland,'' said James La Porte, a
self-employed trucker from Brighton, Colo., who was buying lube
oil. ``Haven't seen a truck stop lit up like it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he hadn't even been inside the marble shower stalls, modeled
on the Ritz-Carlton. (Today's travel tip: The showers are free with
the purchase of 50 gallons of diesel fuel.)
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its 80-or-so-year history, the American
truck stop has been ``re-imaged,'' as designers like to say, with
nostalgic roadside touches harking back to the California coffee
shops of the 1950s (called ``Googies'') and the original parabolic
McDonald's. Though ``truck stop design'' seems like an oxymoron, it
is the latest transformation of the province of professional
haulers into a ``stopping center'' styled to lure the car and
recreational vehicle trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question was, was it the wrong image?'' said Paul
Westlake, the Cleveland architect for the new truck stop, speaking
of the Donald Trump-like red Spanish marble in the showers _ a
ritzy material highly forgiving with soap scum. ``Would truckers
perceive it as too upscale, that they'd be paying for it in their
diesel fuel?''
</P>
<P>
   In a design trend as yet unheralded by Architectural Digest, a
new building type has been born, one that seeks to revive ``the wow
factor,'' as Westlake calls it, that dazzled motorists of the '50s
before television advertising and computer reservations took over.
It may one day stand proudly with such giants of the American
highway as Bob's Big Boy (circa 1949) in Toluca Lake, Calif., a
building-as-billboard relished by aficionados as the architectural
equivalent of a double-decker cheeseburger with pickles on a sesame
seed bun.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, shrinking profit margins on diesel fuel and
increasingly efficient truck engines have caused companies like the
Ohio-based Travel Centers of America, the largest full-service
truck stop company in the country, to look to four-wheelers,
including RV's, for profits. A 1995 study commissioned by NATSO,
formerly the National Association of Truck Stop Operators,
estimated that if just 1 percent of rural auto traffic were
diverted to buying gas and eating meals at truck stops, the result
would be an extra $300 million annually for a $37 billion a year
industry. (Most budget-conscious truckers, noted Forrest Baker, a
retired trucking industry consultant, do not eat two sit-down meals
a day and ``one may consist of bread and bologna.'')
</P>
<P>
   At least 80 percent of truck stops now call themselves ``travel
plazas.'' Travelers can visit a massage therapist, see a
chiropractor, get a manicure or, in the case of Sierra Sid's 76
Auto/Truck Stop Casino on I-80 in Sparks, Nev., marvel at Sid's gun
collection and Elvis memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger is better at the Petro Co.'s Wheeler Ridge center, which
just opened on I-5, near Bakersfield, Calif., with a 40-seat movie
theater and an Internet lounge. At most Petro and Travel Center of
America stops, subscribing truckers can plug into the popular park
and view system, which turns their cabs into motel rooms, complete
with 24-hour e-mail, cable television and a wake-up call.
</P>
<P>
   But Commerce City, just northeast of Denver, is the vanguard of
new design and will be replicated at 40 or so sites by Travel
Centers of America _ which is owned by Clipper Group, a Wall Street
investment firm _ around the country this year. The goal is a 50-50
trucker-traveler ratio, though 80 percent of customers are
currently truckers, said Michael O'Connor, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The building, which opened in June, is an improbable piece of
choreography for two somewhat clashing cultures _ one predicated on
the notion that architecture can make opposites attract. There are
separate entrances, one snazzy with the neon facing the highway for
motorists (leading to a gift-and-convenience store), and a
no-nonsense ``professional drivers only'' door at the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want the trucks seen first,'' O'Connor explained,
``because that would scare off the motorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Travel Centers did extensive research to determine what truckers
wanted. The answer: a clean shower (foggy mirrors and mop buckets
being prime pet peeves, along with recreational vehicles that move
an infuriating 20 mph up a slope).
</P>
<P>
   ``We like them way big,'' said Dale Curry, a freshly shampooed
trucker from Fort Worth, speaking of the preference for double-wide
showers. ``We sit around all day. You're in kind of a coffin, you
might say.''
</P>
<P>
   For truckers' comfort, Travel Centers studied ``the essence of
the Ritz-Carlton bathroom,'' O'Connor said. At a test site in Gary,
Ind., marble, granite and fiberglass showers were offered. Marble
won unanimously in exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists and truckers share bathrooms, a drop-off laundry and
the attention of waitresses. But there is a special truckers-only
shaving room because ``when motorists come in they don't want to
see a half-dressed trucker shaving,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to make the trucker feel at home, the repair shop
``celebrates the machine,'' said Westlake, whose firm, van Dijk,
Pace, Westlake, usually specializes in cultural facilities. One day
in June, light streamed through a bank of glass block windows,
glinting off the stacks of Kenworths and Peterbilts, spotlighting
them like beauty queens on a stage.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike fast-food restaurants and gas stations, truck stops never
had a distinct style. ``The tradition was there wasn't any,'' notes
Steven Izenour, a partner of Venturi Scott Brown, the Philadelphia
architecture firm, and a co-author of ``Learning from Las Vegas,''
a scholarly celebration of commercial architecture and the Las
Vegas strip. ``Architecturally, they've been amorphous boxes strewn
across the tarmac.''
</P>
<P>
   Before superhighways, any place a trucker could fuel his rig and
get a bite to eat counted as a truck stop. Most were mom-and-pop
operations with one pump, a part-time mechanic and a pot of coffee
on the stove; ``open all night'' meant the keys were on a nail next
to the door.
</P>
<P>
   As Jessica Rowcroft, an architectural historian with the
Massachusetts Historical Commission noted, most of the growth of
the modern truck stop came in the 1960s with the heyday of the
interstate highway and the rise of franchises. From a motley array
of separate buildings, the truck stop was consolidated under one
roof, leaving more room for parking. Truck stops began luring
automobiles with intensely lighted gasoline fuel islands. ``We call
it the moth syndrome,'' Westlake said.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving his truck-stop commission, Westlake gathered
images that evoked the emotion of road travel _ including ``roofs
that look like they braked at 60 mph.'' Then he hit the road,
visiting truck stops with character like ``Iowa 80'' in Walcott,
Iowa, a timber-framed chalet billed as the world's largest, and
not-so-fabled ones that ``reeked of diesel fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   But whether truckers and motorists will latch on to each other
like lug nuts to an axle is still a question to be mulled,
preferably over coffee and chocolate-silk pie, as David Kinney, a
lease operator with C.R. England &AMP; Sons, a trucking company in Salt
Lake City, did one recent afternoon in Commerce City.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of friction,'' he said between forkfuls. ``See
that store there? Motorists buy trinkets. Truck drivers are bargain
shoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clark, a trucker from Wheatland, Wyo., said that tourists
were the reason he avoided the entire state of Arizona. ``You can
stand in line forever behind 20 tourists buying candy bars,'' he
said, fuming. ``A truck stop should be a place to park, fuel and
get out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Standing near a battalion of truckers and tourists playing video
games, the freshly showered Curry waxed philosophical. ``I don't
mind if  &UR; they &LR;  don't,'' he said of sharing the truck stop. ``You
get tired of looking at truckers all the time.'' Which is one
reason the architects included panoramic windows.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Merrit, a trucker from Cheney, Wash., was thinking more
about what the designers left out: separate bathrooms for women
truck drivers. Most truck stop bathrooms ``are so nasty,'' said Ms.
Merrit, she keeps a personal jug in her garnet Freightline cab.
</P>
<P>
   A former librarian with neat upswept hair, Ms. Merrit met her
future husband, Louis Delp, a trucker, while she was driving her
car in California. He waved. She waved. She plastered her phone
number in the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Before pulling off from Commerce City with her load of Coors
beer, Ms. Merrit offered a last word on the importance of design to
truckers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it when my husband's shirts don't come out tie-dyed
from the laundry,'' she said. ``And what really matters more than
anything is if someone's decent to you.''

   With each new generation of software, user manuals get skimpier
in inverse proportion to the addition of new features. The user
manual for MS-DOS in 1982, for example, was 486 dense pages; the
manual for Windows 95, with tens of thousands more features, was a
stingy 95 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Software companies insist that they now produce programs so
intuitive that manuals are unnecessary, and that besides, built-in
help systems are far more useful.
</P>
<P>
   But sales of aftermarket computer books say consumers think
otherwise. In fact, Microsoft Office 2000, the recent upgrade of
the world's best-selling suite of business software, is turning out
to be the 1999 Full Employment Act for writers, editors and
publishers of computer books.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bennett, president of MacMillan Publishing USA, says his
company has 56 titles dedicated to Office 2000 _ 14 percent of all
its titles this year. IDG Books, best known for its ``... for
Dummies'' series, is also unleashing a torrent of Office 2000
books. The lure for both companies is the estimated $1.1 billion
consumers will spend on technical books this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, tying a book's fortunes to software sales can be risky.
``Windows 98 met with a resounding ho-hum,'' Bennett noted.

   Two FCC Officials Say Merger Isn't a Done Deal
</P>
<P>
   The media coverage of last week's merger-approval deal between
the staff of the Federal Communications Commission and SBC
Communications Inc., which is trying to acquire Ameritech Corp.,
rubbed at least a couple of the five commissioners the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Though at least some news organizations, including The New York
Times, said the agreement meant that SBC had cleared a big hurdle
in winning approval for the merger, two of the commissioners said,
in effect, ``Not so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to the suggestion of some press accounts, neither we
nor the full commission has indicated even tentative approval of
the SBC-Ameritech transaction or conditions,'' Commissioner Gloria
Tristani, a Democrat, and Commissioner Harold Furchtgott-Roth, a
Republican, said in a statement on Wednesday. ``Indeed, to do so
before the record has even closed would be improper.''
</P>
<P>
   According to people close to the commission, the deal was
negotiated by the agency's staff under the supervision of the FCC's
chairman, William Kennard, and Ms. Tristani and Furchtgott-Roth
were apparently upset by the assumption that the other four
commissioners would simply rubber-stamp the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That said, few people in Washington expect the deal to get voted
down after the commission hears public comments on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tristani is considered a strong supporter of Kennard, while
Furchtgott-Roth is often at odds with the chairman. But people
close to the commission said that Ms. Tristani and Furchtgott-Roth
often join forces on procedural matters.

   A Good Nerd These Days Must Be Able to Stream
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, they might have been the budding engineers who
built model rockets or maintained the high school's lone film
projector as screwdriver-carrying members of the AV Club. A decade
ago they would have been the geeks setting up the school computer
lab.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the tekkie nerds have gone online and multimedia
_ at least judging from three Dearborn (Mich.) High School students
who were in New York last week. The young men attended the
Streaming Media convention at the Sheraton New York, where they
demonstrated last term's project from their advanced video
production course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get the kids who are the weirdos,'' their avuncular,
68-year-old teacher, Russ Gibb, said approvingly as three of his
students demonstrated a wearable computer with a Webcam that they
and others in Gibb's class built for $5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Besides functioning as a standard personal computer, the system
contains a wireless transmitter that can send streams of video and
audio data to a Web-server computer. When worn in the halls and
classrooms of Dearborn High, the unit can transmit everything the
wearer hears and sees to the school's Web site
(www.dearbornschools.org/wdhs) _ potentially useful for letting a
sick schoolmate monitor a class from a home computer, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The computer runs the Linux operating system favored by the
technically adept of all ages who wish to make an anti-Microsoft
statement. But the machine also runs Microsoft Windows 95. That's
because most multimedia software is designed to work with Windows,
explained one of the students, Brandon Gheen, whose business card
lists his title as Student Computer Engineer.
</P>
<P>
   One of his card recipients at the conference was Anthony Bray,
general manager of Microsoft's Streaming Media Division, who said
he was impressed with the students' project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audio, video and animation are the second wave of Internet
technology,'' Bray said. ``I expect that a large percentage of
innovative new content, services and applications will come from
young entrepreneurs, and these three kids give us a glimpse of that
future.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gheen pronounced Bray ``cool.'' But he and his
fellow students, Patrick Murray and Alex Fisher, subsequently
critiqued what they see as the shortcoming of Microsoft's own
multimedia strategy _ with a specificity and technical vocabulary
too abstruse for a model-rocket-era reporter to process in a single
stream.
</P>
<P>
   Had they shared these opinions with the Microsoft executive?
``There's a time and a place for everything,'' Fisher said, wise
beyond his 18 years.

   In another move toward consolidation in the Greek banking

   Varsitybooks.com, an online bookseller, plans to announce this
week that it has signed contracts with nearly a dozen small
universities, colleges and other schools to sell textbooks. In some
cases, the arrangements mean that schools are completely closing
their book-selling operations and sending their students to the
company's Web site.

   IMPROVING THE LEVEL OF CHAT ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Noting a seemingly insatiable appetite for public messaging,
some people argue that the future of the Internet depends on making
this crucial component more satisfying for everyone. To move people
beyond the graffiti quality of much online messaging, two projects
are developing software and discussion practices that encourage
them to talk to, rather than at, one another.
</P>
<P>
   STREAMING IS GEEKS' CUTTING EDGE
</P>
<P>
   Judging from three Michigan high school students who were in New
York at the Streaming Media convention, the nerds have gone online.
The students demonstrated a project from their advanced
video-production course, a wearable computer with a Webcam. Besides
functioning as a standard personal computer, the system contains a
wireless transmitter that can send everything the wearer hears and
sees to the school's Web site.

   TWO NETWORKS GETTING IN THE RING
</P>

   Two networks are joining the professional wrestling fray, with
UPN scheduling two hours on Thursdays in the fall and TNN, the
Nashville Network, signing a deal for an hourlong show on Friday
nights.

   U.S. MARKETS CLOSED
</P>
<P>
   The stock market and other financial markets in the United
States are closed Monday in observance of the Fourth of July. Most
overseas markets, however, are open. U.S. markets will reopen
Tuesday.

IN LONDON, HUNGER FOR THE CHOICE ART MORSEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Four disappointed bidders were prepared to spend more
than $24 million on a Degas pastel at Sotheby's here last week in a
telling indication of today's art market: There is plenty of money
to be spent but not enough great works to spend it on. During last
week's back-to-back auctions of impressionist, contemporary and
modern art, high prices were consistently paid. In some cases the
prices were well deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The Degas, ``Dancer in Repose,'' an 1879 image of a dancer
sitting on a bench massaging her foot, was one of the week's
exceptional works. It had not been for sale for 104 years and had
never been exhibited outside France. The pastel, which was expected
to sell for $8 million, broke all records for Degas, selling to an
unidentified telephone bidder for $27.9 million, more than three
times its estimate.
</P>
<P>
   A staggering price was not altogether unexpected. Not only is
``Dancer in Repose'' a beautiful image with vibrant colors, but it
also has an impeccable provenance. Jules-Emile Boivin, a French
businessman, acquired it from Durand-Ruel, the first great
impressionist dealer in Paris, in 1885 and it had remained in the
Boivin family, which was now selling it.
</P>
<P>
   Offers for the work rose in astonishing increments of $800,000.
In addition to four tenacious telephone bidders, David Nash, a
private New York dealer, was bidding in the sales room, presumably
for his client Paul Allen, one of the founders of Microsoft. Nash
dropped out at $25.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Melanie Clore, Sotheby's deputy chairman in Europe,
took the winning bid, whispering spectators began speculating about
who the buyer could be. Was it the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los
Angeles? Its board was traveling in England at the time of the sale
and could have viewed the pastel. But if it was the winner, the
museum was not ready to declare itself so.
</P>
<P>
   Or could it have been Stephen Wynn, the Las Vegas casino owner
who has spent millions of dollars putting together a mini-museum at
Bellagio, one of his newest casino hotels? Reached by telephone,
Wynn said he was not the buyer. ``Some people from Sotheby's
stopped by and showed the Degas to me,'' he said. ``We put it next
to the one I already have, which is just as good. I don't know who
bought it, but they got a first-rate picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Because both Sotheby's and Christie's offer such shop-at-home
service (months before the sale, auction-house experts travel
around the world with their top works so collectors can see them
without having to go to London) the sales rooms were not as packed
with Americans as they had been in recent years. But Americans
accounted for a good deal of the week's total sales and for the
active telephone bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than 1,000 people from about a dozen countries
crowded the Bond Street sales room of Sotheby's on the night of its
impressionist and modern art sale. They were not disappointed in
the theatrics of it all.
</P>
<P>
   When a Matisse, ``Yellow Dress and Multicolored Dress (Nezy and
Lydia),'' a colorful painting from 1940, came on the block, a
gray-haired man who wore dark glasses and whose accent was
unmistakably American, thrust his hand in the air to proclaim his
intention to bid and finally bought the painting for $11.3 million,
more than twice the $4.8 million high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly nicknamed ``Shades'' by people in the audience, he
left the sales room right after he bought the painting, trailed by
reporters trying unsuccessfully to find out his name. Sotheby's
officials let him slip out of a side door.
</P>
<P>
   Such wild bidding, which has not been seen at sales in New York
or London since the heady days of the 1980s, left the audience
applauding. Many people there said the buyer was a Hollywood
producer, but nobody knew exactly who he was. Experts were
astonished by the high price, noting that while decorative, the
work is hardly considered one of the artist's best.
</P>
<P>
   Another Degas pastel, also being sold by the Boivin family,
``Woman Sitting in Front of a Piano'' (1882-1885), was also
expected to fetch a high price. Three dealers tried to buy it: Nash
and two London dealers, Thomas Gibson and Joe Nahmad. But none were
willing to pay much more than its $4 million low estimate. Nash
bought the pastel for $4.8 million, presumably on behalf of Allen.
</P>
<P>
   (All prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in years dealers were seen buying works for
their inventory, an indication that in some cases they considered
the prices reasonable enough to make a profit on resale. It was
also a sign of the scarcity of works on the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of pictures which 12 months ago were the soft underbelly
of the market were not simply sold, but for high prices, indicating
the general strength of things,'' said James Roundell, a London
dealer.

<P>
   Desmond Corcoran, a London dealer, paid a record price for a
Juan Gris at Christie's sale of 20th-century art on Wednesday
night. The cubist still life, ``Cup, Glass and Bottle (The
Newspaper),'' painted in 1914 shortly before the outbreak of World
War I, is a collage painting combining real bits of newspaper with
a trompe l'oeil rendering of a wine bottle and coffee cup.
</P>
<P>
   It had been estimated to bring $1.5 million to $1.9 million.
Five bidders tried to take the painting home. Corcoran won, paying
$4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other high prices were recorded at that sale, too. Francis
Bacon's ``Three Studies for a Self-Portrait'' from 1976 was
estimated to sell for $1.3 million to $1.9 million. It was bought
for $2.9 million by a telephone bidder identified by Christie's
officials only as an American collector.
</P>
<P>
   Five bidders at the same sale vied for Leger's ``Woman Holding a
Book,'' which was bought by another unidentified American bidding
by telephone. Estimated to fetch $810,000 to $1.1 million, it sold
for $2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier that day collectors ignored Christie's estimates
completely and paid top dollar at a sale of works by the
Catalan-born sculptor Julio Gonzalez. The collection was being sold
by the Hartung Foundation, created in 1994 shortly after the death
of Hans Hartung, a German-born artist who lived in Paris and who
was married to Gonzalez's daughter, Roberta.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the sale were more than 18 sculptures and 60
drawings by Gonzalez, who is widely credited with inspiring
Picasso, David Smith and Calder in the tradition of welded metal
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's slim sculptures often consist of iron rods connected
by arcs of metal in human shapes. Most offered for sale are bronze
casts produced posthumously in 1952, so when an original
hand-forged piece by him is available it is considered an art-world
event.
</P>
<P>
   In the packed sales room, collectors were willing to spend 10
times the estimates for the choicest Gonzalez pieces. ``Head of a
Woman II'' from 1931, a masklike sculpture that was estimated to
bring $300,000 to $360,000, set a world record for the artist's
work, selling to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3.2 million.
``Gothic Man,'' an abstract sculpture of geometric forms conceived
in 1937, also sold for more than 10 times its high estimate, going
for $2.9 million from an unidentified European collector.
</P>
<P>
   From the same year, ``Rigid Shape (Very Fine Shape),'' an
elegant, abstract construction, was bought by another unidentified
American collector for $958,270, more than five times its $190,000
high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The entire sale totaled $14.5 million, more than four times its
$3.2 million high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,''
said Franck Giraud, head of Christie's 19th- and 20th-century art
departments worldwide. ``As confidence built throughout the sale,
what was thought to be a predictable success reached a level that
no one could ever have anticipated.''

some states have more effective laws and regulatory agencies than

 &HT;    Close call between Jarrett, Earnhardt
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ It was one of them Dales.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway _ the
first U.S. auto race ever televised on prime-time network
television _ lacked the climatic finish NASCAR and CBS officials
were hoping for, but the race under the lights still turned into a
late shootout between Dale Jarrett and Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   After debris on the track _ Kenny Irwin's fuel ``catch can'' _
seemed to set up a 10-lap sprint to the finish between a handful of
cars, Jeremy Mayfield spun out with three laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   That ignited a multicar accident in turn 2, which brought out
the race's second yellow flag, allowing Jarrett to finish under
caution for his third victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The win gave Jarrett the Winston Cup points lead for the seventh
week in a row, this one a 177-point advantage over Bobby Labonte
heading into the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt finished second, followed by Jeff Burton, Mike Skinner
and Labonte. Jeff Gordon, who was attempting to become only the
fifth driver to win three races in a row at Daytona, finished a
disappointing 21st.
</P>
<P>
   With 17 of 34 races remaining, Jarrett seems to have a
commanding lead in his quest for his first Winston Cup title. Not
since 1992, when the late Alan Kulwicki overtook the late Davey
Allison in the last race of the season, has a driver leading at the
halfway point failed to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good stat to know,'' said Jarrett, who finished
third, second and third in points the last three years,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to end that string,'' he said. ``Without sounding
cocky or overconfident, if we can continue doing what we've done,
they'll have trouble catching us. But it only takes one race to
make this a close battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's fortunes finally changed at Daytona, where he'd
finished 34th, 23rd and 37th in the last three races on the
2.5-mile superspeedway. In the season-opening Daytona 500, Jarrett
completed only 134 laps after his No. 88 Ford made contact with
teammate Irwin's No. 28 Ford, leaving him 36th in points.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, Jarrett finished outside the top 10 only
once _ 11th at Las Vegas on March 7. He finished in the top five in
all but two of the last 15 events, and won three of the last seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember being involved in anything like it,'' Jarrett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've overcome some things where we shouldn't have finished in
the top 10 and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett probably wouldn't have finished in the top 10 on
Saturday night without the final caution flag. After taking only a
splash of gas on his last pit stop, Jarrett's car ran out of fuel
after finishing the cool-down lap. His crew members had to push the
car from pit road to victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett says the outcome wouldn't have changed if the race had
been completed under green. Earnhardt, who finished second to
Gordon in the Daytona 500, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think within a few more laps we would have gotten by
Jarrett,'' Earnhardt said. ``He might have run out of gas, because
he was really close. That caution really helped him.

 &HT;    A peach of a day
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The big story at the 30th Peachtree Road Race on
Sunday was the new finish, and not just the change to the end of
the course. For only the second time since 1991, a Kenyan failed to
capture either the men's or women's title at the world's largest
10K.
</P>
<P>
   Khalid Khannouchi of Morocco defended his Peachtree title in 27
minutes, 45 seconds, well ahead of John Korir of Kenya. Elana Meyer
of South Africa won the first Peachtree she ever entered in 31:34,
nipping another Kenyan, Catherine Ndereba, by 9 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi and Meyer won $25,000 each from the Professional Road
Racing Organization, which tags the Peachtree as its championship.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the river of 55,000 runners past a starred, striped and
clapping crowd pumped up Khannouchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to win this on the Fourth of July, because I'm
trying to get my citizenship,'' said Khannouchi, who lives in New
York. ``It's just great.''
</P>
<P>
   The race's third decade dawned with a new downhill finish on
10th Street, which received mixed reviews from those in the swollen
middle of the pack. As the lanes narrowed approaching Piedmont
Park, runners had to stop and walk, and that made some grumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like that bottleneck at the end,'' said Claudia
Ritchie, 52. ``I was trying to beat my (best) time.'' Others said
the slowdown was much worse in the old, winding finish through the
park.
</P>
<P>
   The new finish meant that the old course records were just that.
In the wheelchair race, Saul Mendoza of northern Atlanta, by way of
Mexico, clipped a second off the old record with 19:05. Chantal
Petitclerc of Canada (24:13) defended her title and beat her course
record.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who crossed the line an hour later on this sunny
holiday, though, took home the coveted T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely lived up to its hype,'' said Andy Goldberg, 32,
a dental technician from Cumming, holding up his shirt after
completing his first Peachtree. ``I'm going to wear this around
like a trophy.''

SERBIAN WOMEN ATTRIBUTE PLUNGING BIRTHRATE TO FEAR OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Before Serbia went to war with the West,
Vesna Markovic wanted three children. Since the Kosovo conflict,
she has often been sorry that she has one.
</P>
<P>
   To raise the money to provide her 8-year-old son with food,
clothes and toys, Mrs. Markovic, 27, an economist who works at an
electric utility in Belgrade, has become a smuggler of gasoline and
disposable diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Most evenings after work, she and her husband, Zoran, a Serbian
policeman, make a 200-mile round trip from here to the Bosnian town
of Bijeljina to buy about 30 gallons of gas and six boxes of
Pampers _ goods that are in chronic short supply in the collapsed
Serbian economy. For each round of nocturnal smuggling, they
usually pocket about $57.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all become poorer and it is not good to raise children
like this,'' said Mrs. Markovic, who says she has learned how to
tune out her parents, who continue to nag her to have more babies.
</P>
<P>
   It is called the ``white plague.'' Policy makers in Serbia have
been grumbling for decades about the decline in the birthrate, as
have politicians and pundits across much of Europe. But the decline
has accelerated among the Serbs as never before under the rule of
Slobodan Milosevic _ a 12-year span scarred by four lost wars, an
imploding economy and the mass exodus of young people, often the
best and brightest.
</P>
<P>
   During a decade in which Milosevic has sent legions of Serbian
men off to carve a Greater Serbia out of the ruins of the old
Yugoslavia, the women of this country, in perhaps the most intimate
and pivotal decisions of their lives, are quietly choosing to make
a less populous Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The damage from NATO bombs to factories and bridges will have
much less effect in the long run on Serbia than the rapid decline
in the birthrate,'' said Dr. Spasoje Petkovic, an
obstetrician-gynecologist who is acting director of the Clinical
Center of Serbia, the country's largest hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Population statistics, along with interviews with women and
their doctors, suggest that Serbian women of child-bearing age are
deciding in unprecedented numbers that Milosevic's Serbia is not
the place to raise children.
</P>
<P>
   According to government statistics, there were 58,000 babies
born in central Serbia in 1998, a 15 percent decline since 1990 and
the lowest total since the end of World War II. In central Serbia,
the population growth rate has slid this decade from 1.2 percent on
the plus side to 1.8 percent on the minus side, government figures
show.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Serbia's abortion rate appears to be rising
sharply and increasing numbers of young women are telling doctors
they do not want to give birth, according to two senior
obstetricians at Serbia's largest maternity hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The primary reasons for the accelerating decline in the
birthrate, according to woman and their obstetricians, is anxiety
about the war in Kosovo, fear of civil war in Serbia and
unwillingness to raise children in a nation that once had the
highest living standard in eastern Europe but over the past decade
has gotten poorer every year.
</P>
<P>
   Vanja Kovac, wearing a blue nightgown she brought from home,
waited her turn last Friday for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old supermarket clerk from Belgrade already has two
children.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was now in the Clinical Center of Serbia for an
abortion because she and her husband, who is a night watchman,
simply cannot afford to feed another child. Abortions are available
on demand here for anyone over age 18 during the first 10 weeks of
pregnancy. They cost about $25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easier in these times not to have a child than to have
one who does not have enough clothes and food,'' said Mrs. Kovac.
``It is also very risky because of the radiation from the bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are rampant in Serbia that American bombs have created
high levels of radiation that causes birth defects. Alarmed by the
rumors and by hospital reports of a spike in the number of
abortions here, the Serbian government issued a statement in late
May saying that the radiation rumors had been investigated and
proven scientifically to be false.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, however, government officials had issued alarming
warnings about chemical pollution to the air and water near
Belgrade after NATO bombings of refineries and other industrial
facilities close to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   On May 28, the Serbian Ministry of Information appealed to
future mothers and medical workers ``not to interrupt lives that
have begun.'' The government warned darkly that belief in such
rumors ``represents a form of special genocidal war that affects
the basic biological substratum of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The declining birthrate in Serbia has apparently been perceived
by at least one of the country's leading nationalist politicians as
anti-Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   Vojislav Seselj, the hard-line leader of the Serbian Radical
Party and a deputy prime minister in the Yugoslav government, early
this year floated the idea of imposing a special tax on young
couples who did not have children. The idea died for lack of
support.
</P>
<P>
   Obstetricians in Belgrade say that with each passing year this
decade, more and more women of childbearing age seem frightened by
the idea of raising children in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sense that women feel insecure in every sense of the word,''
said Dr. Darko Plecas, head of the Institute for Obstetrics and
Gynecology at the Clinical Center of Serbia. ``Graduating from the
best universities in this country no longer solves the problem of
finding a job or being able to afford an apartment. It is also more
difficult to find a husband, because many young men have left the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   According to various estimates, between 100,000 and 300,000
young men have fled Serbia to avoid the draft in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   When women do get pregnant, they are under more stress than 20
years ago, Plecas added. ``It used to be that I was just an
obstetrician; now I am a part-time psychologist.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Belgrade obstetrician who did not want to quoted
by name, young Serbian women never go to a doctor and say: ``I want
an abortion because of Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is the context,'' the doctor said. ``They are afraid
of what will happen to their children. They fear what family life
will be like. They fear how good the schools will be. They are
already certain that they will not be able to give their children
what their parents gave them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this culture,'' he added, ``if you cannot pamper your
children, it is better not to have them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is fear of falling living standards _ plus fear of
radiation-caused birth defects _ that brought Sladzana Misic, 32, a
mother of two sons, to the Clinical Center of Serbia last Friday
for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband own a bakery that she said clears a profit
of about $210 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the right time to have a baby,'' said Mrs. Misic.
``My husband and I don't have money for milk, diapers or clothes
for another baby. Also, I am afraid of the rain. It is weird. I
think there is something wrong here now because of radiation from
the bombs and chemical weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Misic, who waited for her abortion while wearing a flannel
nightgown with tiny purple and yellow flowers, said she and her
husband are strong supporters of Milosevic. She said, too, that she
believes the Serbian leader did the ``right thing'' by going to war
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we did down there in Kosovo was justified,'' she
said. ``Milosevic is not the problem. The one to blame is the U.S.
government. There was a conspiracy that we cannot know. Kosovo was
a part of an American plan for power and money.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her deep belief in the rectitude of Milosevic's
government, Mrs. Misic said she was having an abortion because she
and her husband want to get out of the country and find better
paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go anywhere,'' said Mrs. Misic. ``It is easy to
travel with my kids now. They are 7 and 10. And I could not take
the nine months of pregnancy in this country because of the
stress.''

DAVENPORT DETHRONES GRAF IN WIMBLEDON FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Determined to make peace with Wimbledon's
grass courts, which had never before been kind to her, Lindsay
Davenport conducted her own cram course last month in the privacy
of a friend's backyard court in Tustin, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   She learned how to turn a lawn into a launching pad for her
boisterous groundstrokes and penetrating serve, trained her
sneakers to trust the terrain beneath them, and built up the kind
of comfort zone she needed to cope with grass court wizards like
the one she faced in Sunday's finale, seven-time champion Steffi
Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Though Davenport killed the neighbor's court, her conversion
from a grass court hater to a grass court enthusiast achieved its
ultimate confirmation Sunday afternoon when, after a searing ace
took her to match point, she defeated Graf, 6-4, 7-5 to win the
most coveted tennis title in the world.
</P>
<P>
   With a shriek of surprise and an apologetic hug for the
retirement-bound legend across the net, Davenport, who regained the
world's No. 1 ranking by reaching Sunday's final, added the 1999
Wimbledon crown to her resume. Davenport said her first reaction,
besides amazement, to accepting her silver salver and a check for
$614,213 ($110,000 less than her fellow Californian Pete Sampras
pocketed for his record sixth title) was relief that she would
never again have to worry about the likes of John McEnroe accusing
her of being a one-Slam wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my second Slam and my third major, because I include the
Olympics,'' said Davenport, who won a gold medal at the 1996 Games
and won her favorite Slam, the U.S. Open, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win two Slams on two different surfaces means I'm a pretty
good all-around player, and to come in here with 15-1 odds and kind
of defy the experts, it just feels incredible,'' Davenport said.
``It's such a tough tournament to win with the rain delays, with
the surface and everything, to pull through and to be such a
fighter as this, I'll never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1 hour, 16 minute match was unforgettable too for the
bombshell Graf dropped shortly after she left Center Court without
waving goodbye. Just as she had done in Paris last month after
winning the French Open _ her 22nd Slam championship _ Graf
announced that she was retiring from Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of having to treat every Slam as a two-week torture test
in pain management _ she wore a bandage on her left thigh Sunday
and has been bothered all year by back pain _ but reluctant to make
her intentions public for fear of seeing her title quest undermined
by sentiment, Graf waited until she and Davenport were off the
court, and out of earshot of royalty, before disclosing that her
14th Wimbledon would be her last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm a little sad about everything, which is normal
for the moment, but in a way I still feel like a winner getting out
of this tournament,'' said Graf, a winner in seven of the eight
Wimbledon finals she had played before. Not since 1987, when she
fell to the nine-time champion Martina Navratilova, had Graf
faltered upon reaching a final here, and when the Duchess of Kent
approached her Sunday with the runner-up trophy, she told Graf she
felt as if there was some mistake being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish I could have shown more and maybe gotten into the
third set or something,'' said Graf, who managed only two break
chances on Davenport's serve and missed on both of them.
</P>
<P>
   But Davenport laced into her shots with the precision of a
diamond cutter and handled Graf's low backhand slice as if this
were a calisthenics competition. The lower the ball slithered, the
more deep knee bends Davenport performed.
</P>
<P>
   Authoritative on Center Court, the showplace where the
30-year-old Graf was hoping to secure her eighth and last Wimbledon
crown in her 31st Slam final, Davenport put the German on the
defensive right from the first game of the match by breaking her
serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think obviously if you get broken right in the first game,
it gives the opponent a good feeling going into this match,'' said
Graf. ``She served more consistently than I did. She had me always
guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport called Graf, who refused to reveal whether she would
play in the 1999 U.S. Open, ``probably the greatest player that's
ever played, but at the same time I think it's really cool that
she's been able to go out on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's choosing when she wants to go out, and I think that's
how we'd all like to end our career,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been unbelievable times, and it's been a lot of
fun,'' Graf said, but adding ``there's got to be a certain time
when I've got to move on with something else in my life. I won't be
here as a player again.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport went about the business of claiming her first
Wimbledon title the same way she had made her Grand Slam
breakthrough last year at the U.S. Open. She erased her beginner's
jitters and won the title on her first-ever trip to its final
round.
</P>
<P>
   After Graf snubbed Davenport's first set point of the opening
set with a blistering forehand return, Davenport converted her
second one and claimed the set 6-4 with a backhand rally as Graf's
final shot, a backhand slice, landed in the net.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport didn't let the rain delay at 4-5 of the second set
interfere with her plan to attend Sunday night's Champion's Ball
(an event for which she hadn't yet bought a dress). After holding
for 5-5, she broke Graf with a pair of corner-to-corner
crosscourts, the set-up shot a forehand and the break-getter a
backhand to grant herself the single opportunity needed to serve
out the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got up serving for the match, I believed, no matter
what, I could do this,'' said Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay Davenport and Corina Morariu won the ladies' doubles,
defeating Mariann de Swardt and Elena Tatarkova, 6-4, 6-4.

   NEW YORK _ If all it took to become a citizen was knowing what
caused the Revolutionary War, Grigoriy Brekhman would be in luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxes were very high and the Colonies hated England about
the taxes because they had no rights,'' explained Brekhman, a
65-year-old immigrant from Ukraine, when the teacher in his
citizenship class posed the question last week.
</P>
<P>
   Correct, the teacher said, but not the best response.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the interview, they are looking for short answers,'' she
advised her elderly Russian-speaking students at Bronx House, a
Jewish community center. ``If you said, `high taxes,' that would be
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Brekhman is part of one of the biggest naturalization waves in
the country's history. He is one of 1.8 million applicants for
citizenship _ the biggest group ever _ who now are waiting
anxiously to be tested on their knowledge of English, civics and
history.
</P>
<P>
   The test is at the core of one of the weightier decisions any
nation can make: Who should be a citizen?
</P>
<P>
   But for this important judgment, critics say, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service relies on a process that is not uniform
in content, administration or grading.
</P>
<P>
   Even eager candidates like Brekhman, in the final analysis, are
judged less on their understanding of citizenship and American
values than on their ability to memorize a list of names, dates and
facts, some relevant and some unrelated to issues of citizenship,
like the names of their senators, the name of the Pilgrims' ship,
the author of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and the colors of the
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Although immigration officials supposedly work from the same set
of 100 suggested history and civics questions, the agency has found
that failure rates vary widely from one part of the country to
another. The agency's critics say that is because the selection of
questions, and the way the questions are framed and the answers
assessed, depend on the mood, style or locale of the official who
does the interview.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration service, driven in part by the unwieldy backlog
of applications that has overwhelmed the naturalization process in
the last three years, has now started looking at ways to make the
citizenship test more uniform and less burdensome to administer.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, in re-examining the mechanics of naturalization, a
debate has arisen on the more fundamental issues of what U.S.
citizenship means and what the country should require a new citizen
to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of making the naturalization process
harder or easier,'' said Noah Pickus, assistant professor of public
policy and political science at Duke University and one of the
experts consulted by the INS. ``But can we make it more a
meaningful, coherent lever for accomplishing the kinds of
aspirations we have, not only for immigrants, but also for
native-born citizens?''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration agency officials said that over the next few months
they would decide what subjects to include in a revised civics and
history test and how much applicants should know to pass the
language and civics tests. They hope to solicit bids on a
test-development contract in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've wanted to open up the issue on all fronts,'' said Doris
Meissner, commissioner of the INS. ``And it's implicit in our
asking the question that we wanted the test looked at, both the way
we use it and what we want the test to be.''
</P>
<P>
   An applicant for citizenship now is tested for English
proficiency and knowledge of the government during an interview
with an immigration adjudicator that can range from 15 to 40
minutes. The process includes a verbal exam in English on some
history and civics topics and questioning about the personal data
on the application form. In most cases, the adjudicator also reads
a few sentences in English and has the applicant write them from
the dictation. The content and conduct of the interview is left
entirely up to the adjudicator.
</P>
<P>
   A new test will be part of a broader agency effort to streamline
and standardize naturalization procedures, Ms. Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a testing process where there's as much
consistency as possible throughout the agency,'' she said, ``and as
much preparation by the applicants as possible, so they have the
strongest chance of passing it if they prepare.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, topics like immigration and citizenship tend to set
political bells ringing, so the discussion of revising the tests
may end as little more than an empty exercise. Ms. Meissner's
agency, buffeted both by advocates for immigrants and by
conservatives seeking to restrict immigration, is treading
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the agency hired the consulting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers to poll a broad range of people, including
experts in linguistics and civics and congressional aides, on the
same questions of revising the naturalization process.
</P>
<P>
   Its report, which reviewed existing history, civics and English
language standards but made no specific recommendations, was
completed at the end of 1998. It has not been distributed outside
the agency, in part to forestall a possible conservative backlash
against tinkering with the process at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, you can ask the same questions today you asked 50
or 100 years ago, because the idea of America is the same as it was
50 or 100 years ago,'' said Stephen Moore, an immigration analyst
at the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group in Washington.
``So I worry about either dumbing it down or updating it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are academics and some
immigrant advocates who support doing away with as many obstacles
to citizenship as possible, although that would require changing
the 47-year-old Immigration and Nationality Act.
</P>
<P>
   Pickus, one of the civics experts contacted by the agency's
consultants, contends that more can be accomplished by making
naturalization what he calls a transformative experience. Starting
a national program of citizenship classes, he said, could help
enlighten prospective citizens about their rights and create a
sense of identification with their new country and its principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can play a kind of catalytic role,'' he said. ``Imagine a
situation where you had civic education courses that talked not
just about the separation of powers, but what to do if your
landlord sues you.''
</P>
<P>
   The test itself would still be a test. But a reform of
naturalization should look at more than the test questions alone,
he said. ``The question is, what should the naturalization process
consist of?'' he said. ``How do we prepare people for
citizenship?''
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the last century, the Progressives'
Americanization movement had a similar idealistic mission of
creating new citizens, rather than simply testing them, and
organized citizenship classes in settlement houses and other
private institutions that taught civics and history in immigrants'
native languages.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the excesses of that movement, many historians
now say it evolved into something xenophobic, nativist and
coercive. The industrialist Henry Ford, for instance, required his
foreign-born employees to attend classes, and the first thing they
had to learn was to say, ``I am a good American.''
</P>
<P>
   After the United States entered World War I, the emphasis of the
movement shifted even more, to compelling immigrants to make
patriotic oaths. But by the end of World War II, the Progressives'
crusade had largely faded.
</P>
<P>
   The objective legal criteria for citizenship have not changed
much over the years, except that race and ethnicity restrictions
have been replaced by national quotas. To qualify, an applicant
must have lived in the country as a permanent resident _ the
requirement now is at least five years _ and have no criminal
record or affiliation with any organization that advocates the
violent overthrow of the government.
</P>
<P>
   But the more subjective components of naturalization have
metamorphosed several times. In the first century after
independence, the naturalization process emphasized a loyalty test
in which new citizens had to demonstrate their ``allegiance to the
Constitution'' and, later, ``their attachment to the principles of
the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the world wars, applicants had to show they were
literate by reading at least 40 words in any language, not
necessarily English. For a time, it was enough for applicants to
bring two citizen witnesses to attest to their character, attitude
toward the government and qualifications for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, the law was changed to require applicants to
demonstrate ``knowledge and understanding of the fundamentals of
the history, and the principles and form of government, of the
United States.'' Twelve years later, a section was added requiring
naturalization candidates to show they could read and write
``simple words and phrases'' in English.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a variety of different tests in use, but since
1986, the immigration service has relied on a set of 100 possible
history and civics questions as the guidelines for those who give
citizenship interviews. That test, now given verbally, serves as a
kind of English language test, but language proficiency is
generally tested by also having an applicant listen to a dictated
sentence or passage and write it down.
</P>
<P>
   The test questions cover basics like the structure of the
federal government, the cause of the Civil War, the content of the
Bill of Rights and the name of the building where the president
lives. Other possible queries include the name of the applicant's
state governor, the number of stripes on the flag and the name of
the first president.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for immigrants, who worry that a revised test might
prove to be a barrier to citizenship, said the test is useful if it
causes immigrants to make an effort to understand the meaning
behind the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would argue that this is the best test that's ever been
devised, but it's not bad,'' said Gary Rubin, director of public
policy at the New York Association for New Americans, one of a
handful of groups in New York City that help immigrants prepare for
the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that immigrants who study for the test know how
the government works,'' he added. ``They know why there are three
branches of government. They know who can declare war.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions touch on many of the topics that are recommended
by history and civics educators who developed standards for public
school students.
</P>
<P>
   But in the view of some experts contacted by the immigration
agency consultants, the questions do not constitute a test of
relevant or meaningful knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't test for understanding,'' said Brenda Bell, an
associate director of the Center for Literacy Studies at the
University of Tennessee. ``There is nothing about the questions
that hangs together and lets you know the person understands what
it means to be a citizen in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Good citizenship skills, she added, include knowing how to
participate in local politics and understanding civic rights and
responsibilities. The problem is devising a standard test to assess
that. ``It's not an easy issue we're talking about here,'' Ms. Bell
said.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the immigration agency's effort to revamp
naturalization testing, it will have to decide whether to continue
administering the tests itself. Many immigrant advocates have
contended that it should not.
</P>
<P>
   ``All INS officers have enforcement training,'' said Aliza
Becker, an author and independent consultant on immigration issues
in Chicago. ``This causes many of them to approach the interview
with an eye to finding any reason a person can not be naturalized.
This is not a problem for the educated, but there are people, like
many refugees, who are terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessing proficiency in what is called ``ordinary English'' can
be the most arbitrary part of the interview. For about one-third of
those who fail the citizenship test, the language portion is the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ```Ordinary,' in my view, is ordinary life, and what do most
people do in their lives?'' Ms. Becker said. ``They speak. They
don't read and write a lot. Of course, I would love to see enough
English-training resources made available so that immigrants could
learn enough to fully participate in all aspects of civic life. But
I don't think it's a fair standard to become a citizen. We don't
hold that standard to our own citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten in much of the testing debate, however, is the
evidence that most newcomers quickly integrate into mainstream
American life, even if they do not start out as experts in English
or civics.
</P>
<P>
   A study published last week by the Immigration Forum, an
advocacy group in Washington, said that more than three-quarters of
immigrants spoke English fluently 10 years after arriving in this
country and that after 20 years, nearly 70 percent sink down roots
in a community by buying their own homes. The study relied on 1990
Census data.
</P>
<P>
   ``One does expect them to learn English and they do,'' said
Nathan Glazer, professor emeritus of education and sociology at
Harvard. ``One does expect them to participate in politics and they
do. So one could probably make a case in terms of social trends,
that the citizenship test hardly matters.''
</P>
<P>
   But the naturalization exam has a value beyond its content, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has another virtue _ the virtue of solemnification,
of rebirth that comes with the change of status,'' Glazer said. ``I
think that we have little enough in our lives which mark
transitions in a significant way, and I think the requirements make
it significant.''

IF DODGERS DON'T COME BACK, HAVE A COMEBACK READY

<P>
   As hecklers, Los Angeles baseball fans are pathetic. And,
probably just as sad, a little apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's our stereotyped laid-back nature or just a fear of
speaking in public, one obvious thing we lack is the ability to
shout out clever, cunning phrases at appropriate moments. We can
boo, as we did during the weekend series against the Giants, but
where does that get ya?
</P>
<P>
   At the Baseball Heckle Depot
(http://web.ionsys.com/(tilda)tolley/index.html), there's hope that
the art of yelling the appropriate phrases at the appropriate umps,
players or fans can be learned.
</P>
<P>
   Start at ``Heckling 101,'' which discusses etiquette (such as
don't make it personal, watch your language, etc.), then clock onto
several lists that have things to yell during your next outdoor
viewing. Some samples:
</P>
<P>
   At an umpire: ``Wake up, you're missing a great game.'' (A
classic, of course, but one that gets the crowd started.)
</P>
<P>
   At a batter: ``You're not in a slump, you're just not hitting.''
Or: ``Them curveballs sure is curvy, eh?'' Or after he hits it:
``Run, Forrest, run!''
</P>
<P>
   At a relief pitcher: ``I don't know what ERA means, but you've
got 7. . . . That's gotta be good, right?''
</P>
<P>
   At a Giants fan? Don't know. The site doesn't get that detailed.
It also has a place you can heckle the Web master _ try ``you
byte!'' _ and submit your favorite heckling stories.
</P>
<P>
   __ CNNSI.com has started a new area called ``Statutudes''
(www.cnnsi.com/statitudes) that attempts to make sense of all the
numbers that an average sports fan is asked to consume on a daily
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Stats are put into context with features such as ``On the
Money,'' which shows who's worth his salary and who isn't, plus
tracking streaks and record pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   __ At the updated U.S. Olympic Committee site
(www.olympic-usa.org), you can download the 928K tax-exempt
disclosures that the organization has filed over the last three
years. Just don't expect to find anything easy to read on
dirty-scanned documents.
</P>
<P>
   __ The hot-hot calendar these days that features 12 women's
track and field athletes in various stages of clothing is available
on a Web site (www.trackgirls.com) for $21.95. It's not endorsed by

SYRIAN LEADER TO MEET WITH YELTSIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT _ A surprise trip to Russia by the Syrian president,
Hafez al-Assad, is looming as the first step in an expected flurry
of Middle East diplomacy as Arab and Israeli leaders jockey for
position in a peace effort that, for the first time in three years,
is suddenly showing signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   Assad, whose country is armed largely with aging Soviet weapons,
had not visited Moscow since the collapse of the Soviet Union. He
abruptly canceled a scheduled trip to Moscow in April, when
Benjamin Netanyahu was still Israel's prime minister and prospects
for a broader regional peace still looked grim.
</P>
<P>
   But the regional picture has changed sharply since the election
in May of Ehud Barak as Israel's prime minister-elect. In recent
days, there have been exchanges of signals from all sides of
genuine interest in rekindling the quest for a broader peace.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on just three days' notice, Assad is scheduled to arrive in
Moscow on Monday, in what appears to be a clear bid to enlist
Syria's old patron once again on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In a scheduled meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, Assad will
certainly seek support for its longtime demand for the full return
of the Golan Heights, the territory seized by Israel in the 1967
war. And Western diplomats say Assad will also seek Yeltsin's
agreement to sell his country as much as $2 billion in arms, as he
seeks to enter any peace talks from a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Syria, long cash-strapped, still owes Moscow $12 billion to
repay aid provided for more than 20 years, and that has been an
obstacle to further arms sales in the past. But in recent months,
the diplomats said Sunday, there have been indications that Russia
may be willing, at least for now, to set aside the unresolved debt,
in the hope that renewing close ties with Syria may help Moscow to
restore at least influence in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is perfect for Assad,'' a Western diplomat who is
based in Damascus said Sunday. ``If Russia agrees to supply Syria
with weapons, it will enhance Syria's position in negotiations with
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip by Assad, who will turn 70 this year and rarely travels
outside his country, is expected to kick off a travel blitz by key
regional leaders. Barak is expected to travel to Washington in the
next few weeks to meet with President Clinton, and he is also
expected to meet soon with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   And Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, whose country made its
peace with Israel two decades ago, has pledged to resume an
intermediary's role by meeting soon with Barak, Assad and Arafat.
On Saturday, during a stop in France after a trip to the United
States in which he met with Clinton, Mubarak said he was ``very
optimistic for the future.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I am sure that the two main issues, that of the Palestinians
and of Syria and Lebanon, will be treated with equal priority,'' he
said after a lunch with President Jacques Chirac of France at
Elysee Palace.
</P>
<P>
   One indication that all sides may be trying to smooth the way to
serious talks has been their tame response to Israel's air attack
10 days ago on sites in Lebanon, which killed nine people and
wounded more than two dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   Barak distanced himself from the strike, which was launched by
Netanyahu's outgoing government in reply to cross-border missile
attacks by Hezbollah guerrillas. And Syria, the main power broker
in Lebanon and a key Hezbollah sponsor, has shown a willingness to
set the matter aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone is looking seriously now to the prospect of
real negotiations,'' a Western diplomat said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the Arab anxiousness, Syrian and Lebanese
officials have said in recent interviews, is a real concern that
Vice President Al Gore's election bid may by year's end leave the
Clinton administration shy about weighing in seriously on matters
of Middle East peace, given domestic U.S. sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Kremlin, in an announcement on Friday, said
Assad was traveling to Russia at Yeltsin's official invitation _ a
possible sign, Western diplomats say, that the unresolved dispute
over Russia's peacekeeping role in Kosovo has left Yeltsin eager to
find other ways to assert his country's role as a power broker.
</P>
<P>
   Any major arms purchase by Syria now, at a potentially crucial
time in the peace effort, would certainly attract criticism from
Israel. But Syria's military strength has withered badly in recent
years, and Damascus could make the case that it would remain far
from parity with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   According to Western diplomats, the centerpiece of the $2
billion arms deal under discussion by Syrian and Russian officials
is an upgraded version of Russia's MiG-29 fighter aircraft, which
has been in production only since December.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions have focused on anti-tank systems, a high
priority to Syria but a subject that has prompted warnings from
Washington that aid to Russia may be canceled if the sale of those
weapons goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Syria is regarded by Washington as a key element in the Middle
East process, but it also remains on a State Department list of
nations that sponsor or support terrorism. U.S. law requires the
withholding of aid to nations that transfer lethal military
equipment to any country that appears on that list.

IN DEFEAT OF AGASSI, SAMPRAS MAKES HISTORY TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Pete Sampras waved his racket like Merlin's
wand and, in one brash swoop, made Andre Agassi disappear, and made
history twice over, in an all-American finale Sunday on Center
Court at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Agassi's prediction that this revival of a
long-dormant rivalry between the top two talents of this generation
had the makings of a marathon, all the holiday fireworks belonged
to Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours after another Californian, Lindsay
Davenport, won her first Wimbledon title and closed out the
Wimbledon career of the seven-time champion Steffi Graf, Sampras
completed an American sweep by humbling Agassi, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the two-time defending champion, passed Bjorn Borg, who
won five Wimbledon titles, to become the only man in this century
to accumulate six Wimbledon championships. And Sunday's bravura
outing earned Sampras his 12th Grand Slam singles crown, matching
the Australian Roy Emerson's record.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the 27-year-old classicist whose game on grass has
evolved to a level that admits no peers, dominated on a gray
afternoon when the men's and women's finals shared the sport's most
storied court for the first time since weather forced a similar
pile-up in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection was Sampras' goal and, according to the top-ranked
Agassi, he attained it. Ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked on water today,'' said the 29-year-old Agassi, the
1992 Wimbledon winner who was coming off a rejuvenating victory at
last month's French Open, where he completed his Grand Slam
collection, becoming the fifth man in history to have won all four
events.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had also hoped to become the first man since Borg in 1980
to collect the Roland Garros and Wimbledon titles in the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it was Sampras _ packing the same eviscerating punch as
a human buzz saw, as Agassi saw it _ who did the record-breaking.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to four titles at the U.S. Open, where he made his
Grand Slam breakthrough in 1990 at age 19 to become its youngest
champion, and two more at the Australian Open, in 1994 and 1997,
Sampras has now compiled a perfect 6 for 6 record in finals at
Wimbledon, the Grand Slam he was groomed to win by his first coach,
Pete Fischer. He has won his six Wimbledon titles in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel like I was born to win here, I really do, and
today was one of those days'' said Sampras, now 46-1 at Wimbledon
in the last seven years. ``In the middle of the second set, I was
on fire, you know, from all aspects of my game. From serving to my
ground strokes I was playing in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as well as I could play, plain and simple,'' said
Sampras, who has turned the art of winning Wimbledon into a simple
science. ``It's all about my second serve and my return. That's it,
that's grass court tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras _ now ranked third despite his successful title defense
_ broke Agassi's serve three times and tormented him with powerful
second serves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time it was 30-30, if he didn't hit an ace on the first
serve, he was hitting his second serve 109, 111, sometimes 119,
122,'' Agassi said. ``I think he hit one second serve the whole
match that was only 100 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who switched to a one-handed backhand at Fischer's
behest, the better to create a bolder, modern-day version of his
stylistic role model, Rod Laver, continued to stake his claim to
being remembered as the greatest player to grace the game in this
or any generation. The French Open is the only missing link in his
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still spinning a little bit,'' said Sampras, who had not
known what to expect when he took to Center Court against the
player he had described as the hottest on the men's circuit. ``I
don't know how I do it, I really don't, to be honest with you.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the place to do it. I mean, against Andre on the
Fourth of July was different than playing anyone else I've played
through my career. Andre brings out the best in me; there's no
question that he elevates my game to a level that's phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The game that stood out as a turning point in the minds of both
players was the seventh game of the opening set. Sampras was
serving at 3-3 and, after falling into a 0-40 chasm, seemed in
danger of handing the getaway keys to Agassi, one of the most
feared front-runners in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras responded by pounding out a succession of service
``bombs,'' said Agassi, that not only saved the game but rattled
the Las Vegan's focus so badly that he immediately surrendered his
next service game to trail by 3-5. Agassi's double fault gave
Sampras the break point he needed to put himself in position to
serve out the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well aware of the fact that one or two huge efforts with
a few big shots can turn a whole match around,'' Agassi said. ``He
knows he can make some great things happen in the matter of a
minute and a half. He can turn an entire match around.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras turned the opening set around right there, served it out
and immediately hobbled Agassi in the first game of the second set
by breaking him there. A 129-mph service winner gave Sampras a two
sets to none lead, and even though Agassi began to send returns
across the net like comets in the third set, Sampras refused to
lose his serve.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Agassi, after saving two break points at 15-40 in the
seventh game but getting into the same trouble in the 11th game,
plopped a backhand into the net to trail by 5-6 and enable Sampras
to serve for the title. An ace took Sampras to match point. He
completed his mission with his 17th and final ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all instinct at that point,'' Sampras said. ``I went for
it, went up the middle, and the next thing I knew I was holding the
cup.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Mahesh Bhupathi and Leander Paes of India added the Wimbledon
title to their French Open crown, confirming themselves as the
world's No. 1 men's doubles team. The top-seeded pair defeated No.
8 Paul Haarhuis and Jared Palmer, 6-7 (12-10), 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4).
Paes also teamed with the American Lisa Raymond to win the mixed
doubles, downing Jonas Bjorkman and Anna Kournikova, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3.

TRADER WHO BROKE BARINGS BANK IS OUT OF ASIAN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Nicholas Leeson set foot on British soil Sunday for the
first time since his wild trades on Asian futures markets in 1995
ran up debts of $1.4 billion, which brought down Britain's oldest
merchant bank and landed him in a Singapore jail.
</P>
<P>
   He is sorry for what he did at Barings Bank but he wants to
start over and rebuild his ruined life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leeson, 32, was released Saturday from Tanah Merah prison in
Singapore and flew home overnight after serving just over half of a
6 1/2-year sentence for fraud and forgery as well as months of jail
time awaiting trial and sentencing. He is a free man physically,
released early for good behavior, but remains shackled financially
by a court order freezing his assets and restricting his access to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to state clearly here that I know I did wrong,'' he
said, reading a statement at a hotel near Heathrow Airport. ``I am
not proud of my activities as a trader with Barings Bank in
Singapore. I was foolish and very much regret what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have done my time. I have taken my punishment, and now I
want to get on with the job of rebuilding my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in an open-necked shirt and chino slacks, a smile
flickering across his pale features, he did not take questions and
left the news conference immediately after reading his 25-line
statement. It was not clear where he would spend his first days
back in Britain, the country he was trying to reach when he fled
Asia in February 1995. He was seized by police while in transit in
Frankfurt, Germany, and sent back to Singapore for trial.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Stephen Pollard, said a court order obtained Friday
by Barings' liquidators allowed Leeson access to $7,900 a month of
his money. From that, he has to pay living costs, legal fees and
any medical bills for his treatment for colon cancer, which was
diagnosed last fall. The Singapore health authorities treated the
illness with surgery and chemotherapy. But, his lawyer said, Leeson
has been told there is a 30 percent chance that the cancer will
recur within four years.
</P>
<P>
   The former trader, who once lived a life of high-voltage risks
and high-ticket rewards on the Asian futures markets, returned to
England to face an array of questions from Barings' creditors about
his financial gains from a 1996 memoir, ``Rogue Trader,'' which has
been made into a recently released movie starring Ewan McGregor.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, a British newspaper has offered $160,000 for his
story. Many creditors do not want to see him profit from any of
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has now paid his dues, and perhaps that should be it,''
said Jill Frankel, a retired schoolteacher who, along with her
husband, lost $320,000 when the bank collapsed. But, she said in a
radio interview, ``I wouldn't like him to profit from his crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Simon Forster, the spokesman for Barings Preference
Shareholders Action Group, people had invested ``part or a very
substantial amount of their life savings in what was reputedly an
organization as safe as the Bank of England,'' adding, ``They feel
very let down indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The court order bars Leeson from selling his story to news
organizations or from cashing in his profits from his memoir or the
movie. Pollard, the lawyer, dismissed suggestions that Leeson had
stashed away secret funds from his trading days or had returned
from Singapore with considerable assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has nothing left of any substance,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The court order requires Leeson to give Barings' liquidators two
days' notice before drawing on his funds. He must state where the
money originated and how he plans to spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Money is not the only problem he faces. After his imprisonment,
Leeson's wife, Lisa, divorced him and married another financial
trader. And Leeson's father has also had a diagnosis of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can perhaps imagine, this is a very emotional day for
me,'' he said Sunday. ``I've been in prison in a foreign land for
four years and four months. Just to be home and see my family again
is something I have longed for all that time.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not directly mention his former wife but said: ``When I
entered prison for the first time, one of the first things that was
said to me was, `Now you will find out who your friends are.'
Nothing could be more true. I have found out who my friends are,
and I would like to thank them all for their support.''
</P>
<P>
   Leeson ran up losses in arbitrage trades in futures contracts on
the Singapore and Japanese stock markets. His employers sent
millions from London to Singapore to cover his positions,
apparently without realizing that he was desperately trying to bid
up a falling market and losing more by the day as the Japanese
market spiraled down after the Kobe earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   But of all those involved in the bank's collapse and its
subsequent sale for one pound sterling to the Dutch group ING Groep
NV, Leeson was the only one to serve time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard said Sunday that ``to his credit, from day one, Nick has
said he was the only person who was involved in criminal action''
relating to the bank's collapse. Nonetheless, the lawyer said,
Leeson felt he was the only Barings employee who has ``really paid
a serious price.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said his client had not yet made long-term plans.
``The shock of coming out of prison after four and a half years and
the knowledge of a 30 percent chance that he may be dead in four
years are not really conducive to long-term planning,'' he said.

PAST IS PROLOGUE FOR TOUR'S ARMSTRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SAMUEL ABT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHALLANS, France _ Two days into the 86th Tour de France, the
jury is still out on whether the race has kept its popularity with
a public weary of doping scandals. But there was no doubt Sunday
that Lance Armstrong's victory in the opening prologue on Saturday,
after his battle with cancer, was exactly the symbol the race
organizers had wished for.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was happy with Saturday's result, Jean-Marie
Leblanc, the Tour's director, flashed a smile rarely seen in the
last year of turmoil and said: ``Yes _ for me, for the Tour and for
Lance above all. This is the Tour of renewal, of a return to the
top level, and look at him: He incarnates that.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, the 27-year-old Texan who returned to full-time
competition a little more than a year ago, looked splendidly happy
in the yellow jersey of the race's leader Sunday morning before the
start of the first of the Tour's 20 daily stages.
</P>
<P>
   But officials of his U.S. Postal Service team emphasized that it
would not go all out to keep his jersey in the week of sprinting to
come, which began with a 129-mile stage from Montaigu to the
poultry center of Challans in western France.
</P>
<P>
   ``There've been years when we would have killed to defend that
jersey,'' said Dan Osipow, the team's director of operations. ``But
not now. It's not worth our energy. We'll need that in the Alps.''
Saying that Armstrong will not risk injury in contesting mass
sprints, Osipow added, ``If we lose the jersey in the next week, we
aim to get it back in the mountains and keep it then.''
</P>
<P>
   After an early scare, Armstrong did keep the jersey for at least
another day, maintaining his lead over Alex Zuelle. The stage,
which was watched by big crowds during hours of rain, was won by
Jaan Kirsipuu, an Estonian with the Casino team.
</P>
<P>
   Thierry Gouvenou, a French rider for the Big Mat-Auber team,
launched a one-man attack at the 48th mile and built a lead that
nearly reached seven minutes, far more than enough to overcome his
54-second deficit after the prologue.
</P>
<P>
   Gouvenou, a journeyman rider from Normandy, is accustomed to
rain. What he is not accustomed to is maintaining a long lead over
179 pursuers. After more than 60 miles of solitary effort, he was
caught. Then it was the turn of another amphibian, the Belgian Ludo
Dierckxsens, who rides for Lampre, to test his luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few miles, however, the sprinters' teams brought
everybody together and the victory went to Kirsipuu, who finished
half a wheel ahead of Tom Steels, a Belgian with Mapei, and Erik
Zabel, a German with Telekom. Kirsipuu was timed in 4 hours 56
minutes 18 seconds, a speed of 26 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The pack, including Armstrong, finished in the same time. He
continued in the lead by 7 seconds over Zuelle, a Swiss with
Banesto, and by 11 seconds over Abraham Olano, a Spaniard with
ONCE. They finished in that order in the prologue.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kirsipuu, who was 40 seconds behind in the prologue, used his
20-second victory bonus and a smaller one en route to move up to
sixth place, 16 seconds back.
</P>
<P>
   The huge numbers of spectators along the roads testified to the
continuing, if fragile, place of the Tour in the national psyche,
even though the crowd at the prologue on Saturday had seemed
smaller than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In the starting town of Montaigu, an informal poll of a dozen
people selected at random seemed to indicate that the public was
willing to give bicycle racing another chance despite the series of
doping scandals that began in the last Tour and have not yet ended.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anybody who rejected the race would not have been
found standing in the rain to see it go by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a great race and worth watching, even if I don't
entirely trust the riders,'' a middle-age man under an umbrella
said. Hiding in a bus shelter against the squall, a young woman
said: ``One more scandal and it's all over. Till then, I remain a
fan.''

TENSION EASES BETWEEN OKINAWANS AND U.S. ARMY BASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KADENA AIR BASE, Japan _ As Americans celebrated Independence
Day, Natsuko Miyagi and Yukihiro Nakanishi ventured behind enemy
lines to get a closer look at what they say imperils their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   For as long as they can remember, Ms. Miyagi and Nakanishi have
despised the vast U.S. military bases that make living in this
sparkling, subtropical island in Okinawa prefecture less inviting
than it could be.
</P>
<P>
   Like many residents of cities surrounding the military bases,
which take up one-fifth of island land, the couple wants them
removed. Okinawans have long complained that noise and vibrations
from military aircraft, combat and ammunitions exercises, and rude
and drunken soldiers threaten not only their pastoral way of life
but also their safety.
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, the couple attended what has become Kadena's
annual ``America Fest,'' a three-day carnival in which the air
base, one of the largest in the world, and military aircraft are
opened for local residents to peruse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous coming here because as a youngster I
was taught these bases were places of great tyranny,'' Nakanishi, a
computer programmer, said. ``But just being allowed to come inside
these gates to see what goes on in here has made me feel better
about the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miyagi, his companion, who is a teacher, needed more
convincing. ``We now know what it's like to be an American,'' she
said. ``We ate a hot dog, listened to country music, and saw some
very big planes that are used to blow things up and kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miyagi's sarcasm notwithstanding, American military
officials here maintain that historically contentious relations
between Okinawans and the U.S. military have improved remarkably in
recent years, mainly because Washington and Tokyo have made efforts
to reduce the negative effects of the bases on local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of anti-base rhetoric being bandied about
for political purposes, and that is not likely to change,'' said
Lt. Col. Brian Hoey, the base's public affairs chief. ``But we
believe there has been a significant change in the way the military
views the community and how they view us.''
</P>
<P>
   Military officials estimated that 200,000 people turned out for
the base festival, which caused huge traffic delays across the
island. Nobu Okada, a college student who took pictures next to an
Apache helicopter, said that he found it curious that so many
Okinawans, who are adamantly opposed to the military bases, would
attend a base party.
</P>
<P>
   Several local political leaders and U.S. servicemen said they
too had noted an improvement in relations since 1995, when the
anti-base sentiment turned to rage after three American servicemen
were convicted of raping a 12-year-old girl. All are now serving
prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after the rape incident, you could feel the distrust in
the air,'' said Gordon Griffen, an Air Force crew chief. ``Local
folks seemed to be afraid of us, but I don't feel that any more. I
think we have shown them that we can be a productive part of their
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement announced by both governments three years
ago, military bases have taken steps to alter the times and
procedures of training and operations, including flight patterns,
to decrease the disturbance to neighboring residents.
</P>
<P>
   Military personnel have received sensitivity training in dealing
with the local community, officials said, and they have become more
involved in public service activities, including volunteering at
local orphanages and taking part in local sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors contributing to better relations, local
politicians said, were the election last year of a new prefecture
governor who has been less radical than his predecessor in
denouncing the bases, and a realization on the part of Okinawans
that they are heavily dependent on the bases for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, little headway has been made on the core of that
agreement _ the return of one-fifth of the land taken up by the
bases _ which is the principal demand of the Okinawans.
</P>
<P>
   Okinawans question the need for a foreign army to be stationed
in Japan, especially in the aftermath of the Cold War. They have
long held that they are being treated unfairly because 75 percent
of the U.S. military installations in Japan are based in their
prefecture.
</P>
<P>
   In the final stages of World War II, Okinawa prefecture, which
encompasses Japan's southernmost islands, was the scene of intense
fighting between U.S. and Japanese forces. After the war, the
island was put under U.S. control until it reverted to Japan in
1972. The islands, which have a population of 1.2 million people,
are home to about two-thirds of the 45,000 U.S. military personnel
in Japan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Apart from the fireworks, concerts, games and aircraft displays,
many Okinawans said that they came to the base festival as a way
displaying their sovereignty over the military installations, which
they say are off limits to them throughout the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my friends criticize me for coming and tell me that I
am being a pawn of the military,'' said Akira Matsumoto, who has
attended the event for the last 15 years. ``But this is Okinawan
land. And we have to express our right to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. James B. Smith, Kadena's base commander, said that
while he sympathized with Okinawan residents who suffered because
of the military presence in their community, the bases were crucial
to the United States' strategy in Asia to maintain a balance of
power.
</P>
<P>
   The general said the importance of the military bases had
increased in the last decade with the closure of bases in the
Philippines. He said the bases were especially vital to respond to
security threats from China, North Korea, or Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said that while his principal job in Okinawa was as a
soldier, he would be failing in that role if he did not address the
concerns of the community in which he operated his air base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days when the base commander had free rein and could do
whatever he wanted to do without concern for the local population
are long gone,'' as they should be, Smith said. ``We are learning
to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   But some anti-base political leaders in Okinawa said there was
no room for compromise and they vow to press ahead with their
efforts to remove all military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko Itokazu, an Okinawan prefecture assembly member, who is on
the planning committee to reduce military installations, said that
the presence of any military base or personnel puts Okinawans at
risk. ``These bases have machines and men whose sole purpose is to
kill,'' she said. ``You can try to make them more sensitive to the
community's needs, but that contrasts sharply with what they are
trained to do.''

ELECTION SEEN AS BOOST TO EFFORT TO GIVE KUWAITI WOMEN THE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT _ A landmark effort to extend voting rights to Kuwaiti
women won a boost here Sunday as the results of elections on
Saturday showed gains by liberal candidates who will form a
substantial bloc in the Persian Gulf's only elected Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In the 50-member Parliament, the liberal or liberal-leaning
deputies will hold 14 seats, up from four in the Parliament that
was dissolved in May. Most are expected to back an emiri decree
that would allow women to vote and hold office beginning in 2003.
Their support, along with that of pro-government candidates, is
likely to be enough to override Islamic opposition to the edict.
</P>
<P>
   But Kuwaiti analysts and Western diplomats said a victory for
women's rights was not yet guaranteed. The idea of political rights
for women is still controversial in Kuwait, and even liberals who
favor the idea may prefer to score points by standing up to the
royally appointed government.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Kuwait's ruling al-Sabah family has permitted a
level of political expression unknown elsewhere in the gulf,
creating a kind of safety valve for dissent. But its own centrist
supporters lost ground in the elections, and at least two-thirds of
the parliamentary seats will now be held by government critics,
either liberals or Islamists.
</P>
<P>
   In a hint of an olive branch, Deputy Prime Minister Sheik Sabah
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who is now seen as the country's day-to-day
leader, said in remarks published on the weekend that he hoped the
legislative and executive branches would be able to work ``in
harmony as we enter the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The government, still formally led by Sheik Saad al-Jaber
al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, resigned Sunday to
await reformation later this month. But Saad, who is not a popular
figure, was expected to retain his powerful post, and some Kuwaiti
analysts predicted new storms in the notoriously unsettled
political environment.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the emiri edict to provide political rights to women
is being closely watched by Western governments, which had long
urged the step, and by Kuwait's Persian Gulf neighbors, who have
watched Kuwait's experimentation with democracy with a mixture of
admiration and dread.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing Kuwaiti law, only men were permitted to vote in
Saturday's elections. The biggest gains were by candidates aligned
with the National Democratic Movement, a two-year-old group whose
calls for expanding political rights to more Kuwaitis and limiting
government power make it Kuwait's most outspoken liberal body.

   The pro-Islamists, from several political alignments, will
retain 20 seats, guaranteeing a firm platform for agendas that aim
to move Kuwait to the right, and that generally oppose the idea of
women voting or holding political office.
</P>
<P>
   Still, under Kuwaiti law, the government is guaranteed an edge
in the battle over the edict, which must be approved by the
Parliament. Cabinet ministers, appointed by the government, will be
allowed to vote, and if they can enlist the support of the new
liberal bloc, it will be difficult for opponents to muster the
votes necessary to block the decree.

OVERSHADOWED TEXAS SEXTUPLETS RECEIVE BELATED HELP 
</HEADLINE>

   HOUSTON _ For the parents of the world's first surviving
octuplets, born here in December, the birth was followed by a
wealth of gifts, including a 5,300-square-foot home, a tractor
trailer loaded with baby furniture, and all the diapers they
needed.
</P>
<P>
   But as the octuplets of Nkem Chukwu and Iyke Louis Udobi
captured the public's imagination and donations, another couple in
the Houston area were struggling to figure out how they would
provide for their less publicized accomplishment: the birth of the
first sextuplets in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ann Collins gave birth to the first of the six children,
Christopher Allon on Oct. 18, with three girls and two boys coming
along on Nov. 11. Christopher Allon died shortly after birth, but
the other five children are home with their parents in Kingwood, an
unincorporated village of about 40,000 people 25 miles north of
downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowed by the birth of the McCaughey septuplets in Iowa in
November 1997, all of whom survived, and the octuplets, seven of
whom survived, the Collinses made few headlines and garnered few
gifts until this spring, when members of their church learned about
their plight. The Collinses also have a 2-year-old son with
cerebral palsy,
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that there are surviving septuplets, sextuplets aren't in
the limelight,'' said Janet Bleyl, president of the Triplet
Connection, an organization for families with multiple births of
three or more. ``It's terrible, but that's media.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Ms. Bleyl said, companies that once donated baby
items to couples with multiple births of at least three are
beginning to do less and making policies about what they will give.
Susan Lauritsen, who knew the Collinses through the Woodlands
United Methodist Church, found that out firsthand as she started
trying to help the family in early February.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I thought was needed was a phone call and people with
sextuplets were provided for,'' Ms. Lauritsen said.
</P>
<P>
   But once she started making calls, she found reality was very
different. Working from an Internet list of companies that provided
give-aways for newborns, she found that nearly one-third had
discontinued their programs for couples with multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Little Tikes Co., a subsidiary of Rubbermaid Inc.,
recently asked the Triplet Connection to publish a note in its
newsletter saying that the company was discontinuing a program that
provided donations for families with multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a listing of companies you can write to for some of
the freebies,'' Ms. Bleyl said, ``but there is no long-term
sustained kind of help out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lauritsen said she also sensed some backlash against parents
with children from multiple births.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Collins, sitting in the living room of her four-bedroom
home in Kingwood, said she had been challenged by people about why
she had not aborted some of the babies in a process known as
selective reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell us you should have gotten rid of some of them,''
she said. ``I look at them and say, `Who should I have reduced, who
should I have gotten rid of?'''
</P>
<P>
   Others say, ``You shouldn't have them if you can't afford
them,'' said her husband, Christopher Collins, who earns $41,000 a
year as a technician for Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Collinses, who went to a fertility specialist, said that
when they went through with a fertility procedure, it appeared that
there were only two eggs that would develop, so it was a surprise
when they learned they would have sextuplets.
</P>
<P>
   The Collinses had always wanted a family of seven. They just had
not expected to have all their children at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not begging for help,'' Christopher Collins said. ``These
kids are my responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Collinses have about $100,000 in medical bills remaining
after insurance covered the rest of the $2.5 million cost of the
births and extended hospital care.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Bleyl says that what families with multiple births receive
depends to some extent on where they live.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McCaugheys had an incredible community, an incredible
church community,'' she said of the Iowa family. ``If you live in
Los Angeles you probably don't know who lives next door, much less
get involved with who's having a baby down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   It was members of the Collinses' church, led by Ms. Lauritsen,
who began organizing their assistance.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these efforts, the family has received donations
including diapers, baby food, strollers, five cribs and bedding.
Efforts are also being made to get them a bigger home and to
provide for the children in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see these kids through college,'' said Randall Reed,
who owns four Ford dealerships in Texas and has set up an education
and health fund for the children at Chase Bank of Texas. ``That's
my mission. I can't imagine what these people go through every day.
Their spirit consumes you.''

KEY OPPOSITION FIGURE RETURNS TO YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A key figure in the Yugoslav opposition
movement who fled during the war with NATO returned Sunday evening
and dared President Slobodan Milosevic to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Djindjic, a central figure in the opposition alliance that
two years ago staged the largest and most sustained street
demonstrations ever held against Milosevic, is facing up to 20
years in prison for avoiding military service during the Kosovo
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe Milosevic can take the risk to arrest me and
provoke protests around Serbia,'' Djindjic said at the Belgrade
airport, adding that he would appear in court here this week to
defend his decision to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic, 46, a philosopher and former mayor of Belgrade who was
educated in Germany, fled the capital in early May after he said he
had received information that paramilitary thugs were planning to
kill him.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he left, a prominent opposition journalist,
Slavko Curuvija, was shot dead in the street after being accused on
state television of being a traitor. The government news media and
pro-Milosevic politicians made the same charge against Djindjic.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport, Djindjic told reporters he had flown into
Belgrade on Montenegrin Airlines, rather than drive through Serbia
in a private car, so that Milosevic's police could not arrest him
away from the glare of television cameras. He arrived from
Montenegro, the small, independence-minded republic that with
Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said he believed that the opposition movement here had
a matter of months to force Milosevic from power before world
attention wandered away from the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not too much time,'' Djindjic said. ``If we have
Milosevic in power after six months, it will be too late. The
attention of the international community will focus on us maybe
three or four months more.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the threat of being imprisoned by courts that Milosevic
controls, Djindjic is facing daunting political problems inside
Yugoslavia's fractured opposition movement.
</P>
<P>
   He has been criticized by other opposition leaders for fleeing
the country at a time of national crisis. Some of that criticism
has come from inside his own Democratic Party, which he helped
found and of which is president.
</P>
<P>
   A number of political analysts here say his standing as an
opposition leader has been weakened by his decision not to stay
with the people of Yugoslavia as they were being bombed.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said that he had been of more use to the opposition
movement and to the future of Yugoslavia during the 11-week war by
getting out of the country and lobbying European governments to
give aid to individual cities where opposition to Milosevic was
strong.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and many European countries have said that
until Milosevic is removed from power, they will give only relief
assistance to Yugoslavia but will not help rebuild roads and
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some countries are ready to make exceptions and help
opposition towns,'' said Djindjic, who spent much of the last two
months meeting with European leaders and talking to the press in
European capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic must also deal with the refusal of Vuk Draskovic,
leader of the largest single opposition party, to join with smaller
opposition parties in the Alliance for Change, an umbrella group
that is staging anti-Milosevic rallies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who accuses Djindjic of cowardice for fleeing during
the war, has said that the time is not right for street
demonstrations and that he wants to work from ``within the system''
to force Milosevic from power.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the opposition can succeed with Draskovic, who is by
far Yugoslavia's most charismatic politician and who has a proven
record of being able to bring tens of thousands of people into the
streets, Djindjic said popular disgust with Milosevic did not
depend on the personality of anyone in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the feeling of the people is that they want change,''
Djindjic said. ``They cannot accept compromise. Those parties that
cannot accept that should leave the political scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said it was not he who was taking a risk by returning
to Yugoslavia, but rather Milosevic who, by staying on in power,
risked his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best solution for him would be to go to The Hague,''
Djindjic said, referring to the International War Crimes Tribunal
that meets in The Hague, Netherlands. ``He is very clever. Maybe he
can explain himself _ I don't know.''

ORANGEMEN SCALE DOWN ULSTER MARCH, AVOIDING CONFLICT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ After British troops mounted the
tightest security operation seen in this most volatile of Ulster
towns, marching Orangemen Sunday scaled their procession from
Drumcree Church down to a token protest and said they hoped their
step back from confrontation would gain them an end to the ban on
parading along their traditional route.
</P>
<P>
   With arguments over disarmament stalling Northern Ireland's
moves toward ending decades of conflict, British troops went to the
greatest lengths to prevent a Protestant-Catholic confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as marathon talks in Belfast failed to resolve
differences between Ulster Unionists and Catholic politicians, the
troops erected barricades, dug trenches, strung miles of barbed
wire, flooded a stream to make it a moat, and plowed under fields
and then soaked them with tubfuls of water dropped from military
helicopters to make them boggy and impassable.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, nine officers of the Protestant marching order, dressed
in their dark suits, black bowler hats, white gloves and orange
bib-like collars strode purposefully to the 20-foot steel and
concrete barrier erected this week to block their path through an
adjoining Catholic neighborhood. Union Jacks, white and red Ulster
flags and pennants reading ``Drumcree: Here We Stand. We Can Do No
Other,'' fluttered in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Halting at the wall, they issued a verbal challenge to the Royal
Ulster Constabulary officer there to meet them, demanding an
explanation from Prime Minister Tony Blair and other British
officials for why they were being denied what they called their
civil right to proceed with their parade. Then they grimly marched
back to the church while thousands of Orangemen lining the country
lane by the parish graveyard applauded.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second straight year that the government-appointed
Parades Commission had ruled that the Orangemen could not march
down a road that is lined with Catholic housing blocks. In past
years, the event has been the flash point for firebombings in this
staunchly Protestant town, of riots on the hillside at whose crest
stands the stone church, and of violence in towns across the
province. The simple word ``Drumcree'' has come to connote the
moment each year when Northern Ireland is at its most explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Portadown is known as the Protestant citadel because the Orange
Order was founded near here in 1795, and the parade from the
downtown lodge hall out along Dungannon Street to Drumcree Church
and then back along the Garvaghy Road dates from 1807. The
Orangemen view their summer parades as cherished expressions of
traditional culture, but Catholics see them as triumphalist shows
of their one-time domination of life in Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sunday remained peaceful, the scene of neighbors
standing on adjoining hillsides separated by the no man's land
bristling with military equipment and staring at one another
through binoculars was a wrenching reminder of the tribal divide in
the British province. ``The rolls of razor wire I see stretched
along the fields across from the church and the metal barrier on
the road is again this year a symbol of the sad divisions of
Northern Ireland,'' said the Rev. John Pickering, Drumcree's
pastor.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in a nearby field, the Orangemen called the Catholic
residents terrorist sympathizers and people who would rather live
off the state than work. Harold Gracey, worshipful district master
of Portadown Loyal Orange Lodge No. 1, said he would continue the
vigil he has kept at Drumcree since last year's turning back of the
parade and vowed never to meet with the leaders of the Garvaghy
Road residents.
</P>
<P>
   All the speakers stressed the peaceful nature of Sunday's
demonstration and said that Blair had hinted in the four meetings
he held last week with the Portadown Orange officers that
disciplined behavior Sunday might earn them reconsideration of the
parade ban in future.
</P>
<P>
   Their pleas that troublemakers stay away proved effective. In
the only arrest, the police stopped four men from Protestant East
Belfast headed here in a car with pickax handles, wire cutters,
combat clothing and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers attacked the prime minister for the plan that he
and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, issued Friday night that
calls for the admission of Sinn Fein leaders into the new Northern
Ireland government on July 15 before there is any disarmament of
the Irish Republican Army. ``His plan is down the tubes, and the
sooner that sinks in, the better,'' Denis Watson, the County Armagh
grand master, said to loud cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Graffiti painted across the top of the barrier at which the
Orangemen halted proclaimed: ``No government for Sinn Fein-IRA''
and a sign on the wall depicted a ski-masked gunman with the simple
question ``Education Minister?'' beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   Other posters took on David Trimble, head of the Ulster Unionist
Party. Trimble is an Orangeman who once led the Portadown marchers
but is now reviled here because he signed the April 1998 peace
settlement, talked with the Garvaghy Road leaders and, as first
minister of the Northern Ireland Assembly, regularly meets Sinn
Fein figures.
</P>
<P>
   The plan produced by the two prime ministers after last week's
talks says that Sinn Fein will produce IRA arms on a timetable that
begins in September and ends in May of next year. The plan
threatens to shut down the hard-won new Northern Ireland
legislature if Sinn Fein does not meet the targets, and also if the
Ulster Unionist Party, the Protestant party that is the province's
largest, refuses to allow Sinn Fein to take up its two seats in the
10-member Cabinet to be named in two weeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has called the plan ``fundamentally unfair'' to the
Unionists and told Blair in weekend telephone calls that his people
do not believe in the Sinn Fein commitment on disarming. He said he
had ``very serious problems'' with the proposal and that he thought
Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness had succeeded
in ``deceiving'' the prime ministers with their disarmament talk.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Sunday Times of London, Blair urged the Unionists
not to misjudge this opportunity, saying it would be ``tragic and
inexplicable'' if they did not approve the blueprint and get the
new government embodied in the April 1998 peace settlement up and
running.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern tried to reassure Unionist doubts about the pledges from
Sinn Fein by saying that he and Blair had found the party more
credible than before. He also expressed hope that the IRA itself
might make a statement addressing widespread doubts that it will
ever dismantle its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always said in their phraseology `Sinn Fein-IRA'
in one breath, but I think it has become clearer in the last period
of time that it is not as simple as that,'' Ahern said in a Sky
News interview. ``Sinn Fein have stated their position
categorically and have given a Sinn Fein commitment that there
would be decommissioning by May next year. But there is not the
same clarity in what is in the IRA's position, so I do hope we get
a clear and unambiguous statement from the IRA in the not too
distant future.''

CLINTON TO START POVERTY TOUR IN KENTUCKY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., W.Va., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, Ky. _ ``The economic boom?'' asked Donna McDonald at
her roadside flea-market rack of used clothes _ humbly frayed
offerings that she has been buying more than selling lately as
local customers survive until their welfare checks this week.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald stared wide-eyed at the question of the boom, as if
directions were being sought to some nirvana far beyond the green
highlands and idle coal mines in this hard-core heart of
Appalachia. ``Not here,'' she noted of the whirring economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now a lot of people need extra money and sell me their
clothes instead of buying,'' Ms. McDonald said, explaining the
economic cycle as she lives it. ``It's tough here; we need jobs and
the economy ain't helped,'' she said, speaking as the daughter of a
coal miner, forced to become one of Appalachia's marginal
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton begins his tour of some of the United
States' most entrenched poverty regions on Monday, the
entrepreneurial impulse in the eastern hollows of Kentucky will be
on his agenda as he makes his first stop in London, Ky., 20 miles
to the west down the Daniel Boone Parkway.
</P>
<P>
   There he will focus on the bona fide success of Kentucky
Highlands, a 31-year-old anti-poverty program whose unusual
specialty is the gathering of venture capital via government loans
and charitable foundations to create businesses and jobs in
poverty-steeped areas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 companies and 6,000 jobs have been fostered in nine
counties by Kentucky Highlands since Appalachia was first
dramatically designated in 1965 as a 13-state swath of intense
poverty deserving special regional aid and remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mystique about Appalachian people: They just don't
want to leave this land,'' Ray Moncrief, executive vice president
of Kentucky Highlands, said of the poor's tenacity in the tattered
coal fields.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton _ the first president to visit here since Lyndon B.
Johnson _ arrives, the statistical progress measured in the past 34
years by the Appalachian Regional Commission is significant: The
poverty rate, once 31 percent, has been cut to 15 percent, just two
points higher than the national average. The difference used to be
nine points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that the Great Society economic development programs
didn't work, I think, is just wrong,'' Jesse White Jr., co-chairman
of the Appalachian Regional Commission, said of the war on poverty
that began in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan crimped the commission's programs, but
the regional approach survived and was formally reauthorized by
Congress last year after 16 years of uncertain budgeting. White
describes Appalachia's situation as ``halfway home and a long way
to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the more troubled hamlets, emerald hills resonate as before
with the hardscrabble life of residents like Ms. McDonald and her
scrawled sign proclaiming ``Donna's New and Used Clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Appalachia's most resistant areas _ much of West Virginia,
southern Ohio and eastern Kentucky _ still have unemployment and
poverty rates at least 50 percent higher than the rest of the
nation. A checkerboard pattern of diehard neediness in 108 of the
region's 406 counties leaves some residents reacting with a polite
shrug to the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess anybody can go anywhere they want,'' said Boyd Asher,
a whatnot dealer sharing roadside space with Ms. McDonald. ``But it
seems like his big boom skipped this place,'' added Asher, yearning
for the steady paycheck of his old coal-mining job that was lost
when the industry moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That left us down in the dumps,'' said Asher, who drives the
school bus part-time and hustles used household goods on roads from
London to Harlan. ``Now the welfare cutbacks in food stamps and all
is hurting us bad. The only money around here is during the two
weeks after the welfare checks come.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At his side, Matt Collins, a retired coal miner and dealer in
assorted dishes and novelties, conceded total puzzlement about the
economy raging in so many other places. ``I just can't never figure
it out. Why can't they never get a factory in here?'' he said of
Clay County, where the unemployment rate is 80 percent worse than
the national average. Clinton, he said, trimmed back traditional
welfare on the promise of greater job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The president intends to highlight his new venture capital
program for impoverished areas. Dubbed New Markets Initiative, it
was announced in January as an attempt to use deferred-interest
loans and other incentives to draw the private sector more deeply
into the Small Business Administration's effort to spawn new
business and jobs in distressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents amiably speculate on why this proposal has come
more in the twilight than in the heyday of the Clinton
administration. But others stand ready to gratefully exploit the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never too late,'' said J.C. Egnew, an engineer who quit
the space program 27 years ago to settle here and become a
businessman, sensing a trainable and loyal pool of factory workers
clinging to the land.
</P>
<P>
   With venture capital help from Kentucky Highlands, Egnew has
created five factory businesses and more than 1,000 jobs, producing
hunting equipment, military tents and automobile air bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is the most powerful man on earth and whatever
he decides is important carries a lot of weight,'' said Egnew, a
community leader in Stearns who recently sponsored a new
computerized community college center to track the economy globally
so the next generation of Highlanders might be better prepared for
change.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why one coal-mine hollow inches toward recovery while
another does not, Egnew responded that the dominant factor beyond
all the aid programs seemed to be whether a community was willing
to dedicate itself to education as the engine of rescue. Otherwise,
he said, expectations remain low, political leaders rarely emerge,
and innovative ventures are never conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Such a community, he said, ``leans on those crutches'' that date
from the worst of Appalachian times in the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Kidd, a 36-year-old worker in Egnew's Outdoor Venture
business, is a coal miner's daughter who seized a job opportunity
as the rarest of Appalachia's resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm home-grown in this country, and I kind of progressed with
the times,'' she said, describing how she landed a start-up job as
a sewing-machine operator and worked her way up to supervisor and
now plant production manager overseeing all three work shifts. Ever
more galvanized, she also obtained a business degree in night
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great for the president to get a good picture of
our region,'' said Ms. Kidd, mindful of the luck of the draw in
life. ``If Mr. Egnew hadn't believed in the people here, what would
I be today?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kidd confessed to sadness lately with the high school
graduations depositing a fresh crop of teen-agers to hang around
with scant promise of a career. ``Mr. Clinton's visit couldn't hurt
anything around here,'' she said.

PROMINENT KOSOVO WOMAN AMONG MANY ALBANIANS STILL IMPRISONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Ajri Begu is well known in this city, an
economist and banker, an author and poet, a gentle man with
thinning white hair and smiling eyes. But when people greet him on
the street, their faces screw up with concern and their questions
are anxious.
</P>
<P>
   They are asking about Begu's wife, Flora Brovina. In Kosovo, she
is more famous than her husband. Arrested by Yugoslav special
police two months ago, during the war over the province, she is
said to be in prison in Serbia, and is reportedly gravely ill.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina is president of the League of Albanian Women and, as
a qualified pediatrician, ran two centers for women and children
that residents say sheltered dozens of people during the NATO
bombing. She is by all accounts a fearless campaigner for peace and
human rights, a dynamo organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She organized many demonstrations in Pristina,'' her husband
said, running down a list that started with the 1981 protests by
Kosovo Albanian students against Serbian rule, and extended to the
eruption of last year's battles between the Kosovo Liberation Army
and Yugoslav security forces in the Drenica region of central
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina is just one of the hundreds, maybe thousands of
Albanians imprisoned all over Serbia. The Council for Human Rights
in Pristina, an Albanian activist group, considers the vast
majority of them political prisoners, since most, like Dr. Brovina,
have been charged under article 136 of the criminal code with
terrorism and separatism.
</P>
<P>
   The council has a list of 1,200 Albanians held in prisons even
before the violence of the last few months. Since March, the list
has swelled to as many as 5,000 people, although Pajazit Nushi,
president of the Council for Human Rights, suspects that many of
them were probably killed rather than detained.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina has joined several well-known Albanian political
prisoners from Kosovo. Among them is Ukshin Hoti, leader of the
Party of National Unity. He was serving a four-year sentence in the
prison in southern Serbia's main town of Nis, and should have been
released on May 17. The council has been unable to trace him,
however.
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested during the war were Arbien Kurti, a student leader
and spokesman for maverick Albanian dissident and opposition leader
Adem Demaqi, and Halil Matoshi, a journalist and writer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina was arrested on April 20, during the height of the
Yugoslav offensive, by eight plainclothes special policemen, at the
entrance to her apartment in Pristina. The policemen had visited
her neighbor earlier looking for her, and the neighbor saw the
arrest occur, watching from her apartment on the intercom camera
placed in the entrance hall.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina was taken to Lipljan prison, south of Pristina, and
a few weeks ago was transferred to a prison in Pozarevac in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Her family has not seen her since March. Her two sons are
studying at the University of Texas in Dallas. Her husband was in
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, when NATO began its bombing
campaign on March 24, and was unable to return to Kosovo. He spent
the 11 weeks of the bombing in Macedonia and Albania, unable to
make contact with her.
</P>
<P>
   He came back as soon as NATO troops moved into Kosovo but has
been unable to gain permission to see her or get medicine to her.
He now sits in his living room in Pristina, smoking heavily and
drinking tiny cups of strong coffee, surrounded by pictures of his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Her slim volumes of poetry are propped up against the table
lamps, turned to show the back cover, which bears her photograph. A
vital woman in her 50s, with blond hair and in a summer dress,
laughs at the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband is desperately worried. A month ago he received a
letter from her. It was written in block capitals and in Serbian,
presumably so the prison guards could check the contents.
</P>
<P>
   The letter gives the bald details of her arrest and detention
and says simply, ``I am fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She asked for medicine, clothes, toothpaste and soap,'' her
husband said. What troubled him most was the drug brands she named:
``Trentol and Enalapril, and some vitamin E.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are drugs for the heart,'' her husband said, adding that
she had never before suffered heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners since released from Lipljan have said they saw her in
early June walking around the exercise yard twice a day, according
to Ariana Zerka of a human rights organization, the Center for
Humanitarian Law, who spoke with the released prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brovina has not yet been brought to trial, and her case
remains ``under investigation,'' according to the Yugoslav
authorities. She has been charged with terrorism and with
supporting the separation of Kosovo from Serbia. She has also been
accused of planning to build hospitals for the outlawed Kosovo
Liberation Army. The charges carry a 10-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Was she a terrorist? ``Well, we all support the separation of
Kosovo,'' her husband said with a smile. ``But they called someone
a terrorist who organized demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   He opened a diary written by a woman staying in one of the
centers she ran. It describes a visit by Dr. Brovina. ``She lifted
our spirits with her humor and energy,'' it reads.
</P>
<P>
   When Belgrade accepted a deal with NATO and allowed the United
Nations to take over in Kosovo, Beku hoped it would bring an end to
his wife's imprisonment. Yet the uncertainty remains. ``The
question is why are they still holding her, especially after the
peace agreement?'' he said. ``What do they want to do with all
these people?''

   WIMBLEDON, England _ Don't argue with the evidence, especially
when it's stacked against you. Andre Agassi tried hard to stir up
his passions, his competitive juices, but eventually realized he
would have to concede the day, surrender a court that is owned by
another.
</P>
<P>
   Center Court here at Wimbledon belongs to Pete Sampras, as it
once did to Steffi Graf, who went out in a more permanent sense
Sunday with nary a whimper or wave. Before Sampras won his men's
modern-record sixth Wimbledon and record-tying 12th Grand Slam
title, Graf lost the women's final to American Lindsay Davenport,
accepted her consolation salver, chatted amiably with the Duchess
of Kent and strode stoically off to announce that she was not
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm a little sad about everything, which is normal
for the moment, but in a way I still feel like a winner getting out
of this tournament,'' she said after failing to win her eighth
Wimbledon title, while Davenport earned her first, by 6-4, 7-5.
Then on came Sampras to set off a fireworks display of power
serving in a 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 takeout of Agassi and complete an
American double by a pair of Southern Californians, on the Fourth
of July.
</P>
<P>
   Graf had trouble reading Davenport's crisp forehand, misplayed
too many backhands, but in the end, as usual, held tight her
emotional rein. When Martina Navratilova bid Center Court farewell
back in 1994, a tear slid down her cheek as she reached over to
pluck a blade of souvenir grass. Few expected less from Martina,
but Graf is who she is, in a perpetual state of unflappable grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was her day, and I wanted to keep it that way,'' she
said, deferring to Davenport while explaining her straightforward
exit and refusing to say if she'll play the U.S. Open next month.
</P>
<P>
   Graf is entitled to change her mind, the way Boris Becker, her
German compatriot, did, after informing Sampras at the net that he
was through following their match here two years ago. Becker missed
the stage and returned this year for a farewell redux. Graf is more
likely to hold to her decision, believing that her oft-injured body
has given her one last window of opportunity this summer _ which
the champion inside her seized by winning the French Open and
coming close here.
</P>
<P>
   Some accept these reality bites more easily than others, like
John McEnroe, who received the bad news from Graf on Saturday that
a strained left thigh compelled her to withdraw from their mixed
doubles semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, we could win this,'' McEnroe pleaded, when he should
have said he understood. That, at 40, he'd had his day.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy, realistic perspective is a wonderful thing. When
Agassi, for instance, was asked how it felt to be the world's new
No. 1 player in the arcane computer ranking, he cracked: ``How
'bout that? I didn't feel much like No. 1 out there today.''
</P>
<P>
   He came out determined, saying he needed a fast start against
the player he called ``a great front-runner.'' So it was that he
found himself at 3-3 in the first set, with triple break point on
Sampras' serve. Time for a fireworks display for the folks back
home, breakfast bombs bursting in air.
</P>
<P>
   First serve winner to the backhand. First serve to the backhand.
First serve and forehand volley. First service winner. First
service winner. Ace. A total of two Agassi strokes in play on five
Sampras points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unreturnables,'' Agassi called the Sampras artillery, which
not surprisingly preceded the breaking of Agassi in the very next
game and a run of 23 of 25 points that soon had the Las Vegan down
a set and a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing in the zone,'' the 27-year-old Sampras said.
``As well as I can play, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Agassi was suspected of mentally disappearing at
times like these, but after reinventing himself from No. 141 to No.
1, the 29-year-old version wasn't going away without one last
crack. It came four games into the second set, Sampras serving at
2-1, 15-15. He hit a forehand approach, which Agassi measured for a
wicked backhand pass cross court.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras dived, flicked the racquet for a backhand volley winner
and rolled creakily over on his stomach. While he picked himself
up, appendage by appendage, right elbow bloodied, Agassi glared
from the baseline, hands on hips. He now understood that this day
was about Sampras, virtually ignored all tournament, except when it
counted most.
</P>
<P>
   While American women's tennis is deeper than ever _ with
Davenport, the Williams sisters and the emergence here of Alexandra
Stevenson _ some thought the 24th career match between Sampras and
Agassi could jump-start the slumping men's game, back in the
States. Nike's Phil Knight _ sponsor of both men and Davenport, too
_ viewed the day as a marketing coup. Brad Gilbert, Agassi's coach,
perceived it as both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great day for American tennis,'' Gilbert told Knight, in
passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great day for Nike,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nike is American tennis,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the crass corporate line, but Sampras' 12 Slams, tying
Roy Emerson's record, speak for themselves. This is a deserving,
dignified champion, defined by his superior athleticism and
fundamental purity. Is he not charismatic enough? Depends what
you're selling.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming here, I spent 10 days extolling the virtues of Tim
Duncan, another young athlete who speaks with performance, with
calm and cool, who comes off well centered, on court and off. It's
not the only way to be, but it's not a bad way to go. From hello to
goodbye, it has made Steffi Graf, for more than half her 30 years,
a Center Court star.

FINLEY PONDERS HIS OPTIONS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ General manager Bill Bavasi and pitcher Chuck
Finley spoke over the weekend about Finley's future with the
Anaheim Angels. Finley, whose contract expires at the end of this
season, previously had talked about the possibility of being traded
to a contender if and when the Angels fall out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the possibility of Finley getting a contract
extension, though he said terms have not been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's right for me to do anything contractually,
not when the team is scuffling,'' Finley said. ``It wouldn't be
right, it would be very selfish of me. It wouldn't be right for me
to go in there with the team 10{ games out and say, `Give me this
or that,' when the team needs help.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Finley said, the priority in his career right now is
winning, wherever it might be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win,'' he said. ``I want to get it going the right
way or go somewhere where it's going to happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money part of the contract is the last thing on my mind,
because I want to win. I'd like to (win in Anaheim), but the
possibility of that happening is grayer and grayer every day. The
way other teams are playing, it's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who is making $5.8 million this season, said he hopes to
play two or more three seasons, but the length of a possible
extension with the Angels hasn't come up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing they've spoken to me about is they don't want
to get locked in to a long-term contract with players that have
played a long time,'' Finley said. ``My response was, `I've never
been hurt, so why are you telling me that?' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Phone it in: Pitcher Mike Fyhrie is expected to be called up
from Triple-A Edmonton today and start Tuesday's game against the
Mariners in Tim Belcher's spot (broken right pinky finger).
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie is 8-5 with a 3.40 ERA for Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odd call: It might have seemed strange to see manager Terry
Collins send Jeff Huson to pinch-hit for Todd Greene in a crucial
situation, as was the case Saturday night. But Greene hasn't been
the hitter the Angels have expected him to be. Even though Huson
struck out with the potential tying runs on base in an eventual 9-7
loss, the numbers on Greene don't lie.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is hitting .200 with runners in scoring position this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, he hasn't been swinging very good,'' Collins
said. ``It was a chance to tie the game up and I wanted to put a
left-handed hitter in there.
</P>
<P>
   __ Center of attention: Darin Erstad got the start in center
field Sunday, his first since 1997. Garret Anderson went to the DH
spot to get a breather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was '97 against the Twins at home, either May or June,''
Erstad said of his last start in center. ``Terry came up to me and
just asked me if it was OK to put me out there and I said, `OK.'
It's pretty much the same to me. I get to play. I know it sounds
generic, but I don't care where I play.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Right woes: Mo Vaughn has struggled this season hitting
against right-handed pitchers. Going into Sunday's game, he was
hitting .224 against righties, though he did show signs of
improvement during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He analyzes himself as a hitter better than anybody I've been
around,'' Collins said. ``He can pick things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Against lefties, Vaughn is hitting .397.
</P>
<P>
   __ Next up: The Angels return home for a three-game series
against the Mariners beginning today at 7:35 p.m. RH Shigetoshi
Hasegawa (1-2, 3.69 ERA) will start for Anaheim against Seattle's
LH Jeff Fassero (3-8, 7.21).

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Back in Midland, in the harrowing, exhilarating
oil days of rising gushers and falling prices, they all had
nicknames: Dennis Grubb was ``Wemus,'' George W. Bush was
``Boosto'' or ``the Bombastic Bushkin,'' Joe O'Neill was ``Spider''
and Donald L. Evans was usually ``Evvie'' or ``Donnie.''
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes, just to annoy the future politician in the
rambunctious Bush, the friends used to call Evans by another name:
``Governor.'' Back then, in the '70s and '80s, it was Evans'
earnest, organized demeanor that seemed more suitable for an
executive office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could just as easily have been Donnie,'' said Grubb, then
an oil man and now an entertainment promoter, referring to the
sense of political destiny now gathering around Bush, the governor
of Texas. ``He could have been any kind of politician or elected
official he wanted, just like George. And now I think he'll make a
great chief of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a little early, of course, to start casting a Bush
Cabinet, even if Evans' perfectly graying temples make him a
TV-movie dream of a distinguished White House official.
</P>
<P>
   But as the chief fund-raiser of Bush's presidential campaign,
Evans announced something last week that impressed the political
world like few other achievements: The campaign had raised $36
million in just four months, more than any other candidate had ever
collected in the entire primary season.
</P>
<P>
   With money now scrutinized as carefully as opinion polls, this
announcement only heightened the sense of inevitability carefully
cultivated by Bush's advisers, and gave the impression that Evans
had wrought some kind of financial miracle. More than once he has
heard it said that Bush had found his Jim Baker, the close friend
and aide of Bush's father, the former president. This kind of talk
brings an exasperated smile to Evans' face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not that,'' he said. ``I'm just the money guy. If
anything, it's more appropriate that somebody call me the Bob
Mosbacher of the campaign'' _ a reference to another wealthy oil
man and adept fund-raiser who became President Bush's commerce
secretary in 1989. (Evans doesn't rule out a possible move to
Washington in the future.)
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, of course, Evans, who will be 53 later this
month, is a rather fortunate money guy. He has collected checks
from 75,000 of the United States' most prosperous citizens at an
economic peak, and on behalf of a charmer with a well-known name
who is considered a Republican savior. It is in his nature to
minimize his achievement, but in this case there is some truth to
his modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the easiest fund raising I've ever done in my life,''
Evans said in an interview at campaign headquarters in a plush
office building down the street from the state Capitol, far more
comfortable than the usual utilitarian jumble. ``Usually political
campaigns are a tough sell, and you always worry that someone's
going to ask you for something in return. This time, you call
someone and they say: `Oh, I'm so glad you called me. I was
wondering how to make a contribution.'''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that Bush chose his national finance
chairman carefully, entrusting his family's extensive network of
money raisers to his best friend, a man with a similar background
and sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, chairman of the University of Texas Board of Regents and
chief executive of Tom Brown Inc., a Midland oil and gas company,
knows almost everyone Bush knows in Texas, where a third of the
treasury was raised.
</P>
<P>
   And being the candidate's best friend made it easier to set up a
network of ``Pioneers,'' who are each raising $100,000, and to call
upon governors who have endorsed Bush to push their state
check-writing operations into overdrive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His experience seeking backers for oil ventures had already led
Evans to become the leading fund-raiser for Bush's campaigns for
governor, but their most formative moments together go back to
Midland in the 1970s, when both arrived in West Texas at the same
time to partake in what Evans calls the ``entrepreneurial heaven''
of the oil business.
</P>
<P>
   Evans had a mechanical engineering degree from the University of
Texas and no real background in the field. But his father had
worked for Shell Oil in Houston, where Evans grew up. His wife,
Susie, grew up in Midland with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   He signed up with Tom Brown, a classic independent wildcatter,
and spent two months as a roughneck on the company's rigs before
moving back to the office and eventually assuming the company's
leadership from Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Evans invested in a few wells with Bush's firm, and the two
became inseparable, riding out the depths of the oil business and
regularly shooting baskets and playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   Their families were also close, and Evans said the Bushes were
an invaluable source of support after the Evanses' second daughter,
who is mentally retarded, was born. Evans, a devout Methodist,
calls that event one of the greatest things that ever happened to
him. (He and his wife later adopted their third child, a boy.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more than business,'' he said. ``We shared a lot of the
same values and beliefs. Both of us were out there at the same age,
building our families, pursuing the American dream, both of us
believing our highest calling in life is to serve other people,
getting involved in United Way, our church, immersing ourselves in
the community. Of course, I always knew who the candidate was going
to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cadences of his speech reflect his immersion in his
friend's world. Instead of ``around the country,'' he says with
repeated passion ``around this great country of ours.'' Driven by
his fierce friendship, he sees his current calling as a form of
public service, with each flurry of $1,000 checks reflecting not
political calculation but hope for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind every check, there's a willing heart,'' Evans said.
``To me, it's not a check; it's a person, someone who cares about
this great country.''

VARGAS MIGHT BE LAST CHANCE FOR MARQUEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raul Marquez once was one of those can't-miss amateur fighters.
Promoters fell over one another in an attempt to sign him after he
reached the quarterfinals of the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's hard to take the left-hander from Houston too
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear not long into his pro career that he's resilient
but limited. His boxing skills are solid but nothing special. And
he doesn't have a big punch. He's also easy to hit, which doesn't
do much for a fighter's career.
</P>
<P>
   His vulnerability was particularly obvious in two forgettable
performances _ a disputed points victory over Keith Mullings and an
eighth-round knockout loss to Yory Boy Campas, his only defeat in
which he lost the IBF junior middleweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Now Marquez has a chance to prove he's not just a coulda-been by
facing current IBF junior middleweight champion Fernando Vargas of
Oxnard on July 17 at Lake Tahoe. Vargas, for one, doesn't like
Marquez's chances.
</P>
<P>
   The champion (16-0, with 16 knockouts) was asked to compare
Campas, whom he knocked out to take the IBF title, to Marquez
(30-1, 20 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   ``Campas can withstand a lot of punishment and he hits hard,''
Vargas said. ``Raul Marquez can withstand a lot of punishment, but
he !ital!can't hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the difference between Marquez and Campas.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to say. Usually southpaws are intelligent fighters,
hard to hit. Raul isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that fair? Is Marquez just another opponent for a fast-rising
champion? Or were the Mullings and Campas fights anomalies? Marquez
insists the latter is the case.
</P>
<P>
   He admits the Mullings fight, in which Marquez suffered a
terrible cut over his left eye, was close. However, he believes he
deserved the decision over the fill-in opponent who evolved into
one of the division's better fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez also believes he shouldn't have taken the Campas bout
only 2{ months later because his face was unusually tender. The
close fight was stopped in the eighth round with Marquez, his eye
closed shut, barely able to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   He fought Campas at least in part because of criticism following
the Mullings fight and took an eight-month break to heal afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taking heat for the Mullings fight,'' he said. ``A lot
of the press thought I lost. I thought it was close, but I think I
pulled it out in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press knows, knowledgeable boxing people know, I lost (to
Campas) because I wasn't ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas also has referred to what he believes is Marquez's
propensity to get cut.
</P>
<P>
   The champion heard somewhere that Marquez has had 300 stitches
to close various cuts on his face _ which Vargas said is
``amazing'' and Marquez claimed is untrue.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez hasn't been cut in his two fights since losing to Campas
and said his skin is completely healed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I have 300 stitches and keep boxing?'' Marquez said.
``He's being kind of childish, really. He's a kid; he talks a lot.
And when you get a guy like that, a guy who talks a lot, it means
he's worried. He knows he's in the toughest fight of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've studied his fights. I've seen the mistakes he does. I
feel I'm very confident, going to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   More likely, this will be his last hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   __ Vargas' future: Shelly Finkel, Vargas' co-manager, said he
and the handlers of WBA champion David Reid are nearing a deal for
a unification bout between May and September of next year.
</P>
<P>
   If things go as planned, that fight would be the finale of a
four-fight deal with HBO. Vargas-Marquez is the first of the four.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a big fight, a big occasion,'' Vargas said. ``I'm
trying to unify this division. If God gives me the power, that's
what I want.''
</P>
<P>
   Vargas and Reid were teammates on the 1996 Olympic team. Reid,
who defends his title against journeyman Kevin Kelly on July 16 in
Atlantic City, N.J., was the only American to win a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   __ Post fight: Johnny Tapia continues to believe he beat Paulie
Ayala in the fight-of-the-year candidate June 26 in Las Vegas.
However, he seems to be coping well with the fact he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala outpointed Tapia to win the WBA bantamweight championship
in Las Vegas. It was the first loss of Tapia's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every champion, Robinson, Ali, Tyson, everybody's gotta
lose,'' Tapia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost. That's what the judges thought I did. There's nothing
you can do, nothing you can say. It's on the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it makes me more focused, it makes me push harder to
another world title.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Tapia wants immediate redemption and to become
champion again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in good shape right now,'' he said. ``Nothing
happened to me in the fight. If they can put it on tomorrow, I can
do it. I want a rematch to get the belt back and prove I won the
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said his future is up to his handlers. Of course, that's
not entirely true; he has the final say on all his fights. If he
!ital!really wanted to fight Tapia again, he probably could.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``Now's the time to get compensated.'' That could
mean a few relatively easy paydays before he takes on an opponent
as tough as Tapia again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is the business aspect of this now,'' Ayala
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia said life will go on if he might never fight Ayala again,
but he had bitterness in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a rematch don't come, it don't make no difference to me,''
he said. ``I have three, four fighters, world champions, I can
fight. I'll go for them.''
</P>
<P>
   __ More Tapia: Tapia had after the Ayala fight he was through
with promoter Bob Arum, with whom his contract has expired.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's not so sure. Tapia has talked business with several
promoters, including Arum.
</P>
<P>
   __ Moving up: Oscar De La Hoya said his title-unification fight
with Felix Trinidad on Sept. 18 will be his last at the 147-pound
welterweight division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been difficult for me to make the weight in this
division, and if I beat Trinidad and he wants a rematch, it'll have
to be in the super-welter category,'' he said. ``I'm not a natural
welter. I'm not going to fight anymore as a welter.''

JULY 4 PARADE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE BECOMES PARADE OF CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRIMACK, N.H. _ It was so smotheringly hot here Sunday that
even the ever-immaculate Elizabeth Dole perspired through the back
of her blouse. But the heat did not stop Anna Britton, on the
sidelines of the Independence Day parade, from reaching out her
arms when she saw Gov. George W. Bush approaching on fast-moving
cowboy boots, flashing his Clint Eastwood crow's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his own sopping shirt, Bush obligingly hugged her,
eliciting an exultant cry from Ms. Britton, a Massachusetts tire
company owner, of, ``I have Bush sweat!''
</P>
<P>
   That celebrity-style encounter was just one of the ways that
this southern New Hampshire town's July 4 parade acted largely as a
parade of candidates _ turning poll and finance numbers into flesh,
and allowing presidential hopefuls whose numbers look weak to try
to counteract them with contact among residents who vote in the
nation's first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, first among the candidates in the parade, was as much a
front-runner there as he is in the polls and financial tallies,
jogging from one side of the crowd to another so energetically that
by parade's end, droplets of sweat dripped to the ground from under
his chin. His deep blue signs far outnumbered any others in the
crowd, and his reception seemed the loudest.
</P>
<P>
   Front-runner status also entails greater scrutiny, however.
Earlier in the day, in nearby Amherst, N.H., Bush had faced
questions from reporters about an article that appeared on the
front page of Sunday's Los Angeles Times saying that he had
``received favorable treatment and uncommon attention'' when he
served as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard. It said there
was ``no evidence of illegality or regulations broken'' in Bush's
military career, but ``doors were opened and good fortune flowed to
him'' at a time when his father was a congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, now the governor of Texas, was quoted by The Associated
Press as saying: ``I asked to become a pilot. I met the
qualifications, and I ended up becoming an F-102 pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Merrimack parade, Bush was too busy pumping the public's
hands to fend off delicate questions. But his activity level was
nearly rivaled by Mrs. Dole, the former president of the American
Red Cross. She crisscrossed the parade path wearing a wireless
``lavaliere'' microphone, her voice projected by mobile speakers
that trundled along in a car behind her.
</P>
<P>
   She never said much more than ``Happy holiday to you!'' and
``Hello, thank you for coming,'' but she said it many, many times,
and the turnout of Dole volunteers in yellow T-shirts appeared to
run a close second in numbers to the Bush hordes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Mrs. Dole and Bush had exchanged what seemed
a significantly warm greeting, but both said afterward that they
were just good friends with high opinions of each other, and
assiduously avoided playing into speculation that Mrs. Dole might
serve well as Bush's ticket mate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday afternoon if her campaign thinking would be
affected by Bush's strong poll showings and recent announcement
that his campaign had amassed a record $36.3 million in four
months, she exclaimed, ``No way!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Money matters,'' she said, ``but it's ideas, it's vision. The
landscape is strewn with politicians who had tons of money and
outspent their opponents, and never got to the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Mrs. Dole said, she believes her campaign is
attracting many voters, particularly young people, who are not
being captured in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Farther back in the parade line and further down in the
popularity polls, similarly undaunted sentiments came from other
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher, was campaigning
elsewhere, but Paul Young, a senior advisor, said that Forbes
planned to raise as much money as every candidate except Bush. And
then, he said, Forbes ``will match him dollar for dollar in
spending in order to overcome the advantages that Bush has as a
special-interest, Washington-insider politician.''
</P>
<P>
   If money were everything, said Gary Bauer, former president of
the conservative Family Research Council in Washington, ``We'd be
finishing up the second Ross Perot term.'' Standing chummily with
the conservative commentator Patrick Buchanan, Bauer said, ``I know
Pat and I both are anxious to get the governor on a stage and ask
him why he's in favor of Most Favored Nation status for China,''
and other questions.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who received 37 percent in the New Hampshire
Republican primary in 1992 and won it in 1996, recalled that in
1991, President Bush ``was at 91 percent in the polls and president
of the United States. Talk about formidable odds _ that's when you
come up here and have Air Force One land behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore missed the parade, but his New Hampshire
campaign manager, Bill Shaheen, said he was on ``baby watch,''
waiting for the overdue birth of his first grandchild. Bush's
strong lead did not concern the Gore campaign, said Shaheen, who is
the husband of New Hampshire's governor, Jeanne Shaheen. At this
point, he said, Gore workers are focused on winning the primary, on
reaching Democrats and potential Democratic converts.
</P>
<P>
   The other Democratic contender, former Sen. Bill Bradley, had no
visible presence at the Merrimack parade.
</P>
<P>
   Among parade-watchers queried, there were still a great many
undecideds, though many showed a decided willingness to accept the
yellow Dole mini-frisbees, the Bush stickers with sheriff's stars
printed on them and the candy scattered by the Forbes car.
</P>
<P>
   At heart, many seemed in the same state as 98-year-old Yvonne
Carter, who rode in the parade as Merrimack's oldest citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still debating it,'' she said of her choice for president.
Asked what she was looking for in a candidate, she replied, ``A
good, honest man.'' And, she was asked, hadn't she spotted one yet?
``No, I haven't,'' she replied firmly.

FARAWAY FRIENDS `ADOPT' A RESERVATION'S ELDERLY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PINE RIDGE RESERVATION, S.D. _ Thaddeus Hust and his wife,
Rebecca Thomas, chose their grandfather because they shared an
interest in gardening with him.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the couple from Durango, Colo., have
been exchanging letters, phone calls and seed packets with Bernard
Little White Man, a 71-year-old widower, and helping to support
him, through the Adopt-a-Grandparent Program.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Hust spent about two hours grilling sausages at the
organization's annual breakfast on the reservation, where some of
the group's 300 members came to meet the elders they are
sponsoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt this connection, this empathy for the Native
Americans,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``Then we heard about this
grandparent idea, and it just seemed like such a wonderful way to
help the elders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adopt-a-Grandparent Program was started in 1987 by a
freelance photojournalist, Gail Russell, who had visited the
reservation while on assignment for a magazine. Through friends
here she learned of three elderly women who had frozen to death in
their own homes during a winter storm. It is not clear whether the
women could not afford propane for heat or could not make the trip
to get supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked about the news, and I asked some of the
grandmas I knew on the reservation to tell me why the programs they
had didn't work,'' Ms. Russell said. She had no plans to start an
organization until an elderly friend, Nellie Red Owl, asked her,
``Wouldn't someone up your way like to adopt a Grandma?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it just clicked,'' Ms. Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Russell then founded the Mountain Light Center, a nonprofit
organization that runs the Adopt-a-Grandparent program. And now she
often makes the 12-hour drive from her home in Taos, N.M., to
deliver food and other supplies to the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The program began with 12 elders from the Wakpamni
(Walk-pom-nee) community here. Now more than 250 elders and their
families are sponsored by members of Adopt-a-Grandparent. About a
dozen elders in New Mexico are also sponsored by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth and a new Web site have helped attract new members
_ most from the United States, but some from Japan and the
Netherlands. Ms. Russell is hoping to double the membership this
year. The budget for 1998 was $150,000, of which $63,000 went
directly to the elders; an additional $75,000 worth of goods was
donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of members say they always wanted to help Native
Americans in some way, but there was no structure they were
comfortable with,'' Ms. Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Pete Smith and his girlfriend, Marja-Liisa
Bykonich, of Longmont, Colo. ``We see so much outpouring to help
others in this country _ it goes out to Kosovo or wherever,'' Smith
said, taking a rest after cooking several bowls of scrambled eggs
at Sunday morning's breakfast. ``And this is the forgotten part of
America, these people that were conquered and just forgotten
about.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Members of the program can either pay a membership fee of about
$50 annually and have no involvement with elders or they can choose
an elder and establish a relationship. ``Some write their adopted
grandparent, others send money, some send new blankets or sheets.
There is no prescribed do this or that,'' Ms. Russell said. In one
case, a couple from Washington helped build a house for their
adopted grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   The elders are chosen by sponsors from lists provided by Ms.
Russell that describe the person's health, hobbies, clothing sizes
and other information. A person must live on a reservation, be at
least 60 years old or disabled to qualify as an elder. Members may
sponsor more than one elder, and elders can be sponsored by more
than one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have about three sponsors,'' said Emily Has No Horse, an
80-year-old widow, who was munching on heart-shaped blue corn
waffles that Ms. Russell made Sunday morning. ``One woman, Barbara,
in California, sends me materials for quilting, or sometimes helps
with the electricity bill or pays for propane.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind Mrs. Has No Horse was Amelia Yellow Thunder, 70,
who showed off the red, green and blue plaid cotton skirt that one
of her sponsors had sent her. Both of the women said their only
income was about $500 a month from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   This level of poverty is typical on this reservation, which
President Clinton was scheduled to visit this week on a tour of
impoverished areas. About 24,000 of the Oglala Sioux's 38,000
enrolled tribal members live here, including about 15,000 elders,
tribal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is about 85 percent here, with a median annual
income of $3,400, said Bart Merdanian, a legislative liaison for
the tribe. In addition to the financial straits, there is a high
incidence of diabetes, heart disease and alcoholism on the
reservation, Merdanian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandmother, Rosemary Good Voice Elk, is diabetic and is
in a wheelchair,'' Ms. Bykonich said. ``Her house was hit by the
tornado this year, and they lost part of the roof, one bedroom and
a front window. I didn't see any beds there when we went by
yesterday, but we didn't come right out and ask because they have
their pride, too.'' Ms. Bykonich said several children and
grandchildren also live with Mrs. Good Voice Elk.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking over the sound of powwow chants and a summer
thunderstorm, Ms. Russell said: ``The Native American way of life
is a circle, and we try to have the energy of the organization in
the same way. The sponsors say they are getting so much more than
they are giving, so it's like life.''

ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS EXPECT PAKISTANI FORCES TO WITHDRAW FROM
DISPUTED AREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After three hours of hastily arranged talks here
between President Clinton and the Pakistani prime minister, Nawaz
Sharif, administration officials said Sunday that they expect that
Pakistani-backed forces would withdraw from their mountain redoubt
on the Indian side of the cease-fire line in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials, who participated in the sessions with the two
leaders, seemed uncertain how or even if Sharif would be able to
guarantee a withdrawal of the forces, who the administration
believes are controlled by the Pakistani military and include some
of its soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   A joint statement by Clinton and Sharif after the unusual
Independence Day talks said ``concrete steps'' would be taken to
restore the cease-fire line in the disputed Himalayan territory.
But it left unclear how far the meeting had gone toward calming an
increasingly volatile standoff between the world's two newest
nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is that there will be a withdrawal of the
forces now,'' a senior administration official said after the
meeting. But he added, referring to the Pakistani leader, that ``we
cannot say how he will pursue'' the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty appeared to arise from Sharif's tricky political
situation at home, where Pakistan's population and military are
likely to resist backing down. Further, it remains unclear whether
Sharif has full control over the mountain fighters or even his own
military command, which has run the government either overtly or
from the shadows for much of its history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also spoke Sunday by telephone with the Indian prime
minister, Atal Behair Vajpayee, during a break in the talks to
inform him of what was going on, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The incursion of the Pakistani forces in May has severely
exacerbated the long-running tensions over Kashmir, raising the
stakes with the possibility of a regional war for the first time
since the two countries tested nuclear weapons last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the urgency of the situation we expect to see action in
the very near future,'' an administration official said after the
talks. ``We'll have to see whether they follow through in the
coming days.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said the Pakistanis understood that the threat of
escalation of the conflict meant that the current situation ``has
to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the official said, the talks had produced a
sequencing of events: withdrawal of forces, cessation of the
hostilities begun in May and then a return to the Lahore
Declaration of last February. Under the Lahore Declaration, the
Indian and Pakistani leaders agreed to peacefully work out their
countries differences.
</P>
<P>
   But before returning to the Lahore talks, which are designed to
deal with a wide gamut of issues, Clinton urged Sharif to resolve
the current incursion first, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fighters crossed the so-called line of control nearly
two months ago, India has warned that it could not allow the
situation to continue. The line of control has divided the province
since a 1972 agreement between India and Pakistan, known as the
Simla Accord.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, Sharif and Clinton said they recognized that
the current fighting was ``dangerous and contains the seeds of a
wider conflict.'' The statement added that ``the president urged an
immediate cessation of the hostilities'' once the cease-fire line
had been restored.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Sharif had asked for a rush appointment with Clinton
appeared to baffle administration officials. Vajpayee had declined
a similar offer of a meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a continuing dialogue that Clinton has been running
with Sharif and Vajpayee, Sharif called the White House on Saturday
morning and told Clinton he had some ideas that he wanted to talk
about urgently in person with the president, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is scheduled to be traveling across the country for
the next few days, invited him to come at once.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the gravity of the distrust between India and
Pakistan and the unpredictability of the domestic politics in both
countries, and the fact that they are now nuclear armed, Sharif's
apparent plea for help was too important for Clinton to ignore,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting Sunday afternoon, administration officials
said they expected Sharif to press Clinton hard to play the role of
an international mediator. But this is a role that the
administration, despite its keen interest in stabilizing the
flashpoint, believes it cannot take on, officials said. To do so,
they said, would be to side with Pakistan, as India has long said
that the conflict should be settled between the two countries
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's desire to come to Washington was probably driven in
large part to get political cover from Clinton for the hard job of
persuading his military to withdraw, several officials suggested.
</P>
<P>
   On his return home, Sharif will presumably have to face the
chief of army staff, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, a more activist
military leader who was appointed to the job after the removal of
the former chief of staff last October.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani military has denied that it controls the forces
that crossed into the craggy peaks of the area. The military has
claimed that the fighters are Muslim freedom fighters. India
maintains that the men are Pakistani army regulars.
</P>
<P>
   In public, the Clinton administration says that Pakistan is
supporting the forces but is vague about who the forces are. Less
publicly, administration officials assert that the forces _
described as about 700 men dug into mountains _ are most likely a
mixture of guerrillas and Pakistani soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani government's insistence that it does not control
the fighters will make it politically difficult for Sharif to live
up to the pledge that he appeared to have made to the
administration Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Further, returning home with a deal that looks as though he has
bent to American pressure is politically risky for the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Kashmir has been the main issue at stake between overwhelmingly
Muslim Pakistan and Hindu India since the two countries were
created from the British Empire in 1947. Pakistan asserts that
Kashmir, with a large Muslim majority, should have the right to
vote on whether to join India or Pakistan. Secular India claims
Kashmir as one of its states.
</P>
<P>
   The current fighting is taking place on peaks more than 15,000
feet high. On Saturday, India claimed that it had captured the
strategic Tiger Hill from the Pakistanis, a position from which the
Pakistanis had been able to hit at an important Indian military
supply road.

POLICE HUNT FOR WHITE SUPREMACIST SUSPECTED IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.C.)  (nk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A man who handed out literature for a white
supremacist group was being hunted in two states Sunday by police
who think he could be responsible for a string of drive-by
shootings of Jews, blacks and Asian-Americans that left two people
dead and seven wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was a Korean-American graduate student who was
killed Sunday morning as he left a church in Bloomington, Ind. That
followed an incident late Saturday in Urbana, in which an
Asian-American student at the University of Illinois was shot in
the leg.
</P>
<P>
   And in an hourlong shooting spree in the Chicago area on Friday
night, a former basketball coach at Northwestern University, a
black man, was killed as he walked with his children in his
neighborhood, six Orthodox Jews were wounded as they were walking
home from Sabbath services, and two Asian-American men were shot at
as they sat in their car at an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is on a spree,'' said Chicago Police Cmdr. William
Hayes. ``He's shooting people all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Illinois say they want to question Benjamin Daniel
Smith, 21, in the shootings there; police in Indiana have issued a
warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the shootings, a white man slowly drove a blue car,
apparently prowling the streets for victims, and said nothing as he
fired, first one handgun, then another while he reloaded, police
said. In Indiana, the police said, he waited in his car and fired
as people left the church.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they have found matching shell casings at all
the sites of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith matches the general description of the killer, and owns a
light blue Ford Taurus with a license plate matching the car that
was seen leaving the Indiana shooting, the police said. A similar
car was used in the earlier shootings, although no witness saw the
license number.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the crimes did not yet fit the legal definition
of a hate crime, because they had no expression of hatred or motive
from the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that monitor racial violence say the Ku Klux Klan, white
supremacist churches and other groups with similar ideologies have
increased their membership dramatically in the Midwest in the
1990s. Smith had been a member of the World Church of the Creator,
an anti-black, anti-Christian, anti-Jewish organization based in
East Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the group described Smith as nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben always struck me as a very thoughtful person, very
intelligent,'' Matthew F. Hale, the minister of the World Church of
the Creator, in East Peoria, Ill., said in a telephone interview.
``I was struck by his sincerity, his dedication, and actually his
cool-headedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former Indiana University student, joined the Church of
the Creator in 1998 by paying $35 and pledging his ``undying
loyalty to the white race,'' Hale said. He attended meetings and
ordered large volumes of its literature attacking Jews and blacks,
Hale said, until his one-year membership lapsed in May. The title
of the group's main publication is: ``Facts that the media and
government don't want you to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale has been fighting a well-publicized battle to obtain his
law license in Illinois. On Friday, his appeal was denied again by
a state administrative board because of his racial views. The
shootings began that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard speculation from reporters that Ben was angry
about my appeal being denied, but I don't know if that's true,''
said Hale, who plans to appeal to the courts. ``He looked up to me
in a lot of ways because I was committed to the legal fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale said his organization did not condone violence, nor incite
it. It does not advocate killing Jews and nonwhites, but proposes
to ``crowd them off the planet in self-defense,'' while
``straightening out the thinking of white people.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, which does not worship any God, is opposed to other
organized religions and has faith only in the white race. Hale said
it supported the views of Hitler in many respects, but differed in
a few. He would not say how many members he has, but said they were
in 22 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The church was known as the Church of the Creator until the
death in 1994 of its founder, Ben Klaasen, of Otto, N.C. It
operates a World Wide Web site, http://www.creator.org, with
documents that include its Golden Rule: ``That which is good for
the White Race is the highest virtue. That which is bad for the
White Race is the ultimate sin.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The shootings began about 8:30 p.m. Friday in Rogers Park, a
northern Chicago neighborhood with a large Jewish population and a
mix of races. Six Orthodox Jews walking home from evening services
were shot, each in three separate incidents. In the first case, the
gunman stood on the sidewalk and fired at a group of men. In the
later shootings, he fired from his car. None of the wounds appeared
to be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The first person was killed less than hour later. Ricky
Byrdsong, 43, the former basketball coach, was shot once in the
back. At least six other shots missed his son and daughter, who
were walking with him near their home in Skokie, just north of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong, 43, had coached the Northwestern Wildcats for four
seasons, from 1994 to 1997. He also coached at Arizona, Eastern
Illinois, Western Michigan, Iowa State and Detroit Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, in Northbrook, about three miles northwest,
a man in a blue car fired shots at two Asian-American men in a car.
Neither was hit.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 a.m. Saturday in Springfield, Ill., six blacks were
shot at, but not were hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the shooting in Urbana Saturday night, a man in a blue car
fired several shots at a group of six Asian students on a corner
near dormitories and academic buildings, police said. One was hit
in the leg, though the wound was not serious, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bloomington on Sunday morning, a man fired four shots into a
group of worshippers leaving the Korean United Methodist Church
just before noon. Won-Joon Yoon, a 26-year-old student at the
University of Indiana, was hit twice in the back and killed, the
Urbana police said. The shooter sped off in a blue Ford Taurus,
running several traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The Urbana police said they knew Smith, who distributed the
World Church's anti-Semitic literature in Bloomington last year.
Sunday they issued a warrant for his arrest, describing him as
about 6 feet tall, 135 pounds, with brown hair. He has a tattoo on
his chest: ``Sabbath Breaker.''

SPLIT DECISION PRODUCES AT WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 Repeating for Green Bay
 &HT;    By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   LONDON _ Should I divorce my wife?
</P>
<P>
   This is a reasonable question that men across the world are
asking themselves after watching or reading about newly unattached
Andre Agassi playing a game called tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Not to give Brooke Shields a bad rap. They remain great and good
friends, says Agassi, and probably have joint custody of the People
magazine subscription. Nevertheless, since their April uncoupling,
Agassi has supercharged up the pike like an express train. Call him
the Las Vegas Cannonball. Agassi's post-parting record _ his split
parade _ is 20-2, including Hong Kong and French Open titles and a
13-match winning streak that goes on the line Sunday at the Big W
against his acquaintance and rival of 18 years, Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   New bachelor Agassi showed he'll have no problems with domestic
duties after whipping up a hot and spicy recipe in a Wimbledon
barbecue pit called Court 1. Rafter, the net-marauding Aussie who
has won the last two US Opens, was tough, all right. But Agassi,
marauding through a 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 win, was tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick could nudge and coax only two break points all Saturday
afternoon against Agassi's serve, which has grown muscle and eyes
over the recent weeks. ``Everything he does is terrific,'' Rafter
says, ``but the way his serve has improved really impressed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi hasn't lost serve in a week, 56 consecutive holds since
somebody named Albert Martin broke through by accident. Those
scarce breakers that Rafter glimpsed happened to be set points at
4-5, 15-40, that could have changed everything. But Agassi gave
those vitals the brushoff as though they were aluminum siding
salesmen hoping to remodel one of his palaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first real opening,'' says Rafter, ``but I didn't
realize then it would be my last. Andre never let me in. I couldn't
find any inroads.''
</P>
<P>
   So Patrick was on the outroad to Boston for the Australia-US
Davis Cup showdown at Longwood, inwardly rejoicing that Agassi
won't be there, too.
</P>
<P>
   One shot told you how Agassi was reveling. Set point in the
tiebreaker, Rafter serving at 5-6. Agassi caromed a double-barreled
backhand return past Rafter so quickly that the Aussie had taken
only a step or two on his route to the net. He flicked the ball
like a half-volley, so early that you wondered if he had allowed it
to bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I saw that ball _ the balls all afternoon _ really
well,'' enthuses Agassi. The set ended, and so did Rafter, although
they played the third required by rules.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to Sunday afternoon, and the duel at 26-or-so
paces on a patch of lawn that is starting to look as barren as
Agassi's head. As ragged as King Pete's chances to keep his crown
if both men continue at their present pace.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, just about gonzo in Paris, lagging behind the 1998 champ
Carlos Moya by a set and 4-1 in the fourth round, suddenly found
the combination that lifted him beyond previous glories and put him
on another planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work, focus, passion came together,'' says the restored
one, his brown button eyes gleaming thankfully. ``I found there's
much more left in me _ for several years. Who would have believed
it a month ago? I had recovered from the terrible fall to 142 in
the rankings. I was starting to play big tennis again, but I wasn't
winning big matches _ until Paris. Until Moya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, Pete again. It's great. This is all the way from
Northridge (Calif.) to Centre Court,'' he laughs at the memory of
two little boys belting balls at each other on a concrete slab in
1981, a 12-and-under tournament. ``I was 11; Pete was 10, about a
foot shorter than me. He's grown a little since. He had a
two-handed backhand then, and he beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras nods, ``If that's the way Andre says it was, fine. I
don't remember, but we've been playing each other ever since. He's
the best returner in the business, maybe the best ever. Andre is
one guy who takes my serve away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi recalls, ``Our first meeting as pros (1989) I beat him
one-and-one in Rome (it was 6-2, 6-1), and he really sucked.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras's memory coincides: ``I did suck. I was just struggling
in Europe to break even and didn't know what I was doing on clay.''
</P>
<P>
   That launched a feud that was supposed to be the greatest since
the Montagues and the Capulets. But after Sampras beat Agassi in
four for the US Open title of 1995, you began to wonder if Pete
weren't the apothecary, mixing a potion fatal to Andre's career.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras feels, ``That seemed to take the steam out of him and
the rivalry. Andre started to go off his game. It was too bad
because we've brought out the best in each other. But I never gave
up on him. I knew he'd be back. Andre is too good. No, we're not
close, but we're not unfriendly. We respect each other.''
</P>
<P>
   They made beautiful tennis together, as well as amusing TV
commercials. ``A lot of fun, the tennis and the commercials,''
Sampras says. And now they're back together again, like old lovers
who've decided to make up and give it another try.
</P>
<P>
   Linked once more, they go at each other in racket-to-racket
combat for the 24th time (13-10, Sampras), the sixth in a major
(3-2, Sampras). But never before in a Wimbledon final. Never for
the most cherished prize of them all on this stage of tennis
stages. And never as Yankee Doodle Dandies on the Fourth of July.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't Northridge, but the occasion still calls for fireworks.
They are just the guys to provide sky rockets, cherry bombs, and
Roman candles every time they swing. Look out, Pete. The usurper
also brings dynamite.

<P>
   PHOENIX - It was the upset of this year and a dramatic fight in
any year.
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; Paulie Ayala's stunning victory over  &UR; Johnny Tapia 10 days
ago won't be remembered by many people. Not many watched.
</P>
<P>
   The Ayala-Tapia drama stands in sharp contrast to the garbage
that boxing has produced lately. Thus far, 1999 has been defined by
the
 &UR; Evander Holyfield- &UR; Lennox Lewis mess. The draw, despite Lewis'
superiority, generated predictions that fights and fighters in the
smallest weight classes would suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala's unanimous decision over the once-unbeaten Tapia for the
World Boxing Association's bantamweight title is evidence of damage
done.
</P>
<P>
   Blood was spilled.
</P>
<P>
   At the box office.
</P>
<P>
   A $400,000 loss is expected on the pay-per-view television
production. Customers weren't buying at the rate promoters had
hoped. After Lewis-Holyfield, why would they? Judging for that one
has planted suspicions that the fix was in. Rob the buyers once,
but not twice.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of the fight itself, there was a scramble to fill
seats. Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay scaled back its Events Center in
anticipation of 6,000, a moderate crowd. But as the opening bell
approached, it was clear that even that was optimistic. In the end,
the hotel/casino sold $50 tickets to its employees for $4. Even at
that price, the crowd fell about 1,000 short of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala-Tapia had none of the glitter and celebrity that has
assured a sellout for the  &UR; Oscar De La Hoya- &UR; Felix Trinidad clash
on Sept. 18. De La Hoya has become a pop idol,  &UR; Ricky Martin in
boxing gloves. He attracts 5,000 groupies to a weigh-in.
</P>
<P>
   The true test of the game's health was in a bout between
lesser-known bantamweights. Had there been a lively interest in
boxing, there would have been a bigger crowd, both at ringside and
in the television audience. &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final crowd count for  &UR; Michael Carbajal's victory Friday
night over  &UR; Oscar Calzada at Tucson Community Center was 3,242,
short of the original estimate of 5,000. The larger number was a
result of the noise. Tucson fans warmly welcomed Carbajal with loud
cheers, unlike the boos the Phoenix fighter often hears when
introduced in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch: Previously unbeaten junior-middleweight  &UR; Manny
 &UR; Sobral had more than his record marred in a loss to  &UR; Tony Badea in
Edmonton. He was mauled. Fifty-three stitches closed cuts on his
face. His right leg was broken. ``After I hurt my leg, I felt I was
having hallucinations,'' said Sobral, who snapped his leg when he
hit the canvas in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Junior-lightweight  &UR; Diego Corrales, a former Phoenix fighter for
west-side trainer  &UR; Willy Borchert, is in line for a mandatory shot
at the International Boxing Federation title held by
 &UR; Robert Garcia, whose possible unification bout with World Boxing
Council champ  &UR; Floyd Mayweather is snagged at the bargaining table.
Purse bidding for Corrales-Gracia is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Butterbean vs. Has Been? Butterbean, otherwise known as  &UR; Eric
Esch, wants to fight  &UR; Mike Tyson, who is trying to shed pounds
before beginning some serious work at the Valley's former Madison
Square Garden gym for a possible bout on Oct. 2. ``Mike can only
fight four rounds, anyway,'' Butterbean said after stopping  &UR; Peter
McNeeley in 179 seconds, or just 90 seconds longer than it took
Tyson. ``I've gotten better and he's gotten worse.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's a shot fighter: New Jersey would not license
Philadelphia welterweight  &UR; Charles Young for a bout last week in
Atlantic City. A CAT scan revealed that Young has a 9-millimeter
slug embedded in his skull. &QL;

CALLING LONG-DISTANCE: D-BACKS READY TO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Diamondbacks' accounting office is set for a
dramatic jump in the club's long-distance phone bills this month.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. has been tirelessly working
the phones, piecing together as many trade possibilities as
possible so the club's brain trust can sift through them and decide
in what direction to go.
</P>
<P>
   There appear to be five legitimate deals the Diamondbacks can
pull off. All involve acquiring major league relief help. All also
translate into the Diamondbacks having to part with one or two of
their prized minor league prospects and at least one player from
the big league roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not just asking for the moon, they want a couple of
planets also,'' Garagiola said. ``We'd be rolling the dice if we
stand pat and rolling them if we make a deal. If we do something,
it will probably be sooner rather than later. We're not looking at
the (July 31) trading deadline; we're serious about it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Any talk of dealing second-year first baseman  &UR; Travis Lee has
been eliminated, Garagiola said. The biggest obstacle is coming to
grips with dealing one of the three phenom pitchers  &UR; (Nick
Bierbrodt, John
 &UR; Patterson or  &UR; Brad Penny) as well as another minor leaguer and
someone from the big league roster for immediate bullpen help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is more about where we're left after a deal,''
Garagiola said. ``Where we are right after, a year from and even
two years from now. It's not difficult to evaluate in terms of who
we would be getting. It's harder to evaluate the other side.'' &QL; 
Dellucci shines &QL; 
It was just his ninth starting assignment in 82 games, but
outfielder &UR; David Dellucci made the most of it again. He was 2 for 4
with a career-high four RBIs Sunday afternoon, including hitting
his first home run since June 23, 1998, a span of 301 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci is batting .459 (17 for 37) with 15 runs and seven RBIs
when he starts and .250 (9 for 36) otherwise. &QL; 
Etc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reliever  &UR; Darren Holmes, on the disabled list because of a sore
lower back, is set to receive a second anti-inflammatory injection
today. Holmes, arguably the club's most consistent reliever,
probably will not return to the active roster until July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter is contemplating the idea of carrying 12
pitchers for the first few series after the All-Star break. The
first two series are in American League ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   Two Diamondbacks have been staying in their St. Louis area
homes. Outfielder  &UR; Bernard Gilkey, who was born and reared in St.
Louis, and pitcher  &UR; Andy Benes, who still has a residence in the
area from his days with the Cardinals, were allowed to stay with
their families. &QL;

U.S. TEAM LOOKS FORWARD TO REST

   STANFORD, Calif. _ Before turning their attention to the Women's
World Cup championship match against China, the U.S. players are
hoping to enjoy a break from the long-distance travel and the
rigors of playing every third or fourth day.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans played in New Jersey, Chicago, Boston and
Washington, often in warm temperatures and high humidity. They have
also practiced every day they weren't traveling, and made the long
haul across the country. Now, they will remain in California,
awaiting Saturday's final at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tournament is very physically taxing, but also
emotionally taxing,'' U.S. captain  &UR; Carla Overbeck said after
Sunday's 2-0 win over Brazil. ``We feel a real sense of
accomplishment at having come this far, but we're looking forward
to a little rest and time to recuperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the players are nursing minor injuries, along with
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all pretty tired,'' forward  &UR; Mia Hamm said. ``But we
have five or six days to regenerate, and that's important. We
haven't reached our goal yet. Our goal is to win it all.'' Jumping
for Joy &QL; 
The Fawcetts were overflowing at a San Jose hotel Sunday morning,
but there was no cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 of U.S. team defender  &UR; Joy Fawcett's friends and
family members made the trip from Southern California to see the
Huntington Beach native play in the semifinal match.
</P>
<P>
   Her fans at the hotel were all dressed in replica U.S. team
jerseys, with her number, 14, and ``Fawcett'' on the back. They
also wore caps with ``Fawcett's Fanatics'' written above the bill. &QL; 
Pre-game festivities &QL; 
The scene outside Stanford Stadium was decidedly different from
what it was for the 1994 men's World Cup, when Brazilian fans
virtually took over the city. They were singing in the streets and
partying in the parking lots, while outnumbering the oppositions'
fans, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the crowd was overwhelmingly pro-American. Red, white
and blue was everywhere on the Fourth of July, and thousands
partook in the American tradition of tailgating in the parking
lots. &QL; 
Corner kicks &QL; 
The Brazilians lost the semifinal match to the United States, but
team members did not go home empty-handed. Before their
quarterfinal match against Nigeria, the Brazilians spent a day
shopping in the Georgetown area of Washington. According to a Cup
official, some players spent more than $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a home-field advantage. Seven of the 20 U.S. team
players are from California, including  &UR; Julie Foudy, who attended
Stanford.  &UR; Brandi Chastain, who grew up in nearby San Jose, was
honored before Sunday's match for making her 100th international
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The United States entered the semifinal with no yellow cards,
the only team in the tournament not to receive a warning from the
referees. They remained card-free until the 90th minute of Sunday's
match, when  &UR; Michelle Akers was cautioned.

   MEXICO CITY _ Charges of vote-buying, polling place
electioneering and other questionable practices, mainly by the
governing party, marred the balloting for governor in the state of
Mexico Sunday, in an election that amounts to a dress rehearsal for
a watershed presidential vote next year.
</P>
<P>
   The race is a tight heat between Arturo Montiel Rojas, 55, the
candidate of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, and Jose Luis Duran Reveles, 38, the candidate from the
right-of-center National Action Party. A third candidate, from the
left-of-center Party of the Democratic Revolution, was lagging far
behind in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   The election is being watched all over Mexico because the
breakdown of the parties' membership in the state of Mexico, the
most populous with 7.1 million registered voters, mirrors the
political configuration of the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are showing the way to the 2000 election,'' Maria Yolanda
Mejia Dominguez, a retired primary school teacher, said with pride
as she cast her vote Sunday in the state of Mexico's capital,
Toluca. The presidential race will be the most open and competitive
in Mexico's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   In another governor's race Sunday, in the western coastal state
of Nayarit, an unusually broad coalition of four opposition
parties, including the Democratic Revolution and National Action
parties, came together to face the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The two elections will tell the opposition parties much about
whether one of them can win the presidency alone, or whether they
have to forge an alliance next year in order to beat the governing
party, which has won every presidential election in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Results from an exit poll by the Televisa network indicated that
the opposition coalition in Nayarit won with 54 percent of the
vote, to 44 percent for the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Mexico, reports of questionable, if not illegal,
election day conduct by the governing party poured in to radio
stations and opposition party monitoring stations all day.
</P>
<P>
   In the huge township of Cuautitlan Izcalli, callers to a popular
radio station reported that governing party members had arrived at
one polling place with a suitcase full of cash and handed out about
$10 to some voters as they emerged from the polls. When opposition
poll watchers protested, they were told that the party members were
not giving out money but were taking up a collection for the local
Catholic charity.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood of Ecatepec, a sprawling urban township with
more than 900,000 voters, governing party followers who were
assembled near a polling place worked a telephone list printed by
the local government, which is controlled by the party, of
residents on a street it had paved in the past few days. The party
members reminded the residents of the new asphalt and told them to
go vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiply this by an order of 400, and you have what's going on
in Ecatepec today,'' said Jose Luis Gutierrez Cureno, a federal
congressman from the Party of the Democratic Revolution who was
monitoring the election in the township.
</P>
<P>
   In another Ecatepec precinct, the governing party organized a
rodeo in an empty lot next to a polling place, also offering voters
a free beer before they cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   In Naucalpan, where Duran, the National Action candidate, had
been the mayor, workers from the local telephone company, Telmex,
arrived Saturday evening with orders to change all the telephone
lines for the the party's elections headquarters, where it had its
vote-counting computers.
</P>
<P>
   After protests from party leaders, the telephone workers got the
lines running, but they all had new telephone numbers, ones that
were not known to party workers spread out across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Chimalhuacan and Zumpango, two other large state of Mexico
townships, governing party workers handed out vouchers to some
voters as they left the polls, so they could collect bags of
cement, roofing materials and food. The National Action Party
complained that the governing party paid about $20 to some people
National Action had lined up as poll watchers so they would switch
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party also complained of irregularities. In
Toluca, the state capital, a National Action worker, Jesus
Alcantara, was detained by governing party poll watchers, who said
he was carrying a package, known in Mexican elections jargon as a
``taco,'' of ballots marked for his party.
</P>
<P>
   The clumsily shaped state of Mexico, draped around three sides
of the federal district of Mexico City, reflects the population and
economic makeup of the country. Teeming suburbs cluster at the
capital city's edge, built around an industrial belt. Yet much of
the state's income still comes from one-acre farms in inhospitable
sierras in the western part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In recent elections, the governing party has won about 38 per
cent of the vote, having lost about half of its voters since its
peak strength in the 1987 election for governor. National Action
has won at least 34 per cent of the vote, but several polls
indicated that it has battled the governing party to a tie in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution, whose candidate is
Higinio Martinez Miranda, 43, suffered an embarrassing decline
during the campaign. It was largely because of negative fallout
from a vote in March for party president, which was annulled
because of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Mexico election, in which the three main candidates
laid out $23 million among them, is also a bellwether for the
lavish spending expected in the presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Nayarit, with 547,000 registered voters, has long been dominated
by the governing party. But the four opposition parties in the
coalition set aside their quarrels to back a candidate who had
recently defected from the governing party because it did not
nominate him for governor. The candidate, Antonio Echevarria
Dominguez, is a Coca-Cola bottling magnate who owns the bullring in
the state capital and was a veteran governing party ward healer.
</P>
<P>
   He is running against Jose Lucas Vallarta Robles, 67, also an
old-time governing party boss, but who is seen as having less vigor
than his opponent.

   PINE RIDGE RESERVATION, S.D. _ Thaddeus Hust and his wife,
Rebecca Thomas, chose their grandfather because they shared an
interest in gardening with him.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the couple from Durango, Colo., have
been exchanging letters, phone calls and seed packets with Bernard
Little White Man, a 71-year-old widower, and helping to support
him, through the Adopt-a-Grandparent Program.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Hust spent about two hours grilling sausages at the
organization's annual breakfast on the reservation, where some of
the group's 300 members came to meet the elders they are
sponsoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt this connection, this empathy for the Native
Americans,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``Then we heard about this
grandparent idea, and it just seemed like such a wonderful way to
help the elders.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adopt-a-Grandparent Program was started in 1987 by a
freelance photojournalist, Gail Russell, who had visited the
reservation while on assignment for a magazine. Through friends
here she learned of three elderly women who had frozen to death in
their own homes during a winter storm. It is not clear whether the
women could not afford propane for heat or could not make the trip
to get supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked about the news, and I asked some of the
grandmas I knew on the reservation to tell me why the programs they
had didn't work,'' Ms. Russell said. She had no plans to start an
organization until an elderly friend, Nellie Red Owl, asked her,
``Wouldn't someone up your way like to adopt a Grandma?''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it just clicked,'' Ms. Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Russell then founded the Mountain Light Center, a nonprofit
organization that runs the Adopt-a-Grandparent program. And now she
often makes the 12-hour drive from her home in Taos, N.M., to
deliver food and other supplies to the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   The program began with 12 elders from the Wakpamni
(Walk-pom-nee) community here. Now more than 250 elders and their
families are sponsored by members of Adopt-a-Grandparent. About a
dozen elders in New Mexico are also sponsored by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth and a new Web site have helped attract new members
_ most from the United States, but some from Japan and the
Netherlands. Ms. Russell is hoping to double the membership this
year. The budget for 1998 was $150,000, of which $63,000 went
directly to the elders; an additional $75,000 worth of goods was
donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of members say they always wanted to help Native
Americans in some way, but there was no structure they were
comfortable with,'' Ms. Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Pete Smith and his girlfriend, Marja-Liisa
Bykonich, of Longmont, Colo. ``We see so much outpouring to help
others in this country _ it goes out to Kosovo or wherever,'' Smith
said, taking a rest after cooking several bowls of scrambled eggs
at Sunday morning's breakfast. ``And this is the forgotten part of
America, these people that were conquered and just forgotten
about.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Members of the program can either pay a membership fee of about
$50 annually and have no involvement with elders or they can choose
an elder and establish a relationship. ``Some write their adopted
grandparent, others send money, some send new blankets or sheets.
There is no prescribed do this or that,'' Ms. Russell said. In one
case, a couple from Washington helped build a house for their
adopted grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   The elders are chosen by sponsors from lists provided by Ms.
Russell that describe the person's health, hobbies, clothing sizes
and other information. A person must live on a reservation, be at
least 60 years old or disabled to qualify as an elder. Members may
sponsor more than one elder, and elders can be sponsored by more
than one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have about three sponsors,'' said Emily Has No Horse, an
80-year-old widow, who was munching on heart-shaped blue corn
waffles that Ms. Russell made Sunday morning. ``One woman, Barbara,
in California, sends me materials for quilting, or sometimes helps
with the electricity bill or pays for propane.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting behind Mrs. Has No Horse was Amelia Yellow Thunder, 70,
who showed off the red, green and blue plaid cotton skirt that one
of her sponsors had sent her. Both of the women said their only
income was about $500 a month from Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   This level of poverty is typical on this reservation, which
President Clinton was scheduled to visit this week on a tour of
impoverished areas. About 24,000 of the Oglala Sioux's 38,000
enrolled tribal members live here, including about 15,000 elders,
tribal officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is about 85 percent here, with a median annual
income of $3,400, said Bart Merdanian, a legislative liaison for
the tribe. In addition to the financial straits, there is a high
incidence of diabetes, heart disease and alcoholism on the
reservation, Merdanian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our grandmother, Rosemary Good Voice Elk, is diabetic and is
in a wheelchair,'' Ms. Bykonich said. ``Her house was hit by the
tornado this year, and they lost part of the roof, one bedroom and
a front window. I didn't see any beds there when we went by
yesterday, but we didn't come right out and ask because they have
their pride, too.'' Ms. Bykonich said several children and
grandchildren also live with Mrs. Good Voice Elk.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking over the sound of powwow chants and a summer
thunderstorm, Ms. Russell said: ``The Native American way of life
is a circle, and we try to have the energy of the organization in
the same way. The sponsors say they are getting so much more than
they are giving, so it's like life.''

U.S. WOMEN REACH FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ Briana Scurry knew the day would come when
she had to rescue this American team. She had seen too many
breakdowns and lapses since this Women's World Cup started to think
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   And with the U.S. at it again Sunday, continually allowing
Brazil to sneak behind the back line and create dangerous
opportunities, there was Scurry, having the game of her life,
turning away shot after shot _ one theatrical save after another in
front of a wild Indepedance Day crowd of 73,123 at Stanford
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, an 80th minute Michelle Akers penalty kick dashed
any last Brazilian hopes _ allowing the U.S. to breathe a sigh of
relief following a tougher than expected 2-0 semifinal victory _
earning the U.S. a date with China Saturday at the Rose Bowl for
the championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese routed Norway, 5-0, in the other semifinal at
Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, U.S. coach Tony DiCicco talked about his team's
defense and particularly the play of Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had to play a lot of defense today, said DiCicco.
``We really worked on trying to eliminate space for Sissi
(Brazilian midfielder) but when they were able to get in on us,
Briana Scurry was awesome tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along that she could become the best goalkeeper
in the world and I think she's proving she is the best keeper in
this World Cup. She came up with some great saves and surely that
was a calming and securing affect for this team.
</P>
<P>
   All through the tournament, the U.S. has been able to dominate
possession and outshoot its opponent. That didn't happen Sunday as
Brazil out-fired the U.S., 13-10, using its speed and pinpoint
accurate passes to spread the U.S. defense.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Pretinha fired two deadly shots at Scurry and almost
chipped another over her shoulder in the second half, but each time
Scurry threw her body at the wind, deflecting shots away from the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.S. up 2-0 late, Pretinha had another easy chance in
the 83rd minute, but again, Scurry slapped her shot wide from
10-yards out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were breakdown's in the defense today, Bri just came
up huge and saved us, said Mia Hamm. ``That one save she made at
the end, just spectacular. I just kept telling her thank God you're
on our team.
</P>
<P>
   Even Scurry admitted she couldn't remember a better game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotta be the best game I've ever played, she said. ``I've
had many good games, but I think today was my best effort in five
years with this team.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the game ended, the entire U.S. team piled on Scurry,
each one afterward praising her efforts, particularly defender
Carla Overbeck.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been in the game a long time, she's a warrior, said
Overbeck. ``She is extremely athletic, she's very dependable, and
just knowing that, we as defenders are going to make mistakes
sometimes. But knowing that Bri's behind us makes all the
difference in the world because she's the best keeper out there.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. was lucky _ very lucky to walk off after 45 minutes
with a 1-0 lead _ a contrast to previous games where they have
given up early goals because of defensive lapses.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Brazil who made the early mistake. U.S.
midfielder Julie Foudy sent an innocent cross from the left side.
Brazilian keeper Maravilha stepped in front, but instead of pulling
it down, she tried to tip the ball back to herself. Before she
could gather it, 5-foot-11 striker Cindy Parlow was close enough to
get her head on it first, giving the U.S. a 1-0 lead in the fifth
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been coming out so slow, so I said what ever you've been
doing at the beginning of games do something different, said
DiCicco. ``We came out and got the goal early on and that set the
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, until Akers' late goal, there was a lot of concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there was, any mistake in the back against a good team
like Brazil and it's tied up, said Overbeck. ``We were fortunate to
get that early goal because we've had our share of bad luck early
in games. With the crowd noise it's difficult to hear and that
might have affected them today.
</P>
<P>
   Next up is China, a team that has beaten the U.S. twice in the
past year. Before he starts thinking of the Chinese, though,
DiCicco talked about how difficult it was for the U.S. to avoid
disaster with all of the high expectations placed on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason why we played a bit nervous during the
tournament, said DiCicco. ``Getting hear was no easy chore. I
thought our group was more difficult than people thought. Obviously
the quarterfinal and semifinal were against teams capable of
winning the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we're through all that. We're going to sit back, get
some needed rest and prepare for the final.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CINCINNATI _ Forget the movies. The National League Central race is
shaping up to be the summer's blockbuster hit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the Astros, there was no shortage of nominees for best
performance in a supporting role in Sunday's 5-3 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds before a Fourth of July crowd of 22,023 at Cinergy
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds withstood temperatures that reached 150 degrees
on the artificial turf to become the Astros' third double-digit
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Powell escaped two jams in relief _ the latter with the
tying runs on base in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Billy Wagner pitched two innings for only the fifth time
this season to record his 20th save in 21 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett made an adjustment at the plate and responded with
a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great game to win, a great game to survive,'' Wagner
said after the Astros moved within percentage points of the
first-place Reds in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   A day after suffering a 10-0 defeat, their most lopsided in
three years, the Astros rode a solid performance by the bullpen and
home runs from Everett and Derek Bell to win for the second time in
three days against the Reds. The teams will complete the four-game
series this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be back and forth,'' Astros interim manager Matt
Galante said. ``We talked in spring training how we thought this
was going to be a tough division. We've always said this was not a
cakewalk for us. We knew it was going to be a tough year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros built a four-run lead and never trailed on one of the
hottest afternoons in Cincinnati in the last two years. Officially,
the temperature was 92 degrees at game time, but the artificial
playing surface felt like an oven. A digital thermometer placed on
one of the on-deck circles 15 minutes before the first pitch read
150 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (10-6), who has fared miserably against the Reds
throughout his career, allowed three runs and did not walk a batter
in 5 innings, joining Jose Lima (11-4) and Mike Hampton (10-3) as
double-digit winners among Astros starters. He helped his cause
immensely by inducing two crucial double-play grounders and also
had an RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, now 2-8 in 18 career appearances against the Reds,
surrendered a two-run homer to Aaron Boone that hit the left-field
foul screen in the fifth and exited with one out in the sixth after
allowing consecutive hits to Greg Vaughn and Barry Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time your starter gets into the sixth inning in heat like
this, it's nice to pick him up and get Shane the win,'' Powell
said. ``I've said all along you get more gratification getting out
of that kind of situation and getting your starter a win more than
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Powell did. He entered the game with one out
in the sixth and the Astros clinging to a 4-2 lead with runners at
second and third. Eddie Taubensee hit a sacrifice fly to cut the
margin to a run, but Powell ended the inning with a called third
strike on Mike Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ever-pesky Reds, who swept a four-game series at the
Astrodome the previous weekend, again had two runners on with two
out in the seventh inning. This time, Powell waged a seven-pitch
battle with Sean Casey, the NL's second-leading hitter, before
coaxing him into a groundout to third. Moments before, Casey hit a
screaming foul down the left-field line that came within inches of
tying the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some of the most fun I've had in baseball,'' said
Powell, who has a 0.80 ERA over his last 11 appearances, covering
11 innings. ``I guess if he would have hit it over the wall, it
wouldn't have ended up fun. Everything I was throwing, he was
fouling off. When he hit the ball down the left-field line and it
went foul, I thought, `Maybe the breaks are changing in our
favor.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 2-0 third-inning lead when Everett, a switch
hitter who normally bats righthanded against an opposing
lefthander, chose to hit from the left side against Steve Avery
(5-7). The move paid off as Everett hit his 11th home run, pulling
a 2-1 curveball to right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt more comfortable batting lefthanded against him,'' said
Everett, who has three hits in 14 career at-bats against Avery.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros added to their lead in the fourth. Ricky Gutierrez
tripled to lead off the inning and slid around catcher Taubensee on
Reynolds' groundout. In the fifth, Bell crushed a ball to
straightaway center field for his 10th home run of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we talked about _ guys stepping up,'' Galante
said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Astros' pitching staff thinned because of injuries,
Galante stretched his relievers Sunday, with Wagner pitching the
final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner ended the game with a strikeout of Pokey Reese,
registering 98, 98, 99, 99 and 100 mph on the radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matty asked me, `Can you do it?''' Wagner said. ``I told him,
`Don't ask me if I can do it; just put me out there.' That's the
way our whole team is. Don't ask us how we feel. Just put us out
there, and we'll give you everything we've got.''

RUSSIA ANGRY AFTER NATO BANS TROOPS FROM KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A NATO delegation rushed to Moscow Sunday as Russian
officials reacted angrily to the Western alliance's refusal to
allow Moscow to send more of its peacekeeping troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As new strains appeared in the alliance's already tense
relationship with Moscow, Russian and Western military officials
began talks Sunday night aimed at resolving differences over
Russia's role in the Kosovo peacekeeping force, Russian and US
sources said.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO's request, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria refused to
grant permission for two Russian military transport planes carrying
equipment and 100 paratroopers to enter their airspace on Saturday
and continued the ban Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials Sunday described the action as a
``provocation on the part of the United States,'' the news agency
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say NATO wants the details of Russia's role to be
resolved before 3,600 Russian troops can join several hundred of
their countrymen who arrived unexpectedly on June 12 and occupied
the airport in Kosovo's capital Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main issues are already agreed, but there are many
technical details,'' US Ambassador James Collins, attending an
Independence Day barbecue for Americans living in Moscow, told
Russia's NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident that highlighted the chilly relations
between the two nations, US officials said an American diplomat had
been expelled from Moscow on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say Moscow has sought revisions to a deal on the
peacekeeping force signed by NATO and Russia in Helsinki last month
by demanding that Russian forces report only to their own
commanders and not to NATO. Russia has always maintained that its
forces would not be under formal NATO command. Interfax quoted the
Russian military officials as saying all the details had been
worked out in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's relations with the United States and NATO are at a
post-Cold War low. Moscow angrily protested when NATO, without
United Nations approval, launched 11 weeks of air strikes against
Yugoslavia _ which Russia sees not only as an ally, but also as
territory well within Moscow's sphere of influence.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombing, Moscow has been increasingly suspicious
of NATO's expansion to include former Soviet-bloc countries such as
Hungary. Sunday, Interfax quoted an unnamed Russian diplomat as
saying Moscow felt ``surprise and regret'' at Hungary's involvement
in efforts to block Russian peacekeeping troops for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has twice given NATO cause to feel shock and surprise in
recent weeks, first by rushing into Pristina ahead of NATO troops
in June and last week forcing alliance fighters to scramble as
Russian strategic bombers flew close to Norway and Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he did not know how long the negotiations in Moscow
would go on, but the Russians clearly want to move their troops as
soon as possible. Ten flights of troops and equipment were supposed
to begin Saturday and a Russian military official said the planes
would begin flying Monday.
</P>
<P>
   US officials say the Russians will not be allowed into Kosovo
until the differences are worked out. Moscow has also begun sending
troops by rail to the Black Sea, where four naval transport
carriers are due to take them to Yugoslavia this week.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Kosovo crisis, Russia has had to balance its
anger over what it perceives as the NATO's arrogance against the
need to maintain good economic relations with the West. Russia's
apparent helplessness is a source of humiliation for policymakers
and citizens alike, especially when former allies are seen to be
aiding NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin held talks with
President Leonid Kuchma of Ukraine, which at one juncture during
the crisis had also refused to allow Russian military planes to fly
over its territory at NATO's request.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also sent a goodwill message to President Clinton to
mark US Independence Day. He said the Kosovo crisis had shown the
need for Moscow and Washington to work more closely to resolve
international disputes.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments relating to Kosovo:
</P>
<P>
   --Zoran Djindjic, leader of Serbia's opposition Democratic
Party, returned to Belgrade Sunday and promised to fight for the
democratization of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted by a cheering crowd of up to 300 people at
Belgrade airport, newly reopened after 11 weeks of NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Police made no attempt to arrest him even though a military
prosecutor has ordered an investigation against him for avoiding an
army call-up during NATO's air war on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   --In the small Kosovar village of Rodesh, truckloads of Gypsies
abandoned their homes for fear of revenge attacks by ethnic
Albanians and fled to Montenegro under the protection of Spanish
soldiers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Many wept and expressed remorse for the actions of some of their
fellow villagers, accused of collaborating with Serb forces in
committing atrocities against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo before and
during NATO's 11-week bombing campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   --Yugoslav army reservists who blocked roads in central Serbia
for a day and a half ended their protest at the weekend after the
authorities agreed to pay them for serving during NATO bombing,
Beta news agency reported.

THE RIGHT WING OF GRANITE STATE'S RIGHT WING GETS TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 HAMPSHIRE-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOPKINTON, N.H. _ Under the scruffy pine trees of the state
fairgrounds, the far right of the political right gathered here
Sunday to review their choices for the Republican presidential
primary with hot dogs, hamburgers, and old-fashioned stump
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Missing the action, however, were Texas Governor George W. Bush
and former Red Cross director Elizabeth Dole, who skipped the
picnic and straw poll, though they were campaigning in the state
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted,'' said Robert Kingsbury, chapter leader of the
John Birch Society of the Lakes Region. ``Because the good ones are
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``good ones'' who came to work the Fourth of July crowd were
Gary Bauer, former head of the Family Research Council; Patrick J.
Buchanan, the television commentator; and Bob Smith, the New
Hampshire senator. The event was cosponsored by some of the state's
most conservative voices: the Coalition of New Hampshire Taxpayers,
the Christian Coalition, the Gun Owners of New Hampshire, the John
Birch Society, and New Hampshire Right to Life, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that some of the candidates with the money and
the ratings don't try these events,'' said Smith. ``It's good for
the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives in this first-primary state have been
irritated at the hoopla surrounding Bush's candidacy as they find
their concerns diluted by too many competing conservative voices.
Smith has even begun musing about creating a third party in order
to promote his progun rights and antiabortion concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Haynes of Claremont said it feels as if the nomination
is a done deal for Bush, though the first primary vote here will
not be cast for at least another six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republican Party is planning on him winning the
nomination,'' Haynes said. ``I don't think he comes out and says
what he stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes is supporting Bauer, she said, ``because he's a Christian
and he stands for things we need to return to.'' She said she is
not sure if Bush will include an antiabortion stance in his
campaign platform.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Brown, a cake decorator from Nashua, sat down in the shade
and looked around. ``Where's Dole?'' she asked. Brown said she was
miffed Dole skipped the event and said she would now back Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Dole and Bush campaigns said Sunday that they
did not want to ask their supporters to pay $25 each to demonstrate
their support in the straw poll _ though they are doing just that
in an upcoming Iowa straw vote. Both Dole and Bush, who are leading
the polls, marched in parades Sunday in Amherst and Merrimack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why show up at a place where he's going to lose the straw
poll?'' said Jim Rubens, president of THINK New Hampshire, a
conservative think tank cosponsoring the picnic. ``This is a
conservative event. The people here are conservative and looking
for a conservative candidate to get behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan won the straw poll with 646 votes. Bauer placed second
with 235, and Smith was third with 104.
</P>
<P>
   Rubens said Bush has been running as a moderate, and with great
success so far. But as he marched with Bush in the Amherst parade
earlier in the day, Senator Judd Gregg, Bush's state chairman,
disagreed with characterizations of his candidate as anything less
than conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the best conservatives we have in the party,''
Gregg insisted.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Sunday morning, Dole said she intends to speak
her mind without regard to polling data and special interest
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm going to do is just be myself and lay it out,'' she
said. ``People can take it or leave it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the thousand or so voters who braved temperatures in the mid
90s Sunday to attend the straw poll, many oppose abortion and
taxes, support gun rights, and proudly promote what they view as
Christian values. People in the crowd here made it clear they
detest President Clinton, and loudly cheered Smith for voting in
favor of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some in the crowd said they are even more to the right
thanthe average conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a conservative, I'm a reactionary,'' said Richard E.
Kennedy, a state representative from Contoocook. He said he does
not like Dole because ``I like to hunt, so the hell with her,''
referring to her stance on guns. And he said he did not like Bush
because of his father's ``betrayal'' on raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives have a problem within their ranks, and they
know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we split ourselves up, the liberals win,'' said Smith,
urging the people to unite behind one candidate. ``We're all
conservatives, we all agree on the issues. . . . Ladies and
gentlemen, if we're going to change America, we've got to win the
election.''

 RITE OF SUMMER PASSES, BUT HEAT WAVE SETTLES IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The midafternoon sun burned like a magnifying glass
in the sky. Heat waves scalded the unprotected face, pavements
turned igneous and reality withered into Saharan mirages. But on a
sweltering Fourth of July, people across the Northeast turned out
gamely for parades, picnics and fireworks and flocked to beaches,
parks and other retreats to escape an old-time scorcher.
</P>
<P>
   Held down by overcast skies that grumbled and wept in the
morning and early afternoon, temperatures rose only into the mid to
high 90s across most of the Northeast and along the mid-Atlantic
seaboard, but fell short of Independence Day records and of
forecasts that had warned of something even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi. It's hot! Goodbye,'' quipped George McKillop, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   How hot was it? The weather service recorded 95 degrees at
Kennedy International Airport and 96 in Central Park; 98 in Newark,
N.J., Philadelphia and Washington; 92 in Hartford, Conn., and 91 in
Albany. The heat index, a temperature and humidity formula, made it
feel like 105 to 110 degrees over much of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McKillop and other forecasters said that Sunday was only
the first and least dire of what is expected to be a three-day heat
wave topping out around 100 degrees on both Monday and Tuesday.
Those marks would eclipse 98-degree records for the dates _ for
July 5 in 1955, and for July 6 in 1986. The heat index would rise
to a furnacelike 110 to 115, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about as bad as it gets,'' Todd Miner, a meteorologist
with Pennsylvania State University, said of the week's forecasts
for the New York region. ``It will be muggy and quite hot until the
end of the week. There could be some relief on Wednesday, but from
now through next Saturday I would give it a 50-50 chance of being
the hottest week of the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the heat and the holiday weekend, extending officially
through Monday, were reason enough to stay inside air-conditioned
homes, venturing out only to air-conditioned cars or
air-conditioned movie theaters during the day, and after sunset out
into the galactic night for great cascades of fireworks above the
East River and in communities across the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the lure of thundering breakers and rapturous sea breezes
brought large crowds out to the beaches of Long Island, New Jersey
and Connecticut, and many could not resist backyard barbecues,
picnics in the parks, baseball games and, in towns large and small,
old-fashioned Fourth of July parades.
</P>
<P>
   The largest parade in New York City unfolded in a neighborhood
called Travis, on Staten Island, where Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
Borough President Guy Molinari and other public officials joined
400 marchers and several thousand spectators in a singing,
flag-waving display of American pride.
</P>
<P>
   It was just across the harbor from Manhattan, but it seemed like
a small town in Kansas or Illinois. The bands played John Philip
Sousa, crowds sang ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' and recited the
Pledge of Allegiance; men and women lined the route, some watching
from their porches, and Norman Rockwell kids sat at the curb,
waving the Stars and Stripes and licking ice cream cones.
</P>
<P>
   The 89th Annual Travis Fourth of July Parade _ billed as the
``oldest continuous'' such parade in the country _ featured high
school, community and police marching bands, fire engines, mothers
and children dressed as Statues of Liberty in greenish robes and
foam crowns, and an Uncle Sam on stilts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Fourth of July, happy Independence Day,'' the mayor,
looking cool in sunglasses and polo shirt, said from a stage.
``This is a wonderful day to remember the history of our country,
the beginning of it, our freedom, our independence.'' There were
spontaneous shouts of support for the mayor's anticipated Senate
race next year and cries of derision for Hillary Rodham Clinton,
his likely opponent.
</P>
<P>
   At Coney Island, another Fourth of July ritual was taking place
_ Nathan's Famous hot-dog eating contest. As a crowd wavering
between nausea and fascination watched for 12 minutes, Steve
Keiner, 50, of Egg Harbor Township, N.J., downed 20\ hot dogs to
defeat the reigning Hirofumi Nakajima, a 134-pound former
noodle-eating champ from Japan, who managed only 19 franks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tears of joy in Coney Island,'' George Shea, a
public relations man who gave a running commentary, told The
Associated Press when it was all over and the trophy, a
mustard-yellow weight lifter's belt, was safe on Keiner's 317-pound
girth. ``The belt is back in America!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took the Zen approach,'' Keiner explained. ``I went down a
path that the hot dog was one with me, and I was one with the
universe.'' As the cheers went up and the flash bulbs popped, he
added, ``Can I get some french fries now?''
</P>

<P>
   Thousands lined the sun-drenched beaches of Long Island's South
Shore and the New Jersey Shore on Sunday. And in Cape May, N.J.,
the holiday celebrators included some wedding parties who found
transportation in the air-conditioned vehicles of Great American
Trolley Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Thomas, a trolley driver, said the bridal parties hardly
worked up a sweat in the heat. ``The brides are excited about
getting married, and nervous. They never complain. They're not
thinking about the heat. I pick them up at home. The trolley is
air-conditioned. The church is air-conditioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourists also took refuge in the air-conditioned comfort of
Hawaiian Jewelry and Gifts, a shop in the Historic Towne of
Smithville in Galloway Township, N.J., operated by Jon Mason, who
moved from Hawaii two years ago. ``We had a different kind of heat
in Hawaii,'' he said. ``It could be 85 degrees and breezy. We never
had this humidity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Battery Park, a long line of tourists stood in the heat for
the ferry to the Statue of Liberty. Some whiled away the minutes by
studying other people in the park: a homeless man lunching on hot
dogs and Poland Spring water, and a very polite park cleaner who
was willing to answer a few questions.
</P>
<P>
   Was it a busy day for him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he hot in his uniform?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he looking forward to going home?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, ma'am.''
</P>
<P>
   Another park employee spoke almost wistfully about going home,
having ``a few cold ones,'' and watching the fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   At Yankee Stadium, the heat got to be too much for the home
plate umpire, Greg Kosc, who left the game between the Yankees and
the Baltimore Orioles in the seventh inning, sweating profusely.
</P>
<P>
   Grover R. Cleveland, who said he was the great-great nephew of
the 22nd and 24th president of the United States, was also working
Sunday. A telephone cable splicer for Bell Atlantic, he was with a
crew standing around a manhole at 109th Street and Broadway,
working not very hard at replacing a copper cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love working on the Fourth of July because I make a lot of
money,'' Cleveland said. He said he was not affected much by the
heat. ``When you work outside,'' he said, ``you have to deal with
the elements, the heat and the cold. Business doesn't stop. I just
drink a lot of water.''

LOYALISTS STAGE PEACEFUL PROTEST INSTEAD OF MARCH
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ In a change in tactics, a
Protestant fraternal organization staged a token, peaceful protest
Sunday against a British government ban prohibiting the group from
marching through a Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In dramatic contrast to last year, when tens of thousands of
Orangemen and their supporters massed in a field at Drumcree Church
to loudly and violently protest the blocking of their annual parade
down the Garvaghy Road, only about 3,000 people turned out Sunday.
By Sunday night, all but a few hundred had gone home.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Orange Order acknowledged that they had gone out
of their way to keep the crowds down and violent loyalists away,
part of a strategy to persuade the British government to lift the
ban. British Prime Minister Tony Blair has hinted that Orangemen
will be rewarded if this year's protest passes off peacefully,
perhaps with a lifting of the ban so the parade can proceed down
the Garvaghy Road later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen commemorate 17th century Protestant victories over
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few isolated incidents of violence. On
Saturday night, a loyalist used a flagpole to hit a Boston woman
who had come here as one of the hundreds of international
observers. Shannon Eaton was treated for a head wound and a broken
wrist. Eaton said one of the men who attacked her was wearing an
orange sash, a symbol of the fraternal order.
</P>
<P>
   While Orangemen remained defiant, their protest Sunday was far
more restrained than last year's, which touched off violence across
Northern Ireland and ended abruptly a week later when three
Catholic boys were burned to death after loyalists firebombed their
home. Last year, violence flared nightly as loyalists fired at
police and British soldiers blocking their path. One police officer
was killed and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth consecutive year that there has been a
confrontation over the march from Drumcree Church, and the second
consecutive year the march has been banned from the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic nationalists on the Garvaghy Road say the parade is
triumphalist and insulting. Protestant unionists, however, say the
parade has followed the same route for nearly 200 years and that
banning it proves that their civil rights are being trampled to
appease nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Flanagan, chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, praised
the restraint shown by both sides. But he said the intense security
will remain for at least several days.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the toning down of the protest, the police and British
Army maintained a heavy presence, barring the Orangemen's path with
a 15-foot high metal barrier topped with razor wire. Sunday
afternoon, a teenager braved a moat and delicately picked his way
through barbed wire to plant a loyalist flag before returning to
the Drumcree side of no man's land to cheers from protestors.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's protest, and the response of police, were carefully
choreographed. After a service at Drumcree Church, six leading
Orangemen, including Harold Gracey, the local Orange Order leader,
marched to the metal barrier barring their way and spoke to a
senior police officer who crossed over to the marchers' side to
hear their complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing bowler hats, white gloves, orange sashes over their best
suits, and carrying umbrellas, the six Orangemen lodged a formal
protest against the ban, demanded an explanation for it, then
turned around and walked back to the church. The police officer
went back through a side flap to the metal barrier, which was then
welded shut.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gracey acknowledged ``we decided to change tack'' in
scaling back the protest. But Gracey, who has spent much of the
past year in a small trailer at the church, remained defiant,
saying he would remain at Drumcree ``until we are allowed to
march.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm entitled to walk any road without asking anyone's
permission,'' he said. ``The problem is not at Drumcree. The
problem is on the Garvaghy Road.''
</P>
<P>
   While denying that the Orange Order could be held responsible
for those who caused violence last year, Gracey said he would leave
if the protest turned violent.
</P>
<P>
   On the Garvaghy Road, the residents' group leader, Breandan
MacCionnaith, welcomed the scaled-down protest, but said it was
time for the Orangemen to meet with residents and work out a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Gracey, however, said he would never talk to MacCionnaith, who
served a prison sentence for the IRA bombing of the local British
army veterans hall.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the field that was covered with tents last year was
empty. Even protesters who said they intended to come here daily
until the ban is lifted said they would commute rather than camp
out.
</P>
<P>
   Bill McCann, part of a loyalist soccer team from Belfast that
came to show its support for the local Orangemen, said ``things
will be different this year. We'll show who's really intransigent.
It's the people on the Garvaghy Road who won't let a 15-minute
march go down the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein assembly member Dara O'Hagan, who represents the
Garvaghy Road area, said people fear that the ban will be lifted
and the parade forced down the road, as happened in 1997. ``People
are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' O'Hagan said.

SPORTS COLUMN: SAME SETTING, DIFFERENT RESULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Their legs were tired, somewhere between the
consistency of tapioca pudding and muscle, the logical result of a
steamy Thursday night in Maryland and a bright Sunday afternoon in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Jet planes and time zones will do that to you. The United States
beat Brazil, 2-0, in the semifinals of the Women's World Cup on
Sunday, as players from both sides fought off sluggishness and
cramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tell your mind to tell your legs to run,'' said Carla
Overbeck, who wears the yellow captain's band on her left arm.
</P>
<P>
   The players would not have it any other way. This was your
typical Fourth of July World Cup game at Stanford Stadium, the
second in history, following the men's 1-0 loss to Brazil exactly
five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The American women know the long schlep is the price for a
once-in-a-lifetime World Cup, a giddy spree across this huge
continent, playing to throbbing stadiums. This is the big time, and
it may never come around again like this in their careers, and they
are enjoying every roar, every ache.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Overbeck said. ``We're bringing our game to the
whole country, not just one coast.''
</P>
<P>
   The game itself was disjointed, lacking any sense of pace or
urgency. Yes, even the Women's World Cup is allowed to settle into
a gallantly professional plateau of weary bodies and careful
tactics. Yes, even the newest American sensation, just discovered
in the past few days, can have a normal game of fits and starts.
</P>
<P>
   There were no back flips, no horizontal headers, that might show
up on the evening sports news, now that the lads back at the
stations have suddenly become conditioned to show a few snippets of
these entertaining new faces.
</P>
<P>
   The two American goals came from a relatively easy header after
a two-handed bobble by the Brazilian keeper, and a penalty kick
following a somewhat questionable call by the referee. Well, weak
goalkeeping is an affliction of the Brazilian men's team, too.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it was a typical soccer game, a typical World
Cup game, with the home team holding off the visitors, somewhat
short of producing the Greatest Game Ever Played That Led the Way
to a Women's League. The stakes are high here. They have been
raised by a barrage of publicity and exposure, charismatic
performers making the most of their shot.
</P>
<P>
   This World Cup was originally supposed be a one-coast wonder,
stretching from Landover, Md., to Foxboro, Mass., with a foray one
time zone west to Chicago. However, the American organizers dared
the world soccer body, known as FIFA, to think big.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking big produced a crowd of 73,123 fans on Sunday, under a
cloudless sky. With Brazilian flags and Brazilian T-shirts and
Brazilian drums all jiggling in the crowd, the Brazilian women
never showed the national genius for offense.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of rhythm may merely mean that women's soccer is quite
sophisticated enough to produce game plans. Coach Tony DiCicco
assigned long-maned Michelle Akers to hector close-cropped Sissi of
Brazil, and Akers negated her all day. And after watching Sissi win
the quarterfinal with a missile of a free kick, the Americans
denied her the opportunity on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coach prepared us,'' Overbeck said. ``We just knew any
time she kicked near the penalty box, she would put it in the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   All these subtle things were happening out on the field, and the
northern California fans understood. The sport-utility-vehicle
crowd cannot muster anywhere near the passion of soccer crowds
around the world, but these people knew when to applaud, if not
scream their hearts out.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks did what they had to do. As Briana Scurry, who played
her best game ever in goal for the Americans, put it: ``I knew we'd
have to knuckle down. It's hard to adjust to that flight. A massage
therapist can only do so much.''
</P>
<P>
   They will be needing some more massages after willing their
bodies to perform on Sunday. Akers took another few hard knocks,
and Mia Hamm once again was hammered, the price of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm did make one gorgeous run, taking a short pass from
Kristine Lilly and feinting to the right and lunging to the left,
before losing the ball to a defender. The fans appreciated the
artistry.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the matter of the sprawling two-handed flop
performed by Hamm after some moderate jostling from Brazil's
captain, Elane. The dive was enough to draw a penalty kick, and the
Brazilian coach, Wilson Oliveira Rica, was sure that that bit of
gymnastics affected the game more than any coast-to-coast flight or
time change ever could.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the cute commercials and the fashion shoots. There
was quibbling about officials. There were welts on Akers' face. The
Women's World Cup is allowed to have them, too.

DIAMONDBACKS CAN TAKE THE HEAT, LIGHT UP CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Diamondbacks batters were virtually running to the
batter's box, each one wanting to take his shot off whatever
sacrificial lamb St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa sent to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   It was only appropriate this game took place at Busch Stadium,
especially since the absurd 17 runs and 19 hits Arizona batters
collected seemed like they belonged in a beer league boxscore,
rather than a major league summary.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' offense busted out in a huge way for the
second time in three days, putting a severe 17-5 thumping on the
struggling Cardinals, who are perilously close to dropping into the
National League Central cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day out there,'' said starter Andy Benes, who
somehow fought his way through the 95 degree temperature that
seemed much worse than any Arizona heatwave when you threw in the
85 percent humidity. ``It was hot, but everybody basically deals
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dealt with the stambath conditions better than others.
Specifically, Diamondbacks players seemed to fare far better than
their Cardinals counterparts on a tortuous St. Louis summer day.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the dragged 3-hour, 32-minute game came to its
painful end, Diamondbacks players were so zapped of their strength
the best they could manage for post-game handshakes were quiet
congtratulations to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of weather takes so much out of you,'' said third
baseman Matt Williams, who was removed from the lineup before the
bottom of the eighth inning. ``This kind of heat gets to you much
more than what we have in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no better example of a player being hit hard by the
sticky conditions than St. Louis starter Juan Acevedo, who was
clutching his knees as early as the second inning on a pop fly to
the infield.
</P>
<P>
   That Acevedo was forced to dart to second base on a hit-and-run
situation on seven consecutive pitches in the bottom of the fourth,
only seemed to push him to the edge that much quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Several Diamondbacks players were nearly in tears from laughter
after watching Acevedo try to rev his legs up while teammate J.D.
Drew continued to foul off pitch after pitch in the sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was clinging to a 4-3 lead and needed just three
outs to become the pitcher of record for St. Louis, Acevedo lasted
just one batter into the top of the fifth, unwillingly being
removed by La Russa after allowing a leadoff single to Luis
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unbelievable day out there,'' said Gonzalez, whose
three-hit day matched David Dellucci for the club best on an
afternoon when the Diamondbacks set the franchise record for runs
in a game. ``When we saw their pitcher running sprints like that,
we knew it was going to take its toll on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci, starting for just the ninth time in 82 games, got
things rolling early when he blasted his first home runs in 13
months in the top of the first. It was the first of three home
runs, the club's first multi-homer game since June 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be eating 10 hours just to get my weight back,''
said Dellucci, who believes he lost at least nine pounds Sunday
afternoon. ``I don't get to (start) very often and I'm pleased to
come through when I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my teammates to have confidence in me when I go out
there. I'm not selfish. I look around and see guys having career
years. I'm not stupid. As long as they're doing well, they're going
to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Manager Buck Showalter: ``There will come a day when we
will find out (how Dellucci will do as a starter). The challenge
for me is to give him starts, keep him in the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Benes _ who has put together solid back-to-back outings now,
allowing four earned runs in his last 13 innings _ was aggressive
for nearly all of his 114 pitches. He was ahead of hitters most of
the afternoon and had them swinging at his pitches more often than
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was as gutsy an effort as can see by Benes,'' Showalter
said. ``He had great body language. He wasn't bending over huffing
and puffing.'' &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ A man who handed out literature for a white
supremacist group was being hunted in two states Sunday by police
who think he could be responsible for a string of drive-by
shootings of Jews, blacks and Asian-Americans that left two people
dead and seven wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The latest victim was a Korean-American graduate student who was
killed Sunday morning as he left a church in Bloomington, Ind. That
followed an incident late Saturday in Urbana, in which an
Asian-American student at the University of Illinois was shot in
the leg.
</P>
<P>
   And in an hourlong series of shootings in the Chicago area on
Friday night, a former basketball coach at Northwestern University,
a black man, was killed as he walked with his children in his
neighborhood, six Orthodox Jews were wounded as they were walking
home from Sabbath services, and two Asian-American men were shot at
as they sat in their car at an intersection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is on a spree,'' said Chicago Police Cmdr. William
Hayes. ``He's shooting people all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in Illinois say they want to question Benjamin Nathaniel
``August'' Smith, 21, in the shootings there; police in Indiana
have issued a warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the shootings, a white man slowly drove a blue car,
apparently prowling the streets for victims, and said nothing as he
fired, first one handgun, then another while he reloaded, said
Patrick Camden, a Chicago police spokesman. In Indiana, the police
said, he waited in his car and fired as people left the church.
</P>
<P>
   The police said they have found matching shell casings at all
the sites of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose last known address was in Bloomington, matches the
general description of the killer, and owns a light blue Ford
Taurus with a license plate matching the car that was seen leaving
the Indiana shooting, said Bloomington Police Chief Jim Kennedy. A
similar car was used in the earlier shootings, although no witness
saw the license number.
</P>
<P>
   The police said the crimes did not yet fit the legal definition
of a hate crime, because they had no expression of hatred or motive
from the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Groups that monitor racial violence say the Ku Klux Klan, white
supremacist churches and other groups with similar ideologies have
increased their membership dramatically in the Midwest in the
1990s. Smith had been a member of the World Church of the Creator,
an anti-black, anti-Christian, anti-Jewish organization based in
East Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the group, Matthew F. Hale, described Smith as
nonviolent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben always struck me as a very thoughtful person, very
intelligent,'' Hale said in a telephone interview. ``I was struck
by his sincerity, his dedication, and actually his
cool-headedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a former Indiana University student, joined the Church of
the Creator in 1998 by paying $35 and pledging his ``undying
loyalty to the white race,'' Hale said. He attended meetings and
ordered large volumes of its literature attacking Jews and blacks,
Hale said, until his one-year membership lapsed in May. The title
of the group's main publication is: ``Facts that the media and
government don't want you to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale has been fighting a well-publicized battle to obtain his
law license in Illinois. On Friday, his appeal was denied again by
a state administrative board because of his racial views. The
shootings began that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard speculation from reporters that Ben was angry
about my appeal being denied, but I don't know if that's true,''
said Hale, who plans to appeal to the courts. ``He looked up to me
in a lot of ways because I was committed to the legal fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale said his organization neither condoned violence, nor
incited it. It did not advocate killing Jews and nonwhites, but
proposes to ``crowd them off the planet in self-defense,'' while
``straightening out the thinking of white people.''
</P>
<P>
   The church, which does not worship any God, is opposed to other
organized religions and has faith only in the white race. Hale said
it supported the views of Hitler in many respects, but differed in

   The shootings began about 8:30 p.m. Friday in Rogers Park, a
northern Chicago neighborhood with a large Jewish population and a
mix of races. Six Orthodox Jews walking home from evening services
were shot, each in three separate incidents. In the first case, the
gunman stood on the sidewalk and fired at a group of men. In the
later shootings, he fired from his car. None of the wounds appeared
to be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The first person was killed less than hour later. Ricky
Byrdsong, 43, the former basketball coach, was shot once in the
back. At least six other shots missed his son and daughter, who
were walking with him near their home in Skokie, just north of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Byrdsong, 43, had coached the Northwestern Wildcats for four
seasons, from 1994 to 1997. He also coached at Arizona, Eastern
Illinois, Western Michigan, Iowa State and Detroit Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, in Northbrook, about three miles northwest,
a man in a blue car fired shots at two Asian-American men in a car.
Neither was hit.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:30 a.m. Saturday in Springfield, Ill., six blacks were
shot at, but not were hit.
</P>
<P>
   In the shooting in Urbana Saturday night, a man in a blue car
fired several shots at a group of six Asian students on a corner
near dormitories and academic buildings, police said. One was hit
in the leg, though the wound was not serious, police said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bloomington on Sunday morning, a man fired four shots into a
group of worshippers leaving the Korean United Methodist Church
just before noon. Won-Joon Yoon, a 26-year-old student at the
University of Indiana, was hit twice in the back and killed, the
Urbana police said. The shooter sped off in a blue Ford Taurus,
running several traffic lights.
</P>
<P>
   The Urbana police said they knew Smith, who distributed the
World Church's anti-Semitic literature in Bloomington last year.
Sunday they issued a warrant for his arrest, describing him as
about 6 feet tall, 135 pounds, with brown hair. He has a tattoo on
his chest: ``Sabbath Breaker.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ All around him, there is chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher and Ken Hill are on the disabled list, Chuck Finley
is pitching as poorly as he ever has and Steve Sparks' knuckleball
is about as reliable as a TV weatherman's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But Omar Olivares, No.5 on the depth chart, has been the Angels'
best starting pitcher this season. Olivares gave up two runs and
five hits in a complete game Sunday, leading the Angels to a 5-2
victory over the Oakland A's before 19,721 at the Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   It was Olivares' second complete game of the season, the only
two on the Angels staff this year. Olivares, who entered the game
with the sixth-best ERA in the American League, lowered his ERA to
3.27.
</P>
<P>
   It was the eighth time in 16 starts Olivares (7-6) has pitched
at least seven innings in a game. And he's the only Angels pitcher
in the last 12 games to pitch at least six innings _ and he's done
that twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched great for us all year,'' said Angels manager
Terry Collins. ``Without question he's been our most consistent
guy. He came into spring training and earned a spot. He didn't want
any doubts, so he came in ready to go and he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares gave up an RBI single to Eric Chavez in the fifth and a
sacrifice fly to Jason Giambi in the ninth. That was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I didn't feel that strong, but mentally I was
focused and I hit both sides of the plate,'' Olivares said.
``That's what you have to do to be successful _ location _ and I
had that today.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for a two-run homer in the ninth by Troy Glaus, Troy
Percival would have pitched the ninth. But with the lead 5-1,
instead of 3-1, Olivares got the chance to finish it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to throw the whole game,'' he said. ``Every time
I pitch, I'm thinking nine innings. I knew it was huge because the
bullpen has pitched a lot the last 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 12 hits Sunday _ 39 in the three-game series _
including three by Mo Vaughn. Vaughn's RBI single in the seventh
inning broke a 1-1 tie and gave the Angels the lead for good.
Garret Anderson also had three hits.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn went 7 for 16 with four RBI in the series, which he said
was big because he was hitless in the Texas series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept working at it,'' Vaughn said. ``I'm starting to take
good swings and hit the ball all over the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had at least one hit in each of the first five innings _
eight in all _ but only one run to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Anderson singled with two out in the first, but Glaus
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got an RBI double by Randy Velarde in the third
inning but left the bases loaded when Reggie Williams struck out.
In the fourth and fifth innings, the Angels had possible
run-scoring innings thwarted by hitting into double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Olivares was cruising. He didn't allow a hit through
four innings, and the only two baserunners he allowed _ two walks _
were erased on double-play grounders.
</P>
<P>
   The A's got their first hit of the day when Giambi led off the
fifth with a single to right; he took third when John Jaha followed
with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares looked like he might escape, striking out Matt Stairs
and getting Ramon Hernandez on a popup to shallow right field. But
Eric Chavez got the run home with a groundball single to center,
tying the game at 1.
</P>
<P>
   The A's took starter Mike Oquist out of the game after Gary
DiSarcina's leadoff double in the seventh. Doug Jones came in and
struck out Darin Erstad but walked Velarde, bringing up Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn got his third hit of the day, a single to right, to drive
in DiSarcina for a 2-1 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a chance for more as Velarde took third on
Vaughn's single. But Anderson popped out to third and Glaus _ after
Chad Harville replaced Jones _ struck out.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added their third run in the eighth inning after
loading the bases on three walks. DiSarcina got the run home when
he grounded out, but the Angels again missed an opportunity to
increase the lead _ after an intentional walk to Erstad _ when
Velarde grounded into a double play.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WIMBLEDON, England _ Lindsay Davenport once feared she lacked the
game, or perhaps the brain, to conquer Centre Court. She always has
been the least mobile, least athletic of the contending women, and
her confidence sagged accordingly.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wimbledon's slippery lawns forgive nothing _ but slow feet and
clumsiness tend to be punished most severely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I had the game to win here,'' the third-seeded
Davenport said Sunday after a 6-4, 7-5 victory over seven-time
champion Steffi Graf, who afterward announced her Wimbledon
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, fittingly on this Fourth of July, becomes the first
American woman since Martina Navratilova in 1984 to win Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open title Davenport claimed last year told her the
self-doubting was no longer necessary. It told her she had arrived
at the summit and that she belonged there, no questions or
apologies required. Six fortnights of grass-court futility
notwithstanding, Davenport finally was prepared to make her peace
with tennis' most sacred grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport went out Sunday and played like the No. 1-ranked
player she is, making shockingly short work of the second-seeded
German who had become an enduring symbol of Wimbledon excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Graf, on a 7-0 roll in finals here before Sunday's, couldn't
convert either of her break points against Davenport's serve. The
23-year-old Californian achieved just two herself, but she made
them pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Those winners, a mis-hit forehand in the first game and a
forehand cross-court drive in the penultimate game, proved the
difference in a match that apparently has brought a close to Graf's
long, immensely fruitful tenure at what the English call ``The
Championships.'' Only Navratilova's nine titles exceed her
prodigious total.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't be here again as a player,'' Graf, 30, said.
</P>
<P>
   She had bid Roland Garros adieu a month ago, having surprised
herself with a sixth French championship, her first major title
since reconstructive knee surgery and a wrist operation had
threatened to curtail her career. But Graf's Wimbledon farewell
would not prove to be such a celebratory occasion, as her somber
tone and red-rimmed eyes confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Given that she wouldn't guarantee her participation in the U.S.
Open this year or future Australian Opens, Graf's bid to equal
Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slams appears over as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' Davenport said. ``She came through so much, and
she's the greatest player, probably, that's ever played. If she's
not going to play the French or Wimbledon again, it's looking
pretty obvious that she'll retire sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it's really, really cool that she's been able to
go out on her own. I think that's how we'd all like to end our
careers, still playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf's legacy, considering the depth of the contemporary women's
game, seems to justify calling her the best ever. She has won 22
Slams, including five U.S. and four Australian Opens, and she swept
the four majors in 1988, besides winning the Olympic gold medal,
giving her the so-called ``Golden Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   Four other times she won three legs of the Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of Court's titles came at the Australian Open during a
period when many top foreign players skipped the event. Also, 13 of
them predated the advent of Open tennis.
</P>
<P>
   But Graf was in no mood to reflect on the scope of her
accomplishments, or what her future might hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we talk about today?'' Graf said, expressing displeasure
with questions about her plans. ``I'm not going to go into anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the match, the only Wimbledon final she had dropped
since Navratilova defeated her as an 18-year-old novice in 1987,
she was unhappy with her backhand and, to a lesser degree, her
serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing because I didn't play up to the level that
I can,'' Graf said. ``Unfortunately, my backhand didn't work very
well. My forehand, I guess, played OK, but on my backhand side I
made too many unforced errors, and she served more consistently
than I did. The (break) chances I had, I didn't convert so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's confidence level going in was such that she elected
to receive after winning the racket toss. The payoff came
immediately, leaving Graf to fight from behind. Even a half-hour
rain delay with Graf leading 5-4 on serve in the second set didn't
disrupt Davenport's momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason,'' she said, ``that helped me calm down. I
just told myself, `My gosh, I'm doing so well. I'm so close. I can
do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport never had advanced beyond the quarters, and she was a
15-1 long shot according to London's bookmakers at the outset of
the tournament. To earn the right to hold the plate aloft in
triumph, Davenport delivered what Navratilova called ``a perfect
match.''
</P>
<P>
   And practically a perfect tournament.
</P>
<P>
   She rolled through the fortnight without yielding a set and
spent, on average, less than an hour on the court per round. Even
Graf kept her out there for only 117 minutes. When the last ball
was struck _ a Graf forehand return into the net _ Davenport burst
into tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God, I did,'' she said. ``I was in such shock. I was
like, `I can't believe I did it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Or, for that matter, against whom she did it. Davenport had
upset then-No. 1 Martina Hingis to win at Flushing Meadow. Now
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to win these tournaments by beating the best,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Davenport added the doubles title with Corina Morariu and
then headed happily off to the Wimbledon Ball, wearing a new dress
picked out for her only Sunday afternoon. Next year, she's likely
to come better prepared.

COMMENTARY: INDEPENDENTS' DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMAGANSETT, N.Y. _ Ready for a little political mischief on a
holiday weekend? Let us consider what could upset the seemingly
preordained Bush and Gore nominations.
</P>
<P>
   An unremarked time bomb called the Reform Party is on the ballot
in all 50 states. Based on its vote total in 1996, its presidential
candidate will receive $12.6 million in federal funds in 2000. If
Ross Perot runs again, his vote will again dwindle; if the party
chooses an ex-senator like David Boren or Sam Nunn, it would draw
equally from both major parties and have little impact.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the Reform Party, in convention assembled next year,
chose to embrace the nominee of the Republican or Democratic Party?
It would never endorse the Establishment candidates, Bush or Gore _
but what about a genuine maverick with appeal to independents, like
Republican John McCain or Democrat Bill Bradley?
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the next 12 months, the 25-point lead that Bush
now holds over Gore will surely shrink. The major parties will look
at the pull of that crucial third line, plus its federal money and
stretch-drive call on prime-time ad slots, and wonder _ wouldn't it
be great to have that independent segment count for our man?
</P>
<P>
   In New York state campaigns, it is routine for the major parties
to dicker heavily for Independence, Liberal and Conservative Party
lines on the ballot. In the Rudy-Hillary senatorial race, national
Republicans will beg Conservatives not to split New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's vote, and national Democrats will try to snatch
his Liberal line away for Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion is a New York tradition; the Conservative Party made the
difference for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and the reform party delivered
a quarter-million votes for Charles Schumer last year.
</P>
<P>
   Is such ``double access'' available to presidential candidates
elsewhere? Yes in crucial Pennsylvania and Connecticut; no in a
dozen other states; and in the remainder, it would take about $6
million (much reimbursable as primary expenses) to conduct petition
drives and lawsuits to achieve double access. The Reform Party has
proved itself adept at winning such arguments.
</P>
<P>
   What would be in it for Ross Perot? (1) A maverick-major party
name at the top would build his Reform Party in 50 states,
strengthening its lower-level independent candidacies; (2) Reform's
aim to end the corporate pork barrel and shake up the corrupting,
out-of-control politics of money is the essence of McCain's message
now and will be Bradley's later; (3) becoming a real player would
change the debate-denied Perot from a Stassen-esque joke into a
claimant to the role of Warwick, the kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   What would it take to transform this amusing academic notion
into an unforeseen political development?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fear of losing. &LR;  If George W., in some gaffe during an
interview or primary toe-stubbing or weakness in debate, loses his
aura of inevitability; or if Al Gore is too slow to close the poll
gap and cannot dispel that ``can't win'' miasma _ loyalties would
vanish. Diehards are now die-easies; nobody wants to go down with
the Gore or Bush ship. Vast campaign treasuries won't stop a run on
the bank of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   A Kierkegaardian dread is sure to afflict whichever party's
front-runner fails to show late foot in early primaries. This could
give the reformist long shots of both parties _ McCain and Bradley
_ a new viability.
</P>
<P>
   Next February, the candidate within each major party running
second for the nomination may say to party leaders: Polls show that
our likely nominee will lead us down the road to defeat. Here's how
we can win: I can deliver the third line on ballots that can tip
the balance almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Pshaw, say boxed-in thinkers; unless Ross runs himself, the
Reform line won't have big money. But if Perot goes on that third
line for vice president, and Reform endorses the slate to the
Electoral College chosen by the major party candidate, then
billionaire Ross could contribute as much as he wanted to the
campaign _ and nobody need fear he would become vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something creative has to happen to American politics,'' says
Russell Verney in Dallas, chairman of the Reform Party. This is my
off-the-wall contribution, accompanied by a wish for a happy
Independents' weekend to all.

<P>
   JACKSON TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Since the DNA fits, you would think the
tiger lady would admit, but that is not the case with Joan
Byron-Marasek, who has become known as the Tiger Lady of New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, there was the news that fur samples from the
431-pound Bengal tiger found wandering around Jackson Township and
subsequently shot to death in January matched the DNA of fur found
on the grounds of Ms. Byron-Marasek's Tigers Only Preservation
Society, a privately owned preserve.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Ms. Byron-Marase and her lawyer, Valter Must, stood
on the woodsy outer fringe of her 11-acre property _ where, OK,
they admit, a section of the mesh iron fence that circles the
property was down _ insisting, as she has all along, that the late
tiger was not hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not our tiger,'' said Ms. Byron-Marasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tuft of hair was found on a thorn tree,'' said Must, in fine
courtroom style. The New Jersey Division of Fish, Game and
Wildlife, he said, ``is arguing that because a tiger was shot a
mile from here, and they found this tuft of hair over here, that
ipso facto the tiger came from inside the container.''
</P>
<P>
   Not an unreasonable assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Where do Ms. Byron-Marasek and her lawyer believe a tiger could
have come from?
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been tigers dumped in this area,'' Ms.
Byron-Marasek said darkly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two possibilities,'' Must said. ``One: A tiger visited here.
Two: There was no tiger here, but somehow the fur got here. They
put it here to frame her.''
</P>
<P>
   There is something of a siege mentality these days at Tigers
Only, which Ms. Byron-Marasek appears to have run as a one-woman
save-the-tiger project for 23 years, with occasional help from her
husband. On Jan. 27, a 7-foot-long Bengal tiger went for a stroll
in the suburban woods of Jackson Township, setting off a chase by
foot, patrol car, and finally, as night fell, by FBI helicopters
equipped with infrared light.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in here with their guns drawn, with shotguns,'' Ms.
Byron-Marasek said. ``Fifty people in my little tiny house;
helicopters over the animals, terrifying the animals. I was just in
shock afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials counted 17 adult tigers in Ms.
Byron-Marasek's preserve, though her animal theatrical permit
listed 23. Later, records from Ms. Byron-Marasek's own
veterinarian, whose name Fish and Game has not released, indicated
that Ms. Byron-Marasek had 18 tigers in January, just before the
tiger was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Ms. Byron-Marasek's position helped by a report by Dr.
Patrick Thomas, curator of mammals at the Bronx Zoo in New York. He
called the fencing at the preserve ``inadequate'' and the sanitary
conditions ``deplorable.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, state officials turned down Ms. Byron-Marasek's
application to renew her permit and gave her 30 days to remove the
the tigers from her property. She is appealing that decision.

`WILD WILD WEST' BANGS UP BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Will Smith's ``Wild Wild West'' shot to the top at
the nation's multiplexes with an estimated $28 million at 3,342
theaters as major movies continued to set off fireworks during the
Friday-Sunday Fourth of July holiday period, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' action comedy took in $8.5 million more than the
nearest contender, the second weekend of ``Big Daddy'' with a
still-impressive $19.5 million at 3,121 theaters. ``Wild Wild
West'' has now grossed $41.2 million in its first five days, but
that total is less than half the stratospheric $84.1 million posted
by Smith's mega-hit ``Men In Black'' during its first five days
over the July 4th weekend in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in the industry were expecting `Wild Wild West' to do a
little better,'' said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source forecasting service. ``There was a lot of competition
because most of the major films are geared to people under 22.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``West'' will not suffer significantly from the
spate of negative reviews it received, noting that poor notices
have little impact on its core audience of younger moviegoers. He
predicted ``West'' could eventually top $150 million domestically,
which should push it into profitability despite its reported $115
million price tag.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations for ``Wild Wild West'' had been sky high because
``Men In Black'' topped $250 million and Smith's ``Independence
Day,'' which launched on the same weekend in 1996, went past $305
million. But Warner distribution chief Dan Fellman said comparisons
to Smith's other blockbusters are not entirely valid.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Wild Wild West' is a very different film from the other two,
but anytime you open like this, you have to be very pleased,'' he
said. ``Young people are responding very well, and it played well
in all markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall business totaled an impressive $126 million for
Friday-Sunday, up 12 percent from the same period last year and
down 6 percent from last weekend's turbocharged box office. Summer
season receipts have been running a stunning 27 percent ahead of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has been so powerful with big openings and
pictures showing strong legs,'' said industry tracker Arthur
Rockwell, who noted that ``Wild Wild West'' had a tough task due to
the pull of holdover films. ``I think `Wild Wild West' had a decent
opening due to Will Smith's star power, but it doesn't have
franchise or sequel written all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   With moviegoers off work Monday, ``West'' could take in another
$9 million and top $50 million in its first six days while Sony's
``Big Daddy'' will likely be closing in on $90 million after 11
days. Despite losing more than half its opening weekend audience,
``Big Daddy'' is on track to reach the $150 million mark by the end
of its domestic run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tarzan'' continued to post respectable numbers in third place
with $13.1 million at 3,103 theaters as attendance fell 45 percent
from its second weekend, giving Disney's 37th animated feature $105
million overall. ``Tarzan'' is the sixth 1999 movie and 188th of
all time to top the $100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's controversial ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and
Uncut,'' R-rated due to its foul-mouthed animated stars, performed
solidly in fourth with $11.3 million at 2,128 sites to push its
five-day total to $19.6 million. The studio will likely see massive
profits from the big-screen version of the Comedy Central series,
since the film cost a bargain-basement $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of holdovers were battling for fifth, led by Paramount's
third weekend of ``The General's Daughter'' with $10 million at
2,858 theaters, followed by 20th Century Fox's seventh weekend of
``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' with $9 million at
2,631 sites and New Line's fourth weekend of ``Austin Powers: The
Spy Who Shagged Me'' with $8.9 million at 3,091 locations.
``Phantom Menace,'' which lowered its theater count by nearly 500,
is the fourth highest domestic grosser ever with $369 million while
``Shagged'' is No. 47 with $168.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's opening of ``Summer of Sam,'' Spike Lee's recounting of
the impact of the 1977 serial killer case, performed moderately in
eighth with $5.5 million at 1,536 theaters. ``That's not too
shabby, given the subject matter,'' Bucksbaum said, adding that
positive reviews helped attract the target audience of over-25
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Universal's sixth weekend of
``Notting Hill'' with $3.7 million at 1,940 theaters and Miramax's
third weekend of ``An Ideal Husband'' with $2.6 million at 602
sites. ``Notting Hill'' is less than $4 million shy of joining the
$100 million club, signaling strong prospects for star Julia
Roberts' next film, ``Runaway Bride,'' which Paramount opens July
30.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's opening of coming-of-age comedy ``American Pie''
should post solid business next weekend and may challenge ``Wild
Wild West'' for the top spot. Sony will also open ``Arlington
Road,'' with Jeff Bridges investigating terrorists, after delaying
its original mid-May release.

 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
WIMBLEDON, England _ He knew what people were saying. The stuff
about his mediocre results of late, his questionable fitness, his
good fortune in the quarterfinals, when Mark Philippoussis, who was
pummeling him, up and quit with an injury.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, it had become hip and trendy to predict top seed Pete
Sampras' demise on the grass court he had come to call his own,
particularly with that old fire back in Andre Agassi's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday proved a bad day for the doom prophets. The world
didn't come to an end _ take that, Nostradamus _ and neither did
Sampras' now-record reign at Wimbledon. Take that, Andre.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' Fourth of July rockets practically set Agassi's baggy
britches ablaze in a final that was as un-American as it was
all-American. There was nothing patriotic, much less benevolent,
about the under-two-hour 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 Pistol-whipping Pete gave
his popular countryman. The only flag the fourth-seeded Agassi
waved when he left the greensward was white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give Pete full credit for the way he played,''
Agassi said. ``He played some impeccable tennis at the most
important times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was even good enough to amaze himself, no trivial feat
when you have been top-ranked in the world six years running,
prevailed at Wimbledon six times in seven summers and pulled into a
tie with Roy Emerson in the race for the most Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has 12, too, and because he's 27, it's probably going to
require the end of the world to prevent him from leaving Emerson _
and everyone else _ eating his dust. His six Wimbledon titles are
the most by anyone in the 20th century, and his match record here
since a semifinal loss to Goran Ivanisevic in 1992 is 46-1. Richard
Krajicek beat him in the quarters en route to the title in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete's achievements speak for themselves,'' Agassi said.
``Pete's accomplished more than anybody else, in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   A stubborn sort, though, the French Open champ who is one of
only five men to own a career Grand Slam added: ``I still expect
myself to beat him. I'm obviously looking forward to the U.S. Open.
We've had three Grand Slams and three different winners. Who's No.
1? The U.S. Open will tell that.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering how swimmingly Agassi had come through in Paris,
completing the aforementioned sweep of the Slams at Roland Garros,
and how brutally he had dismissed the two-time defending U.S. Open
champ, Patrick Rafter, a day earlier in the semis, Agassi found
legions of believers in his corner when he strode onto Centre
Court.
</P>
<P>
   If Lindsay Davenport could knock off Steffi Graf for the women's
title, Agassi could do likewise to Sampras. The pro-Agassi crowd
smelled another upset, especially when, at 3-3 in the first set,
Agassi got Sampras in a love-40 headlock. Tennis' consummate
counterpuncher had come out swinging. Sampras' response?
</P>
<P>
   Whack! Whack! Whack! Whack! Whaaack!
</P>
<P>
   Three break points saved, service held. Then, to prove he was
serious, Sampras broke Agassi in the next game, held for the first
set and began the second with another break. At love. After which
he really started smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the second set,'' Sampras said, ``I was on
fire. That was as well as I can play, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From 3-3, 0-40,'' Agassi said, shaking his head, ``six minutes
later I was down 6-3, 1-0 and a break. That's how Pete plays.
You've got to weather his storm. When you do, that's when he's
vulnerable. I had my opportunities, but his storm was too strong
today. I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras conceded it was his most impressive effort in a long
while, for which he gave Agassi, the new No. 1-ranked player in the
world despite the outcome, much of the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre brings out the best in me,'' he said. ``He elevates me
to a phenomenal level because I have so much respect for his game.
If I'm not at my best, it's a long day against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi is thought to have the best return of serve in the game,
but he had just one other break point in the match. Agassi got to
30-all six times, but as he said, ``If Pete didn't hit an ace on
the first serve, he'd hit his second one 109 (mph) or 111 and
sometimes 119 or 122.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking chances out there, and people think he's walking
on water until he starts missing a few of those. But today he
walked on water.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras averaged 110 mph on his second serves yet had only five
double faults. He aced Agassi 17 times. It was a remarkable
performance at a most opportune juncture, particularly because his
tennis hadn't been overly inspired lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``My serve sort of carried me to the title, as it has before,''
he said. ``I haven't played great, but once I step on that Centre
Court this atmosphere, playing Andre, it brought out the best in
me. I was going to enjoy myself out there. Who knows how many times
I'll play Andre in a big final?''
</P>
<P>
   Until the Wimbledon tuneup at Queen's Club, Sampras had not won
a tournament all year, skipping the Australian and bombing out
early, as usual, at Roland Garros. Also, many believe he wouldn't
have survived the Philippoussis onslaught, if the hulking
Australian hadn't gone down with a knee injury shortly after
winning their first set.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win any Slam, you have to have some good fortune,'' Sampras
said. ``Maybe that was the turning point for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to reflect on the enormity of the moment and its historic
ramifications, Sampras politely declined. He said he hadn't
digested much yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still spinning,'' he said. ``It's going to hit me over the
next couple days. It's hard to explain how I'm feeling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   A word he could have used was ``unbeatable.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The party of President Ernesto Zedillo won a broad
victory in an election Sunday for governor of the state of Mexico,
based on early returns, but the balloting was marred by charges of
vote-buying and polling place electioneering, mainly by the
governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The election amounted to a dress rehearsal for a watershed
presidential vote next July, which will be the most open and
competitive in Mexico's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Montiel Rojas, 55, the candidate of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won with 41 percent of
the vote while his closest rival, Jose Luis Duran Reveles, 38, of
the right-of-center National Action Party, came in with 35 percent,
according to projections announced by the Televisa network based on
early returns.
</P>
<P>
   A third candidate, from the left-of-center Party of the
Democratic Revolution, trailed with 24 percent, Televisa said, in
results corroborated by an early count by another network, TV
Azteca. The state elections council said turnout was about 49
percent of the eligible electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The election was being watched all over Mexico because the
breakdown of the parties' membership in the state of Mexico, the
most populous with 7.1 million registered voters, mirrors the
political configuration of the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are showing the way to the 2000 election,'' Maria Yolanda
Mejia Dominguez, a retired primary school teacher, said with pride
as she cast her vote Sunday in the state of Mexico's capital,
Toluca. The presidential race will be the most open and competitive
in Mexico's modern history.
</P>
<P>
   In another governor's race Sunday, in the western coastal state
of Nayarit, an unusually broad coalition of four opposition
parties, including the Democratic Revolution and National Action
parties, came together to face the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   The two elections will tell the opposition parties much about
whether one of them can win the presidency alone, or whether they
have to forge an alliance next year in order to beat the governing
party, which has won every presidential election in seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   Results from an exit poll by the Televisa network indicated that
the opposition coalition in Nayarit won with 54 percent of the
vote, to 44 percent for the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   In the state of Mexico, reports of questionable, if not illegal,
election day conduct by the governing party poured in to radio
stations and opposition party monitoring stations all day.
</P>
<P>
   In the huge township of Cuautitlan Izcalli, callers to a popular
radio station reported that governing party members had arrived at
one polling place with a suitcase full of cash and handed out about
$10 to some voters as they emerged from the polls. When opposition
poll watchers protested, they were told that the party members were
not giving out money but were taking up a collection for the local
Catholic charity.
</P>
<P>
   In a neighborhood of Ecatepec, a sprawling urban township with
more than 900,000 voters, governing party followers who were
assembled near a polling place worked a telephone list printed by
the local government, which is controlled by the party, of
residents on a street it had paved in the past few days. The party
members reminded the residents of the new asphalt and told them to
go vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multiply this by an order of 400, and you have what's going on
in Ecatepec today,'' said Jose Luis Gutierrez Cureno, a federal
congressman from the Party of the Democratic Revolution who was
monitoring the election in the township.
</P>
<P>
   In another Ecatepec precinct, the governing party organized a
rodeo in an empty lot next to a polling place, also offering voters
a free beer before they cast their ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Ecatepec, opposition-party election workers came
upon a house where the governing party was doling out toilet paper
and tuna fish to voters. When the opposition group tried to stop
the handouts, several city police officers chased away the
opposition contingent, arresting one person. The police were lead
by Jorge Hernandez Hernandez, a top official in the Ecatepec
municipal government, who punched one opposition member in the
face.
</P>
<P>
   In Naucalpan, where Duran, the National Action candidate, had
been the mayor, workers from the local telephone company, Telmex,
arrived Saturday evening with orders to change all the telephone
lines for the the party's elections headquarters, where it had its
vote-counting computers.
</P>
<P>
   After protests from party leaders, the telephone workers got the
lines running, but they all had new telephone numbers, ones that
were not known to party workers spread out across the state.
</P>
<P>
   In Chimalhuacan and Zumpango, two other large state of Mexico
townships, governing party workers handed out vouchers to some
voters as they left the polls, so they could collect bags of
cement, roofing materials and food. The National Action Party
complained that the governing party paid about $20 to some people
National Action had lined up as poll watchers so they would switch
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party also complained of irregularities. In
Toluca, the state capital, a National Action worker, Jesus
Alcantara, was detained by governing party poll watchers, who said
he was carrying a package, known in Mexican elections jargon as a
``taco,'' of ballots marked for his party.
</P>
<P>
   The clumsily shaped state of Mexico, draped around three sides
of the federal district of Mexico City, reflects the population and
economic makeup of the country. Teeming suburbs cluster at the
capital city's edge, built around an industrial belt. Yet much of
the state's income still comes from one-acre farms in inhospitable
sierras in the western part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In recent elections, the governing party has won about 38 per
cent of the vote, having lost about half of its voters since its
peak strength in the 1987 election for governor. National Action
has won at least 34 per cent of the vote, but several polls
indicated that it has battled the governing party to a tie in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Party of the Democratic Revolution, whose candidate is
Higinio Martinez Miranda, 43, suffered an embarrassing decline
during the campaign. It was largely because of negative fallout
from a vote in March for party president, which was annulled
because of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Mexico election, in which the three main candidates
laid out $23 million among them, is also a bellwether for the
lavish spending expected in the presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Nayarit, with 547,000 registered voters, has long been dominated
by the governing party. But the four opposition parties in the
coalition set aside their quarrels to back a candidate who had
recently defected from the governing party because it did not
nominate him for governor. The candidate, Antonio Echevarria
Dominguez, is a Coca-Cola bottling magnate who owns the bullring in
the state capital and was a veteran governing party ward healer.
</P>
<P>
   He is running against Jose Lucas Vallarta Robles, 67, also an
old-time governing party boss, but who is seen as having less vigor
than his opponent.

SPORTS COLUMN: METS ARE NOT COMPLYING WITH OLD TENET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On their treadmill to maybe missing the National
League wild-card berth again, the Mets keep falling to the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday night's finale with the Atlanta Braves, the Mets
had not only already lost the three-game weekend series at Shea
Stadium, they had also been blanked in the two previous games, 16-0
and 3-0. No runs, not enough hits and another error: losing more
ground to the Braves in the N.L. East.
</P>
<P>
   That was typical of the Mets late last season, and has been
again this season, whenever there's an occasion to rise to.
</P>
<P>
   One of baseball's oldest tenets for a good team is to win each
regular-season series, no matter who the opponent is, good or bad.
That has been Joe Torre's philosophy in measuring the Yankees for
two World Series rings in his three seasons as manager, just as it
was Earl Weaver's philosophy years ago when the Orioles dominated
the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that from the master,'' Don Baylor, who played for
Weaver and is now the Braves' hitting coach, was saying Sunday
night. ``If you play four, win three. If you play three, win two.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a special value to, say, winning the first two
games of a three-game series, as the Braves did over the weekend.
With two in the bag, a manager can choose to rest a regular in the
third. Another factor: Some pressure is off the team that won the
first two, more pressure is on the team that lost the first two.
</P>
<P>
   In their struggle to justify themselves as wild-card contenders,
the Mets have yet to learn the trick of winning the series that
make a difference in the standing, the trick of rising to the
occasion. And until they learn it, they will never be a contender
for a wild-card spot, much less a challenger for the division
title.
</P>
<P>
   With a chance for a wild-card berth last September, the Mets
lost their final five games _ two in Montreal, three in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, just one victory would have lifted the Mets into
a three-way playoff with the Cubs and Giants (the Cubs won a
playoff with the Giants). Two triumphs in the Mets' last five games
would have meant the first wild-card playoff berth in the Mets'
history. But they lost all five games.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Mets have had three occasions to rise to, but
they slipped and fell each time.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the Mets lost two to the Yankees before
salvaging the finale at Yankee Stadium, the first of 10 victories
in a span of 12 games before going to Atlanta for another occasion.
Yes, they won the opener of that series for 11 out of 13, narrowing
the Braves' division lead to two games, but they then lost the last
two games.
</P>
<P>
   After winning three of four in Florida, the Mets returned to
Shea for another occasion with the Braves, but fell flat.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets' four-game series with the Expos, which begins
Monday night at Shea, another occasion awaits them _ the Yankees'
three-game visit to Shea, starting Friday. Winning at least two
from the Yankees would seem to be imperative if the Mets are to
develop any confidence in themselves for the next occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Winning all the games they're supposed to win against lesser
teams is fine, but if they are to rise in the wild-card race, they
must consistently rise to the occasion against the division leaders
and the other wild-card contenders.
</P>
<P>
   And against the Yankees next weekend, the Mets must rise to the
occasion with Armando Benitez as their closer now that John Franco,
the left-hander with 19 saves, is on the disabled list with an
inflamed tendon on his middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's no different,'' Benitez said before Sunday
night's game. ``Everybody knows what he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Dominican right-hander has done, primarily as a setup
man for Franco, is appear in more games, 41 to 34, than Franco;
strike out 67 in 42 innings and earn three saves with a 1.50 ERA.
But his record is 0-2. ``For me, only the inning is different,''
said Benitez, the Orioles' closer last season. ``The ninth instead
of the eighth.''
</P>
<P>
   In their quest for the playoffs beyond the Yankee series, the
Mets must rise to at least 10 more occasions with division leaders
and wild-card contenders _ two series each with the Braves, Astros,
Pirates and Giants; one each with the Phillies and the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Mets hope to emerge as the wild-card winner, they
must win most of those series.

U.S. AND SCURRY BEAT BRAZIL AT ITS OWN GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ They had played two games in four days,
connected by a coast-to-coast flight. And when Sunday's Women's
World Cup semifinal ended, the exhausted American players were left
sprawling in the locker room, backs aching, happy for the 2-0
victory over Brazil, even happier for five days to recover for the
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   If this was a largely uninspired match, it was understandable.
Both teams had played quarterfinal matches on Thursday in suburban
Washington and on Sunday they were battling jet lag as much as each
other.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Americans did not fully have their legs, they did
have the endurance of midfielder Michelle Akers and the composed
goalkeeping of Briana Scurry to forge a convincing victory before a
star-spangled Fourth of July crowd of 73,123 at Stanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now advances to the World Cup final next
Saturday at the Rose Bowl against China, which defeated Norway by
5-0 in Sunday's other semifinal match in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   China is fast and technically skilled and has defeated the
Americans twice in three matches this year. But the United States
can be encouraged by the resourcefulness of having won three
consecutive games without a goal from the world's career leading
scorer in international play, Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   While Hamm appeared hesitant in one-on-one challenges on Sunday,
perhaps bothered by a nagging hamstring injury or a lapse of
confidence, she continued to run hard, to track back on defense and
to fire dangerous crosses into the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   And, with the Americans holding a tenuous 1-0 lead, she
cunningly produced a foul in the 80th minute, falling to the
ground, both hands extended like Superman about to save Metropolis,
after what appeared to be a less than vicious push by the Brazilian
defender Elane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no necessity for the refereeing to be that bad,''
said Wilson Oliveira Rica, the Brazilian coach. ``The United States
is a great team. They didn't need that kind of help. If that was
Brazil inside the 18-yard box, it would not be called.''
</P>
<P>
   Volunteering for the penalty kick was Akers, the original star
of this team, the most valuable player of the 1991 World Cup, who
continues to show amazing stamina despite battling chronic fatigue
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Akers played the entire 90 minutes Sunday, clearing a dangerous
cross in the first half, tying up the Brazilian star Sissi in
midfield, staying on the field after a nasty collision left her
with a goose egg on the back of her head and shaking off a raking
cleat from Sissi that caught her in the face. Akers took a couple
of eight counts, but remained in the game both times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived with my chronic illness so long, I've learned to
stuff it,'' Akers said of her pain.
</P>
<P>
   In the 80th minute, captain Carla Overbeck played a goal kick to
midfield and Akers expertly headed it backward to a sprinting Hamm
on the left flank. When Hamm was taken down and the penalty kick
was awarded, Akers stood over the ball from 12 yards, like a
field-goal kicker waiting for the snap, took two confident steps
and punched the ball inside the right post for a 2-0 American lead
that finally provided security on an uncertain afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Yeah, baby, give me that,''' said Akers, who also
scored a crucial penalty kick during the 1996 Summer Olympics.
``Those are the moments you live for. It's a scenario I've been
practicing every day for the last couple of months. The only thing
on my mind was `Where do I put it?'''

<P>
   The American defense had been instructed by coach Tony DiCicco
not to commit fouls near the penalty area, thus depriving Sissi,
the World Cup's leading scorer with seven goals, of her specialty _
the free kick. ``She was my girl,'' Akers said. ``I wasn't going to
let her score.''
</P>
<P>
   When Brazil did breach the penalty area, Scurry fended it off
with gymnastic goalkeeping, pitching her third shutout in five
World Cup matches and 52nd career shutout in 95 international
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``She proved she's the best keeper in the World Cup,'' DiCicco
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry punched away a point-blank shot in the 30th minute,
pushed a floater over the crossbar in the 46th minute and laid
herself out like a shortstop 10 minutes later, making a diving save
of a low blast by Nene. Afterward, her teammates sprinted toward
her and jumped into her arms in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be the best game I ever played,'' Scurry said.
``Any game when I can do my part and get my team into the final of
the World Cup is my best game.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco had considered benching forward Cindy Parlow in favor of
the more vibrant Shannon MacMillan, but he resisted, and on Sunday
his decision paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans scored an early goal, instead of giving one up, as
they had in previous games. In the fifth minute, Julie Foudy lifted
a cross from the left flank that was fumbled by Maravilha, the
Brazilian goalkeeper. It is a vulnerability the Americans had
spotted in previous matches. Parlow charged the goal, and before
the ball could hit the ground, she flicked it with her head into
the net for a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gave our whole team confidence,'' Parlow said. ``We
had been behind in the early part of two games. Getting ahead early
gave us confidence and let us relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing is exactly what the fatigued American players plan to
do in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play better,'' Hamm said. ``This is not the type of
game we wanted to play, but it got the job done. In the final, we
have to play our best. That's as simple as I can make it.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   It was late at night after a disappointing Yankees loss, and an
emotionally charged crowd poured onto a downtown No. 4 train. A
woman who had been on the train before the fans filled it, upset at
the sudden influx of people, exclaimed, ``It's like a herd of
animals in here!''
</P>
<P>
   Within a matter of seconds, the entire car of about 100 riders
burst into a cacophony of moos, neighs, oinks, baas,
cock-a-doodle-doos and any other farm-animal sound imaginable. This
went on for about 30 seconds. The fans' stress had been released,
and the woman had learned a lesson: Don't mess with Yankees fans.

   My friend Kevin and I were strolling down Madison Avenue on a
lovely warm Sunday evening. The city was exceptionally peaceful,
and he and I were quietly shopping and enjoying the last precious
hours of the weekend. We were facing downtown, with our backs to
the setting sun. Suddenly we heard ``Excuse me,'' and turning
around, we saw a handsome, well-dressed middle-aged man. ``Yes,''
we replied, probably sounding a little confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you happen to notice the beautiful sky behind you?'' he
asked. ``It's amazing, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   We looked up Madison and saw the illuminated orange-red-purple
sky. It was simply lovely. The three of us stood for a moment, just
admiring the view, and then he broke the silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky was so beautiful, I just wanted to share it with
somebody,'' he said. ``Enjoy the rest of your evening.''
</P>
<P>
   We thanked him, looked at each other, smiled and continued our
strolling. The lovely man said it all. New Yorkers are wonderful.

   An article in a recent issue of The New York Times about a
hairdresser who was accused of discriminating because he refused to
cut the hair of older women brought back memories of an experience
with that same hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   I had an appointment to meet my husband, and my hair definitely
needed work. A young colleague told me of ``a great hairdresser''
who was a bargain as well. I made an appointment. I was greeted at
the door with the question ``Didn't you know that I don't cut the
hair of anyone over 25?''
</P>
<P>
   I was ready to walk, but it was a really bad hair day, so I
said, ``Well, you can make me look 25 years younger.'' He cut my
hair.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I told my 27-year-old daughter what I had done, and I
knew she would say: ``Mom, how could you? You should have reported
him.'' She did say that, and then paused. ``But was it a good
cut?'' she asked. ``Maybe I'll go to him first.''

TIME'S CLOSE LOOK AT CORPORATE TAX BENEFITS  
 TNN JUMPS INTO THE RING  
 RETURN TO SAVANNAH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least no one can say there was no warning. Last November, in
the first part of an award-winning series on corporate tax benefits
by Donald Barlett and James Steele, Time Magazine published a
related article about various tax benefits that were granted to its
parent corporation, Time Warner Inc. The article, detailing tax
breaks worth about $2.4 million, ran under the headline ``We Play
the Game Too.''
</P>
<P>
   And play it and play it. New York City's government last week
gave Time Warner its second windfall of the year. This one was
worth $28 million and specifically benefits the company's
publishing division, which is expanding and renovating its offices
on the Avenue of the Americas between West 50th and 51st Streets.
Earlier this year, City Hall granted an $11 million tax break to
HBO, another Time Warner division, when it said it would renew its
lease at West 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Steele does not seem to be raising eyebrows at the deal. Asked
about the practice-what-you-preach aspects of the situation, he
said, ``The point we made in the series was that, as long as
governments are making these available, corporations will seek
them. Until an overall policy exists, in which one state can't raid
another's jobs or one city can't raid another, this is going to go
on.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the most important thing a media corporation has
to do is ``at least write about these things.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's managing editor, Walter Isaacson, said, ``I think
corporate welfare is silly in all its guises.'' He added: ``We
write about the corporation. We don't speak for the corporation.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Costiglio, who does speak for Time Inc., said of the tax
breaks, ``The executives who run the company try always to act in
the best interest of the company _ this would be a case of that.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of other media companies have received tax benefits in
the city in recent years, including New York Times Co., News Corp.,
Bertelsmann AG, Viacom Inc. and NBC.

   More Mock Mayhem
</P>
<P>
   How much more popular can professional wrestling get? A
mainstream (if audience-starved) broadcast network, UPN, has
already decided to embrace the mock mayhem on Thursday nights in
the fall, scheduling two hours of ``WWF Smackdown.'' Now elbowing
its way into the fray is TNN, the Nashville Network, which last
week announced a three-year deal with an outfit called Extreme
Championship Wrestling for an hourlong show on Friday nights.
</P>
<P>
   TNN may be the network of ``Grand Ol' Opry,'' rodeo and fishing
shows, but it also has NASCAR automobile races and ``Rollerjam,'' a
late-'90s version of Roller Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have dual audiences, basically female Monday to Thursday,
and basically male on weekends,'' said David Hall, president of TNN
and CMT, Country Music Television, both owned by CBS Cable. ``With
`Rollerjam' on Friday nights, we found we could attract a young
male audience, and they'd hang around for `Motor Madness,' which is
tractors and trucks and stuff like that,'' at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   That young male audience _ so particularly desired by
advertisers _ is driving the wrestling phenomenon. But it is not
for men only. The World Wrestling Federation's two Monday-night
hours on the USA Network earned 26 of the top 30 rankings on the
Nielsen list of most-watched shows among all basic cable networks
for the second quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   On its lowest-rated night, the WWF show attracted 4.1 million
households; on its highest, 6.4 million households tuned in. And
the competition, TNT's ``WCW Monday Nitro Live,'' draws between 2.7
million and 3.5 million households each Monday, as well.
</P>
<P>
   USA Network also has a Sunday-night show. Now UPN is adding its
Thursday show, and TNN a Friday show.
</P>
<P>
   If the WWF and WCW are the major leagues of wrestling, ECW is a
sort of Triple-A league, staging live wrestling events in small
arenas and televising a handful each year on a pay-per-view basis.
It has a reputation for being a training ground for WWF and WCW
performers _ and for encouraging even wilder physical violence.
</P>
<P>
   The TNN show starts on Aug. 27 and will run at 8 p.m. Fridays,
preceding ``Rollerjam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the not-very-pleasant stuff going on outside the ring
will not be part of our show,'' Hall said, ``because this ECW is
such an athletic approach to wrestling, your story lines don't have
to get into whose dating who.''

   City's Mystique Seduces a Publisher Again
</P>
<P>
   The Southern charm of Savannah, Ga. _ a crucial character in the
best seller ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' _ has
seduced a New York publisher once again. St. Martin's Press is
paying a six-figure advance for a previously published first novel
set in the balmy coastal city by a native son who tirelessly
promoted his work with Rotary Club appearances and articles in
``Podiatry Today.''
</P>
<P>
   William Harris Jr., a podiatrist for almost 25 years and the son
of a former sheriff of Chatham County, Ga., is the first to
acknowledge that the early success for ``Delirium of the Brave''
comes on the pages of a perennial best seller known simply in
Savannah as The Book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that there's any denying that `Midnight in the
Garden of Good and Evil' has put such a spotlight on Savannah and
that because of that any book of this caliber would stir up some
interest,'' said Harris, 52, in a telephone interview from his
medical office in Savannah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delirium,'' which was originally published by a small Savannah
publisher, Frederic Beil, is a Southern saga that follows four
generations of an Irish-Catholic family and a black family through
their clashes with the Chatham County power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Like John Berendt's ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,''
the plot pivots on a murder of a homosexual _ in this case a serial
killer who distributes body parts in brown paper bags.
</P>
<P>
   But while Midnight was a nonfiction work that stretched the
facts in fictional ways, ``Delirium'' is billed as fiction with
firm roots in factual events, including the crimes of a paper bag
murderer who was captured in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Since the book was published last fall, the title has sold more
than 5,000 copies locally, which eventually attracted the interest
of an agent and large publishers who bid for the book in an auction
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Harris' new literary agent, Nancy Stauffer, said the writer
himself could be a Flannery O'Connor character. At the age of 19,
Harris stepped on a downed power line, and his legs had to be
amputated.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal with St. Martin's, which is owned by
Holtzbrinck GmbH, Harris is planning on writing a sequel to
``Delirium.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the foreseeable future his shingle will stay up in
Savannah while the fiction takes shape at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't quitting my day job real soon,'' joked Harris. ``But
who knows.''

CHINESE WOMEN ROUT NORWAY, 5-0; WILL PLAY U.S. FOR TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ The Chinese sent a clear message to the
Americans Sunday night with a 5-0 rout of Norway that sends them
into the championship game of the Women's World Cup against the
United States. The Chinese were vastly superior in all aspects of
the game in eliminating Norway, the defending World Cup champion,
and ending its 10-game winning streak in the tournament, going back
to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   China has defeated the Americans twice this year, in Portugal in
March and in New Jersey in April. Coach Per-Mathias Hogmo of Norway
was so impressed by the Chinese after Sunday night's game that he
called them the best team in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ma Yuanan of China refused to make his team the favorite
against the Americans in Saturday's championship game, even after
Sunday night's remarkable performance. He was very careful in his
choice of words and said he hoped his team would play against the
Americans at the level it did on April 25, referring to China's 2-1
victory in a friendly at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will take one step at a time,'' Ma said, when asked about
his strategy for the game against the Americans in the Rose Bowl.
``But this is the best China has played in recent games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese came to the tournament with a high motivation to
reach the championship game after they were eliminated by Sweden in
the quarterfinals in the first Women's World Cup, in 1991 in China,
and then lost in the semifinals to Germany in 1995 in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest motivating factor for us is the solidarity and the
united effort of the team,'' Liu Ailing, who scored two goals, said
through an interpreter after the game when she acted as the team
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Wen also had two goals, with Fan Yunjie getting the other
goal. Sun's two goals gave her seven for the tournament and tied
her for the most goals with Brazil's Sissi. Sun has a chance to
capture the golden boot as the tournament's leading scorer in the
clash against the Americans in the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   China's play was flawless, especially on attack. The Chinese
front runners of Sun and Jin Yan were a constant threat. With help
from Liu, playing slightly behind the two strikers, the Chinese
showed plenty of variety in their play, often changing the point of
attack to exploit weaknesses in Norway's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal, three minutes after the opening kickoff, came on
a left-footed shot by Sun from near the penalty spot after Jin's
shot was knocked down by Bente Nordby, the goalkeeper. The goal was
the culmination of a play that developed on the left side of the
attack with a precision pass into the middle by Liu.
</P>
<P>
   China's second goal came in the 14th minute on a blistering shot
by Liu to the upper right corner from the arc on top of the penalty
area after a play that started with a corner kick from the right
side.
</P>
<P>
   Sun and Liu Ying had marvelous opportunities to extend China's
lead, but their shots sailed over the bar from good position inside
the penalty area. It was the goalkeeping of Nordby that kept the
Norwegians within 2-0 at the half. There was little Nordby could do
on Liu Ailing's goal, in the 51st minute, when Liu collected a
loose ball after a corner kick from the left and rocketed a
left-footed shot from 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   China's three goals in 51 minutes equaled the total Norway had
allowed in four games before Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   China's rendezvous with the Americans was secured in the 65th
minute, when Fan sprinted all the way from her defensive position
to get behind Norway's defense to put China ahead by 4-0 from close
range. Sun scored her second of the night, on a penalty kick in the
72nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   Hogmo tried everything, even replacing a couple of key players
whom the Chinese had neutralized, but nothing worked. The
Norwegians had two decent opportunities after China's third goal,
but Gao Hong, the Chinese goalkeeper, showed tremendous quickness
in recording the shutout.

CLEMENS LOSES HIS ZIP, AND YANKEES GET ZAPPED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Scientists have documented global warming in this
century, but nobody needed to tell the Texan Roger Clemens that it
was panhandle-hot at Yankee Stadium on Sunday. Clemens returned to
the Yankees' dugout after pitching another inning in the thick heat
and said drolly, ``I think they just dumped a pail of water on the
rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' sauna analogy was appropriate. The humidity was
stifling and the temperature was 89 degrees when the game started,
and when the sun came out in the early innings, players and umpires
baked.
</P>
<P>
   But even after a devastating week of blown victories, and in the
throes of a losing streak that has likely choked off their playoff
aspirations, the Orioles did not wilt. B.J. Surhoff launched a
grand slam off Ramiro Mendoza to cap a six-run rally in the seventh
inning as the Orioles beat the Yankees, 7-3, before 37,046.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff is a candidate for the American League All-Star team
that will be filled out with reserves picked, in part, by Yankee
manager Joe Torre. Maybe Surhoff's All-Star chances would have been
better, Torre joked later, if he had ``hit into a double play.''
Baltimore's victory was its first after 10 consecutive losses.
</P>
<P>
   Making his 14th start for the Yankees, Clemens returned to the
air-conditioned clubhouse after each half-inning, changed his shirt
and drank water and other liquids to keep himself hydrated.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Orioles' hitters battled him and extended the
counts in the early innings, Clemens was doomed to an early
departure; it was just too hot to expect anyone to last long with
that workload, Torre mused later.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens threw 83 pitches in the first four innings, more than 20
pitches per inning. When Clemens breezed through the middle of the
Baltimore lineup in the sixth while needing only seven pitches, the
Yankees' coaching staff hoped Clemens might be able to pitch into
the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees leading, 3-1, Jeff Conine doubled to open the
Orioles' seventh, and Clemens hustled to back up third for a
possible play there. Whew. Cal Ripken hit Clemens' next pitch into
short center field for another hit, and Clemens moved to back up
home plate as Conine scored. Whew.
</P>
<P>
   Those two short sprints, coupled with his mounting pitch count,
sucked the breath out of Clemens, and catcher Jorge Posada and the
pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, went to the mound and lingered,
giving Clemens a chance to recover.
</P>
<P>
   But there was not enough time. After the rookie Jerry Hairston
flied to deep left, Torre replaced Clemens with Mendoza. ``The
pitch count,'' Torre said, ``was as much of an issue as the heat
was for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The first batter Mendoza faced was Mike Figga, the reserve
catcher who was placed on waivers by the Yankees last month without
having taken an at-bat for them this year. Mendoza's first
sinkerball to Figga did not sink, and Figga banged it over the head
of center fielder Bernie Williams; Ripken stopped at third.
</P>
<P>
   After Brady Anderson was walked intentionally, Mike Bordick
singled to right, scoring Ripken with the tying run. Mendoza threw
a fastball for ball one to Surhoff, then came back with a changeup,
and Surhoff reached out, his weight on his front foot, and flicked
his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Torre thought Surhoff's fly ball to right would be caught for a
sacrifice fly. Mendoza was sure of this, too, as was Derek Jeter.
But the ball kept going, and Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right
fielder, reached for the wall and looked up _ grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   As Surhoff rounded the bases, the third base umpire, Larry
Barnett, moved to check on the condition of the home-plate umpire,
Greg Kosc, and Barnett called for the Yankees' trainer, Gene
Monahan. Kosc had been sweating a lot all day _ the front of his
shirt and pants were soaked _ and early in the game he had begun
curling cold towels around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   When Monahan reached Kosc, he waved smelling salts under the
umpire's nose; Kosc's head bobbed, his eyes bulged, his face was
pale, and soon Kosc's arms dangled over the shoulders of Barnett
and Monahan, like a human yoke, and he was led off the field.
</P>
<P>
   He was hospitalized for heat exhaustion and dehydration and was
replaced behind home plate by the second-base umpire, Ed Hickox.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Yankees had been griping openly with Kosc on his
ball-and-strike calls in the previous two innings, particularly
Posada, who seethed after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Posada said that after he was called out on strikes by Kosc in
the sixth, he turned to the umpire and told him he was being
inconsistent with his strike zone. ``He hasn't called it all day,
and all of a sudden, he's going to expand it because it's hot,''
said Posada, before expanding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line, the guys are not in shape,'' Posada
continued, referring to umpires. ``It was hot _ I can understand
it's hot. You've got to be able to go through the game. They're not
prepared, they're not in shape; it's a shame. He gets hot, the zone
gets bigger. One doesn't go with the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   The American League president, Gene Budig, who watched the game
on television at his New Jersey home, said of Kosc: ``Greg passed
the required physical examination. He is a weight lifter.''

COMMENTARY: FASTER, BUT IS IT DEADLIER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you are lucky enough on this holiday to find
yourself in traffic moving more than 55 mph, you might contemplate
a surprising fact: You are not dead.
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a surprise to you, but it is to some people in
Washington who consider themselves experts on highway safety. In
1995, when Congress voted to repeal the national 55-mph speed
limit, they predicted carnage on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Claybrook, the president of Public Citizen, an advocacy
group, called the bill ``a death sentence to thousands of
Americans.'' As President Clinton prepared to sign the bill, the
consumer advocate Ralph Nader prophesied, ``History will never
forgive him and his allies in Congress for this assault on the
sanctity of human life.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Stone, president of the Advocates for Highway and Auto
Safety, went on the NBC program ``Today'' to predict ``6,400 added
highway fatalities a year and millions of more injuries.'' That
figure of 6,400 more deaths each year, which Ms. Stone's group took
from a worst-case estimate of a Department of Transportation study,
was repeatedly cited by journalists and dozens of advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the massacre has been avoided. Driving has
actually become safer despite the higher speed limits adopted in
most states. In 1995, the final year of the national speed limit,
41,817 people died on American roads; last year there were 337
fewer deaths, even though Americans drove more miles. The fatality
rate per mile has declined 11 percent since 1995, and is now at an
all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   The national speed limit, imposed in 1974 to conserve energy,
never saved much oil but survived thanks to claims that it saved
lives. After being modified in 1987 to allow 65-mph speeds on some
rural freeways, it was eliminated by the 1995 law allowing the
states to set their own limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety and consumer groups warned us in 1995 that there'd
be blood on the highway and soaring premiums for car insurance,''
said Stephen Moore, the director of fiscal studies at the Cato
Institute, a libertarian policy group. ``But since then the
fatality rate has dropped steadily, and insurance premiums have
actually fallen, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The prophets now say they were misunderstood. ``We were
predicting a worst-case scenario,'' Ms. Stone said, ``if all the
states changed their laws on all the potential roads, including the
dangerous secondary roads. Fortunately, most states didn't do
that.'' That's true _ but then there was never any reason to assume
that the entire country would become stupidly reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Local politicians (and local drivers) generally know a little
about local road conditions. Even without guidance from the experts
in Washington, legislators in northeastern states figured out that
the 70- and 75-mph limits set in places like Wyoming might not work
in congested urban areas. In New York, New Jersey and Connecticut,
the top speed limit is 65, and it applies on only a few highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prediction of 6,400 deaths was never very realistic,''
said Julie Rochman, the spokeswoman for the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety, which recently analyzed accident rates on the roads
where the speed limit was raised. It concluded that the higher
limits led to a higher fatality rate resulting in about 500
additional deaths per year.
</P>
<P>
   Even that estimate may be too high, according to Moore's new
study for the Cato Institute. He found that the overall highway
fatality rate has been declining nearly as fast in states with
raised speed limits as in states with unchanged limits. How, if
there are extra deaths on the higher-speed roads, could the overall
death toll still be falling in those states?
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation is that extra deaths are more than
offset by the lives saved by other safety measures like seat belts,
air bags, better-engineered cars and laws against drunken driving.
But Moore prefers another explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can go 70 or 75 miles an hour on an Interstate,'' he
said, ``you're more likely to take it than a secondary road that's
a shorter route. So even if a few more people die on the
Interstates because of higher speeds, there are fewer deaths
overall because drivers are being diverted from two-lane roads to
much safer six-lane roads.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if you assume the worst, that the higher speed limits
are killing a few hundred Americans annually, those losses have to
be balanced against the time that drivers are saving: 400 million
hours annually, by Moore's calculations, which works out to about
600 lifetimes spent outside a car. That might not seem like a bad
bargain, especially to anyone sitting in traffic today.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ It might be a final spasm, the last gasp from
a dying patient.
</P>
<P>
   American tennis isn't healed, by any means, certainly when you
see how bereft of future male champions our junior ranks appear.
But for one golden throwback summer, at least, tennis is strolling
proudly through the garden again, taking the sun.
</P>
<P>
   For now, golf is the straggler, tagging along well to the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Maria Olazabal's winning another Masters and Payne
Stewart's winning another U.S. Open _ I don't care how dramatically
he did it _ do not compare to Andre Agassi coming from two sets
down in the French Open final, then having Agassi go
Swoosh-on-Swoosh against Pete Sampras in a Yankee Doodle dandy of a
Fourth of July Wimbledon crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   True, the match proved a tad anticlimactic, a one-horse race.
Sampras, inarguably the King of Centre Court, had too much serve
for Agassi's vaunted return. Hence, he won his sixth Wimbledon in
seven years with a brutally efficient straight-sets victory that
made a mockery of Agassi's computer glitch of a No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel very much like No. 1 right now,'' Andre said
sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Day fireworks he had promised amounted, on his
part, to no more than a sparkler or two, but watching Sampras'
unabashed 6-3, 6-4, 7-5 excellence rewarded would be enough of a
thrill by its lonesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have played any better,'' Sampras said, saying a
lot. ``That's probably the best I've played in many years. I mean,
plain and simple, I was hitting the ball clean from the backcourt
and serving big at all the right times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andre brings out the best in me. No question, he elevates my
game to a phenomenal level.''
</P>
<P>
   A word that also describes his career achievements. Pistol
Pete's 12th Grand Slam title tied Roy Emerson's all-time record.
Sampras' Wimbledon total stands unmatched during the modern era,
which is the only era worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with Lindsay Davenport's women's championship, ending
Steffi Graf's for-the-ages Wimbledon career, it made for as
smashing (pardon the pun) a day in tennis as the United States has
experienced in at least 15 years, or since John McEnroe and Martina
Navratilova last pulled off the same all-American sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Factor in the guaranteed rowdy, rip-roaring U.S.-Australia Davis
Cup tie at historic Longwood in a couple of weeks, an affair that
commemorates the 100th anniversary of the competition and pairs the
two nations with the proudest Cup traditions, and you have a tennis
interlude for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   A zenith, even. The age of McEnroe, Connors and Borg never
produced a more concentrated dose of high-drama, high-octane tennis
than we've seen since Agassi began his entrancing, unexpected run
through Roland Garros. In Paris, he completed the first career Slam
since Emerson in the mid-1960s joined the exclusive company of Fred
Perry, Don Budge and Rod Laver.
</P>
<P>
   With Andre, now there are five of them.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this explosion of history-making will have kids _ never
mind their paunchy, aging baby-boomer parents _ streaming from
their houses, rackets in hand, to create another tennis power surge
remains to be seen. But the sport has at least regained a toehold
in the American consciousness after interest levels had ebbed to
distressing lows, certainly in regard to the dreary,
European-dominated _ Sampras excepted _ men's game.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Carlos Moya and Marcelo Rios, three
pretenders who have intruded of late on Pete's mountaintop turf,
are virtually unknown to Bubba on Main Street. Even Boris Becker
and Stefan Edberg before them, although huge talents, captured at
best cult followings as tennis drifted into minor-sport territory,
closer to cricket and curling than to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I'm told people in bars Saturday night were arguing the
relative merits of the Sampras serve vs. the Agassi return, and
debating the two Yanks' merits as athletes and entertainers.
Everybody loves a showdown, a high-noon shootout between two
superstar gunslingers, something golf is ill-designed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   And rarely does.
</P>
<P>
   Golf will need Tiger Woods and David Duval to be even turning
the corner in the final twosome at the British Open at Carnoustie
or the PGA at Medinah to equal what Wimbledon gave us Sunday with
the whopper one-two punch of Sampras-Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Graf-Davenport, not to slight the women, made for a formidable
undercard, too. Everywhere we turned, history was sprouting. Will
it help launch an all-out renaissance?
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know,'' Sampras said, ``is this was one great day for
American tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the greatest.
