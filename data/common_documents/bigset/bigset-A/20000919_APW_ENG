U.S. Hopes To Salvage Mideast Peace Process
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A high-ranking Palestinian official said Monday that a U.S.
team was working on a position paper aimed at salvaging the Mideast peace deal,
which stalled over the sovereignty of a key Jerusalem shrine. Palestinian
negotiator Nabil Shaath, in the United States for consultations on the peace
process, said the paper would probably be completed by the end of this week.
Also in New York, Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said the Clinton
administration was expected to ''assess'' the status of the peace process after
separate talks this week with Palestinian and Israeli negotiators.

U.S., North Korea To Resume Talks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and North Korea, in another step toward
a smoother relationship, have agreed to resume talks on three key issues --
missile proliferation, nuclear weapons and terrorism -- next week, a senior U.S.
official said Monday. From the U.S. standpoint, while North Korea recently said
it would suspend its tests of long-range missiles in exchange for an easing of
U.S. sanctions, the talks beginning Sept. 27 in New York are designed to halt
the spread of North Korean technology to Iran, Iraq and Pakistan.

Peru Justice Minister: Spymaster Not Detained
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante denied reports
Monday that the nation's shadowy intelligence chief has been detained, saying
the military was not holding the vilified and powerful figure who is at the
center of a political scandal. Earlier Monday, independent radio station CPN
reported that spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos had been detained on orders of the
commander of Peru's armed forces. Then, a lawyer who claimed he represented
Montesinos' sister alleged that her brother was being detained at the
headquarters of the National Intelligence Service.

Hostages Spotted in Philippines
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Government troops pursuing Muslim rebels
through a southern Philippine jungle to rescue 19 hostages have reported the
first sightings of some of the captives, an official said Tuesday. Some Abu
Sayyaf rebels fled to the coastlines of small Jolo island in an attempt to
escape, officials said. The rebels are believed to have bought speedboats with
some of the more than $15 million ransom they reportedly received from Libya and
Malaysia for freeing other hostages.

   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Three gangs of armed gunmen broke into three jails
in separate incidents, freeing more than 200 inmates, many of them convicted and
suspected drug traffickers, officials said Monday. Ten men wearing masks and
armed with automatic weapons Sunday night stormed the jail in the city of
Sumare, about 80 miles northwest of Sao Paulo, and after ''overpowering and
pistol-whipping two guards, freed 91 inmates,'' inspector Paulo Roberto
Rodrigues said by phone. Six inmates had been recaptured so far.

this village north of the Arctic Circle. It went into the tundra and did not hit

Department. The six survivors were taken by helicopter to hospitals in Barrow,
Fairbanks and Anchorage, Carr said. The identities of those killed were being

<HEADLINE> Decision on appeal in Iran Spy Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An Iranian appeals court will announce a
decision by Thursday on the appeals of 10 Jews convicted and
sentenced to jail on charges of spying for Israel, state-run radio
reported Monday night, quoting a senior judiciary official.
</P>
<P>
   Hossein Ali Amiri, the judiciary chief of southern Fars province
where the men were tried, said on Iranian radio that the decision
was to be released by Thursday at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Amiri did not say whether the three-judge panel had resolved
differences of opinion that twice have resulted in postponements of
announcement dates.
</P>
<P>
   Judges have had trouble agreeing on whether all the charges that
resulted in convictions constituted crimes, according to Amiri. The
main charges on which a lower court convicted the 10 were
espionage, cooperating with the Zionist regime and participation in
an illegal group. Defense lawyers had argued during the trial that
there is no definition of or punishment for espionage under Iranian
law.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 were convicted July 1 and sentenced to prison terms of
four to 13 years. Three others were acquitted. The case has
attracted international scrutiny, with critics questioning whether
the closed-door trial was fair; there was no jury and the judge
also acted as prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the appeals court was to have announced a decision
by Aug. 21.

<HEADLINE> $80 Million Given to Smithsonian  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of the country's wealthiest entrepreneurs
is giving $80 million to refurbish the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   The gift, from West Coast developer Kenneth E. Behring, will be
announced Tuesday, The Washington Post reported. Behring also gave
the Smithsonian $20 million three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Behring's money does not come with directions on how it is to be
used. But the 72-year-old college dropout who started his career as
a used-car salesman said he hopes it helps the Smithsonian depict
the pursuit of the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''The museum should talk about who we are,'' Behring told the
Post. ''Sometimes it is easy to forget how we started, who made the
country. I hope we can put something here to inspire people to
chase the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence M. Small, secretary of the Smithsonian, said ''Behring
Center'' will be added to the name of the museum at the front of
the building, which opened in 1964 and houses the original
Star-Spangled Banner, Edison's light bulb and other American
artifacts.

<HEADLINE> Drug-Ousted Romanian Disappears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Traian Ciharean, one of two Romanian
weightlifters banned from the Olympics after testing positive from
steroids, is missing after refusing a plane trip home.
</P>
<P>
   Following the positive test, Ciharean was ordered to leave the
Olympic Village and turn in his Olympic accreditation. He then
refused the Romanian Olympic Committee's offer of a trip home and
disappeared after leaving the village.
</P>
<P>
   Because Ciharean presumably is in Australia under a visa granted
those accredited for the games, it is uncertain if he could legally
stay in Australia without his Olympic credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were working on his ticket to go home and he refused to
take it and left his badge,'' said Alex Epuran, a spokesman for the
Romanian Olympic Committee. ''We reported it to the Olympic Village
police, as we were requested to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Epuran said Romanian officials had not been in contact with
Ciharean since he left the Olympic Village on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Romanian delegation was concerned for Ciharean's
safety, Epuran said, ''He's out of our delegation. He's out of the
village. He's not our concern anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ciharean was banned for life by the International Weightlifting
Federation after testing positive for anabolic steroids for a
second time. Adrian Mateas, who also tested positive, was suspended
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Because another Romanian lifter tested positive earlier this
year, Romania came under the IWF's three-strike rule and was barred
from the Olympics and all international competition for the rest of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite initial objections by the International Olympic
Committee, Romania paid a $50,000 fine to the IWF and was
readmitted to the games. IOC officials finally agreed with the IWF
following a series of meetings Monday that it was unfair to ban
lifters who tested clean and were ready to compete.

<HEADLINE> Women's Shooting: Rhode Wins Bronze  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Kim Rhode came into this year's double
trap with two Olympic records. She left with just a bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode scored 139 points Tuesday (Monday night EDT) to finish
third behind Pia Hansen of Sweden and Deborah Gelisio of Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very happy to come away with a medal,'' the 21-year-old
shooter from El Monte, Calif., said.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, with 148 points -- 112 in qualifying -- broke Rhode's
marks set at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''She shot awesome today,'' Rhode said.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after winning his first gold medal, Tanyu Kiriakov
of Bulgaria added a second, this time in the men's 50-meter pistol
competition at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriakov, a gold medalist in the 10-meter air pistol at the
Seoul Games in 1988, won the 50-meter event with 666 points.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Basinsky of Belarus won the silver and Martin Tenk of the
Czech Republic the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode, a three-time World Cup champion, is also entered in
Thursday's skeet competition. She advanced to the eight-woman
double trap final, by scoring 103 points in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Basinsky, who won the gold at this year's Atlanta World Cup
event, defended the silver medal he won at the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Kiriakov entered the eight-man final on top with 570 points. He
scored more that 10 points in five of the 10 rounds in the final to
hold off Basinsky, who scored 663.3.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Yifu of China, the current world champion, finished sixth
with 659.0 points. Wang was the 10-meter air pistol silver medalist
in these games. Atlanta gold medalist Boris Kokorev of Russia
failed to reach the finals. He scored 559 points and finished in a
12th-place tie.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Demarest, the event's world record-holder from Mission
Viejo, Calif., scored 552 points and placed 23rd. Demarest set a
finals record of 676.2 at this year's Milan World Cup, breaking
Kiriakov's previous record mark of 675.3.

<HEADLINE> Freeman Feels Honored at Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Cathy Freeman says her selection to
light the flame for the Sydney Olympics was ''a tremendous honor
for the aboriginal people,'' yet she realizes not all Australians
were pleased by the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, in her first news conference since being surrounded by
flames and cascading water last week as she kindled the cauldron,
said choosing an indigenous Australian for that role was a thrill
for many people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of people got a kick out of me lighting the
flame,'' she said Tuesday (Monday night EDT). ''It was a tremendous
honor for the aboriginal people.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia's original inhabitants, Aborigines now are a troubled
minority of 386,000 mostly impoverished people. They are beset by
substance abuse, poor health, little education and crime.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is an inspiration and a source of pride for her fellow
Aborigines, as well as a powerful spokeswoman for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Many indigenous Australians say it was a defining moment in
their lives when Freeman took a victory lap with the aboriginal
flag after winning the 400 meters at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   After being publicly rebuked by team officials for that display,
Freeman went out and won the 200 meters -- and again paraded with
the red, yellow and black flag.
</P>
<P>
   And her outspokenness on aboriginal issues has made her even
more of a hero to indigenous people.
</P>
<P>
   In July, she accused Australian leaders of insensitivity for
refusing to apologize for government policies that forced the
removal of about 100,000 aboriginal children from their homes from
1910 until the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman stayed away from any overt political statements at the
news conference and warned that ''people choose to use me as a
symbol for all sorts of causes,'' but made it clear her selection
to light the flame was a potent symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, the overwhelming favorite at Sydney to win the 400
meters and become the first aboriginal person to capture an
individual Olympic gold medal, first learned of her selection to
light the flame when Australian Olympic Committee president John
Coates met with her a few months ago at an Italian restaurant in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I was shocked and numbed and I was totally blown
away. How could I say no?'' she said. ''I was very, very honored.
Very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman was so excited after lighting the cauldron Friday that
she couldn't fall asleep until the middle of the night. While she
was waiting for the torch, she said she became worried about how
people would react to her selection.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I got the flame I was very embarrassed. I was thinking
about what all the people were going to think about Cathy Freeman
lighting the torch. I tend to think about the negative things,''
she said. ''You can't please everybody. Everybody has different
views.''
</P>
<P>
   But Freeman said those doubts disappeared when she was handed
the torch by former Olympic hurdling champion Debbie Flintoff-King
and the 110,000 people in the Olympic Stadium cheered wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the negatives went out of my head,'' she said. ''I felt
the absolute energy and emotion coming from all the people in the
stadium.''

<HEADLINE> Rafter Defeats Spadea at Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- American Vince Spadea blew an overhead
on set point, and that was the only break Australian Pat Rafter
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter survived a tough first set Tuesday (Monday night EDT) in
the opening round at the Olympics and delighted a partisan crowd by
handing Spadea his latest loss in a miserable year, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Spadea fell to 2-25 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the Olympics,'' he said. ''I'm able to say I competed and
was able to live out a dream. That's more special than worrying
about how the year went.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. men, who are without Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi,
started 0-2. Todd Martin made his Olympic debut at age 30 and lost
to Rainer Schuttler of Germany 6-2, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty long way to come for 14 games,'' Martin said.
''I wouldn't say I played terribly. It's just that he outplayed me
point after point.''
</P>
<P>
   American Monica Seles played the opening match on center court
and beat Katalin Marosi-Aracama of Hungary 6-0, 6-1 in 48 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Spadea made the Olympics only because Agassi withdrew and three
other Americans turned down a chance to play. He hung with Rafter
until losing his serve in the final game of the first set, hitting
three errant volleys and then whacking an easy overhead two feet
wide on set point.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the kind of shot I have to make to win big matches,''
Spadea said. ''I didn't break his serve the whole match, which is
disappointing because my return is something I rely on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, urged on by chants of ''Aussie, Aussie, Aussie'' from
the center court crowd, dominated at the net with his typically
acrobatic play. He won the first seven points of the second set and
raced to a 3-0 lead as Spadea's frustration mounted.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 5-2, Spadea slammed his racket to the
court. Six points later, he was out of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   His loss leaves the Americans with just two men in singles,
Michael Chang and Jeff Tarango. Sampras decided to skip the games.
Agassi, who withdrew because his mother and sister have breast
cancer, vacationed this week with his family in Hawaii and played
tennis with girlfriend Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, seeded 13th, is a two-time U.S. Open champion but has
never won a tournament in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pressure's there, and I definitely felt it today,'' he
said. ''It's good to get the first match out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, seeded second,
beat Christophe Pognon of Benin in 38 minutes, 6-1, 6-1. Then they
talked at the net, and Pognon took the loss well.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just pleased to be here,'' Kuerten said. ''I think he
was maybe happier than me today.''
</P>
<P>
   Spaniard Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, seeded fifth, beat wild-card
Na Li of China 6-1, 7-5. Eighth-seeded Dominique Van Roost of
Belgium swept Adriana Gersi of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Seles is part of the U.S. women's squad that
has touted itself as a dream team. Her teammates are top-seeded
Lindsay Davenport, the 1996 gold medalist, and second-seeded Venus
Williams in singles. Williams and her sister Serena will play
doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't imagine a better team,'' Seles said. ''Everybody is
playing their best, and coming from the U.S. Open, we're all pumped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles, who also competed at the 1996 Games, said she enjoys
Olympic tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a totally different feeling,'' she said. ''There are few
professionals in the Olympics, but it's fun to do every four years,
and Sydney is one of my favorite cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles won the first nine games against Marosi-Aracama, a
wild-card ranked 108th. When Seles hit a backhand into the net to
give Marosi-Aracama a game and make the score 6-0, 3-1, the crowd
let out a lusty cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was really nervous,'' Seles said. ''My next match will be
a better barometer of how I'm playing.''

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. equestrian team won its first
medal of the Sydney Games, finishing with a bronze in the three-day
event Tuesday (Monday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. riders put in three steady show-jumping rounds, scoring
175.0 to put them on the medal stand.
</P>
<P>
   Australia won the gold with a score of 146.8. Britain finished
second with 161.0.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. anchor rider Karen O'Connor of The Plains, Va., dropped two
jump rails on Prince Panache, who was stiff after the clean round
he put in on the grueling cross-country course the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so proud of how hard Panache tried when he was so
tired,'' O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen O'Connor's husband, David, had a clean round on Giltedge,
while Nina Fout of Middleburg, Va., had five time faults on 3 Magic
Beans to clinch the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was in fourth place when the day started, but
two New Zealand horses were lame after cross-country, dropping them
from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton was in the stands to cheer on the United States.
She sat in front of Britain's Princess Anne.

<HEADLINE> Fred Lane's Wife Still Detained  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The widow of NFL running back Fred Lane
was held without bail Monday on bank larceny charges after
documents in federal court suggested she might have killed her
husband to stop him from reporting the theft.
</P>
<P>
   At a later hearing in state court, the prosecutor told the judge
that the state intends to seek the death penalty if Deidra Lane is
convicted of murder.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor told the judge that Deidra Lane killed the
Indianapolis Colts running back to collect on a $5 million life
insurance policy taken out shortly before his death. Judge James
Lanning then revoked Deidra Lane's $100,000 bail on the murder
charge.
</P>
<P>
   She had been free on $100,000 secured bond in connection with
the July 6 slaying.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court, Judge Carl Horn referred to an FBI agent's
affidavit before he told a sobbing Deidra Lane -- wearing an orange
jail jumpsuit and leg shackles -- that she would not get bail any
time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Lane denies that she killed her husband to collect on a life
insurance policy. She said in a 911 call after the shooting that
her husband had choked and hit her.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her greed appears to be at the center of both the federal and
state charges,'' Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane's lawyer, Henderson Hill, said there is ''absolutely
nothing to this allegation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the state court hearing, prosecutor Marsha Goodenow told the
judge that Fred Lane was the victim of their brief and violent
marriage, not her.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have witnesses who will testify he came to practices with
bruises and rake marks,'' Goodenow said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three weeks after the life insurance policy was
purchased, Deidra Lane went to a store to look at shotguns, the
prosecutor said. She asked the clerk about the weapon's spray
pattern and the kinds of ammunition it used.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal hearing, court documents from an FBI investigator
suggested a possible motive: Lane killed her husband to keep him
from telling police about her role in the 1998 theft of $41,200
from a Wachovia Bank branch.
</P>
<P>
   Horn did release Deidra Lane's co-defendant, Natosha Watson, on
$50,000 unsecured bond.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Deidra Lane and Watson conspired
to steal $41,200 from the Charlotte bank where Watson worked as a
teller. The theft occurred July 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing against bail, Assistant U.S. Attorney Brian Whisler
said several witnesses identified her from bank surveillance tapes.
Combined with her police record, he said, Deidra Lane was a danger
to the community and a risk of flight.
</P>
<P>
   Hill argued that his client was no danger to anyone and had
cooperated with every request from police and the courts since her
arrest in the murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Whisler told Horn that Deidra Lane has a criminal record dating
to 1995. She was charged with attempting to rob a South Carolina
credit union five years ago. She was arrested but allowed to
complete a diversionary program and she was not convicted.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another strange twist, The Charlotte Observer reported
that Deidra Lane's brother, John Brandon Gary, was arrested on an
unrelated bank robbery charge Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mecklenburg Sheriff's Department confirmed that Gary has an
extensive arrest record, but had no information about his latest
arrest. Calls Monday night to the U.S. Marshall's office in
Charlotte seeking details on the arrest went unanswered.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys 27, Redskins 21  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Troy Aikman might not get his job back as
the Dallas Cowboys' quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Cunningham, filling in while Aikman recovers from the
ninth concussion of his career, threw two touchdown passes Monday
night as Dallas beat stumbling Washington 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham had a 76-yarder to Chris Warren and a 16-yarder to
Jackie Harris as Washington, which entered the season as a
prohibitive favorite to win the NFC East, lost for the second time
in three games.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first victory of the season for the Cowboys, who
allowed 73 points in losing to Philadelphia and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham passed for 179 yards and scrambled for 32 yards on
three carries, and also had a 44-yard completion to Rocket Ismail
to set up the pass to Harris that extended a 17-14 lead to 24-14
with 9:19 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins responded with a nine-play, 69-play drive capped by
Brad Johnson's 7-yard TD pass to Mike Sellers. But Izell Reese
intercepted Brad Johnson's pass with 2:09 left to set up Tim
Seder's 38-yard field goal that made it 27-21.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dallas' sixth consecutive victory over Washington and the
first win of Dave Campo's coaching career.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes the next two games absolutely critical for the
Redskins, whose free-agent signings during the offseason made them
one of the Super Bowl favorites -- at least in their own minds and
the minds of their fans. They face the undefeated New York Giants,
who lead the division by two games, at the Meadowlands next Sunday
night, then play Tampa Bay the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, which had looked sluggish in a win over Carolina the
first week and a loss in Detroit last week, was even shakier this
week against what had been a porous Dallas defense.
</P>
<P>
   This game ended much the same way as last week's 15-10 loss in
Detroit -- with a critical interception of Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas had a 14-7 lead at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Washington scored first on a 7-yard fourth-down run by Stephen
Davis in the first quarter on a 32-yard drive set up by Champ
Bailey's 54-yard punt return on a handoff from Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   But six minutes later, Cunningham dropped the snap on a first
down from the Dallas 24, but managed to pick it up and hit Warren
10 yards ahead of Sam Shade for the TD that tied the score. Shade
appeared to be looking at the fumble as Warren breezed by him.
</P>
<P>
   The second Dallas TD came after Leon Lett knocked the ball from
Johnson's hands and Greg Ellis recovered at the Washington 49.
Eight plays later, on fourth and inches from the 3, Emmitt Smith
took a pitchout from Cunningham and drove into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Seder's 32-yard field goal on the first series of the second
half made it 17-7 for Dallas. The key play on that drive was a
27-yard pass-interference call on Darrell Green.
</P>
<P>
   But the next time Dallas got the ball, Cunningham's first-down
pass deflected off Warren and into Shade's arms at the Cowboys' 24.
Davis carried five straight times, going in from the 1 to cut
Washington's deficit to 17-14.

<HEADLINE> Four Killed in Alaska Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUIQSUT, Alaska (AP) -- A small plane crashed Monday while
landing at the Nuiqsut airport on Alaska's North Slope, killing
four of the 10 people aboard, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the plane crashed about 3 p.m. near the runway of
this village north of the Arctic Circle. It went into the tundra
and did not hit any buildings, said Paul Carr, chief of the North
Slope Borough Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The six survivors were taken by helicopter to hospitals in
Barrow, Fairbanks and Anchorage, Carr said. The identities of those
killed were being withheld pending notification of kin.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews from the North Slope Borough and the Nuiqsut
Volunteer Fire Department were at the scene near Prudhoe Bay, some
400 miles north of Fairbanks. Investigators with the National
Transportation Safety Board were expected to arrive at the crash
site Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine aircraft belonged to Cape Smythe Air in Barrow.
Cape Smythe President Grant Thompson said there were nine passenger
and a pilot aboard the Piper 1040.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who said the turbo aircraft left Dead Horse about 65
miles east of Nuiqsut at 2:45 p.m., called the crash
''devastating.'' He said he knew of no problems with the aircraft,
but had not had time to check its service history.
</P>
<P>
   Several Cape Smythe Air planes have had mishaps this year.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a Cape Smythe Air pilot was injured after his plane
crashed on sea ice about three miles from the Kotzebue airport. On
Feb. 9, while landing at Wales, a Piper Cheyenne veered out of
control while landing, causing minor injuries to eight passengers
and a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the pilot of a Piper 1040 landed in Savoonga without
lowering his landing gear. No one was injured.

<HEADLINE> Bustamante: Spymaster Not Detained  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's justice minister denied reports Monday
that the nation's shadowy intelligence chief has been detained,
saying the military was not holding the powerful behind-the-scenes
figure who is at the center of a growing political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The reports and denial of spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos' arrest
further deepened the mystery surrounding his whereabouts and raised
questions about the stability of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, independent radio station CPN reported that
Montesinos had been detained on orders of the commander of Peru's
armed forces. Then, a lawyer claiming he represented Ana
Montesinos, whom he identified as the spymaster's sister, sought
out reporters alleging that her brother was being detained at the
headquarters of the National Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   He presented a writ of habeas corpus saying the detention was
illegal and demanding that Montesinos be freed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante denied that
Montesinos had been taken into custody and cast doubt on the
identity of the lawyer and the sister he claimed to represent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that he is in Lima and I know that he is not
detained,'' Bustamante told a news conference late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Ana Montesinos, whose name appears on the writ, he
said that ''she is not a sister or a relative of Mr. Montesinos.''
</P>
<P>
   A retired army general and several opposition leaders also
charged that the reports of Montesinos' detention were a ruse to
buy time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vladimiro Montesinos is not detained, but I don't know exactly
where he is,'' said retired army Gen. Jose Salinas Sedo, who led a
failed coup against President Alberto Fujimori in 1992. ''They're
protecting him. They're playing with the Peruvian people and
winning time to see how to manage the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, who gave his name as Jose Carmen Ojeda, did not
answer his cell phone later to respond to the accusations. There
was no listing for Ana Montesinos in the Lima telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tumult in the media, the streets of Lima were quiet
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Peru has been thrown into political turmoil since the release of
a videotape allegedly showing Montesinos bribing an opposition
lawmaker to support Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Fujimori said the video had damaged the credibility
of his government and that he was deactivating the National
Intelligence Service. In the bombshell announcement, he said he
would call new elections and not run himself, ending his
decade-long hold on power. He did not say when the new elections
would be held, or whether he would remain in office until then.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some 10,000 people packed into a downtown plaza
Monday night and roared their approval as opposition leader
Alejandro Toledo called on Fujimori to have Montesinos arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''There cannot be a healthy democracy in Peru with Montesinos
free,'' he told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, the leading opposition candidate in May's presidential
runoff against Fujimori, demanded between choruses of ''the
dictatorship will fall'' that an emergency transition goverment be
put in place immediately and that elections come within four
months.
</P>
<P>
   The reports of Montesinos' detention came after opposition
leaders had angrily demanded that Fujimori order his detention.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Gutierrez, a member of the investigative unit at the
opposition paper La Republica, said earlier Monday that
high-ranking military officers had confirmed Montesinos' detention.
</P>
<P>
   Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade earlier charged that Montesinos was
still running the intelligence service and was holed up in the
agency's headquarters. Unconfirmed news reports said he was
feverishly destroying documents that would incriminate him.
</P>
<P>
   The CPN radio report, citing unidentified military sources, said
the arrest order had been issued by Montesinos' close associate,
Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruesta, commander of Peru's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's critics say Montesinos has manipulated Peru's
intelligence network to infiltrate illegally all branches of
government for Fujimori, and they have accused him of masterminding
a campaign of smear attacks and dirty tricks to assure Fujimori's
political power.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Vargas Llosa, the famed novelist defeated for the
presidency by Fujimori in 1990, warned that the generals placed in
key positions by Montesinos were dangerous because ''they are
defending the little power they still have left.''
</P>
<P>
   ''A wounded beast is more dangerous than a healthy beast,'' he
said in a radio interview from Puerto Rico. ''Montesinos is a
person who has no place to run to, who is known to the whole world
for his misdeeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Military experts said Fujimori's decision to deactivate the
intelligence service was likely supported by discontented midlevel
officers, fed up with Montesinos' meddling in the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Retired army Gen. Daniel Mora said he doubted Montesinos had
enough pull in the military to launch a barracks revolt over
Fujimori's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's decision to step down from power was a shocking
announcement from the man who recently won a disputed election for
an unprecedented third term.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cheered the decision, and appealed to the
country's military to ''work toward a peaceful transition'' of
power.

<HEADLINE> Diabetes, HIV Drug Link Checked  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A French scientist described a new type of
diabetes in people infected with HIV and suggested Monday it could
be linked to anti-retroviral drugs used to treat the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, scientists have reported seeing HIV
patients with diabetes who also have a condition where fat collects
in their abdomens while their faces and limbs become abnormally
thin. They have suspected that recently developed AIDS drugs called
protease inhibitors might be linked to both problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Eric Renard told a conference of the European
Association for the Study of Diabetes that his research on 102 HIV
patients showed that the two conditions were in fact related to
three separate medications in a cocktail of HIV drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Known as anti-retrovirals, these drugs have been credited with
contributing to the dramatic drop in AIDS deaths seen over the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Renard, a professor of medicine at Montpelier University in
France, said the fat problem was linked to two of the drugs in the
cocktail, D4T and 3TC. He said diabetes appeared to be triggered by
the third type of drug, protease inhibitors, but only in patients
who already had the fat problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Olga Vaccaro of the department of clinical and experimental
medicine at Federico II University in Naples, Italy, said Renard's
research could help scientists better understand this rare type of
diabetes and offered an interesting theory of what caused it.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it is difficult to separate the effects of one drug from
another because HIV patients have been on multiple treatments,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said if a link between diabetes and the HIV treatment is
confirmed, doctors may have to take this into consideration when
treating HIV patients.
</P>
<P>
   Renard said the development of diabetes in HIV patients may be
linked to the fact that those drugs have been found to interfere
with the ability of a protein that is responsible for taking sugar
from the blood into muscles, the liver and other tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Insulin is a hormone that escorts sugar through the blood stream
and ''unlocks'' tissues so that the sugar can enter. In diabetics,
insulin cannot do its job properly and too much sugar remains in
the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now understand why protease inhibitors may introduce
diabetes in these patients,'' Renard said. ''They will probably
never die of AIDS, so now the problem is if you are stabilized on
one disease, will you get another one?''
</P>
<P>
   In the study, 89 of the 102 patients had the fat distribution
problem. Of those, 74 were taking protease inhibitors. Diabetes
then developed in 13 percent of those patients and a precursor for
diabetes, a problem disposing of blood sugar, developed in another
19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 7 percent of the 15 people not taking the drugs developed
the blood sugar disposal problem, while none of them got diabetes.

<HEADLINE> Report Warns on Human Gene Trials  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attempting to change genes and create future
generations of perfect, healthy human beings is dangerous,
irresponsible and should not be permitted now, a panel of experts
says in a report.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, in a report issued Monday, called for the creation of a
public committee to monitor and oversee the increasingly
sophisticated research into genetic modification.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the current research is concentrating on modifying the
genes to correct health problems in living humans. This is called
somatic gene modification and involves changing the genes in
existing mature cells.
</P>
<P>
   But, the committee said, there is animal research in which there
is an alteration of genes that affect future generations. This is
called ''inheritable genetic modification,'' or IGM.
</P>
<P>
   Applied to humans, IGM could, in theory, allow the production of
''designer children,'' or babies born with genes modified to make
them, and future generations taller, more athletic, more beautiful
or more intelligent. IGM could also be used to remove from a family
lineage the genes that cause inherited diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Theodore Friedmann of the University of California, San
Diego, said that IGM technology now ''is not safe for humans.''
</P>
<P>
   He said experiments have produced animals born with major birth
defects, gross physical distortions and fatal abnormalities. The
same thing, he said, could happen in humans if the current IGM
technology was applied.
</P>
<P>
   Friedmann said reports of gene manipulation and cloning
experiments tend to concentrate on the successes. But behind each
triumph there can be scores of animals that were born with terrible
and usually lethal genetic problems. This, the committee said,
shows that the IGM research is not now safe to use on humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''In animal experiments, this technology has been highly
inefficient and not of proven safety,'' said Friedmann. ''There are
major technical barriers to using this technology in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Sondra Wheeler, a teacher at the Wesley Theological Seminary in
Washington, said permitting IGM research in humans also could be
socially disruptive. She said there is the possibility that genetic
changes that would produce healthier and improved children would be
available only to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This would widen the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have
nots' to an unprecedented extent,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a moral problem on the distribution of these
benefits,'' said Wheeler. ''Who gets it? Who decides? What
criterion do they apply?''
</P>
<P>
   The committee report said a public committee should be organized
to monitor and oversee any IGM research on humans. The report
called for a public discussion to determine if Americans really
want to approve human IGM research.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association for the Advancement of Science is the
world's largest federation of scientists, with more than 146,000
members. The AAAS publishes Science, one of the world's major,
peer-reviewed journals of general scientific research.

<HEADLINE> Test Victim's Family Sues Penn  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL RUBINKAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The family of a teen-ager who died during a
gene therapy experiment last year filed a wrongful death lawsuit
Monday against his doctors and the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Gelsinger, 18, of Tucson, Ariz., died Sept. 17, 1999, four
days after starting the experiment. Gelsinger's death is the first
known to have been caused by gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in city court accuses doctors of being
''careless, negligent and reckless'' in their treatment of
Gelsinger. It does not specify an exact amount of damages being
sought.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the university expressed sorrow over Gelsinger's
death but said his medical care ''met the highest standards'' and
that he was fully aware of the risks involved with the therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger suffered from an inherited disorder that inhibits
nitrogen processing in the body. The disorder usually kills boys at
a young age, but Gelsinger controlled his condition with drugs and
a low-protein diet.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hoped to correct the problem by injecting into his
liver a cold virus that had been modified to carry a gene that
would control the condition.
</P>
<P>
   But 24 hours after the therapy began, his condition went
downhill. After two days, he slipped into a coma. He eventually was
taken off life support.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger was the 18th patient to receive the gene therapy at
Pennsylvania. Some of the earlier patients experienced some side
effects that quickly were corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said that Gelsinger and his father Paul reviewed
documents and had discussions with Penn doctors in order to make an
informed decision about Jesse's participation in the therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit called those documents and discussions ''misleading
and deceptive,'' claiming the Gelsingers were not told of the
severe toxic effects of the cold virus particles, nor that monkeys
injected with the virus had become ill or died.
</P>
<P>
   The Gelsingers also did not know that some trial participants
had suffered serious side effects, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also accused the lead researcher, Dr. James Wilson,
of having a conflict of interest. A company founded by Wilson
funded part of the Penn research. The company, Genovo Inc., later
was sold to a bigger company and Wilson reportedly received $13.5
million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Food and Drug Administration accused Wilson of
violating safety regulations. The FDA ordered Wilson and the
University of Pennsylvania's Institute for Human Gene Therapy to
halt human drug trials.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party ballot dispute before high court  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Pat Buchanan is the Reform Party's
nominee for president and should be listed as such in Connecticut,
Buchanan's supporters told the state Supreme Court's chief justice
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Francis McDonald Jr. is being asked to decide if
Buchanan or rival John Hagelin should be listed on the Reform Party
line in Connecticut. He also could decide to leave the ballot line
open.
</P>
<P>
   Failing to list Buchanan as the Reform nominee ''would deny the
voters of Connecticut the voice of the Reform Party'' and prevent
them from hearing the party's message, said Frank Reed, vice
chairman of the Reform Party USA. It also would decrease the number
of votes he receives nationally, thereby hurting the party's
chances to reach 5 percent of the popular vote and retain its
federal matching funds in the next presidential election, he
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Both Buchanan and Hagelin claimed the Reform mantle at competing
national conventions last month. Just how the party came to hold
two nominating conventions at the same time was the subject of much
of Monday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's supporters say Hagelin backers walked out of the Long
Beach, Calif., event. Hagelin backers maintain they were ''locked
out'' by pro-Buchanan forces.
</P>
<P>
   Reed and other Buchanan supporters cited a decision by the
Federal Election Commission last week giving Buchanan $12.6 million
in federal campaign funds belonging to the party, as proof their
candidate deserves the spot on Connecticut's ballot. They also
cited a ruling by a California judge last week declaring him the
Reform nominee and ordering Hagelin to stop campaigning as such.
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Torre, a lawyer representing the party's pro-Hagelin
faction, said Buchanan already is on the presidential ballot in
Connecticut - as the nominee of the new Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   Why should Buchanan be listed on the ballot twice? Torre asked.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who lives in Ohio, said he was unaware of the Freedom
party designation.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Atchley of Hamden, a Buchanan backer and self-described
chairman of the state Reform party, said that if Buchanan wins the

party designation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Pat Buchanan wins (the lawsuit), the Freedom Party will
vanish,'' Atchley said outside of court.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Ratings Tumbling for NBC  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe it's that the competitions are aired
nearly a day after their results are released on the Internet. Or
maybe it's just that football is more popular.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, NBC's ratings for the Sydney Olympics have been
disappointing, and they aren't likely to get better.
</P>
<P>
   They are down compared with the last Summer Games (Atlanta,
1996), the last overseas Summer Games (Barcelona, 1992) or the last
Summer Games held this late in the calendar (Seoul, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, the Nielsen numbers have yet to approach
what NBC told advertisers they would. The first three days of taped
telecasts -- not a single second of competition is being broadcast
live -- have averaged a 14.5 national rating in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in the 15-hour time difference between Sydney and the
East Coast, NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol said in June that he
expected the coverage to average between a 17.5 and 18.5 during the
Olympics. Advertisers were told the primetime average would be at
least a 16.1.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the ratings are 10 percent lower than that low-water
level. They also are 32 percent lower than Atlanta's 21.4 through
three days, and 10 percent lower than Seoul's.
</P>
<P>
   NBC declined to comment late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Networks sometimes must give advertisers extra air time to make
up for lower-than-promised ratings. NBC sold $900 million in
advertising for the Sydney Games after spending $705 million for
the TV rights and $100 million on production.
</P>
<P>
   Things might not get better in a hurry for NBC, since the
ratings were down despite the airing of two sports among the most
popular with U.S. audiences. It's doubtful the swimming competition
could become any more riveting -- eight world records were set in
the first two days at the pool -- and the U.S. gymnastics teams have
not shown much promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a whole lot you can do, frankly, to change course.
What you hope for are major success stories or major athletes that
you could promote,'' said Neal Pilson, who oversaw U.S. TV coverage
of two Winter Olympics while president of CBS Sports.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that could be hurting the ratings is the lengthy
delay between when events are completed and when they are aired.
Results are available on the Internet or on TV sportscasts as many
as 20 hours before NBC shows the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary ratings also indicate that these ''Autumn Olympics''
are not faring well against football. NBC's coverage from noon to 6
p.m. on Sunday pulled in a 7.6 overnight rating (based only on the
country's largest markets). Fox's NFL doubleheader, from 1-7 p.m.,
drew an 11.1, while CBS's NFL game got a 9.6.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point for NBC represents 1,008,000 households, or 1
percent of the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Kills 8 in Pakistan's Capital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A powerful bomb ripped through a
crowded market during the early morning rush hour in Pakistan's
capital Tuesday, killing at least eight people and wounding 50,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb exploded while workers were unloading vegetables from a
truck, witnesses said. The explosion damaged several shops and
triggered a stampede.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear where the bomb was placed. Earlier,
police said the explosion occurred outside a shop.
</P>
<P>
   Nasir Khan Durrani, senior superintendent of police, confirmed
the toll of those dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
   No group claimed immediate responsibility for the explosion, and
police said they were investigating.

Diabetes, HIV Drug Link Checked
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A French scientist described a new type of diabetes in
people infected with HIV and suggested Monday it could be linked to
anti-retroviral drugs used to treat the virus that causes AIDS. In the last few
years, scientists have reported seeing HIV patients with diabetes who also have
a condition where fat collects in their abdomens while their faces and limbs
become abnormally thin. They have suspected that recently developed AIDS drugs
called protease inhibitors might be linked to both problems.

quashed a new Finance Ministry rule floated last month to tax businesses every
time employees use company computers for private Internet surfing.
Telecommunications and computer firms had criticized the government for the tax
plan, arguing that it would be a bureaucratic nightmare that would discourage
many people from becoming familiar with the Internet.

reported that spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos had been detained on orders of the
commander of Peru's armed forces. Then, a lawyer who claimed he represented
Montesinos' sister alleged that her brother was being detained at the

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes on China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is about to change the nature of
U.S.-China trade ties in a vote supporters say will add a critical
element of stability to the tumultuous relations between the
world's most powerful and most populous nations.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage Tuesday of the PNTR, or permanent normal trade
relations, bill is near-certain, sending the legislation to
President Clinton for his signature. The measure is aimed at
opening up China's markets, bringing billions in new business to
American companies and making China a more responsible and
accountable member of the world community.
</P>
<P>
   It is opposed by labor, human rights and conservative groups who
say it is wrong to give up the annual review of China trade that
since the 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen student movement has
given lawmakers a way to highlight China's weapons proliferation
and persecution of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, the most important trade bill since the 1993
North American Free Trade Agreement, enjoys the potent backing of
President Clinton, the congressional Republican leadership and the
nation's major business and agriculture groups. Both presidential
candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
support permanent trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents the most significant opportunity that we have
had to create positive change in China since the 1970s, when
President Nixon first went there and later in the decade when
President Carter normalized relations,'' Clinton said in a speech
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is a consequence of a trade agreement between
the United States and China last fall that opened the way for
China's entry into the World Trade Organization. With WTO
membership, China will make significant cuts in its tariffs while
opening its markets to the products and investment of America and
other countries. China must also abide by international rules in
such areas as protecting intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The PNTR legislation would go into effect when China joins the
WTO, probably late this year or early next year. Currently, under a
1974 law, trade relations with communist states must be reviewed
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which already has open markets, made no new
concessions as part of the agreement, but must grant permanent
trade status before it can share in China's market-opening
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Jackson of the American Farm Bureau Federation said that
with China's agriculture tariffs slated to be cut in half, American
exports of farm products could increase by $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   There will be ''unprecedented opportunities,'' said John
Schachter of the Business Roundtable, with ''the opening of the
world's largest emerging marketplace to goods and services that
largely have been kept out until now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lower tariffs, under WTO rules China must also
grant Americans and others the right to set up distribution points
within the country, must open its financial and service sectors to
foreign competitors and must allow outside participation in its
Internet and telecommunications development.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those benefits, Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., warned Monday
that it was a ''dangerous mistake'' for Congress to give away its
voice on trade relations when China's security threats and human
rights abuses are getting worse. ''We are putting profits over
people,'' he said. ''It's plain wrong and it's un-American.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the PNTR bill last May by 237-197, and the only
real suspense during two weeks of debate on the Senate floor was
whether they could keep opponents from attaching crippling
amendments on subjects ranging from proliferation to human rights
abuses. The concern was that the House wouldn't have time to act on
any Senate changes before Congress adjourns next month.

<HEADLINE> Harnessing Wind in the Southeast  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLIVER SPRINGS, Tenn. (AP) -- Three tall white spires topped with
delicately poised 75-foot-long rotors that point into the wind,
waiting to bring a new source of renewable energy to the Tennessee
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to see them as soon as we got 'em up,'' Tennessee
Valley Authority Chairman Craven Crowell said Monday as his
helicopter landed on Buffalo Mountain, site of the first major wind
turbine project in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The turbines, which rise nearly 300 feet into the sky, will
provide about 2 megawatts of electricity, enough to power more than
400 homes in a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's small compared to the authority's systemwide demand of
some 28,000 megawatts. ''But it is a big part of what we are doing
with green power,'' said Jim Keiffer, the TVA's senior vice
president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The authority's Green Power Switch alternative energy program,
launched on Earth Day on April 22, is being offered in a first-year
test to customers of a dozen of the authority's 158 local
distributors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, some 1,944 homes and 115 businesses have signed up to
buy blocks of green power. Residential customers are charged an
extra $4 a month per 150 kilowatt-hour block, roughly 12 percent of
a household's monthly average.
</P>
<P>
   The authority hopes to have as many as 8,000 residential
customers signed up by next spring. Officials have a target of
mid-October for connecting the windmills up to its grid.
</P>
<P>
   Locating the turbines atop a 3,300-foot-high reclaimed strip
mine was both symbolic and practical. ''This was a strip mine and
now we have turned it into something that is very friendly to the
environment,'' Keiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The turbines will be complemented with as many as 12 solar
collectors -- four are now running in Nashville, Pigeon Forge,
Gibson County and Knoxville -- and a landfill gas-to-energy facility
in Middle Tennessee that should be working by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The turbines were made in Denmark and installed by enXco, a Palm
Springs, Calif., company that manages or owns about 4,400 turbines
in California, Texas, Iowa, South Dakota, as well as Costa Rica,
Germany, England and India.
</P>
<P>
   The turbines cost $3.4 million and the authority is budgeting
about $8 million for this first phase of green power -- all of which
it expects to recoup through the extra fees charged consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Smith, director of the Southern Alliance for Clean
Energy, called it a ''very important move by TVA to begin to invest
in renewable energy like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is pushing the authority to move away from
coal-fired generating stations that pollute the air. ''We hope this
is just the first step in a long commitment that TVA is going to
make to clean up the power mix,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Unrest Threat Looms in Ivory Coast  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Only the hardcore drinkers and
socializers remain at this clapboard drinking spot near the home of
the Ivory Coast's junta leader, where loyalist soldiers had driven
back mutinous attackers earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Many customers left after surly soldiers erected a barricade
across the street from this ''maquis'' -- the name given to Ivory
Coast's open-air meeting places where rich and poor alike go to
share braised chicken and quart-sized beers on low, rickety tables.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, customers are anxiously discussing the growing threat
of civil war, a coup or anarchy following the apparent
assassination attempt on military leader Gen. Robert Guei.
</P>
<P>
   The attack rattled what has long been one of Africa's most
stable and prosperous nations and marked widening political and
military divisions ahead of the Oct. 22 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, schools, cafes and nightclubs were all closed for the day
following the early morning shooting that left two presidential
bodyguards dead.
</P>
<P>
   But at this maquis -- informally known as the Taxi Stand Maquis,
after the nearby rank of cabs -- the shooting has only added to the
lively thirst for talk and drink among the die-hard few. Customers
vigorously argue whether the clash was an attempted coup or a drama
staged by the military regime for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation is interrupted by a tall thin man wearing a
wooly hat and bedraggled jacket with the words ''Disarm all the
chiefs of state'' daubed in paint on his back. The man, who had a
half-full bottle of Coke stuck in his belt, shouts above the
pounding African pop music.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ivorians have lost their spirits from their heads and that is
why they are willing to die,'' he yelled. He does not give his
name. ''The military are getting ready to go to the land of the
dead. Some are already there.''
</P>
<P>
   This brings a roar of laughter from one table, and starts a
discussion between the three young men about whether there is life
after death.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I get there I will give you all a full report,'' says one
of the three, Lamine Dokui.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress, 40-something Mariam Sanogo, dismisses the threat
of war, even though she heard the shooting early in the morning,
which left the president's villa pocked with hundreds of bullet
holes. Guei said his men were searching for the attackers and their
political backers -- which many observers took as a veiled threat at
one of his main rivals, popular opposition leader Alassane Dramane
Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Sanogo believes Guei staged the attack as a pretext to arrest
Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions have been flaring over whether Ouattara will be allowed
to seek the presidency. The issue came into question after a new
constitution was adopted in August that includes an amendment
stipulating that both parents of presidential candidates be ''of
Ivorian origin'' -- a change widely believed to be aimed at
excluding Ouattara.
</P>
<P>
   Ouattara insists his parents were Ivorian. His opponents say
they were from Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Sanogo becomes silent when one of the glassy-eyed soldiers
manning the barricade across the street enters and orders a
quart-sized beer. The military man quaffs the drink in a few
seconds and leaves without paying. Nobody complains.
</P>
<P>
   She then admits she would like to be somewhere else,
particularly her village in central Ivory Coast, near the official
capital of Yamoussoukro, a city of bureaucrats and a
multi-million-dollar Roman Catholic cathedral built by the
country's deceased president, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, with the
proceeds from cocoa and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   But it is in Abidjan, the country's commercial center, where
work can be found. And despite a declining agricultural economy and
business slowed by political instability in recent months, Sanogo
remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We Ivorians, we will think and say bad things, but when it
comes down to the day, we will be too afraid to cause too much
trouble,'' Sanogo says. ''I know Ivorians because I am one. So
don't worry. Everything will be all right.''

<HEADLINE> Challenges From Gore's Poster Child  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA COOK
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- The camera sweeps over a sleeping baby,
then up to a nurse busy with tubes and monitors next to his crib.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-second Al Gore ad, pitching his support for a patients'
bill of rights, tells the story of 1-year-old Ian Malone, who was
born severely disabled.
</P>
<P>
   When Christine and Dylan Malone's HMO decided to terminate their
baby's nursing care despite a pediatrician's warnings he'd die
without it, they called Gore's campaign out of desperation and the
Democratic presidential candidate took notice. The ensuing
publicity prompted the HMO to reverse course.
</P>
<P>
   It's still very tough going and Ian's future is not clear. But
his parents are enjoying smiles the doctors thought they could
never expect to see.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Zoopa, zoopa, zoopa!'' Dylan Malone coos to Ian, bouncing the
baby on his knee. Ian giggles and smiles blissfully. This is his
favorite game.
</P>
<P>
   That rosy-cheeked smile is more than Dylan, 27, and Christine,
36, once believed possible. A botched delivery deprived Ian of
oxygen; he was born gray and seemingly lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   ''He worked his way up to blue,'' Christine grimly recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Ian now suffers from a long list of medical problems. He can't
swallow, which means he's in constant danger of choking to death on
spit-up or even his own saliva. He can't eat, and is hooked to a
feeding tube 20 hours a day. He can't hold his head up, can't walk,
can't talk. He has some mental retardation -- how much, Ian's
doctors don't yet know.
</P>
<P>
   But already, this frail little boy has surpassed expectations.
Ian's pediatrician warned the Malones that he might never smile,
might never recognize them or show any positive response other than
to stop screaming for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Malones have learned to cherish the smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ''There certainly are times, if we were the self-pitying kind,
we could wallow,'' Christine says, as she and Dylan play with a
sleepy Ian on their living room couch.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we do, once in a while,'' Dylan adds.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it doesn't make me feel any better. I mean, walking down
the baby food aisle in the grocery store, and not buying baby food.
...''
</P>
<P>
   Christine's voice trails off and she thinks for a minute, the
silence punctuated by the whirr and click of Ian's feeding machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes me feel better to concentrate on what he can do,''
she concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Their goals seem modest. Dylan hopes his son will one day be
able to accept a feeding tube into his stomach instead of his
intestines. That would mean quicker feeding, and more free time
away from the machine. Christine wishes Ian could gain the strength
to hold up his head, which has an alarming tendency to flop around.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are other dreams, wishes they don't speak aloud very
often.
</P>
<P>
   ''My goal is to take him to Al Gore's second inaugural walking
and talking,'' says Dylan. ''Even if walking is with a walker and
even if talking is 25 words.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ian came home from intensive care, he was much worse off.
He only stopped crying when he was sedated, he had frequent
seizures and he nearly choked to death several times.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very, very dark time,'' Christine recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were times I would come home and Christine would be
almost in a fetal position, just sobbing,'' Dylan remembers. ''And
I just wanted to join her.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's largest medical insurer, began cutting back
Ian's nursing care. The company said Ian did not qualify for
in-home nursing at all -- even though his pediatrician recommended
16 hours of nursing care a day. The Malones appealed to Aetna's
system, but lost.
</P>
<P>
   They called everyone they could think of. Legislators and the
state insurance commissioner offered help, but there wasn't much
they could do. At the newspaper where Dylan Malone works as a
graphic artist, his insurance is governed by federal, not state
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Dylan called Gore's campaign office.
</P>
<P>
   Gore happened to be campaigning through Washington before the
presidential primary in February. He met the Malones and talked to
them for an hour, then made their story part of his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't cut this child's coverage,'' Gore railed at a rally.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity picked up. Gore and the Malones went on NBC's
''Today'' show, joined by an Aetna representative who surprised
them by saying Aetna would continue Ian's 16-hour nursing care for
as long as he needed it. Christine put a hand to her earpiece, as
if to check she was not hearing things.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said evaluation of Ian's case was accelerated because of
the attention but the company would have made the same decision
ultimately.
</P>
<P>
   The Malones believe the publicity meant all the difference. And
they had no hesitation about seeing their case put to political
purposes by appearing in Gore's ad, which started showing
nationally last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had come to a fork in the road,'' Dylan says. ''One
direction was, Ian's a martyr, and the other direction was, Ian's a
poster child. I'm really glad he got to be a poster child.''

<HEADLINE> Judge's 96' Ruling Used Against Him  </HEADLINE>
By HOLLY RAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Several months ago, a court clerk who was
agonizing in private whether to report unethical behavior turned to
a ruling written by his boss, Chief Justice David Brock.
</P>
<P>
   The same words that helped Howard Zibel in February became
public ammunition against Brock on Monday when his historic
impeachment trial began.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 ruling, Brock severely admonished a district judge
accused of fixing his brother's speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judges are entrusted with immense authority over matters that
affect the lives of all of New Hampshire's citizens,'' Brock wrote.
''It is a great public trust. Indeed, judges are the most visible
symbol of the rule of law in our society. Without judges who are
perceived and trusteed by members of the public as impartial, the
authority of the rule of law is compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   House lawyer Joseph Steinfield read the same passage during his
opening statement; Brock's lawyers were expected to deliver their
opening arguments Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted in July to impeach the 64-year-old Brock, a high
court justice since 1981 and chief justice since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The House accused Brock of lying to its investigators, making an
improper call to a lower-court judge in 1987, soliciting comments
from then-Justice Stephen Thayer about Thayer's own divorce case in
February, and routinely allowing judges to comment on cases from
which they were disqualified for conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Steinfield zeroed in on the 1987 case, a business dispute
involving a powerful state senator. Brock has acknowledged calling
a court clerk, but not the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moment the Chief Justice places a phone call directly to a
trial judge about a pending case, you have a corrosive effect on
the requirement of impartiality,'' Steinfield said. ''It can't be
allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brock's lawyers contend that nothing he did was serious enough
to warrant conviction in the Senate. They say the constitutional
grounds for impeachment -- bribery, corruption, malpractice and
maladministration -- require evil intent or personal gain as a
motive.
</P>
<P>
   They also plan to stress the constitutional importance of a
judiciary free of casual political interference over matters that,
at most, merit scrutiny by the committee that disciplines judges.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate trial is expected to last two to five weeks. In
pretrial hearings last month, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to
require a two-thirds vote for conviction, or 15 senators, instead
of a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate left open the possibility of lesser penalties than
removal from office if Brock is convicted. It also decided to let
each senator determine the appropriate standard of proof.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate did not agree on a definition of
''maladministration,'' one of the grounds for impeachment under the
state constitution. The word is used in three of the four
impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   The House has impeached a judge only once before, in 1790, but
he resigned before his Senate trial.

<HEADLINE> Bush Takes His Turn on 'Oprah'  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- George W. Bush was taking his turn in the Oprah
easy chair on Tuesday, part of the Republican's effort to woo back
women voters newly enthusiastic about Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidential rivals crisscrossing paths these days and
courting the same middle-class voters, Bush followed Gore by a week
and a day into the Chicago studios where Oprah Winfrey tapes her
syndicated talk show for some 22 million devotees.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the first politician Winfrey ever invited onto a show
that's run 15 seasons, won flattery and a thumbs-up from the
wealthy entertainment mogul, who has given $12,000 to Democrats
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Her partisan stripes do not worry Bush, said Ari Fleischer,
spokesman for the Texas governor's campaign. ''The governor's
looking forward to it. Oprah's always a very important opportunity
to connect with a lot of viewers, mostly women.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Pass, a spokeswoman for Winfrey's production company,
said it is anyone's guess whether Winfrey will make an endorsement
in the presidential race. For now, Pass said, ''Oprah's not giving
any indication of her preference.''
</P>
<P>
   In polls, women voters indicating a preference have given Gore
his strongest advantage in months. A Gallup survey released on
Monday showed the vice president leading Bush among women by 17
points.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the latest poll from the Pew Research Center, Gore leads
among women on all of the issues that they consider the most
important: keeping Social Security and Medicare financially sound
(Gore is up 52-33); health care (Gore, 50-30) and education (Gore,
44-38). Gore also has an advantage on protecting and strengthening
American families, 44-37 among women.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why women appeared to be more supportive of Gore,
Fleischer said Bush was ''less interested in why they left'' than
on ways to win them back.
</P>
<P>
   He was campaigning this week with wife Laura at his side. From
''Oprah,'' the pair was headed to Chicago's Beethoven Elementary
School, and then on to the Henry Clay School in Lexington, Ky., for
a forum on school safety.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Winfrey's Harpo Productions studios, however, gun
control activist Jim Brady was staging a press conference with
activists from the anti-gun Million Mom March to highlight a 1997
Texas law that Bush signed permitting concealed handguns in
churches, hospitals, nursing homes and amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   Brady, the former Republican presidential press secretary,
called on Bush to ''explain his gun record. What kind of signal is
George Bush sending to our kids when he thinks it is OK to carry
handguns in our amusement parks?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has proposed giving teachers unilateral authority to remove
unruly kids from their classrooms, and also shielding teachers and
school districts from legal liability in discipline cases.
Fleischer said 31 percent of all high schools have been involved in
lawsuits or out-of-court settlements arising from disciplinary
action.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed that parents and teachers sign ''disciplinary
contracts'' laying out standards and means of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush and his wife promoted his tax-relief agenda for
parents by touring the maternity ward of a Little Rock, Ark.,
hospital. ''This is heaven, all kinds of babies to kiss,'' Bush
enthused.
</P>
<P>
   Appealing to women voters is important because they turn out on
Election Day. Since 1980, women have been exceeding men in their
rate of voting by up to 3 percentage points, and they also make up
a bigger share of the electorate, said Curtis Gans, director of the
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. In 1996, he
said, women made up 52 percent of the voting population.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said it's unlikely Bush can
catch Gore in support among women. But he also predicted Bush's
sharper focus on issues will improve his standing among both men
and women and ''tighten the race back up.''

<HEADLINE> Serbs Not Concerned With Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MERITA DHIMGJOKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A dark red marble marker
overlooking Kosovo's tensest community stands as a lonely relic of
the years when Serbs and Albanians fought a common enemy, the
Nazis, instead of each other.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reminder, as Yugoslavia heads into elections Sept. 24
with Slobodan Milosevic fighting to stay on as president, that
things were once very different -- that in its communist period
Yugoslavia's official credo was ethnic tolerance, and many of its
citizens actually believed in it.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the memorial to those who ''gave their lives for the
freedom of the future generations'' is overshadowed by other
realities -- the antennas and radio transmitters set up by NATO and
the United Nations charged with keeping the peace between Serbs and
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Below the monument lies Kosovska Mitrovica, divided into hostile
halves.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential and parliamentary elections include Kosovo,
which nominally remains part of the Balkan federation despite being
under NATO and U.N. control.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serbs of Kosovska Mitrovica have other concerns -- the
approach of winter, and the fear of their Albanian neighbors, still
in vengeful mood over the Serb crackdown that led to the NATO
bombing last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 200,000-strong Serb minority has fled Kosovo. Those
who remain are pressed into NATO-protected enclaves, and they are
angry -- with the West for taking the Albanian side, but also, in
many cases, with Milosevic for causing the war.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav president rose to power more than a decade ago by
promising to protect all of Yugoslavia's Serbs. Instead, after
goading Serbs into war first in Croatia, then Bosnia, and finally
in Kosovo, he abandoned them, leaving them to the mercies of rival
ethnic groups now in control.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Milosevic seems to hope Kosovo can help him win the
election against his main rival, Vojislav Kostunica, who is
presently ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Kosovo's 2 million Albanians, having fought to break
away from Serbia, will likely boycott the elections. So will many
Serbs, according to some of their moderate leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is feared a boycott will play into Milosevic's hands
by allowing him to claim the votes of those who stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   That should be relatively easy. The United Nations and NATO have
said they will not monitor the voting, and restrict their role to
keeping the peace. Thus, like elsewhere in Yugoslavia, there will
be no independent verification of who voted for whom.
</P>
<P>
   During the last Yugoslav elections four years ago, Kosovo Serbs
enthusiastically listened to Milosevic's message that a vote for
him was a vote for continued Serb supremacy in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people in Kosovska Mitrovica walk on weed-infested
pavements past boarded-up storefronts, windows plastered with
election posters. The mood is glum. Dark looks and gestures meet a
visitor asking questions about Milosevic and the elections. Serbs
in this town have a more urgent quest -- survival.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are worried about the winter that's coming, about food and
power,'' said Dusan Drobac, a Kosovo Serb.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old law student had little doubt Milosevic would
manipulate the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should I vote, if I know who the winner is going to be at
the end?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing by the memorial stone, he pointed south to what is now
the Albanian half of Kosovska Mitrovica, and sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ''See the white house with the red balcony?'' He said. ''There's
where I used to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those lucky enough to have jobs don't seem to care about
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Jelena Sedlarevic makes $70 a month selling nationalist mementos
at the ''Srpska Zemlja'' (Serbian Land) souvenir shop. She wears
one of the shop's more popular items, a T-shirt displaying the
insignia of the ''White Wolves'' -- the vigilante group guarding the
main bridge over the Ibar River that divides the city's Serbs and
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Customers are few, and much of her time is spent daydreaming of
better times at home in Dragoljevac, her village in western Kosovo,
now occupied by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   She produced a mirthless smile when asked how she would vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only when I am able to return home can we talk about
elections,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Airport gets FAA grant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) - The Federal Aviation Administration is
granting more than $900,000 to the Floyd D. Bennett-Warren County
Airport for infrastructure improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The $932,982 grant will be used to build a new taxiway and a new
terminal apron - where passengers walk onto or exit a plane.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the runways at the airport were upgraded, so a new
taxi service would continue the improvement to the airport - making
it more attractive to corporate and private jet owners.
</P>
<P>
   Small airports, like Warren County's air field, were boosted by
a bill earlier this year that brought $150,000 per year for
projects such as snow removal, safety lighting and other equipment
purchases.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- On a day when she needed help from her
Olympic teammates, U.S softball pitcher Michele Smith didn't get
much -- and the team's 112-game winning streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Seles, after winning her first Sydney match, said she
expects better from her powerful women's tennis teammates. And
boxer Jose Navarro, who won his fight Tuesday (Monday night EDT),
was just keeping up with his undefeated teammates in the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
   At the softball competition, Smith threw 10 shutout innings --
but the Americans stranded a staggering 20 baserunners in an
11-inning, 2-1 loss to Japan. It was the first loss for the U.S.
women, the gold medal winners in Atlanta, since the 1998 world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of errors by Dot Richardson led to Japan's two runs in
the 11th, when Jennifer Brundage and Stacey Nuveman struck out
looking with the tying run on base for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is now 3-0 in Olympic competition, while the United States
dropped to 2-1. But the loss doesn't diminish the team's gold medal
hopes, as the top four in the eight-team tournament advance to the
medal round.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S TENNIS: Seles, the first of the American women's
tennis ''Dream Team'' on the court in Australia, needed just 48
minutes Tuesday to win her Olympic opener, 6-0, 6-1 over Katalin
Marosi-Aracama of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   She then wasted no time in hailing her teammates: top-seeded
Lindsay Davenport, the 1996 gold medalist, and second-seeded Venus
Williams in singles; Williams and her sister, Serena, in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't imagine a better team,'' Seles said. ''Everybody is
playing their best, and coming from the U.S. Open, we're all pumped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S TENNIS: Todd Martin, making his Olympic debut at age 30,
was eliminated from the tennis tournament by Rainer Schuttler of
Germany 6-2, 6-0. Martin lost the final eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Following him quickly to the exit was Vince Spadea, who replaced
the injured Andre Agassi on the U.S. team. Australian Pat Rafter,
to the delight of the partisan crowd, made short work of Spadea in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: Another match, another victory. Navarro scored the
Americans' seventh consecutive victory in the first round of the
Olympics, scoring a 16-10 victory over 112-pounder Hermensen Ballo
of Indonesia. Navarro has won nine silver medals in assorted
competitions, but hopes to finally grab a gold.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   -- MISSING WEIGHTLIFTER: One of the two Romanian weightlifters
banned from the Olympics after a positive steroid test has
disappeared. Traian Ciharean, who was banned for life after the
second positive test of his career, vanished Monday after refusing
a plane trip home from the Romanian Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   -- EQUESTRIAN: Three steady rounds of show-jumping produced a
bronze medal for the American equestrian team. Australia won the
gold, while Britain finished second in the three-day jumping event.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SWIMMING: The Flying Dutchman was at it again.
</P>
<P>
   One day after his stunning gold medal victory over Aussie Ian
Thorpe, Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands was fastest
swimmer Tuesday (Monday night EDT) in the 100-meter freestyle
preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband crashed what was billed as a two-man party
between American Gary Hall Jr. and Russian Alexander Popov, who
waged a memorable sprint final at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Both also
qualified for the semifinals in the race; Popov is the two-time
defending gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   The finals were set for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Moussambani of Equatorial Guinea didn't qualify, but he
competed -- and that was enough. The 22-year-old, who trains in a
20-meter pool with no lanes in his west African homeland, finished
more than a minute behind the leaders in his first attempt at
swimming 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200 breaststroke, 19-year-old Kyle Salyards was the
lone American to advance.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, 21-year-old American Misty Hyman was top
qualifier in the women's 200 butterfly, edging out world record
holder Susie O'Neill of Australia. Kaitlin Sandeno, 17, of Lake
Forest, Calif., also qualified for the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband showed no ill effects from his medal-winning
200-meter performance against Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   In that same session, heavily favored U.S. swimmer Lenny
Krayzelburg zipped across the pool in an Olympic-record 53.72
seconds to win the 100-meter backstroke. Krayzelburg's quick trip
completed a lengthy journey that took him from Ukraine to the
United States to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him as a gold medalist was American Megan Quann, who won
the 100-meter breaststroke. The 17-year-old backed up her boast of
knocking off defending champion Penny Heyns of South Africa in the
100 breaststroke -- although she did not break Heyns' world record
of 1:06.52.
</P>
<P>
   In the 200 freestyle, the Dutch swimmer threw a ''Hoogie'' into
plans of the ''Thorpedo'' for Olympic dominance. Van den
Hoogenband, aka Hoogie, upset Australian teen sensation Thorpe, who
had to settle for a silver after winning two golds.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had five golds after three days of the
eight-day swimming meet.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BEACH VOLLEYBALL: In barely enough time to break a sweat --
less than 20 minutes -- Americans Rob Heidger and Kevin Wong kept
their medal hopes alive with a quick 15-2 victory over France's
Jean-Philippe Jodard and Christian Penigaud. The U.S. pair now has
a chance to advance to the final 16 with another victory.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S GYMNASTICS: The U.S. gymnastic team's 16-year Olympic
losing streak was quickly extended for another four years. The
Americans finished fifth in the team competition, sending them home
with no team medal yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to judge this team's success by anybody else's
standards,'' said John Roethlisberger, a three-time Olympian in his
last games. ''They're A-1 in my book.''
</P>
<P>
   In the score book, they were No. 5 as the gold medal went to
China. Ukraine won the silver medal, and defending gold medalist
Russia took the silver.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have not won a team medal in a non-boycotted
Olympics since 1932.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BASEBALL: The mercy rule was invoked after the top of the
seventh, and it couldn't have come soon enough for South Africa.
Right-hander Jon Rauch struck out 13 and John Cotton drove in five
runs as the unbeaten United States (2-0) won 11-1. Under Olympic
rules, a 10-run lead in the seventh or later stops a game.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S WATER POLO: Maureen O'Toole and the U.S. women have a
new Olympic experience to handle -- losing. The home pool advantage,
with a raucous local crowd, was too much to overcome as the
Australians defeated the Americans 7-6. It was the women's first
defeat in Sydney, leaving their record at 2-1-1
</P>
<P>
   The Americans fell to Australia and its raucous home crowd, 7-6
on Tuesday (Monday night EDT), their first water polo defeat at the
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WEIGHTLIFTING: Mexico has won its first medal of any kind in
the Olympic sport of ... weightlifting? Yes. Soraya Jimenez of
Mexico won the 127&AMP;frac12;-pound title by pumping a stunning 281 pounds
above her head.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is about to change the nature of U.S.-China trade
ties in a vote supporters say will add a critical element of stability to the
tumultuous relations between the world's most powerful and most populous
nations. Senate passage Tuesday of the PNTR, or permanent normal trade

Diabetes, HIV Drug Link Checked

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A French scientist described a new type of diabetes in

years, scientists have reported seeing HIV patients with diabetes who also have
a condition where fat collects in their abdomens while their faces and limbs
become abnormally thin. They have suspected that recently developed AIDS drugs

German Internet Tax Plan Blocked
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on Monday ruled out a tax on
Internet use that critics said would stifle the development of the Web in
Germany, Europe's biggest economy. In a speech to business leaders, Schroeder
quashed a new Finance Ministry rule floated last month to tax businesses every
time employees use company computers for private Internet surfing.
Telecommunications and computer firms had criticized the government for the tax
plan, arguing that it would be a bureaucratic nightmare that would discourage
many people from becoming familiar with the Internet.

<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A high-ranking Palestinian official said Monday that a U.S.
team was working on a position paper aimed at salvaging the Mideast peace deal,
which stalled over the sovereignty of a key Jerusalem shrine. Palestinian
negotiator Nabil Shaath, in the United States for consultations on the peace
process, said the paper would probably be completed by the end of this week.
Also in New York, Israeli Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said the Clinton
administration was expected to ''assess'' the status of the peace process after
separate talks this week with Palestinian and Israeli negotiators.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and North Korea, in another step toward
a smoother relationship, have agreed to resume talks on three key issues --
missile proliferation, nuclear weapons and terrorism -- next week, a senior U.S.
official said Monday. From the U.S. standpoint, while North Korea recently said
it would suspend its tests of long-range missiles in exchange for an easing of
U.S. sanctions, the talks beginning Sept. 27 in New York are designed to halt
the spread of North Korean technology to Iran, Iraq and Pakistan.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante denied reports
Monday that the nation's shadowy intelligence chief has been detained, saying
the military was not holding the vilified and powerful figure who is at the
center of a political scandal. Earlier Monday, independent radio station CPN
reported that spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos had been detained on orders of the
commander of Peru's armed forces. Then, a lawyer who claimed he represented
Montesinos' sister alleged that her brother was being detained at the
headquarters of the National Intelligence Service.

of the 11th inning as Japan beat the United States 2-1 on Tuesday (Monday night
EDT) to snap the U.S. softball team's 112-game winning streak. Richardson's
second error came as she tried to cut off a throw to second to guard against a
double steal.

<HEADLINE> Japan 7, Australia 3 in Baseball  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Yoshinori Okihara's three-run homer
overcame a three-run shot by Australia's Dave Nilsson and rallied
Japan to a 7-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson's three-run homer off Tomohiro Kuroki put Australia
ahead 3-1 in the third inning Tuesday (Monday night EDT) and
brought the loudest ovation from the home crowd of 13,903 -- the
largest in the first three days of the Olympic tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson, an All-Star catcher with Milwaukee in 1999, played in
Japan this year so he could represent his homeland in the Olympics.
He's having a solid tournament after an up-and-down season the
Chunichi Dragons.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson went 2-for-4 with a homer and a double Tuesday, leaving
him 6-for-12 in three games with three doubles and one homer. He
has driven in seven of Australia's 12 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Okihara, a shortstop who has played six seasons in Japan's
industrial leagues, went 4-for-5 with two singles, an RBI double
and the three-run homer that let Japan (2-1) take control in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Australians (1-2) managed only five hits in eight innings
off Kuroki, a right-hander who became the ace of the Chiba Lotte
Marines' staff when Hideki Irabu left for the major leagues in
1997, signing with the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Kuroki is one of four pitchers from Japan's major leagues on its
Olympic staff, one of the main reasons it's a medal favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hutton, a right-hander who pitched in the major leagues,
most recently with the Cincinnati Reds in 1998, let Japan tie it at
3 in the fifth on Okihara's RBI double and a sacrifice fly.
Okihara's homer highlighted a four-run sixth off Mark Ettles.

<HEADLINE> Reds 7, Giants 1  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Osvaldo Fernandez pitched a four-hitter for
his first complete game in four years, outdueling Shawn Estes for
his first win since May 30 as the Cincinnati Reds beat the San
Francisco Giants 7-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, who lost for just the fourth time in September,
opened an eight-game homestand during which they hope to clinch the
NL West title. They still hold the majors' best record at 89-60.
</P>
<P>
   But they were stymied by a former teammate making his third
start since a two-month stint in the minors and on the disabled
list.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez (3-3), who went 10-17 with the Giants from 1996-97,
kept the potent San Francisco offense quiet with surprising ease.
San Francisco got just one runner to second base before the ninth,
when Barry Bonds hit a two-out RBI double. The Giants lost at home
for just the second time in 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   It was Fernandez's first complete game since Aug. 25, 1996,
against Montreal, while he was pitching for the Giants, and the
third of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ochoa had four hits, scored three runs and drove in another
for the Reds, who won their fourth straight and eighth in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, who has 17 hits in his last 32 at-bats (.531) while
trying to win the Reds' right-field spot for next year, extended
his hitting streak to a career-high nine games with the second
four-hit game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Benito Santiago hit a ninth-inning homer and drove in three runs
for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati handed Estes (15-5) just his second loss since June
10. Estes, who allowed nine hits and four runs while walking three
and striking out six, led the majors in winning percentage before
the game and had won three straight.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's three-run fifth inning was prolonged when Bonds ran
toward Sean Casey's drive into left field but made an awkward slide
and missed the ball. It bounced into the seats, and Cincinnati then
scored two-out runs on Ochoa's double and Santiago's single.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds played their seventh straight game without Ken Griffey
Jr., who didn't take a scheduled batting practice session before
the game. Griffey, who partially tore his left hamstring last week,
will try to hit again on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Estes dropped into a tie with Randy Johnson for the NL lead
in winning percentage. Boston's Pedro Martinez (17-5, .773) leads
the majors. ... The Giants drew the 3 millionth fan to Pacific Bell
Park on Monday night, increasing the franchise's season attendance
record and also setting a record for any Bay Area sports team. The
lucky fan was 76-year-old Peggy Long of Vallejo, Calif., who won
season tickets in 1985 and has been a faithful fan ever since. ...
The Reds got their first win at Pac Bell. They were swept in a
three-game series earlier this year. ... Bill Mueller leaned over a
sideline railing to make a nifty grab of Ochoa's pop foul in the
seventh.

<HEADLINE> End of West Nile Spraying Sought  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A woman who said she could barely speak after
pesticide hit her face was among witnesses called by
environmentalists who hope to convince a judge to block the city's
all-out attack against the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge John S. Martin is expected to rule
later in the week on whether the groups can at least temporarily
block the city from continuing to spray pesticides on
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The pesticide ''is very dangerous, particularly in the manner in
which the city is applying it,'' Robert K. Simon, an environmental
and toxicological scientist from Fairfax, Va., told the judge at a
hearing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the West Nile virus killed seven people in the New
York City metropolitan area. This year, 11 people have been
diagnosed with the mosquito-borne virus in New York City and one in
New Jersey. None has died.
</P>
<P>
   Inga Van Eysten, a lawyer for the city, said public health
agencies at every level of government have supported the city's
spraying campaign and its efforts to educate the public about the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very real problem,'' she said. ''We are proceeding in a
way that ensures the public health will be protected and which
follows all applicable laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Eysten said city officials were doing their duty by ordering the
spraying of neighborhoods across the city to kill infected
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon said the spraying was a mistake because the pesticides
have immediate damaging effects on people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The same thing that happens to mosquitoes happens to humans,''
he said. ''All of your muscles start twitching. It starts affecting
your respiratory system.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Felthem, a Staten Island resident, said she was struck by
pesticide when she opened her door at 9:30 p.m. on Aug. 27,
thinking spraying would not start until 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I closed the door and immediately washed my face'' she said.
''My eyes began tearing. I felt a tightness in my chest. My voice
was getting weaker. Within an hour, my voice was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her voice was recovering but she will not go into her
backyard until she is confident spraying is over.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Rowan Barrett doesn't want to know
anything about the men's Olympic basketball tournament except that
Canada is unbeaten and Spain is next on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know the format purposely and when anyone starts
talking about it, my ears are closed,'' Barrett said after scoring
21 points in Canada's 99-54 victory over Angola on Tuesday (Monday
night EDT). ''I'll just let things take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   After Canada upset the host country in the opening game,
suddenly the talk is of it being a medal contender, something the
team felt coming in although few of those predicting the medalists
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our team is focused on the process here and we're happy with
that,'' said Barrett, who played at St. John's and now plays
professionally in Venezuela. ''As long as we stay focused on that,
whether we're playing Australia, Angola or the U.S., it will stay
the same.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no letdown against Angola (0-2) in Canada's first game
since the 101-90 victory over Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm more relieved than glad,'' said Canada coach Jay Triano,
who played on the country's last Olympic team in 1988. ''This was
one of those games you can only lose. We did what we had to do to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant getting off to a good start and Barrett was a big
part of that, scoring 13 points as Canada took a 23-9 lead in the
opening 7&AMP;frac12; minutes and then stretched the lead to 50-29 at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash of the Dallas Mavericks had nine points and five
assists against Angola. He has 20 assists in Canada's two games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve and I have been playing together since we were 16, 17
years old so we've been together for a while and our games
complement each other,'' said Barrett, 27. ''He really makes it
happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada shot 62 percent from the field (34-for-55) against
Angola, including 9-for-19 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Carvalho led Angola with 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   The talk of the medal round is now circulating around the
Canadian team. Before the Olympics, it was only the Canadian
players talking about it. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't get caught up in that. We just have to play each
game,'' Triano said. ''This is always a crazy tournament. Things
always happen.''
</P>
<P>
China 75, New Zealand 60
</P>
<P>
   Wang Zhizhi, at 7-foot-1 the middle-sized of the three players
who make up the formidable ''Great Wall,'' had 19 points, including
seven in the 12-0 run that gave China 52-37 lead with 11 minutes to
play.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand (0-2) opened the second half with a 7-0 run to get
within 40-37. Then Wang keyed the decisive run, capping it with a
three-point play on an authoritative drive to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Hu Weidong added 16 points for China (1-1), while 7-5 Yao Ming
had eight points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Marks, who played at California, and Mark Dickel, who plays
at UNLV, each had 13 points for New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Russia 71, Spain 63
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Tchialkine scored 23 points to lead Russia (1-1), which
dominated the game inside. Alexander Bachminov's driving basket
with 6:23 to play gave Russia the lead for good at 56-55 and were
the first of six straight points inside.
</P>
<P>
   Spain (1-1) got within 66-63, but Russia went 4-for-5 from the
free throw line during the final 53 seconds, including 4-0f-4 by
Sergei Panov, his only points of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Kirilenko had 16 points and nine rebounds for Russia,
which finished with a 32-14 advantage in scoring in the paint and
outrebounded Spain 38-26.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Herreros had 13 points for Spain. Starting guard Ignacio
Rodriguez injured his right hand early in the second half and
didn't play again. Rodriguez, who returned to the bench with a wrap
on his hand, had three points and three rebounds.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- On a day when she needed help from her
Olympic teammates, U.S softball pitcher Michele Smith didn't get
much -- and the team's 112-game winning streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Seles, after winning her first Sydney match, said she
expects better from her powerful women's tennis teammates. And
boxer Jose Navarro, who won his fight Tuesday (Monday night EDT),
was just keeping up with his undefeated teammates in the Sydney
Games.
</P>
<P>
   At the softball competition, Smith and teammate Christa Williams
threw a combined 10 shutout innings -- but the Americans stranded a
staggering 20 baserunners in an 11-inning, 2-1 loss to Japan. It
was the first loss for the U.S. women, the gold medal winners in
Atlanta, since the 1998 world championships.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of errors by Dot Richardson led to Japan's two runs off
Smith in the 11th, when Jennifer Brundage and Stacey Nuveman struck
out looking with the tying run on base for the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is now 3-0 in Olympic competition, while the United States
dropped to 2-1. But the loss doesn't diminish the team's gold medal
hopes, as the top four in the eight-team tournament advance to the
medal round.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S TENNIS: Seles, the first of the American women's
tennis ''Dream Team'' on the court in Australia, needed just 48
minutes Tuesday to win her Olympic opener, 6-0, 6-1 over Katalin
Marosi-Aracama of Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   She then wasted no time in hailing her teammates: top-seeded
Lindsay Davenport, the 1996 gold medalist, and second-seeded Venus
Williams in singles; Williams and her sister, Serena, in doubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't imagine a better team,'' Seles said. ''Everybody is
playing their best, and coming from the U.S. Open, we're all pumped
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S TENNIS: Todd Martin, making his Olympic debut at age 30,
was eliminated from the tennis tournament by Rainer Schuttler of
Germany 6-2, 6-0. Martin lost the final eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Following him quickly to the exit was Vince Spadea, who replaced
the injured Andre Agassi on the U.S. team. Australian Pat Rafter,
to the delight of the partisan crowd, made short work of Spadea in
straight sets, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: Another match, another victory. Navarro scored the
Americans' seventh consecutive victory in the first round of the
Olympics, scoring a 16-10 victory over 112-pounder Hermensen Ballo
of Indonesia. Navarro has won nine silver medals in assorted
competitions, but hopes to finally grab a gold.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MISSING WEIGHTLIFTER: One of the two Romanian weightlifters
banned from the Olympics after a positive steroid test has
disappeared. Traian Ciharean, who was banned for life after the
second positive test of his career, vanished Monday after refusing
a plane trip home from the Romanian Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   -- EQUESTRIAN: Three steady rounds of show-jumping produced a
bronze medal for the American equestrian team. Australia won the
gold, while Britain finished second in the three-day jumping event.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SWIMMING: The Flying Dutchman was at it again.
</P>
<P>
   One day after his stunning gold medal victory over Aussie Ian
Thorpe, Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands was fastest
swimmer Tuesday (Monday night EDT) in the 100-meter freestyle
preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband crashed what was billed as a two-man party
between American Gary Hall Jr. and Russian Alexander Popov, who
waged a memorable sprint final at the 1996 Atlanta Games. Both also
qualified for the semifinals in the race; Popov is the two-time
defending gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   The finals were set for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Moussambani of Equatorial Guinea didn't qualify, but he
competed -- and that was enough. The 22-year-old, who trains in a
20-meter pool with no lanes in his west African homeland, finished
more than a minute behind the leaders in his first attempt at
swimming 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 200 breaststroke, 19-year-old Kyle Salyards was the
lone American to advance.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, 21-year-old American Misty Hyman was top
qualifier in the women's 200 butterfly, edging out world record
holder Susie O'Neill of Australia. Kaitlin Sandeno, 17, of Lake
Forest, Calif., also qualified for the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband showed no ill effects from his medal-winning
200-meter performance against Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   In that same session, heavily favored U.S. swimmer Lenny
Krayzelburg zipped across the pool in an Olympic-record 53.72
seconds to win the 100-meter backstroke. Krayzelburg's quick trip
completed a lengthy journey that took him from Ukraine to the
United States to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Joining him as a gold medalist was American Megan Quann, who won
the 100-meter breaststroke. The 17-year-old backed up her boast of
knocking off defending champion Penny Heyns of South Africa in the
100 breaststroke -- although she did not break Heyns' world record
of 1:06.52.
</P>
<P>
   In the 200 freestyle, the Dutch swimmer threw a ''Hoogie'' into
plans of the ''Thorpedo'' for Olympic dominance. Van den
Hoogenband, aka Hoogie, upset Australian teen sensation Thorpe, who
had to settle for a silver after winning two golds.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had five golds after three days of the
eight-day swimming meet.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BEACH VOLLEYBALL: In barely enough time to break a sweat --
less than 20 minutes -- Americans Rob Heidger and Kevin Wong kept
their medal hopes alive with a quick 15-2 victory over France's
Jean-Philippe Jodard and Christian Penigaud. The U.S. pair now has
a chance to advance to the final 16 with another victory.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S GYMNASTICS: The U.S. gymnastic team's 16-year Olympic
losing streak was quickly extended for another four years. The
Americans finished fifth in the team competition, sending them home
with no team medal yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to judge this team's success by anybody else's
standards,'' said John Roethlisberger, a three-time Olympian in his
last games. ''They're A-1 in my book.''
</P>
<P>
   In the score book, they were No. 5 as the gold medal went to
China. Ukraine won the silver medal, and defending gold medalist
Russia took the silver.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have not won a team medal in a non-boycotted
Olympics since 1932.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BASEBALL: The mercy rule was invoked after the top of the
seventh, and it couldn't have come soon enough for South Africa.
Right-hander Jon Rauch struck out 13 and John Cotton drove in five
runs as the unbeaten United States (2-0) won 11-1. Under Olympic
rules, a 10-run lead in the seventh or later stops a game.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WOMEN'S WATER POLO: Maureen O'Toole and the U.S. women have a
new Olympic experience to handle -- losing. The home pool advantage,
with a raucous local crowd, was too much to overcome as the
Australians defeated the Americans 7-6. It was the women's first
defeat in Sydney, leaving their record at 2-1-1
</P>
<P>
   The Americans fell to Australia and its raucous home crowd, 7-6
on Tuesday (Monday night EDT), their first water polo defeat at the
Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- WEIGHTLIFTING: Mexico has won its first medal of any kind in
the Olympic sport of ... weightlifting? Yes. Soraya Jimenez of
Mexico won the 127&AMP;frac12;-pound title by pumping a stunning 281 pounds
above her head.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 2, Diamondbacks 1  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Kevin Elster homered with two
out in the ninth inning Monday night to give the Los Angeles
Dodgers a 2-1 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Elster, batting for Alex Cora, drove a 1-1 pitch from Greg
Swindell (2-6) over the fence in left. Swindell, who started the
ninth, was the fourth Arizona pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw (3-4) pitched the ninth for Los Angeles, which kept
Arizona five games behind New York, the NL wild card leader.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown allowed six hits in seven shutout innings with eight
strikeouts and one walk. He has held teams to fewer than two earned
runs in 13 of 31 starts this season, but got no-decisions in six of
those. He is 6-1 in the others.
</P>
<P>
   He has been particularly effective against Arizona, giving up
fewer than three earned runs in nine of 10 career starts. But seven
of those also resulted in no decisions, and he remained 3-0 against
the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Armando Reynoso gave up one run and four hits in six
innings, struck out three and walked two. He is 0-4 in his last six
starts since beating Philadelphia on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles went ahead in the fourth on singles by Mark
Grudzielanek and Shawn Green singled and Eric Karros. Reynoso
appeared to pick off Grudzielanek at second, but umpire Ed Rapuano
called him safe and he scored on Karros' hit.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona scored in the eighth off Mike Fetters when Tony Womack
singled, took second on a groundout and scored on Luis Gonzalez's
single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The game was the first on the Diamondbacks' longest road
trip of the year. They play three in Los Angeles, five in San
Francisco and four at Colorado, including one makeup game at San
Francisco and another at Denver. ... The Dodgers have five players
with 20 or more homers for the first time since 1979. Gary
Sheffield has 41, Eric Karros 30, Shawn Green 24, Todd Hundley 23
and Adrian Beltre 20. The only other time the Dodgers had five
players with 20 or more was when Ron Cey, Steve Garvey and Davey
Lopes hit 28 homers each, Dusty Baker hit 23 and Joe Ferguson 20.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Yun Mi-jin led a South Korean sweep in
women's individual archery Tuesday, defeating Kim Nam-soon in the
championship match.
</P>
<P>
   Yun, 17, is still eligible for junior competition. She broke the
Olympic record by five points by scoring 173 earlier in the day.
Her score also broke the junior division world record.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who lost the final 107-106, scored a total of 334 to break
the Olympic record of 330 set by Kim Kyung-wook of South Korea, at
the 1996 Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Soo-nyung beat Choe Ok Sil of North Korea, 103-101, for the

<HEADLINE> Beach Volleyball: U.S. Men Win Easy  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Americans Rob Heidger and Kevin Wong
kept their medal hopes alive in men's beach volleyball, splitting
two consolation matches but appearing certain to advance.
</P>
<P>
   They scored a quick 15-2 victory over France's Jean-Philippe
Jodard and Christian Penigaud in their first consolation match
Tuesday, then lost 15-11 to top-seeded Julien Prosser and Lee
Zahner of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, Heidger and Wong looked certain to advance
with the best point difference, plus 7, among the teams that
dropped their second consolation matches.
</P>
<P>
   There was one consolation match remaining -- Fabio Diez and
Javier Bosma of Spain vs. the Czech pair of Michal Palinek and
Martin Lebl, who were second in point difference with plus 5.
</P>
<P>
   The victory automatically put Prosser and Zahner in the final
16, along with Oliver Stamm and Nikolas Berger of Austria, who
defeated the Australian duo of Matthew Grinlaubs and Joshua Slack
15-10.
</P>
<P>
   Heidger and Wong crushed Penigaud and Jodard in less than 20
minutes in their first match Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The match ended the beach volleyball careers of Jodard and
Penigaud, who previously announced that the Olympics would be their
final tournament. They confirmed that decision after losing the
quickest match so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to know when it's time to stop,'' said Jodard, 34, a
two-time Olympian. ''For us, it's time. We're not so young now.''
</P>
<P>
   A loss would have ended the tournament for Heidger and Wong,
following a first-round upset defeat in a match they led 14-9
before failing to convert five match points and falling 17-15 to
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they made sure of the result early, storming to an
11-1 lead after 14 minutes and finishing off the French with
dominating net play that included six blocks -- four by Heidger and
two by Wong.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans -- both 6-foot-8 -- never gave Jodard and Penigaud
openings, causing the French to try lobs and angle shots that went
wide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to come out strong early and try not to let this team
build momentum,'' Heidger said. ''I thought we stayed focused
throughout and prevented them from getting any rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Heidger and Wong faced Jodard and
Penigaud, and Heidger said he was sorry that it had to be in the
final match for the French.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gets tough when you're competing against someone you've
established a personal relationship with,'' he said. ''I'm sorry we
had to beat them in their final game. They're a couple of class,
great guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Prosser and Zahner, the Americans stormed to a 9-4 lead,
then saw the Australians battle back to tie them at nine and forge
ahead. By scoring nine points, Heidger and Wong apparently had
secured their spot in the final 16.
</P>
<P>
   Prosser and Zahner defeated Norway's Jan Kvalheim and Bjorn
Maaseide 15-12 in their first consolation match. After that match,
Kvalheim announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the playback system, the 12 first-round losers compete for
four places in the final 16, with the 12 first-round winners
filling the other slots.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday (Sunday EDT), teams from Germany, Italy, Cuba and
China made it through the losers' bracket to join both U.S. teams
and the other first-round winners in the women's final 16.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis, the third-seeded
Americans, will face the Cuban duo of Tamara Larrea and Dalixia
Fernandez Thursday (Wednesday night EDT). The Cubans beat China's
Zhang Jingkun and Tian Jia 15-12, then overpowered the Yanchulova
sisters -- Lina and Petia -- of Bulgaria 15-3 on Monday to stay
alive.
</P>
<P>
   The other U.S. team, fourth-seeded Holly McPeak and Misty May,
will meet Lucilla Perrotta and Daniela Gattelli of Italy, who
advanced by beating Yukiko Ishizaka and Chie Seike of Japan 15-5
and then ousting Zi Xiong and Rong Chi of China 15-9.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong: I've Almost Recovered  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- American cycling star Lance Armstrong
is ready to ride in the Olympics, declaring himself almost fully
recovered from a broken neck vertebra from a training crash last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Although his neck remains stiff, the two-time Tour de France
winner said Tuesday he'll be ready for the Sept. 27 road race and
the Sept. 30 time trial, an event in which he's among the gold
medal favorites and one he's tailored his training to fit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The neck is a slight problem,'' Armstrong told a news
conference filled with dozens of reporters. ''It's probably about
90 percent right now. I can still ride. I can still train and I
will be able to race. Sitting on a time trial bike is not a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 29, broke the bone when he collided with a car Aug.
28 while training on a remote road in France. A time trial victory
last weekend at the Grand Prix des Nations in northern France
convinced Armstrong he was fit for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, is to win a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was only one reason to come and that's to win,'' he
said. ''I've never been to Australia, and while it looks like it
would be a nice place for a vacation, that's not the reason I
came.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, of Austin, Texas, is riding at the Olympics for the
third time. He placed 14th in the road race at Barcelona. At the
Atlanta Games, he was sixth in the time trial and 12th in the road
race.
</P>
<P>
   However, Armstrong competed in Atlanta while he unwittingly was
battling testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain.
His illness was diagnosed two months after he rode at the games.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barcelona feels like a really long time ago ... and in
Atlanta, at the time, I was very sick but I still expected to ride
well,'' he said. ''To come back a third time is very special to me,
mainly because of the illness in Atlanta that I didn't know
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Something about arriving in Sydney felt right to Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was telling my wife when we got here last night it feels
better this time,'' he said. ''I don't know why but I didn't feel
at home in Barcelona and I didn't feel at home even in Atlanta.
Last night, it was a good feeling when we landed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Armstrong took a training ride to inspect
the road course. He was concerned the injury could affect him more
during the mass-start road race than in the time trial, where
riders are timed individually on a 29-mile circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physically, I feel great. My conditioning is close to 100
percent,'' he said. ''The scary part is trying to avoid another
crash on the injury. But preparation-wise, conditioning-wise,
everything's great.''

<HEADLINE> Men's Volleyball: Russia 3, U.S. 1  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- At least the latest loss for the
beleaguered U.S. men's volleyball team was to a highly regarded
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team showed vast improvement after its surprising
opening-round defeat, but still dropped to 0-2 in Olympic pool play
by losing to a powerful Russian squad Tuesday, 25-18, 25-23, 21-25,
25-17.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can still get out of this group, in my mind,'' said U.S.
coach Doug Beal. ''And the players have to believe that, and we
have to make them believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has beaten the Americans seven out of eight times they've
played since the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat doesn't hurt the U.S. team nearly as much as its
four-game loss to Argentina on Sunday, because it would have taken
a near-perfect effort to stop the efficient Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans still can advance from Group B into the
quarterfinals, but they must beat a tough Yugoslav team Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to bring it for sure against Yugoslavia,'' said U.S.
setter Lloy Ball, who tried in vain to spark his teammates by
hollering wide-eyed at them after points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll have to work with them tonight, make sure there's no head
hanging,'' he said. ''As hard as it's going to be, you've got to
forget this loss, because it does us no good to think about it when
we're playing Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia, like the United States, is trying to re-establish itself
as an elite volleyball program. The Russians have won three of the
nine Olympic gold medals awarded in the sport, but none since 1980.
They were seventh in Barcelona and fourth in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team corrected most of the serving and hitting mistakes
that plagued them the first time out. But Russians Sergei Tetokin
and 7-foot-1 Alexei Kazakov simply got too many easy sets from
Konstantin Ushakov.
</P>
<P>
   Even on an off night by star hitter Roman Yakovlev, Russia had
more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure that there was a lot of pressure on the guys feeling
like we let one get away against Argentina,'' Beal said. ''That's a
team we probably should have expected to win against in our
group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who won gold in 1984 and '88, started fast, and
the first game was a duel of high jumps and crashing, uncontested
spikes.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Lambert, possibly America's best pure hitter, had a better
match than against Argentina, when his timing was off and he lost
confidence. Two straight slams by Lambert put the U.S. team ahead
10-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian blocking began to take over, however, with Kazakov
shadowing powerful George Roumain. As in the opening match, the
emotional Roumain was frustrated early when his shots were being
drilled back in his face.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans trailed by four, but got back to 18-17 before
falling apart. Kazakov stopped a shot by Roumain, then had an easy
kill to give the Russians a 23-17 lead. Igor Cholepov converted two
straight shots for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert did make a few mistakes late, and he said he's
demoralized about his play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously I'm not satisfied at all,'' he said. ''The game
feels really hard for me right now.''
</P>
<P>
   After dropping the close second game, the Americans -- with the
6-foot-7, 255-pound Roumain getting an easy kill, followed by
another from Lambert -- won 25-21.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth set wasn't close, and in the waning moments the venue
PA system played an appropriate tune: the theme from ''Mission:
Impossible.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - William Brian Little, an investment banker and
founding partner of the leveraged-buyout firm Forstmann Little,
died Sunday of a heart attack. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   Little graduated from Colgate University and Harvard Business
School. He began his career on Wall Street with White Weld &AMP; Co.,
mainly in the company's Los Angeles office. He moved back to New
York in the late 1970s, after the company was bought by Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he moved from Merrill Lynch and joined Theodore
Forstmann and Nicholas Forstmann to form Forstmann Little, which
relied primarily on equity financing to pay for the companies it
bought.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1980 and 1992, the firm and its limited partners
invested a total of $1 billion in 18 deals, reaping a return of
about $5 billion. The successes included the Dr Pepper Co. and the
Topps Co., which makes bubble gum and sports cards.
</P>
<P>
   Little retired in 1994.

<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A powerful bomb ripped through a
crowded market Tuesday morning, killing at least 11 people and
wounding more than 60 in Pakistan's capital, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb exploded while workers were unloading grapes from a
truck, witnesses said. The blast damaged several shops and
triggered a stampede of workers and shoppers from the market, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the explosion,
and police said no arrests had been made. Officer Rao Iqbal
confirmed the toll of dead and injured.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable market was in a relatively poor part of the city,
and many of the workers were refugees from Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has been plagued by political violence and factional
fighting for years. However, there has been relatively little
unrest since Gen. Pervez Musharraf took power in a coup that ousted
an elected civilian government last October.
</P>
<P>
   The capital, Islamabad, has also traditionally been calm even
when other Pakistani cities were aflame.

<HEADLINE> Albright Wants A Woman President  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Publicly and privately, Madeleine Albright has
used her position as secretary of state to promote women in top
jobs and support those who have cracked the glass ceiling. And she
is now pledging to do everything she can to help a woman become
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Albright herself might be a natural candidate, she is
barred by the U.S. Constitution from becoming president because she
was born abroad. Because the presidency isn't a possibility for
her, she says she's never thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   But she said Monday that she believes foreign-born Americans
''ought to have the opportunity to serve at the highest level.''
And she said women in every country of the world should also have
that right.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on nearly four years as the first woman to direct
U.S. foreign policy, Albright said she discovered that being a
woman didn't matter when it came to representing the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''They respect the United States, and the gender issue does not
come up,'' she told a meeting co-sponsored by The White House
Project, which is dedicated to having a qualified woman
successfully run for the presidency within the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be honest, I find American men more difficult to deal with
than the foreign men,'' she said, to applause and laughter from
many of the 200 women in the audience at The New York Times, which
also sponsored the event.
</P>
<P>
   With just four months to go before the Clinton administration
leaves office, Albright said she doesn't believe ''that women are
better, purer, kinder.'' What she will keep fighting for -- even
after leaving the State Department -- is the right of women in every
society to ''first-class citizenship,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In fact, I believe that of all the forces that will shape the
world of the 21st century, the movement to recognize and realize
the rights of women will be among the most powerful,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Albright was young, she said, ''I was never sure I believed
in role models because I never had any. There were very few women
role models.''
</P>
<P>
   She was born Marie Korbelova in Prague in 1937. Her father was a
Czech diplomat who took his family to London as Germany took over
their homeland at the start of World War II. The family moved to
Denver in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   She admired U.S. first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, but if she had a
role model it was her father -- and like him she became a foreign
policy expert.
</P>
<P>
   When Albright came to the United Nations as U.S. ambassador in
1993, she recalled having her secretary invite the other female
ambassadors to lunch, not knowing how many there were.
</P>
<P>
   Six turned up. With Albright, this ''Group of Seven'' as they
called themselves -- adopting the name of the seven most powerful
industrialized nations -- made a pledge to always take each other's
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said this G-7 succeeded in getting two women elected
judges at the international war crimes tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda -- important because many of the crimes,
including rape, were against women.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton selected her to be the first female
secretary of state, after 63 males, Albright said one of the first
things she did was visit a local public school and read a story
entitled ''Girls Can Do Anything.''
</P>
<P>
   She also started a similar group of female foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started, there were seven of us,'' she said. Now there
are 15. Again, the same rule: Always return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   State Department colleagues have sometimes wondered, for
instance, why she will never refuse a call from the foreign
minister of Liechtenstein, which is not exactly a powerhouse in the
global arena.
</P>
<P>
   But Albright said ''the most moving moment for me'' was when
Liechtenstein's foreign minister, Andrea Willi, told her she helped
a lot in solving some problems ''because I had sworn I would take
her phone call.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But most of all, I love the girls ... who come up and say,
'you are really making a difference for us,''' she said. ''It's
just the biggest thrill of all.''
</P>
<P>
   But she said there's a lot of hard work ahead, both domestically
and internationally, to achieve real equality for women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody is going to give this to us, and our daughters have
forgotten how hard some of us have worked,'' said Albright, a
mother of three daughters. ''It never stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that there will be a woman president sooner rather
than later,'' Albright said.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Debt-Reduction Measure  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans are hailing House passage of a
bill aimed at funneling 90 percent of next year's surplus to debt
reduction as a victory in their battle against President Clinton
and big-spending Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the pre-election measure is anything but. And in
fact, the bill signals that Republicans are ready to spend billions
more in fiscal 2001 than the budget they pushed through Congress
earlier this year was to allow.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved the measure Monday by 381-3, with only Reps.
Alan Mollohan, D-W.Va., Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and Martin Sabo,
D-Minn., voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope this overwhelming vote encourages the president to
embrace our proposal,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
said in a written statement. ''The president should abandon his
effort to spend the surplus and instead join the common-sense
coalition that is working to refund the surplus though debt
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's own budget also proposed using 90 percent of next
year's surplus for debt reduction. But as Congress tries to
complete must-pass spending bills and adjourn for the year, Clinton
is seeking billions more in spending than Republicans have so far
approved.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the measure is likely to die in the Senate under the
weight of Democratic delaying tactics, House Democrats voted for
the measure en masse. But they called it a GOP ploy aimed at
salvaging a year in which their chief push, for tax cuts, has been
largely blunted. Clinton vetoed the two biggest Republican
tax-cutting measures -- reducing levies for many married couples and
for people who inherit large estates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republicans switched position in midair,'' said Rep. Jim
McDermott, D-Wash. ''They've been reading the polls, and they
figured out the American people don't want tax cuts for the wealthy
few. What they want is to pay down the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation calls for setting aside about $240 billion for
debt reduction, or about 90 percent of the $268 billion overall
surplus the Congressional Budget Office expects in the coming
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. That includes the entire
projected Social Security and Medicare surpluses, plus an
additional $42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave $28 billion of next year's projected surplus
for tax cuts and extra spending that lawmakers and Clinton will
negotiate in the waning weeks of this year's session of Congress.
Republicans have said they want to use that money half for
spending, half for tax cuts, though DeLay told reporters that the
proportions are negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both parties have already pledged to not spend the
Social Security and Medicare surpluses for anything but debt
reduction -- meaning that about $198 billion of the debt reduction
would likely occur anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also contended that the proposal marks an abandonment
of GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, whose tax-cutting plans
would eat up far more than 10 percent of projected surpluses.
Republicans say their plan would not interfere with Bush because
their legislation applies only to next year.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, the measure represents an abandonment of the
spending limits Republicans wrote into the budget for the coming
fiscal year that Congress approved last April.
</P>
<P>
   That budget was to limit spending for fiscal 2001 discretionary
programs to $625 billion. Those programs -- financed in the 13
annual spending bills -- cover everything but automatically paid
benefits such as Medicare and interest payments to holders of
Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure approved Monday would go well beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office's $268 billion surplus estimate
for next year that Republicans are using assumes that discretionary
spending would be $638 billion -- $13 billion higher than the GOP's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Republicans say they would allow an additional
$14 billion for spending out of the $28 billion in surplus dollars
that would not have to be used for debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   That would total $652 billion in spending, or 4 percent more
than the $625 billion in the 2001 budget.
</P>
<P>
   That would also be 7 percent more than the $608 billion expected
to be spent this year.

<HEADLINE> Asian Leaders Denounce Lee Case  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The government's handling of the Wen Ho Lee case
was ''tainted by racism'' and played up stereotypes, Asian-American
civic leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers at a town hall meeting before the President's Advisory
Commission on Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders on Monday
alleged that the 60-year-old Taiwan-born scientist was unfairly
singled out by prosecutors because of his Chinese background.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is one stereotype about Asian-Americans that has
fueled racism and discriminatory treatment, it is that Asians are
perpetual foreigners whose loyalties to this country are always in
question,'' said Margaret Fung, executive director of the Asian
American Legal Defense and Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''Asian-Americans have rallied to support Dr. Wen Ho Lee because
of the realization that this type of racial scapegoating could
happen to any of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, fired from his job at the Los Alamos weapons lab in March
1999, pleaded guilty to one count of mishandling classified
material and was set free last week. The federal government dropped
58 other felony counts that once charged him with endangering
nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The town meeting at New York University's law school was the
second of four planned meetings before the commission. The first
took place in Los Angeles in July. No date has been set for the
next meeting in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday that Lee's nine-month pretrial
detention conflicted with America's disdain for ''abusive executive
authority,'' but added that he had not seen evidence of racial
profiling in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The speakers disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's prosecution of Dr. Wen Ho Lee was politically
motivated and tainted by racism from the start,'' Fung said. ''The
government officials responsible for this debacle must be held
accountable for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor in the Lee case was the scarcity of Asians in
leadership positions at the Los Alamos lab, said Henry Tang,
president of the Committee of 100, an organization of
Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''The national laboratories, despite decades of heavy
Asian-American employment, have almost nonexistent Asian-American
management at the director or deputy director levels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tang urged the federal government to investigate the case ''so
that this whole national shame will never be repeated again.''

<HEADLINE> Concerns Raised Over Education Theft  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers are demanding that Education
Department officials explain how $1.9 million meant for children
who live on Indian reservations and military bases apparently was
diverted to buy a Maryland house, a Cadillac and other items.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second time this year that department officials have
had to contend with large-scale fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just makes you furious,'' said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.,
a longtime critic of department bookkeeping who's seeking to
legislate a congressional audit. ''This is just one more time that
shows the need for somebody to get serious about cleaning up
Department of Education finances.''
</P>
<P>
   In a civil action filed in July, the Justice Department alleges
that $1.9 million intended for two school districts in South Dakota
was diverted on March 31 into two bank accounts in Upper Marlboro,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filing says the money placed into those
two accounts was used to draw cashier's checks to pay $46,900 for a
Cadillac Escalade, more than $50,000 for a Lincoln Navigator and
$135,000 for a house in Maryland. The document says the rest was
diverted into other bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Education Department officials said Monday they could not
comment on ongoing cases, but department investigators were
expected to testify Tuesday before the House Education and
Workforce Committee about auditing problems at the department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have to empty the pop machines to make payroll, but
it came close,'' said Chris Anderson, superintendent of the
600-student Bennett County Schools system in Martin, S.D., which
along with Wagner Community Schools in Wagner, S.D., was left
waiting a month for its funds.
</P>
<P>
   Impact Aid is a $906 million department-run program meant to
help school districts educate children living on Indian
reservations or military installations. Such places are federal
lands that don't generate the local property taxes that usually
fund local school programs. In Bennett County schools, Anderson
says, the money helps pay for special programs such as universal
preschool and alternative classrooms for children with behavior
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department did not specify criminal charges in its
civil complaint, and Justice officials reached Monday could not
immediately confirm whether criminal actions had been initiated.
The civil complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Washington also
did not allege that Education Department employees were involved in
the theft.
</P>
<P>
   In May, federal officials discovered an employee theft ring that
bilked the department of more than $1 million in stolen equipment
and falsely reported overtime. Some employees have pleaded guilty
in the case; officials say other charges are pending.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been cooperating with Justice officials,'' said
Roberta Heine, Education Secretary Richard Riley's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In June, House lawmakers approved a bill directing the General
Accounting Office, Congress' auditing arm, to study department
accounts particularly prone to abuse. A Senate committee will
consider a similar move Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for the Senate sponsor of the bill, Tim Hutchinson,
R-Ark., say Senate leaders back the bill. It's not clear whether
President Clinton would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he has no choice; the litany of corruption in the
agency is just getting to be too long,'' said Hoekstra, who blames
past failed audits for creating an environment ripe for ''waste,
fraud and abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would be the only main education legislation to reach
Clinton's desk this year. The renewal of $15 billion in Education
Department programs, including Impact Aid, is caught in an
election-year deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Heat Wave Hits San Francisco Area  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE SMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sweltering temperatures strained
California's already overburdened power grid as residents fought to
find relief from a heat wave that's expected to last all week.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service on Monday reported record-breaking
temperatures in Oakland, where 92-degree temperatures broke a
record for the day of 88 set in 1984. Downtown San Francisco hit 91
by midday, a few degrees shy of the 94-degree record set in 1912.
The North Bay and inland areas felt the worst of the sizzling heat.
The mercury hit 100 degrees in Santa Rosa, 101 degrees in Napa and
102 degrees in Livermore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I plan to go into hibernation. I don't plan to do much this
afternoon,'' Sandra Threl Fall said while taking a morning walk
around Oakland's Lake Merritt.
</P>
<P>
   The weather service expects the highest temperatures to last
through Wednesday, then cool off a bit Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The California Independent System Operator, the agency that
manages the flow of electricity on California's power lines, on
Monday declared a Stage 2 emergency, which may mean voluntary
outages among some commercial and industrial customers. The agency
and power companies across the state have appealed to consumers to
reduce energy use.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Sacco, an architect who works out of her home, said she is
taking measures to conserve, but she won't turn off her computer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't afford to lose the business,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Parks and Recreation Department worker Jorge Paz looked for ways
to stay cool in Oakland. ''We're just trying to work the best we
can, then get in the shade. Work a little, then go to the shade.
Take care of yourself,'' Paz said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the bay in San Francisco, where summer usually means
overcast and chilly days, some were taken by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it would be rainy days, foggy days. I thought San
Francisco wasn't that hot,'' said Andy Wyss, a Swiss tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Others were enjoying themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''Days like this you have to eat outside,'' said Mike Leon, who
was on his lunch break. ''There's only 10 days a year you can
actually do it.''

<HEADLINE> Two Bombs Explode In Indonesia Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Two bombs exploded Tuesday near a
crowded market in the troubled eastern Indonesian town of Ambon,
sending hundreds of shoppers fleeing in panic.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were sent to a nearby Muslim hospital. It was not
immediately clear whether they were hurt by the blasts or in the
stampede by frightened townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said army troops created more panic when they fired
warning shots to control the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Ambon, the capital of Maluku province, has been wracked for
almost two years by violence between Muslims and Christians. Much
of the town has been devastated by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people of both faiths were at the market to buy
government-subsidized food. Bitter sectarian divisions usually keep
Muslims and Christians apart in Ambon, 1,600 miles northeast of
Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Troops were deployed on Ambon streets after the crowd dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the Ambon explosions were linked to a
series of unexplained bombings that have terrorized the national
capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, a car bomb exploded in the basement garage of
the local stock exchange, killing 15 people. On Aug. 1, another
bomb exploded outside the Philippine ambassador's residence,
killing two people and injuring dozens, including the envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Many have suggested the Jakarta bombings are the work of
supporters of ex-dictator Suharto, who is facing trial for massive
corruption during his 32-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the U.N.'s refugee agency said it had scaled back
its operations in Jakarta after the bombings in the capital -- and
after three of its foreign staff were killed in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugee's staff at its
Jakarta headquarters were sent home Tuesday because of security
fears, said the agency's head, Rene Van Rooyen.
</P>
<P>
   He said workers had been told to stay away from the office for
at least two days.
</P>
<P>
   Van Rooyen would not say if a direct threat had been made
against the office or any staff. He also declined to say how many
workers were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.N. foreign aid workers and three Indonesians were
murdered in the West Timor border town of Atambua by an
anti-independence mob on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The militias are intent on destabilizing U.N.-administered East
Timor's transition to self-rule and preventing 120,000 East
Timorese refugees languishing in squalid camps near the border from
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor broke away from Indonesia last year after its people
voted overwhelmingly to secede in a U.N.-sponsored ballot.

<HEADLINE> Kids Invited To Miss. Flag Debate  </HEADLINE>
By GINA HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Mississippi school children will get a
chance to propose less racially charged state flag designs -- or
argue why the current banner used for more than 100 years should be
kept.
</P>
<P>
   A flag study commission voted Monday to open the debate to
public and private high school students. The commission also agreed
to have hearings around the state this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Students will be encouraged to draw new flag designs, write
essays on why the flag that features the Confederate battle banner
should be left unchanged or explain why a new symbol is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. William Winter, the commission chairman, said the
goal was to find a solution ''where there are no losers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If it is humanly possibly, we're going to do this in a way
that will serve to unify this state and not divide it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some have complained that the state's banner is an offensive
reminder of slavery and that the Confederate battle flag should be
removed from the top left corner of the state flag.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also delayed until next month a vote on whether
to change the coat of arms.
</P>
<P>
   Winter appointed the flag commission after the state Supreme
Court ruled in May that the 1894 law designating the flag as the
official emblem was repealed in 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Stone Barefield, an attorney for the Sons of the Confederate
Veterans, said the U.S. Supreme Court could reconsider the ruling
and that the commission deliberations were premature.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday meeting was interrupted several times by other
commission critics. One carried a sign and another a large
Confederate battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every member at this table already knows exactly what they're
going to do. This facade you're putting on is for show,'' Jim
Giles, head of a Southern heritage group, yelled during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Winter said all sides would be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot let this issue of the flag interfere with the
progress we are making in the state of Mississippi in so many ways
-- in race relations, in economic development, in our standing in
the eyes of the nation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this summer, South Carolina legislators removed the last
remaining Confederate battle flag on a statehouse dome and placed a
slightly smaller one nearby as part of a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP and other flag opponents insist they'll continue to
boycott the state until there are no Confederate flags flying at
the Capitol. The flag also was removed from within the state Senate
and House chambers.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Said Slow in Deutch Probe  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alerted in the summer of 1998 that former CIA
Director John Deutch kept classified defense information on his
personal computers, documents show the Pentagon started
investigating only this year after the spy agency turned over
investigative material.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen was among those told of Deutch's
possible security lapses in 1998, according to the Pentagon
documents, which were obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a spokesman for Cohen, said the
secretary did not act in 1998 because the Pentagon was ''not in
possession of any documentation from the CIA's investigative
efforts.'' He said that when CIA information was turned over to DOD
in February of this year, Cohen ''turned right around'' and ordered
a probe now under way.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 1998 memo to Cohen and his top deputy, acting
inspector general Donald Mancuso wrote, ''The CIA believes it may
be necessary for DOD (Department of Defense) to conduct an
assessment of any possible security compromises identified in their
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo said the CIA already was ''investigating allegations
that Mr. Deutch created and maintained highly classified and
compartmented documents and journals on a number of computers,
including personal computers at his homes in Maryland and
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The computers ''were regularly used'' in conjunction with
Deutch's America Online Internet account and ''may have been used
to transfer such information without regard to security
procedures,'' the 1998 memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Deutch and his attorney for comment were not
immediately successful. He left the CIA in 1996 and now teaches at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, Cohen told the Pentagon's general counsel and the
inspector general that he had ordered an investigation of Deutch
two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''On or about that date, the Department of Defense received for
the first time certain material from the Central Intelligence
Agency which the CIA inspector general gathered in the course of
their investigation'' of Deutch, Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Included in this material is a lengthy journal reportedly kept
by Dr. Deutch during the time he served as undersecretary of
defense ... and deputy secretary of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, the DOD spokesman, said the Pentagon inspector general
and the assistant defense secretary for command, control,
communication and intelligence are conducting separate, parallel
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office is ''trying to track the hard
drives and the floppy drives that were in Dr. Deutch's possession
over time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant secretary was ''doing the damage assessment''
mentioned in the July 1998 memo to Cohen, Quigley said. That probe
is trying to ''look at the actual content of material that was
present on those computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the 1998 memo to Cohen, a Pentagon investigator
for the inspector general gave further information on what the
Pentagon had learned from the CIA at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Deutch kept very thorough journals, which include
significant quantities of DOD classified and other sensitive
information,'' investigator Mark Spaulding wrote to his boss.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA believed that ''a damage assessment by DOD is required
to protect the significant quantities of DOD information on the
computers,'' Spaulding added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Sign Insurance Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton thinks a long-term care
insurance program that Congress approved for federal employees
could serve as a model for helping all Americans deal with chronic
illnesses, an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton on Tuesday signs a bill giving government workers
help with long-term care costs, he was expected to make a pitch for
two other health care measures he wants Congress to pass before he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also was expected to note that while the legislation is
a step forward, there are chronically ill people of all ages who
can't buy long-term care insurance at any price because of a
pre-existing condition.
</P>
<P>
   The president was expected to use the bill signing ceremony as
an opportunity to push his proposed $3,000 tax credit for long-term
care as well as an initiative to provide funding to help people
providing care to older relatives. This measure would provide
funding for information-referral services and counseling to help
family members handle the emotional strain of caring for
chronically ill relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the long-term care insurance bill before its
August recess and sent it to the White House last week. It calls
for setting up a program that would make long term care available
to federal employees, members of the uniformed services, and
civilian and military retirees.

<HEADLINE> Survivor's Hatch Gets His Own Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, R.I. (AP) -- In August, ''Survivor'' winner Richard
Hatch sued his hometown. Now the city has named a day after him.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch was presented with a commemorative town tile and a
proclamation on ''Honorary Richard Hatch Day'' -- Sept. 18, 2000 --
in a ceremony that highlighted the 39-year-old's ingenuity and
guile but avoided talk of the litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, only in America can something like this happen,''
laughed Ken Cordeiro, a real estate agent who knew Hatch before he
became famous as the $1 million winner of the hit CBS show.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who was known for wandering around naked during filming
on the remote island off Borneo, was also given a Middletown
T-shirt by the Town Council. ''Is this a hint?'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after Hatch returned from filming ''Survivor,'' police
charged him with second-degree child abuse. Hatch's then 9-year-old
son told police his father wrapped his hands around his neck when
he tired on a run. Hatch said the boy concocted the story because
he was angry about being forced to exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors decided last month to drop the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch now is seeking unspecified damages from the state
Department of Children, Youth and Families. He says the child
welfare agency hurt the boy emotionally and damaged their
relationship when they removed him from his home. Hatch also is
seeking $1 million from Middletown for wrongful arrest and
defamation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Hatch received ovations from the crowd of 400 at the
Town Council meeting that usually attracts about 14 -- and long
lines of fans waited for a chance to get their picture taken with
the corporate trainer.

<HEADLINE> Torre Launches Prostate Program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Yankees manager Joe Torre remembers feeling
dazed when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer last year. But his
wife, Ali, took the situation in hand.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Torres helped launch ''Two Against One: Couples
Battling Prostate Cancer,'' a multimedia support and education
program that was billed as ''a spouse's guide to coping with
prostate cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The spouse plays such a major role in this fight against
prostate cancer,'' Torre said in a telephone interview. ''Once I
got diagnosed, I kind of blanked out mentally and my wife, Ali,
really kept a level head and put us on the road to start fighting
against this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The Torres decided to get involved in ''Two Against One''
because the process of arriving at a treatment decision was such a
difficult one for them -- a process that also offered little support
for the patient's spouse or partner.
</P>
<P>
   ''To my surprise, as we were going through the process of
recovery, we both realized we were going through similar
emotions,'' said Mrs. Torre. ''It was important for Joe and I to
communicate our feelings with each other because we were playing a
guessing game and trying to protect each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, 60, eventually opted for surgery, and is in remission.

<HEADLINE> Earl Spencer Releases Family Book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Earl Spencer, brother of the late Princess
Diana, said researching his family's history gave him the strength
to survive the loss of his sister.
</P>
<P>
   ''You draw strength when you go back to your roots,'' he said
Monday on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   His research went into a new book, ''The Spencers: A Personal
History of an English Family.'' Spencer said it does not cover
Diana's life, but is instead the history of ''an aristocratic
family.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really want to cash in on that,'' Spencer said of the
very public life and death of his sister. ''This is really more a
history book. I didn't want to intrude upon the modern age. That
wasn't the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer also told King that his title means very little to him,
since ''the aristocracy in Britain doesn't mean a whole lot to
anybody anymore.''

<HEADLINE> U.S., N.Korea Talks Planned in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and North Korean negotiators will resume
talks next week in New York in an attempt to end a stalemate over
Pyongyang's development and export of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The talks also will focus on U.S. allegations that North Korea
sponsors terrorism and on terms of an accord that froze North
Korea's nuclear weapons program in exchange for two civilian
reactors and supplies of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The last round of missile talks ended in July with North Korea
insisting its program was a sovereign exercise in self-defense, but
also with indications from economically distressed Pyongyang that
it might curb the program in exchange for payments of about $1
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   From Pyongyang's standpoint, the meetings that begin Sept. 27
offer an opportunity to air complaints that energy supplies under
the nuclear freeze agreement have been inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The third issue, terrorism, needs to be resolved before North
Korea can hope to win U.S. acceptance. The Stalinist North is
listed by the State Department as a supporter of terrorism, and
thereby under U.S. law is barred from receiving other than
humanitarian assistance such as food.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
Monday, said the talks could go on a few days or longer, depending
on the progress made.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with North Korea have been on the upswing since
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung two years ago undertook a
process of reconciliation with Pyongyang, North Korea's leader, Kim
Jong Il gradually warmed to the overture and they met at the summit
in June.
</P>
<P>
   But a search at the Frankfurt, Germany, airport of the North
Korean delegation to the United Nations' Millennium Summit earlier
this month touched off a ripple of ill will.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation canceled its trip to New York, and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright subsequently said she regretted the
incident and that the search by German security personnel was not
authorized by U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun decided
not to attend the U.N. General Assembly meetings last week. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ''unavoidable reasons''
were behind the cancellation and it was not aimed at slowing
momentum toward improved relations.
</P>
<P>
   The visit had been foreseen as a possible opportunity for
Albright to meet with the foreign minister, which would have
shifted the improving relationship into higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in Thailand, Defense Secretary William Cohen cautions
that despite easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula, the United
States will stay vigilant as long as North Korea keeps a huge army
on its border with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encouraged by the steps that we see being taken. But we
must remain vigilant because of the size of the army that the North
Koreans still maintain,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was heading to South Korea later Tuesday for a three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that there has been a reduction in the tensions
that previously existed,'' Cohen acknowledged. But, he added, this
is only the ''first stages ... toward a reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be very cautious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is believed capable of targeting virtually all of
Japan as well as other Asian countries with its missiles. And a
potential long-range threat was cited by the Clinton administration
as one reason for considering a U.S. missile defense program -- a
decision President Clinton has deferred to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, North Korea's export of missile technology to
Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and other countries has alarmed U.S. officials
as a devastating challenge to American attempts to curb
proliferation.

<HEADLINE> Senate Votes on China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is about to change the nature of
U.S.-Chinese trade ties in a vote supporters say will add a
critical element of stability to the tumultuous relations between
the world's strongest power and the most-populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage Tuesday of the PNTR, or permanent normal trade
relations, bill is near-certain, sending the legislation to
President Clinton for his signature. The measure is aimed at
opening up China's markets, bringing billions in new business to
American companies and making China a more responsible and
accountable member of the world community.
</P>
<P>
   It is opposed by labor, human rights and conservative groups who
say it is wrong to give up the annual review of China trade that
since the 1989 crackdown on the Tiananmen student movement has
given lawmakers a way to highlight China's weapons proliferation
and persecution of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, the most important trade bill since the 1993
North American Free Trade Agreement, enjoys the potent backing of
President Clinton, the congressional Republican leadership and the
nation's major business and agriculture groups. Both presidential
candidates, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
support permanent trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents the most significant opportunity that we have
had to create positive change in China since the 1970s, when
President Nixon first went there and later in the decade when
President Carter normalized relations,'' Clinton said in a speech
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is a consequence of a trade agreement between
the United States and China last fall that opened the way for
China's entry into the World Trade Organization. With WTO
membership, China will make significant cuts in its tariffs while
opening its markets to the products and investment of America and
other countries. China must also abide by international rules in
such areas as protecting intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Sun Yuxi, told
reporters, ''The early resolution of this issue not only serves the
interests of China; it is also in the interests of the United
States itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The PNTR legislation would go into effect when China joins the
WTO, probably late this year or early next year. Currently, under a
1974 law, trade relations with communist states must be reviewed
annually.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which already has open markets, made no new
concessions as part of the agreement, but must grant permanent
trade status before it can share in China's market-opening
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Jackson of the American Farm Bureau Federation said that
with China's agriculture tariffs slated to be cut in half, American
exports of farm products could increase by $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   There will be ''unprecedented opportunities,'' said John
Schachter of the Business Roundtable, with ''the opening of the
world's largest emerging marketplace to goods and services that
largely have been kept out until now.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to lower tariffs, under WTO rules China must also
grant Americans and others the right to set up distribution points
within the country, must open its financial and service sectors to
foreign competitors and must allow outside participation in its
Internet and telecommunications development.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those benefits, Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., said Monday
that it was a ''dangerous mistake'' for Congress to give away its
voice on trade relations when China's security threats and human
rights abuses are getting worse. ''We are putting profits over
people,'' he said. ''It's plain wrong and it's un-American.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the PNTR bill last May by 237-197. The only
real suspense during two weeks of Senate debate was whether
opponents could be prevented from attaching crippling amendments on
subjects ranging from proliferation to human rights abuses. The
concern was that the House wouldn't have time to act on any Senate
changes before Congress adjourns next month.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4444.

<HEADLINE> Putin Orders Salvage of Sunken Sub  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin has decided to go forward
with an operation to retrieve the bodies of 118 crewmen who died
aboard a nuclear submarine that sank in the Barents Sea, Deputy
Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent reports had said that the proposed operation was
being delayed because of disputes over financing, but Klebanov said
after meeting with Putin that contracts have been drafted and are
expected to be signed within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The contracts are with the Norwegian company Stolt Offshore,
whose divers were able to open the hatch of sunken submarine Kursk
after Russian efforts failed for days. The amount of the contracts
was not immediately announced.
</P>
<P>
   The retrieval effort is expected to take place in October or
November, Klebanov said, according to the news agency Interfax. The
Kursk sank on Aug. 12 after massive explosions.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts shattered the submarine so severely that divers are
unlikely to be able to retrieve the remains of sailors who were in
the first four of the Kursk's nine compartments, Klebanov said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also has ordered that an operation be conducted to raise
the wreck of the Kursk from its resting place 350 feet below the
surface, Klebanov said. That effort is expected to start next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax said the cost of raising the wreck is estimated at $45
million. No contracts have been signed for the salvage operation,
but Klebanov said the work will most likely include Dutch and
Belgian companies, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the explosions has not been determined. Russian
officials say they are focusing on indications that the Kursk
collided with an underwater object, possibly a foreign submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The United States says two of its submarines were monitoring the
naval exercises in which the Kursk was taking part but denies that
either was involved in a collision.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Rival Shakes Up Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Stanko Saric pushed his way past the
women holding their babies and farmers extending their hands. In
front at last, he handed a jar of his prized honey to the man
challenging Slobodan Milosevic in upcoming presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see?'' Saric said, his black mustache twitching in
excitement after shaking the hand of Vojislav Kostunica. ''I can
talk to him! He is the one I want for my president.''
</P>
<P>
   Saric is one of thousands swarming to see Kostunica, a law
professor who has dared take on Milosevic in Sunday's national
elections. Wherever Kostunica goes, from village to town across
Serbia, people rush to embrace him, an ordinary man like themselves
who has rekindled faith long lost among the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowds are feverish, chanting with passion and
conviction. More than 20,000 spilled last week onto the streets in
Novi Sad, Serbia's second-largest city, to wave banners and thunder
in unison: ''Kostunica, save us from this madhouse!''
</P>
<P>
   Sentiments flow easily from those suffering the fatigue of
Milosevic's decade in power -- marked by four Balkan wars and a
descent into isolation and economic misery.
</P>
<P>
   They rush to see the soft-spoken academic who dares campaign,
going door-to-door throughout this troubled land of 10 million -- an
unusual act in a country where the aloof president is kept on a
pedestal, away from masses.
</P>
<P>
   He has even inspired suggestions that his candidacy fulfills an
old prophecy embedded in legend here that one day, Serbia would be
saved by a man with the same family name as his ancestral village.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Kostunica, whose roots go back to Kostunici, a village on
the slopes of Mount Suvobor. The 400 peasants living there today
swear his name alone is proof he is the country's savior.
</P>
<P>
   Shy and lacking frills, Kostunica, 56, seems an unlikely hero.
He's never held a major office, speaks in low monotones, and is
known for gray suits and dark circles under his eyes. Though he
once dreamed of playing professional basketball, constitutional law
proved more absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   More important to voters, though, he has never been involved in
the scandals and shady deals linked to ruling officials. His
campaign poster simply reads: ''Who can look you straight in the
eyes?''
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by bursts of euphoria at his rallies, the demure
professor seems startled and says he ''only wanted to talk to the
people, hear their troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I am encouraged by all this rebirth of hope but I am
also aware of the tremendous responsibility,'' Kostunica said.
''Along with despair, decade-long bitterness and humiliation, there
is faith in some sort of divine justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Picked by an alliance of 18 opposition parties, Kostunica has
long hovered on the fringes of Serbia's political scene. A fervent
anti-communist, he was fired in 1974 from Belgrade Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, Milosevic's Socialists offered him his job
back, but Kostunica refused, founded the Democratic Party of Serbia
and has led it ever since. He was always critical of the ''falsely
reformed, renamed communists, like Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica's personal and political consistency, steadfast belief
in rule of law and Serb patriotism are qualities which endear him
to average voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''He appeals to all, disillusioned nationalists,
traditionalists, monarchists, urbanites, farmers, refugees and the
young,'' says Belgrade political analyst Aleksandar Tijanic. ''In a
fair ballot, Kostunica would undoubtedly win.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country still recovering from NATO bombings last year and
where Milosevic scorns opponents as Western stooges, Kostunica has
succeeded in mixing the right dose of criticism and tactical
distance from the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to make our peace with Europe and the world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Milosevic paid little heed to Kostunica's
campaign, despite trailing in every independent opinion poll. But
when Kostunica came to a northern Serb enclave in Kosovo,
Milosevic's supporters pelted him with stones, hitting him squarely
under the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Kostunica simply wiped the blood from his cheek and suggested
that Milosevic must be frightened in order to react with violence.
</P>
<P>
   Days later in Novi Sad, he warned the throngs that Milosevic was
ready to rig the vote or even resort to force to secure victory
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milosevic's regime has stolen years of our lives,'' Kostunica
said as he wrapped up the rally in Novi Sad. ''And now it's
preparing the theft of the century.''

<HEADLINE> Contractor in prison for fraud in airport railway construction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - The owner of a local engineering company,
extradited from New York, was imprisoned for 3 1/2 years for fraud
in connection with shoddy piling work at a Hong Kong airport
railway station.
</P>
<P>
   Hui Wai-chung, 38, who was extradited to Hong Kong after being
arrested in New York in May, had pleaded guilty to one count of
conspiracy to defraud. He was sentenced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hui, proprietor of the On Foundation Engineering Company, was
accused of defrauding developers and contractors of the airport
railway from May to November of 1997 by building substandard
foundations at a station site.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations showed that of the 87 bored piles constructed by
On Foundation, 83 were 3.3 feet to 49.5 feet shorter than required.
</P>
<P>
   Remedial work costing millions of dollars had to be carried out,
according to court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Hui left Hong Kong before officials there began an
investigation. He was arrested by FBI agents in New York and agreed
to return voluntarily to Hong Kong in July.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Slow To Pursue Warning  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alerted in the summer of 1998 that former CIA
Director John Deutch kept classified defense information on his
personal computers, the Pentagon started investigating only this
year after the spy agency turned over investigative material,
documents show.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen was among those told of Deutch's
possible security lapses in 1998, according to the Pentagon
documents, which were obtained by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a spokesman for Cohen, said the
secretary did not act in 1998 because the Pentagon was ''not in
possession of any documentation from the CIA's investigative
efforts.'' He said that when CIA information was turned over to the
Pentagon in February, Cohen ''turned right around'' and ordered a
probe now under way.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 1998 memo to Cohen and his top deputy, acting
inspector general Donald Mancuso wrote, ''The CIA believes it may
be necessary for DOD (Department of Defense) to conduct an
assessment of any possible security compromises identified in their
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo said the CIA already was ''investigating allegations
that Mr. Deutch created and maintained highly classified and
compartmented documents and journals on a number of computers,
including personal computers at his homes in Maryland and
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The computers ''were regularly used'' in conjunction with
Deutch's America Online Internet account and ''may have been used
to transfer such information without regard to security
procedures,'' the 1998 memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Deutch and his attorney for comment were not
immediately successful. He left the CIA in 1996 and now teaches at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 9, Cohen told the Pentagon's general counsel and the
inspector general that he had ordered an investigation of Deutch
two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''On or about that date, the Department of Defense received for
the first time certain material from the Central Intelligence
Agency which the CIA inspector general gathered in the course of
their investigation'' of Deutch, Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Included in this material is a lengthy journal reportedly kept
by Dr. Deutch during the time he served as undersecretary of
defense ... and deputy secretary of defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, the DOD spokesman, said the Pentagon inspector general
and the assistant defense secretary for command, control,
communication and intelligence are conducting separate, parallel
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office is ''trying to track the hard
drives and the floppy drives that were in Dr. Deutch's possession
over time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant secretary was ''doing the damage assessment''
mentioned in the July 1998 memo to Cohen, Quigley said. That probe
is trying to ''look at the actual content of material that was
present on those computers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A month before the 1998 memo to Cohen, a Pentagon investigator
for the inspector general gave further information on what the
Pentagon had learned from the CIA at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Deutch kept very thorough journals, which include
significant quantities of DOD classified and other sensitive
information,'' investigator Mark Spaulding wrote to his boss.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA believed that ''a damage assessment by DOD is required
to protect the significant quantities of DOD information on the
computers,'' Spaulding added.
</P>
<P>
   Other Pentagon documents said Deutch also was under
investigation for carrying, in his shirt pocket, a 1,000-page
journal on computer disks and cards containing classified
information.

<HEADLINE> Sexual bias suit nets $2.3 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A federal jury has awarded $2.3
million to a former policewoman who accused the Sleepy Hollow
Police Department of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff, Nancy Paolantonio, had testified about sexual
advances, lewd comments, insulting jokes and being unjustly fired.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's jury award, for sexual harassment, sex discrimination,
retaliation and back pay, was more than twice what Paolantonio's
lawyer had requested. It must still be approved by Magistrate Judge
Lisa Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a vindication for Nancy Paolantonio, who was
treated to extremely outrageous behavior by the village and the
defendants,'' said the lawyer, Christopher Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   Sleepy Hollow Mayor Phil Zegarelli said he would meet with the
village's insurers before deciding whether to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Paolantonio joined the force in 1998 and was fired in 1999 after
superiors said she showed up drunk for work. She denied that claim
in court during a two-week trial.

<HEADLINE> Recreational vehicle hits road in search of entrepreneurs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - ''Be the Boss'' emblazoned on its sides, a
recreational vehicle is on a 9,000-mile journey in search of
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   An emu farmer from Alabama paid a visit. So did a Vermont man
who makes decorative metal creations in his garage.
</P>
<P>
   The van is staffed by the Institute for Entrepreneurship. The
Albany-based not-for-profit corporation was founded two years ago
to help entrepreneurs thrive. The institute is affiliated with the
State University of New York at Empire State College.
</P>
<P>
   In June, staffers started on a 45-day trek to visit more than
two dozen cities in 11 states. They planned to visit Pittsburgh,
Boston and New Orleans. But the ''Be the Boss'' van also toured
sleepy towns in West Virginia, Alabama and other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got clearance from the mayor of Atlantic City to go right
on the boardwalk,'' said Jill Hommel, associate program
coordinator. ''We visited college campuses, summer camps and
shopping centers. We must have talked to a couple thousand people.
Some would even approach us when we were filling up at gas
stations.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Entrepreneurial Research Consortium found that
more than 35 million households - about one in three - were
directly involved in a new or small business in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Institute staffers found a young crowd interested in becoming
entrepreneurs. Most people they talked with on the tour have been
under 30. Like the four master's of business administration
students at the University at Buffalo who were outside the van
several days ago as it visited UB's North Campus in Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   The four - all between ages 23 and 27 - applied for an ''Angel
Grant'' through the Institute, hoping to secure $5,000 in seed
money for an Internet venture that would let supermarket chains
offer shoppers complete lines of products and services.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're building an infrastructure that's totally different from
Priceline.com and the other Internet-based shopping services that
are already out there,'' said Larry Miller. ''It's going to be a
very consumer-focused model that would let people manage their
entire grocery shopping purchases.''

<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China executed seven people on Tuesday for crimes
including murder, kidnapping and running gambling and prostitution
rings, official media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Gang leader Lai Xundong and three of his cohorts were put to
death shortly after their appeals were turned down by the Jilin
province high court at a public rally in the northeastern city of
Changchun, Xinhua News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Three associates of Lai and his gang were also executed after
the court confirmed their death sentences, Xinhua said. The seven
were put to death by firing squad, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Another 30 people associated with Lai's gang had their appeals
turned down and were sentenced to up to life in prison, the report
said. Hundreds of people attended the rally, it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUEENSBURY, N.Y. (AP) - The Federal Aviation Administration is
granting more than $900,000 for infrastructure improvements at a
rural Adirondack mountain airport.
</P>
<P>
   The $932,982 grant will be build a new taxiway and a new
terminal apron to the Floyd D. Bennett-Warren County Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the runways at the airport were upgraded. These
improvements would make the airport more attractive to corporate
and private jet owners, many of whom vacation in the Adirondacks or
in the summer at Saratoga Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   Small airports, like Warren County's air field, were boosted by
a bill earlier this year that brought $150,000 per year for
projects such as snow removal, safety lighting and other equipment
purchases.

<HEADLINE> Two Bombs Explode in Indonesia Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- Two bombs exploded Tuesday near a
crowded market in the troubled eastern Indonesian town of Ambon,
sending hundreds of shoppers fleeing in panic.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were injured in the stampede of frightened
townspeople. Army troops created more panic by firing warning shots
to control the crowd, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   One person also was killed and 16 were injured Tuesday when
gunmen in speedboats opened fire at a passenger ferry near Ambon, a
local hospital worker said. Two people had been killed Monday when
gunmen fired at another passenger boat in nearby waters.
</P>
<P>
   Ambon, the capital of Maluku province, has been wracked for
almost two years by violence between Muslims and Christians. Much
of the town has been devastated by the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Residents said hundreds of people of both faiths had gone to the
market to buy government-subsidized food. Bitter sectarian
divisions usually keep Muslims and Christians apart in Ambon, 1,600
miles northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Troops were deployed on Ambon streets after the crowd dispersed.
Senior police and army officers in Maluku, also known as the
Moluccas, said the situation was normal by late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the Ambon explosions were linked to
bombings that have terrorized the national capital, Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Many have suggested the Jakarta bombings are the work of
supporters of the former dictator Suharto, who is facing trial for
massive corruption during his 32-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   In the northwestern province of Aceh, three soldiers and a
police officer were killed Monday in a bomb blast by separatists
fighting a guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday night, two bombs exploded at government offices in
the regional capital Banda Aceh, causing minor damages but no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the U.N. refugee agency said it had scaled back its
operations in Jakarta after the bombings in the capital -- and after
three of its foreign staff were killed in West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugee's staff at its
Jakarta headquarters were sent home Tuesday for at least two days
because of security fears, said the agency's head, Rene Van Rooyen.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.N. foreign aid workers and three Indonesians were killed
in the West Timor border town of Atambua by an anti-independence
mob on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The militias are intent on destabilizing U.N.-administered East
Timor's transition to self-rule and preventing 120,000 East
Timorese refugees in camps near the border from returning home.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Jakarta on Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen demanded Indonesia disband militias in West Timor
immediately or risk losing international financial assistance
needed to overcome its worst economic crisis in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   In response, dozens of demonstrators burned U.S. and U.N. flags
Tuesday outside the American Embassy and accused the Clinton
administration of meddling in Indonesia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the United Nations has granted its peacekeepers in
East Timor the right to shoot at militiamen without warning, a U.N.
official said. U.N. peacekeeper Philippine army Capt. Isabelito
Sanchez said the world body had changed its rules of engagement in
the troubled territory because of an increase in militia sightings.

<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A man who admitted helping his teen-age
brother plot the slaying of another man was sentenced to 10 years
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Griswold, 19, of Syracuse, avoided a murder trial by
accepting a plea deal in which he admitted to felony charges of
second-degree conspiracy and second-degree criminal possession of a
weapon in the shooting death Jevon Shepherd. Shepherd died Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold's 17-year-old brother, Darnell, was convicted last week
of second-degree murder in Shepherd's slaying. Darnell Griswold
faces a maximum penalty of 25 years to life in prison when he is
sentenced Sept. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Griswold, who did not testify at his brother's trial,
admitted plotting with Darnell to kill Shepherd because Darnell had
a dispute with the victim. He also admitted giving Darnell a gun to
commit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherd, 20, was shot twice in the chest when he answered the
door to the vacant apartment where he had spent the night.

<HEADLINE> Doubts on Burundi Peace Prospects  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYNE SAMBIRA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- On the eve of meeting to sign a
cease-fire, doubts grew on Tuesday about the willingness of
Burundi's warring factions to agree to an end to this central
African nation's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent rebuff to peace mediator Nelson Mandela, Burundi
President Pierre Buyoya said late Monday that he didn't expect a
cease-fire to be signed any time soon in his country.
</P>
<P>
   A peace agreement was signed on Aug. 28 by Buyoya, Hutu parties
and six of the 10 Tutsi parties participating in the two-year-old
peace talks. But Mandela failed to get a cease-fire included in the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, the former president of South Africa, has summoned the
holdout parties, Buyuyo and the leaders of the two Hutu rebel
groups to Nairobi on Wednesday to sign a cease-fire, without which
the rest of the agreement cannot be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the minds of the organizers, I do not think that the
meeting was scheduled in order to sign a cease-fire, but to try and
bring into the peace process those who have not participated so far
and to commit them to stopping the violence,'' Buyoya told
reporters in Bujumbura after returning from Uganda, where he met
with President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
   ''There can be no cease-fire without negotiations,'' he said.
''I have no illusions that a formal cease-fire will be signed.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya, the heads of the holdout Tutsi parties and rebel leaders
have gone to South Africa several times to meet Mandela separately
to work out details before Wednesday's meeting in the Kenyan
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Entebbe, Uganda, Buyoya said he was
certain that peace would ''eventually come'' to Burundi, despite
the stepped up rebel attacks since the Aug. 28 peace agreement. In
the pact, the sides agreed to integrate the army and set up a
power-sharing arrangement in the government and national assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Burundi's Tutsi dominated army has been fighting Hutu rebels
since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Burundi's first
democratically elected president, a Hutu. A Tutsi elite has
dominated the government, army and business interests since
independence in 1962, though they are a minority. The conflict has
claimed at least 200,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Guilty in Husband's Death  </HEADLINE>
By RON ZAPATA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Canadian woman accused of stabbing her
husband to death after he fell asleep during a discussion about
their troubled marriage was convicted of voluntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Alpna Patel, a 28-year-old dentist, was found guilty Monday in
the death of Viresh Patel, a physician. The 26-year-old husband was
stabbed to death with a steak knife on March 24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''The amount of blood on the bed speaks for itself,'' said jury
forewoman Patricia Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The May 1998 marriage of the couple, whose families are from
India, was the focal point of a Canadian documentary about arranged
weddings. The film portrayed them as a happy couple whose marriage
had been arranged through ads placed in an Indian newspaper. Both
sought a spouse who shared the same customs.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Edward Smith Jr. said Patel stabbed her husband
after he attacked her for being disobedient toward his father.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutor William McCollum argued that Patel got angry when
her husband fell asleep while she was talking about how to repair
their failing marriage, and stabbed him while he slept.
</P>
<P>
   This was Patel's second trial in the killing. In February,
jurors acquitted Patel of first-degree murder, but were deadlocked
on charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Judge John
Prevas ruled that Patel could not be retried for second-degree
murder, but only for manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Patel was handcuffed and led out of the court as her mother
trembled and wept uncontrollably. Officers refused to allow her
father to hug her as she left.
</P>
<P>
   Patel faces up to 10 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled
for October 24.

<HEADLINE> Russian Media Holding Claims Probed  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev on
Tuesday accused the government of ''crude blackmail'' against
Russia's biggest independent media group, and said he wanted to
discuss the matter with President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's natural gas giant Gazprom, which is partly owned by the
Russian government, is trying to take over the embattled Media-Most
holding company. The move is seen by media watchdogs as the latest
attempt by the government to rein in press freedom and silence the
company, which has been critical of the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most, which includes Russia's main private TV channel, a
prominent radio station and several leading newspapers, has already
seen its offices raided by masked, armed police. Media-Most head
Vladimir Gusinsky was held in jail for four days in June on fraud
charges.
</P>
<P>
   About a month after his release from prison, Gusinsky signed an
agreement with Gazprom, promising to sell Media-Most to Gazprom for
what Gazprom said was a $473 million debt plus $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky now says he signed the July 20 deal under duress, and
that the agreement has no legal force.
</P>
<P>
   One of the agreement's provisions was that the sale would be in
exchange for guarantees of freedom and safety for Gusinsky and his
business associates, Gorbachev told reporters on Tuesday. The
former Soviet president heads a group of prominent public figures
who serve as advisers for Media-Most's flagship television station
NTV.
</P>
<P>
   Gorbachev described the agreement as an ''instance of crude
blackmail by the state,'' and said the public council had asked for
an ''urgent meeting'' between him and Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the head of Gazprom's own, small media holding
company, Alfred Kokh, insisted Tuesday that the attempts to take
over Media-Most were driven purely by business interests and had no
political motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most is behind on a $211 million loan from Gazprom, and is
due to pay millions of dollars more in other loans in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The operations of Media-Most don't bring even nearly the kind
of money that is needed to pay those debts,'' Kokh told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   By buying out Media-Most, Gazprom will be able to protect its
investment and save Media-Most from bankruptcy, Kokh said. He added
that Gazprom then planned to resell a controlling share to foreign
media groups, thus preserving Media-Most's independence from the
Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Kokh reiterated Gazprom's accusation that Media-Most had
transferred most of its assets to offshore companies to hide them
from Gazprom. Prosecutors said Tuesday that they had opened an
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In another media-related development, the newly appointed
trustees of ORT television learned that they would have to come up
with $100,000 to form a private company to oversee their shares,
Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees, including many prominent journalists, met Monday
for the first time since tycoon Boris Berezovsky asked them to
control his 49 percent of the shares in the company earlier this
month. Berezovsky said he was trying to keep the shares out of the
hands of the government, which controls 51 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees were surprised to learn Monday that they would have
to collect the funds for the new company and that Berezovsky would
hold them financially accountable for how they managed the shares,
The Moscow Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky has tried in recent months to rally opposition to
Putin. However, his critics say he is just agitating to regain the
influence he enjoyed as a member of Boris Yeltsin's inner circle
but lacks under Putin.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 17; Nasdaq Is Up 33  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded in early trading Tuesday,
ending at least temporarily a slide triggered by anxiety about
corporate profits and rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 17.39 at 10,825.91.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 4.33 to 1,448.84, and the
Nasdaq composite index climbed 33.77 to 3,760.29.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa traded down 63 cents at $26.50 in early trading after the
steel manufacturer became the company to say its earnings will be
hurt by rising energy costs and softening demand.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday a selloff in blue chip and technology issues sent the
Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite index down more
than 100 points apiece as corporate profit warnings again
preoccupied the market.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the third-quarter less than two weeks away, a
number of companies have warned their results will be below Wall
Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings come as a growing number of indicators suggest the
economy is moderating. Investors, unsure of how slower economic
growth will affect corporate profits, have been unloading the
stocks of companies that even hint at lower earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressure is rising oil prices, which have climbed
as high as $37 per barrel of crude oil this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index Tuesday was up 1.48 at 518.16.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.39 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.02 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.15 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell
0.08 percent.

<HEADLINE> Zoo Veterinarians Descend on Bayou  </HEADLINE>
By JANET McCONNAUGHEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A length of plastic pipe made the 3-foot
alligator say aaah. A few turns of electrical tape around the snout
secured the pipe and neutralized the toothy jaws, clearing the way
to push a finger-wide scope into the reptile's stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoo! Hey, Bob! Come take a look at this! There are tons of
parasites!'' Dr. Mark Lott, a Tulane Medical School
gastroenterologist, said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Not an appetizing sight, to be sure -- unless you're among the
450 veterinarians and 200 students from 35 countries at this week's
joint convention of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians
and International Association for Aquatic Animal Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Then this is the sort of thing you live for, along with studying
the best design for animal morgues, how to draw blood from penguins
and the fact that dolphins get ulcers from the same bacteria humans
do.
</P>
<P>
   All are convention topics, but as the event began with weekend
workshops, the sedated reptile, part of a ''wetlab'' on alligator
anesthesia, was the chief attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, after taking his turn at the gastroscope, passed the
eyepiece to the 'gator's temporary handlers -- Dr. Claude Lacasse, a
veterinary intern at the Birds of Prey Clinic in Montreal, and Dr.
Patricia Reyes, veterinarian at the San Juan de Aragon Zoo in
Mexico City. The enlarged view showed what looked like hundreds of
threadlike worms, all wriggling energetically.
</P>
<P>
   Another dozen 2- to 4-foot 'gators, the smaller ones still
bearing the brilliant black and yellow stripes of babyhood, were
scattered around the floor at the Audubon Zoo Hospital, with two
vets sitting or squatting by each.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo's chief veterinarian, Dr. Roberto Aguilar, and Lott
developed the gastroscopy technique after one of the signature
white alligators at the Aquarium of the Americas in New Orleans
died of zinc poisoning, from pennies thrown into its tank.
</P>
<P>
   Alligators eat stones as ballast and a digestive aid. Coins
apparently are similar enough to stones to be swallowed, too, but
have caused difficulty in alligator guts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at neighboring Tulane University, vets were giving
anesthesia to giant goldfish and learning about fish surgery. At
the Audubon Institute Center for Research on Endangered Species,
the topic was artificial reproduction techniques, from artificial
insemination to cloning.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the endangered species research center included
Hou Rong, reproduction research director at China's Chengdu
Laboratory of Reproduction and Genetics for Endangered Wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ''She might be familiar with most of the techniques. She wants
to see how the Americans do it, see if they have any different
techniques,'' translated Jinping Yu, a conservation biologist at
Zoo Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists at the center use dog and cat testes and ovaries
to learn information crucial to work with endangered species, such
as what percentage of canine sperm is likely to survive freezing,
or how to tell whether sperm from a specific cat is likely to
fertilize an egg.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Pressured To Step Down  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- The whereabouts of Peru's intelligence chief
grew murkier amid conflicting reports of his arrest, deepening the
mystery about the man at the center of Peru's growing political
crisis and raising questions about the government's stability.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pressure increased for President Alberto Fujimori to
step down quickly following his stunning announcement late Saturday
that he would call new elections -- in which he would not be
candidate -- amid a bribery scandal involving spy chief Vladimiro
Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed Fujimori's convoy leaving the
government palace before dawn Tuesday for the army headquarters,
where he sometimes sleeps. The motorcade returned to the palace in
only 15 minutes, raising local media speculation that he may have
stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   In front of 10,000 cheering supporters Monday at a downtown Lima
plaza, opposition leader Alejandro Toledo called for the immediate
formation of an emergency government and the arrest of Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ''There cannot be a healthy democracy in Peru with Montesinos
free,'' Toledo told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Between choruses of ''The dictatorship will fall,'' Toledo
demanded that new elections promised by Fujimori be held within
four months -- not the six to eight months top government officials
have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protesters, including opposition legislators, gathered
outside the offices of Montesinos' National Intelligence Service in
Lima, demanding his arrest. They scuffled briefly with police after
they tried to push their way into the military complex. But
overall, Peru's barracks and streets remained calm.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante on Monday denied local news
reports that Montesinos had been detained, saying the military was
not holding the elusive spy chief, who for a decade has helped
Fujimori run roughshod over Peru's democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents have suggested that Fujimori may lack the power
to order the arrest of Montesinos, who spent his years as
intelligence chief placing his men in key positions within the
armed forces and government.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist who refused to participate in a
May presidential runoff against Fujimori charging the vote would be
rigged, made no mention of his renewed bid for the presidency in
the upcoming elections. He had said Sunday he would be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Peru was thrown into political turmoil last week after the
release of a videotape allegedly showing Montesinos bribing an
opposition lawmaker to support Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
   The video was widely perceived as powerful evidence that
Fujimori and Montesinos had pressured or bribed opposition
legislators to join his party's bloc following May's vote in which
Fujimori was re-elected but lost his majority in congress.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the video had damaged the credibility of his government,
Fujimori announced Saturday he would deactivate the National
Intelligence Service, which Montesinos had cultivated into Peru's
most vilified and feared institution, intimidating and blackmailing
his, and Fujimori's, opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvians were stunned when Fujimori went on to promise new
elections, ending his decade-long presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, independent radio station CPN, citing unidentified
military sources, reported that Montesinos had been arrested on
orders from his close associate, Gen. Jose Villanueva Ruesta,
commander of Peru's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Gutierrez, a member of the investigative unit at the
opposition newspaper La Republica, told The Associated Press that
high-ranking military officers had confirmed Montesinos' detention.
</P>
<P>
   But a retired army general and several opposition leaders said
the reports of Montesinos' detention were a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vladimiro Montesinos is not detained, but I don't know exactly
where he is,'' said retired army Gen. Jose Salinas Sedo, who led a
failed coup against Fujimori in 1992. ''They're protecting him.
They're playing with the Peruvian people and winning time to see
how to manage the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade charged that Montesinos was still
running the intelligence service and was holed up in the agency's
headquarters. Unconfirmed news reports said he was feverishly
destroying documents that would incriminate him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a lawyer claiming to represent Ana Montesinos, who he
identified as the spymaster's sister, sought out reporters,
alleging that her brother was being held at the headquarters of the
National Intelligence Service.
</P>
<P>
   He presented a writ of habeas corpus, saying the detention was
illegal and demanding that Montesinos be freed.
</P>
<P>
   However, Justice Minister Bustamante denied that Montesinos had
been taken into custody and said the woman mentioned was not
Montesinos' sister.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that he (Montesinos) is in Lima and I know that he is
not detained,'' Bustamante said late Monday.

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 9; Nasdaq Gains 61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading Tuesday, as
the market struggled to rebound after a slide triggered by anxiety
about corporate profits and rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq
composite index tumbled more than 100 points apiece, investors were
reluctant to commit themselves to blue chips, but technology stocks
fared better.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average dipped 8.50 to 10,800.02.
</P>
<P>
   But broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index rose 5.50 to 1,450.01, and the tech-dominated Nasdaq
composite index climbed 61.09 to 3,787.61.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some call it a rebound, some call it bargain hunting, but on
balance the uptake in the market leaves a lot to be desired,'' said
Alan Ackerman, a senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
''Overall, investors are still nervous over energy prices, the euro
and an economic slowdown which may prompt quarterly earnings to be
a bit lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors Tuesday repeated what has become a pattern in the
market -- punishing the stocks of companies who even hint at
disappointing quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa fell 94 cents to $26.19 in early trading after the steel
manufacturer became the latest company to say its earnings will be
hurt by rising energy costs and softening demand.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the third-quarter less than two weeks away, a
number of companies have warned their results will be below Wall
Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings come as a growing number of indicators suggest the
economy is moderating, which raises questions on Wall Street about
the impact slower economic growth will have on corporate profits. A
Commerce Department report Tuesday said housing construction rose
modestly in August, but at levels below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices, which have climbed as high as $37 per barrel
of crude oil this week, are adding to the pressure on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks were strengthened by merger news, although it was
unclear how lasting therally would be.
</P>
<P>
   Computer server manufacturer Cobalt Networks rose $14.55 to
$55.50 -- a 35 percent increase -- on news it was being acquired by
Sun Microsystems in a $2 billion stock-for-stock merger
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 131.03 million
shares, ahead of the 119.24 million shares in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index Tuesday was up 1.37 at 518.05.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average was up 0.39 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.02 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 0.15 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell
0.08 percent.

<HEADLINE> Officer kills man after car chase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ASHLAND, N.Y. (AP) - A policeman shot and killed a 46-year-old
man after police said he led them on a chase and twice tried to run
an officer down.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gendrin, 46, of Waverly died Monday of a gunshot wound to
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Officer David DeKay, received minor injuries after he tried to
stop Gendrin, said Waverly Police Chief Larry Preston.
</P>
<P>
   The incident started around 3 p.m. in the Village of Waverly, 30
miles west of Binghamton, when Gendrin ignored DeKay, who was
trying to stop him for driving with a suspended license. Police
said Gendrin had been convicted in 1998 and 1999 on petit larceny
charges.
</P>
<P>
   As Gendrin sped away, the front right tire ripped off the car,
but he continued driving on three tires and the sparking rim.
Gendrin swerved around two stopped school buses that were letting
children off in the town of Chemung, Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   DeKay dropped back from a high-speed pursuit, radioed ahead for
assistance from state troopers and deputies continued to follow
Gendrin until he caught up with the suspect at the dead end of the
two-lane highway in the parking lot of a former fuel station.
</P>
<P>
   As dozens of construction workers watched, DeKay got out of his
patrol car, drew his gun and ordered Gendrin to get out of the car,
Preston said. Instead, Gendrin threw his car into reverse and ran
into DeKay, according to police. DeKay recovered to find Gendrin
driving toward him again, Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   DeKay, a 12-year veteran who is the village's weapons training
officer, was thrown onto the hood of a car, but managed to fire a
fatal shot through the windshield at the driver, Preston said. He
fired a second shot after he fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Gendrin continued driving a couple of hundred feet down the road
before the car veered off the road into the yard of a nearby home.
DeKay ran to the car and found Gendrin dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as I'm concerned, this officer (DeKay) is a hero,''
Preston said. ''He saved his own life and the lives of many others
in the area.''

<HEADLINE> Swastikas found in campus bathrooms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - Binghamton University is offering a
$1,000 reward for information leading to the arrests of those
responsible for several swastikas, one drawn in human feces,
discovered in a residence hall bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to make sure people understand we are taking this
seriously. ... We don't want or accept this kind of racism on the
campus,'' Rodger Summers, vice president for student affairs, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   University police are investigating four reports since Sept. 5
of graffiti containing swastikas and obscene language in a bathroom
on the third floor of Bingham Hall, a residence hall at the
university which houses both freshmen and upperclassmen, Summers
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 27 percent of Binghamton University's student body is
Jewish, according to university estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Aaron Slonim, of Chabad House Jewish Student Center, said
he believes the incidents are not the work of an organized group,
but one or two persons trying to annoy people. Stephanie Mann,
president of Hillel-Jewish Student Union, voiced similar feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's more someone looking for attention,'' she said. Mann said
she thinks the motivation for the graffiti is more ignorance than
hatred.
</P>
<P>
   If caught, those responsible could face misdemeanor criminal
mischief or harassment charges, said Summers. They would also face
university disciplinary action, ranging from a warning to
expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The swastika graffiti comes in the wake of an incident at the
university last semester in which several Binghamton University
wrestlers were charged with assaulting Asian-American students
outside a residence hall.

<HEADLINE> Parents Offer Car for Returning Baby  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- After a thief returned an infant unharmed in a
stolen car, the baby's grateful parents offered the vehicle as a
gift.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-month-old Israeli infant, Arieh, was found before dawn
Tuesday outside a Palestinian refugee camp near Jerusalem after
police were tipped off by an anonymous caller.
</P>
<P>
   The phone call ended an hours-long police hunt with cruisers and
helicopters. Police set up roadblocks after the thief stole the car
in Tel Aviv on Monday evening when Arieh's mother, Sigal Levy, left
the keys in the ignition while she took a stroller from the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Sigal Levy and her husband, Reuven, were overwhelmed with
gratitude to have their child back.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (the thief) is invited to call me in another week or two,
once the story is forgotten, to the cellular phone number I left,
and I'll give him the car as a gift,'' Reuven Levy said on national
radio.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, Levy had pleaded with the thief on the radio to
return the child, even without the car, giving explicit
instructions on how to call police from a public phone. An
anonymous tip pointed police to the car and unharmed baby, who was
sitting in his car seat on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (the infant) was awake, looking around, rather
indifferently, as if he had been waiting for us,'' officer Shlomo
Aronishky told Israel radio.
</P>
<P>
   Reuven Levy said he didn't want police to track down suspects or
press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Car theft in Israel has reached epidemic proportions. Police say
Palestinians, sometimes in cooperation with Israeli criminals,
steal cars and drive them to chop shops in the West Bank, where
they are taken apart within minutes. The parts are often smuggled
back into Israel for resale.

<HEADLINE> Debate Over Cuba Embargo  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal study on how the 38-year-old U.S.
embargo on Cuba has affected both nations' economies was the spark
for a renewed dispute Tuesday over the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The International Trade Commission study, due Feb. 15, won't
make recommendations about whether to continue the sanctions. But
both supporters and opponents of the embargo stated their cases at
a hearing Tuesday that's part of the study process.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six witnesses asked to testify -- so many that
commissioners had to schedule a second day of hearings. It was one
of the biggest forums ever held in Washington on the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could almost say this is going to be the Woodstock of the
Cuba issue,'' John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and
Economic Council, said of the large anticipated crowd. ''But in
Woodstock, there were mostly people of like minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those participating: Cuban exile groups that favor
sanctions to pressure Fidel Castro's government, humanitarian
groups who say the sanctions hurt innocent people, businesses and
agricultural groups that believe they would benefit from trade with
Cuba and others that believe they would be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The first speakers were lawmakers on both sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unilateral sanctions don't work,'' said Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont., who along with Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., spoke against
the sanctions. ''When we stop our farmers and businesses from
exporting, they are hurt and our Japanese, European and Canadian
competitors happily rush in to fill the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   They were countered by two Florida Republican members of the
House, Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart, who
argued that lifting the sanctions would boost Castro's government
without offering real economic benefits to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the belief of U.S. policy that it is as immoral as it is
unacceptable to simply stand by and allow one of our closest
neighbors to languish unendingly under a brutal dictatorship run by
a psychopath and conduct business as usual,'' said Diaz-Balart.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has been receiving renewed attention with some farm-state
Republicans joining liberal Democrats in favoring the easing of
restrictions on the sales of food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban exile movement, which favors maintaining the
sanctions, was weakened following the battle over Elian Gonzalez,
the young castaway who returned to Cuba after a long dispute
between his father and his Florida relatives. Also, the debate over
trade relations with China has made some lawmakers take a new look
at Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns that sanctions could be eased have ''galvanized''
embargo supporters, said Dennis K. Hays, executive vice president
of the Cuban-American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no longer possible to sit on the sidelines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some advocates of the embargo are skeptical about the study's
importance, noting that it was requested by an opponent of the
sanctions, Rep. Charles Rangel, N.Y., the ranking Democrat on the
House Ways and Means Committee. They question the study's ability
to gauge how the United States and Cuba would be affected if the
embargo were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to quantify the impact of what are you not
making,'' said Otto Reich, an international business consultant and
former ambassador to Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts see the report as unique because the
commission is independent and nonpartisan. Two commission
economists visited Cuba in July, meeting with government officials.
They are also conducting a survey of U.S. businesses and trade
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Peters, vice president of the Lexington Institute think
tank, said the commission's report could be influential, given the
depth of its research and its objectivity
</P>
<P>
   ''They are authoritative, they don't have a dog in this fight,''
he said. ''They have tremendous resources, so they are going to be
able to do a pretty thorough look at the impact of the sanctions
and the potential trade that could flow.''

<HEADLINE> Bankrupt Cruise Line's Crew Stranded  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- The crew of an American cruise ship
seized in Halifax remained stranded Tuesday as the ship's owner and
backers waded through financial claims against the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The 450 crew members of the SeaBreeze 1 were waiting to be paid
so that they can return to their home countries, which include
Costa Rica, India, Jamaica and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   The SeaBreeze 1 and the cruise ship Rembrandt, owned by Premier
Cruise Lines of Port Canaveral, Fla., were seized last Thursday in
Halifax by Premier's primary lender. Two other Premier ships were
seized in ports in the Bahamas and in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Rembrandt, after reaching an agreement with creditors
Friday, left for Nassau with only crew on board. About 1,500
passengers on the SeaBreeze 1 and The Rembrandt were either bused
or flown back to Boston and New York, or found their own means of
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   So far 17 claims were filed against the SeaBreeze 1, a Federal
Court spokesman in Halifax said Monday. The ship must stay in
Halifax until the claims are satisfied.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Insurance Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton signed a long-term-care
insurance program for federal employees Tuesday that the
administration hopes could be a model of bipartisan cooperation on
health care issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope we will continue to build on the spirit embodied by
this bill today,'' Clinton said before signing the measure at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the long-term-care insurance bill before its
August recess and sent it to the White House last week. It calls
for setting up a program that would make long-term care available
to federal employees, members of the uniformed services and
civilian and military retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted insurance industry support for the initiative,
which will provide a new option to 13 million people. Aides said
the president hopes the new law will serve as a model for private
employers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The president, flanked by nearly a dozen members of Congress
from both political parties, called the legislation
''groundbreaking'' both for its practical effect and its bipartisan
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is further proof not only that Democrats and Republicans
both get old, but that when we put progress before partisanship we
can tackle our toughest challenges,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made a pitch for two other health care measures he
wants Congress to pass before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The president used the bill-signing ceremony as an opportunity
to push his proposed $3,000 tax credit for long-term care as well
as an initiative to provide funding to help people providing care
to older relatives. This measure would help pay for
information-referral services and counseling to help family members
handle the emotional strain of caring for chronically ill
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The White House health care package, Clinton said, would ''help
ensure the aging of America will be, on balance, a great benefit
and not an overwhelming burden to our children and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation authorizes the federal Office of Personnel
Management to negotiate with private insurers to offer more
affordable long-term-care insurance policies to federal employees,
retirees and their families.

<HEADLINE> Computer glitch forces Bergen nursing home to file for Chapter 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWOOD, N.J. (AP) - A computer glitch that caused a Bergen
County nursing home to miss out on $350,000 in Medicaid payments
has led the facility to file for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Norwood Holdings Inc., owner of The Heritage at
Norwood, said it filed for Chapter 11 protection after the delayed
payment created a cash-flow shortage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was caused by a delay in Medicaid reimbursements by
Unisys Corp., a computer consulting company that runs the state's
Medicaid reimbursement program.
</P>
<P>
   A Unisys spokeswoman said the company was not immediately aware
of a problem with The Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Heritage officials expect the situation to be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''The company is not bankrupt,'' said spokeswoman Patricia Gitt.
''The Chapter 11 was done to protect the company until the problem
is worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   She said no changes in care, staffing, or day-to-day operations
at the home are planned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing will be impacted by this,'' she said. ''The level of
care will remain the same. Operations will remain the same.
Employees should know that everything is business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage has about 200 elderly residents.

<HEADLINE> Census Response Rate Topped 1990  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans reversed a long slide in
participation, sending back more Census forms this year than they
did a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first number from the Census is very good,'' proclaimed
Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   The final response rate for forms mailed and filed via the
Internet was 67 percent, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   That's two points better than 1990 and reverses declines in
response since 1970, he said.
</P>

   The agency is completing its follow-up visits to households that
failed to respond and expects to report national and state
population totals by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> More Whales Killed in Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP)-- Japan's research whaling fleet has returned home
with 88 whales caught and killed in the northwestern Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo also said its plan to sample three species -- the minke,
Bryde's and sperm whale -- next year remains unchanged. Japan met
strong criticism, especially from the United States, because Tokyo
added Bryde's and sperm whales to its whaling mission this year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's whale catch had been limited to minke whales.
</P>
<P>
   The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling
in the mid-1980s but allows whaling countries to kill whales for
research to gather information on migration, eating patterns and
pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-whaling countries and activists say Japan is catching
whales in the name of scientific research to satisfy a demand for
whale meat, considered a delicacy here.
</P>
<P>
   The latest mission returned with 43 Bryde's whales, five sperm
whales and 40 minke whales, Takaaki Sakamoto of the Fishery Agency
said Tuesday. Next year, Japan plans to sample up to 100 minkes, 50
Bryde's and 10 sperm whales in the northwestern Pacific Ocean,
Sakamoto said.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure to punish Japan for its expanded whale hunt, the
United States last week decided to deny Japan some fishing rights
in U.S. waters.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Ex-Argentine Officer Freed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- A retired Argentine army major, arrested in Italy
and wanted by France in the 1976 disappearance of a young woman in
Argentina, has been released from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Antonio Olivera was freed Monday pending a decision on an
extradition request from French authorities, a court official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Olivera's lawyer, Marcantonio Bezicheri, said Olivera plans to
return to Argentina on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No date for the court's decision on the extradition request has
been set, the lawyer said. Italian authorities have up to three
months to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Olivera was arrested in August at Rome's Leonardo da Vinci
airport as he was about to board a flight to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   He is wanted for questioning by a French judge probing the Oct.
15, 1976, disappearance of 22-year-old Marie Anne Erize and 14
other French nationals from the northwestern Argentine province of
San Juan.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups maintain Erize was abducted by a military
commando linked to Olivera, who was an army lieutenant at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary hearing last month, Olivera said he would fight
extradition and claimed he had nothing to do with Erize's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,000 people are officially acknowledged to have died
or disappeared under the 1976-83 military dictatorship in the
so-called ''dirty war'' against leftists and other perceived foes.
Human rights groups put the figure at as many as 30,000.

<HEADLINE> N.J. woman dead in her home for a year before anyone knew  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Janice Petrowsky wanted to be
left alone. She got her wish, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old Morris County woman was dead for a year before
anyone noticed.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that raises troubling questions about community and
how far neighbors and authorities should go to try to help someone
who doesn't want assistance, Petrowsky's clothed skeleton was found
last month sitting on the kitchen floor of the Long Valley home in
which she had become a recluse, propped up by a pillow and
surrounded by the badly decomposed remains of several pets.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors say Petrowsky's only contact with them was angry,
shouted demands to stay away from her and from her property; one
said she even fired BB guns at children who ventured too near her
home. Neighbors began wondering whether anything had happened to
the woman they called ''The Witch,'' but for months, none cared
enough to look.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't look for her 'cause we were afraid we'd find her,''
said one woman, who like others who lived near Petrowsky, would not
give her name.
</P>
<P>
   Morris County authorities say they don't consider her death
suspicious. Although an autopsy could not determine the cause of
death because the woman's remains were so badly decomposed, there
were no signs of injury to any of her bones, said Capt. Christopher
Linne, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   He said it appeared as if she had sat down to die on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her body was propped up by one of those pillows with a back
and arms on either side,'' he said. ''She had her things around
her, such as her inhaler and some personal items. She apparently
died in that spot. The pets died where they dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the animals were cats or dogs, due to
the advanced state of decomposition.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just blotches,'' Linne said.
</P>
<P>
   Using documents found inside the house, as well as other
evidence, Linne estimated Petrowsky had been dead for at least a
year, maybe longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Looking at the house itself and various records and bills, it
appears if nothing happened there after June of 1999,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Petrowsky lived alone in the house, set high on a hill hidden
behind thick woods, since her mother, Olga, died in 1997. She did
not work and stayed inside most of the time, said Washington
Township Detective Sgt. Michael Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   When she did venture outside, it was mostly to yell at her
neighbors, they said. One woman who lives nearby said Petrowsky
began harassing her family almost immediately after they moved in
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got a number of messages on our answering machine with foul
language, saying, 'Stay off my property!' '' said the woman. ''She
was not a friendly neighbor, to say the least. People around here
called her 'The Witch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ''She was not very nice,'' another neighbor said of Petrowsky.
''She'd yell at you and scream at you to stay off her property.
Everybody else here is very nice. It's just a sad situation that
somebody could be left alone to die that way.''
</P>
<P>
   But people tried to help Petrowsky. In March 1999, state social
workers went to the house to check on her, but requested a police
escort due to previous reports of erratic behavior, Bailey said.
She had been arrested in 1990 for slashing neighbors' tires, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ''She basically threw us off the property,'' he said. ''Didn't
want any help from anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, she did the same when counselors from Morris
County tried to look in on her, Bailey said. Authorities would not
say why social workers wanted to visit the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Township police have an officer assigned to check on
elderly residents or anyone else who might need extra attention,
but participation in the program is voluntary, and no officer was
ever asked to go to Petrowsky's house, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult, because when you're dealing with adults,
the only way to get them help against their will if they're
mentally ill or have some other problem is for a family member to
go to court and have them declared unfit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was not done in Petrowsky's case, Bailey said. In fact, it
took police weeks to track down any of her relatives to notify them
of her death, he said. Her sister, Barbara Wade of Sparta, declined
comment through her lawyer, and did not return a message left on
her home answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the signs that something was wrong began accumulating,
no one went to check on the woman. Her mail was piling up at a post
office box in nearby Califon, but because rent on the box was paid
through the end of 1999, no one from the post office thought to
check on her, either. The unclaimed mail was returned to the
senders.
</P>
<P>
   It included two delinquent property tax notices sent by
Washington Township. But no tax lien was due to be placed on the
house, assessed at $192,400, until next month. The annual tax bill
was nearly $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   As bills went unpaid, Petrowsky's utilities were turned off. A
gas company worker tacked a notice on her front door in April,
warning that service would soon be shut off.
</P>
<P>
   And neighbors thought it odd that the windows in Petrowsky's
house stayed open all winter. When springtime rolled around, the
property became overgrown with weeds. But still, no one took it
upon themselves to check on her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said to a couple of neighbors, 'You know, I haven't seen
'The Witch' in a while; should I go check on her?' '' said the
neighbor who moved in seven years ago. ''But she used to shoot BB
guns at kids who walked around back there, so I never went.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Aug. 6 when a neighbor mustered enough courage
and curiosity to go to Petrowsky's house and look for her. The
unidentified resident knocked on the door but got no answer. In the
driveway, a sopping wet copy of The New York Times had degenerated
into a pulpy mush, half inside a blue plastic wrapper. An inside
page showed the date as Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor went to the back of the property, walked through a
basement door and up the stairs into the fetid house, where he
found Petrowsky and the remains of her pets on the kitchen floor.
He went home and called police.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor angrily rejected suggestions that those who
lived near Petrowsky might have looked in on her more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ''My wife never saw her in 14 years,'' he said. ''It's not my
responsibility to check on my neighbors. The only good thing about
her being dead is I could cut the grass leading to the driveway
now. She wouldn't let me cut it before, and it looked like hell.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Weighs Acne Drug Restrictions  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Women and their doctors may soon face far
tougher restrictions on who can take the acne drug Accutane, which
can cause serious birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   Accutane is highly effective at fighting disfiguring acne, but
it can cause brain, facial and other birth defects. Thus,
Accutane's maker urges women to undergo two pregnancy tests before
taking the first dose, and to use two forms of birth control.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody enforces those recommendations, and 1,995 women have
gotten pregnant while using Accutane since it hit the market in
1982. Most of those pregnancies ended in abortion, but of the 383
babies born, 162 had birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of the women were already pregnant when they started
using Accutane, showing ''the system had really broken down in
those cases,'' said Food and Drug Administration drug chief Dr.
Janet Woodcock.
</P>
<P>
   So the FDA asked its scientific advisers how to beef up
manufacturer Hoffman-La Roche's voluntary safety program.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's recommendation late Monday: FDA should mandate a
formal registry of all doctors and patients prescribing or using
Accutane. Doctors who agree to certain pregnancy-prevention steps
would be certified to prescribe Accutane. Women would undergo
repeated pregnancy testing, and receive a month's supply of
Accutane only after pharmacists check the computerized registry to
verify they're cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA isn't bound by the recommendations and Woodcock said
only that she takes the advice ''very seriously.'' But, ''we came
in here with a position that more should be done,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Roche objected to a mandatory program.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Floods Could Slow Growth  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS DECHERD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Prime Minister Hun Sen warned
Tuesday that economic growth in poverty-stricken Cambodia would
likely slow because the worst flooding in 70 years has devastated
rice paddies and other farmland.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140 people have died in Vietnam and Cambodia in two
months of flooding, while 1 million people have lost their homes,
belongings, land or livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the southeastern province of Prey Veng, Hun Sen said
huge areas of rice paddies and fields used for other crops have
been submerged.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I have to worry about now ... is economics,'' Hun Sen
said, according to a national radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had hoped for 5.5 percent economic development this year
and some of that growth was to come from agriculture. But the
floods have sunk agriculture. So the question is, can we reach 5.5
percent or not?''
</P>
<P>
   The government said Tuesday that 116 people have died in the
floods in Cambodia. In neighboring Vietnam, at least 30 people have
died, including 23 children.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia is one of the world's poorest nations and its economy
largely depends on farming, with virtually all farmers growing
rice. International aid organizations have had some success in
getting farmers to diversify.
</P>
<P>
   The government also is struggling to industrialize the nation
but has faced many hurdles in the wake of the 1997 Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Monika Midel, Cambodia's director of the World Food Program,
said damage to crops will be extensive, though it's difficult to
estimate the losses while so much of the southeastern part of the
country is under water.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the main problems after the water recedes will be
(recovering from) crops destroyed and infrastructure destroyed or
damaged,'' said Midel.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Red Cross appealed for $1.9 million in aid, with
the bulk going to Cambodia. On Monday, the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies launched an additional
appeal for up to $1.5 million for Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 27; Nasdaq Climbs 67  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors again punished companies with
disappointing results Tuesday, limiting Wall Street's efforts to
rebound from a slide triggered by anxiety about corporate profits
and rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks moved higher but blue chips were down a day
after the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite index
tumbled more than 100 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading, the Dow fell 27.37 to 10,781.15.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 7.36 to 1,451.87, and the tech-dominated Nasdaq climbed
66.92 to 3,783.44.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some call it a rebound, some call it bargain hunting, but on
balance the uptake in the market leaves a lot to be desired,'' said
Alan Ackerman, a senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
''Overall, investors are still nervous over energy prices, the euro
and an economic slowdown which may prompt quarterly earnings to be
a bit lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have generally been down this month, after a healthy
rally in August that sent some issues soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Investors repeated Tuesday what has become a pattern in
September -- unloading the stocks of companies that even hint at
disappointing quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa was down $1.56 at $25.56 after the aluminum manufacturer
became the latest company to revise its earnings outlook downward
because of rising energy costs and softening demand. The company's
third-quarter earnings will still be 35 percent above last year,
but that wasn't enough to satisfy investors.
</P>
<P>
   Federal-Mogul dropped 75 cents to $8.50 after its top officer
stepped down and the auto-parts manufacturer warned of
lower-than-expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the Big Board, Ingersoll-Rand fell $4.19 to $35.56 after
warnings its profits would be below expectations because of
weakness in the euro, Europe's chief currency, and lower demand.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the third-quarter less than two weeks away, a
number of companies have said their results will be below Wall
Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings come as a growing number of indicators suggest the
economy is moderating, which raises questions about the impact
slower economic growth will have on corporate profits. A Commerce
Department report Tuesday said housing construction rose modestly
in August, but at levels below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices, which have climbed as high as $37 per barrel
of crude oil this week, are adding to the pressure on corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks were strengthened by merger news, although it was
unclear how lasting the rally would be.
</P>

<HEADLINE> It's official: Seltzer beat Rep. Forbes in primary  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) - Regina Seltzer, a 71-year-old former
librarian who spent a paltry $40,000 on her campaign, was declared
the winner by a 35-vote margin Tuesday in her primary contest
against Republican-turned-Democrat Rep. Michael Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote from the recanvass of the Sept. 12 primary was
Seltzer 6,077 to Forbes 6,042, said Suffolk County Democratic
Elections Commissioner Neil Tiger. Seltzer will face Republican
Felix Grucci, the Brookhaven Town Supervisor, in the Nov. 7 general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a three-term congressman who switched parties last year,
amassed a $1.4 million war chest, some of that coming from a
fund-raiser last April that featured President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer had said she ran for Congress because ''we should have
people in there who represent the ordinary person.''
</P>
<P>
   She immigrated from Poland at age 8 and worked as a school
librarian for 13 years. In the 1970s, she served one term on a town
council, her only previous elected office. After losing
re-election, she enrolled in law school at age 50. She works for
free for a Long Island environmental group and has written a book
on children's rights.
</P>
<P>
   As for her no-frills budget, Seltzer said: ''I don't like to ask
people for money.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer said her desire to defeat Forbes was fueled less by his
change in parties than his politics. Forbes backed Republican Newt
Gingrich's ''Contract With America'' and opposes legalized
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Only two incumbents have lost in primaries this year: Democrat
Rep. Marty Martinez of California and GOP Rep. Merrill Cook of
Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has said he would support Seltzer if she were declared
the official winner.

<P>
	   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) - The remnants of tropical depression
Gordon, which inundated North and South Carolina with up to 10
inches of rain, brought showers up the coast to New Jersey on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state had light showers, but heavier rain was
possible Tuesday afternoon and evening, said meteorologist Jim
Gross, of the National Weather Service in Mount Holly.
</P>
<P>
   A flash flood watch was in effect for the greater Philadelphia
area, where 1 to 3 inches of rain were possible.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy downpours also were possible in Union and Passaic
counties. The Weather Service warned of the possibility of flooding
in low lying areas and places with poor drainage.
</P>
<P>
   The former hurricane caused scattered flooding, roof damage and
power outages across Florida before streaming along the Southeast
coast Monday with heavy rain. The rain was blamed for two traffic
accident deaths in North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Coming Soon: Another Film Festival  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL HILL
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODSTOCK, N.Y. (AP) -- Here comes another Woodstock festival --
this one with movies and cocktails instead of guitar solos and rain
chants.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural Woodstock Film Festival begins Thursday. The
four-day event gives the famed arts colony a Birkenstocked foot in
the door to the glitzy world of film festivals. But the problem
could be getting noticed in an increasingly crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the big-name festivals like Sundance and Telluride,
dozens of more modest festivals are cropping up nationwide. Chris
Gore, author of ''The Ultimate Film Festival Survival Guide,''
estimates that more than 100 new festivals have begun since his
book's first edition in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Many are regional festivals lacking in A-list stars, chichi
parties or industry clout. They are apt to show shoestring
productions, experimental shorts or documentaries. They have names
like the Rehoboth Beach Independent Film Festival, the Double Take
Documentary Film Festival and the Butt-Numb-A-Thon Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a film festival every weekend of the year, more than
one,'' said Nic Holt, director of the Kudzu Film Festival of
Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers cite a few reasons for the proliferation:
Towns like film festivals because they provide tourism dollars and
a taste of Hollywood, independent filmmakers flock to them for the
chance to show their work on the big screen; audiences are drawn by
the chance to see something different or offbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've become in a way an alternative distribution for
movies,'' Gore said. ''These movies don't open at the multiplexes
and the mall theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kudzu festival drew more than 3,000 people last year. The
Wisconsin Film Festival in Madison drew 12,000 in its second year.
Woodstock organizers hope to draw a few thousand people with more
than 60 movies -- many of them non-mainstream fare like ''The
Wedding Cow'' and ''Shooting Vegetarians.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are slim that these smaller festivals will launch the
next ''Blair Witch Project'' -- which became blockbuster-bound after
its discovery at Sundance last year. But Gore notes that a number
of filmmakers, like Richard Schenkman (''The Pompatus of Love''),
have generated buzz through the festival circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Also, buyers for cable stations keep track of the festivals,
said International Documentary Association president David
Haugland. Cable stations have a voracious appetite for
documentaries and other films, contributing to the bull market for
independent films.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oddly enough, it doesn't seem yet that there are too many
festivals,'' Haugland said. ''From the filmmaker's perspective, it
can be hard to dig through the maze to see where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of smaller festivals don't tend to see each other as
competitors since they operate in different areas and on different
weekends. But the congestion of festivals can make it hard for
upstarts to get noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Woodstock has the advantage of a built-in artsy cachet. Even
before the famed 1969 Woodstock concert -- which was actually held a
bit south, in Bethel, N.Y. -- the town was a magnet for artists and
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Festival organizers are taking full advantage of the town's
image -- the event's symbol is a peace sign with an imbedded ''W.''
Music and film will be a festival theme and it will close with ''My
Generation,'' a film about the Woodstock concerts of 1969, 1994 and
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the fact that Woodstock is close to New York City (where,
by the way, the 38th annual New York Film Festival opens Friday),
and festival organizer Meira Blaustein sees a formula for success.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think there's something very special and magical about
Woodstock and that this area that will make the festival unique,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger-name movies at Woodstock this year include a screening of
''Stop Making Sense,'' Jonathan Demme's 1984 concert film on the
Talking Heads; stars expected to attend include actor Aidan Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Blaustein expects the festival to grow in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Gore said it will likely do so in the face of even more
film festivals. He notes that making movies these days is the same
sort of everyday activity as starting a garage band. Meanwhile, it
remains easy for festival organizers to attract advertisers, and
struggling filmmakers are happy to pay entry fees of $35 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's not a film festival within 100 miles,'' he said,
''it's a good place to start one.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Kills 16 in Pakistan's Capital  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- In the deadliest bombing this year in
Pakistan, a bomb tucked into a crate of grapes tore through a
bustling produce market Tuesday, killing 16 people and wounding
more than 80.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs in Pakistan have killed at least 74 people this year, but
no one has been convicted in any of the more than 40 attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, condemned
Tuesday's blast on the outskirts of Islamabad as a ''dastardly act
of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and doctors said that 16 people were confirmed dead, and
several of the wounded were in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has blamed rival India for many previous bombings, but
the government made no such accusation Tuesday. India has
consistently denied any involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion scattered grapes, apples and bananas over the
grounds of the open-air market as workers were unloading crates
from delivery trucks shortly before 8 a.m. The blast sent workers
and shoppers stampeding from the city's largest wholesale fruit and
vegetable market.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the explosion and saw fruit flying in the air,'' said
Hasan Khan, a shop owner who was just 60 feet from the blast.
''People started running and screaming. We pulled down the shutters
on our shop and left.''
</P>
<P>
   Police detained seven truck drivers in Islamabad for
questioning. Authorities later arrested three men in northwest
Pakistan, near the border with Afghanistan, where the truck with
grapes began its journey.
</P>
<P>
   The market is in a poor neighborhood, and many of the victims
were Afghan refugees, who unload the dozens of trucks that arrive
each day from farms.
</P>
<P>
   Since Musharraf seized power last October, ousting an elected
civilian government, political unrest in Pakistan has declined.
</P>
<P>
   But with its chaotic cities, the easy availability of
explosives, and a police force that has limited investigative
skills, Pakistan is vulnerable to terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the explosions have targeted outdoor markets, bus
stations and other crowded public places in major cities such as
Karachi and Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's bombing was the first this year in Islamabad. The
capital has traditionally been calm even when other Pakistani
cities were aflame.
</P>
<P>
   Islamabad is home to many government bureaucrats, businessmen
and diplomats, and does not have the huge, restless slums found in
other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan claims Indian-sponsored terrorists are behind many of
the attacks, saying it is an extension of their long-running
dispute over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. The two countries
trade fire almost daily in Kashmir, and have fought two of their
three wars over the divided territory.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has also been plagued by infighting between domestic
political factions, and periodic violence between Sunni and Shiite
Muslim groups.

<HEADLINE> Bill With Trade Tax Breaks Advances  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Finance Committee approved a bill
Tuesday to provide about $4.5 billion in tax breaks for foreign
sales by U.S. corporations to replace a tax system ruled an illegal
subsidy by the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO decision, which upheld a challenge to U.S. Foreign Sales
Corporation laws from the European Union, gave the United States
until Oct. 1 to replace the invalidated system. After that date,
the EU could begin imposing new tariffs and sanctions on U.S.
products that officials fear might spark a massive trade war across
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the estimated 6,000 U.S. companies that
operate offshore sales subsidiaries don't want to lose a lucrative
tax benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation satisfies the United States' WTO obligations
and ensures that U.S. companies will compete on a level playing
field in the global marketplace,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del.,
chairman of the Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Sales Corporation rules invalidated by the WTO allow
U.S. companies to reduce income taxes by 15 percent through
subsidiaries set up outside the United States. It is roughly equal
to a tax rebate provided by the EU to its export companies.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO, however, determined that FSC is a special exception not
permitted under international trade rules. The new system, costing
$4.5 billion over 10 years, addresses that objection and moves
these U.S. tax laws closer to those used by Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ''This whole bill is an effort by the United States to show good
faith,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved by the committee on a voice vote, next goes
to the Senate floor. The House last week passed similar
legislation, although the Senate bill included an amendment by
Grassley to remove a 100 percent deduction corporations can claim
for dividends paid out of earnings and profits from certain foreign
income.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers questioned continuing large tax breaks to certain
corporations. Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., wanted to offer an
amendment barring pharmaceutical companies from benefiting because
drugs frequently cost more in the United States than they do
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most Americans do not understand the nuances of international
trade, but they do understand when they are getting gouged,'' Bryan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, however, said the
trade tax bill is essential to avoid a trade war and is not the
proper place to debate the high cost of prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would not be appropriate and it would also delay passage of
the legislation,'' Eizenstat said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> FDA Proposes Antibiotic Warnings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Antibiotics may soon bear an official warning
-- that overusing them is wearing them out.
</P>
<P>
   Germs are growing increasingly impervious to the world's
antibiotics. Many common infections can no longer be treated by old
standbys like penicillin, and some even are becoming untreatable by
the antibiotic of last resort, vancomycin.
</P>
<P>
   The more often an antibiotic is used, the more chances bacteria
have to evolve ways to evade it. Infectious-disease experts have
long warned that antibiotics are being overused -- too often
prescribed for viruses like colds that the drugs simply cannot
treat, for example. And they're often used improperly, such as when
patients don't take all the prescribed doses, making leftover germs
more resistant to any future treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to fight that trend, the Food and Drug Administration
proposed Tuesday placing special warnings on virtually all
antibiotic labels reminding doctors to prescribe them only when
truly necessary, and explaining when that is. The label also would
include tips for doctors to use in counseling patients about proper
antibiotic use.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is taking the step because ''antibiotic resistance is a
serious and growing public health concern in the United States and
the world,'' said FDA Commissioner Jane Henney.
</P>
<P>
   But the warnings would be only on the drugs' official label --
and very few doctors read drug labels anymore. The agency is
considering whether more direct-to-consumer advice is warranted.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA will consider mandating the new labels after a 75-day
public comment period.

<HEADLINE> Melissa Etheridge, Girlfriend Split  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Another celebrity lesbian couple is calling it
quits.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker Melissa Etheridge and her girlfriend, director Julie
Cypher, announced Tuesday they were ending their relationship after
12 years. The couple has two small children together.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the utmost of love and respect for one another, we have
decided to separate,'' the couple announced in a statement released
by Etheridge's label, Island Records.
</P>
<P>
   ''As committed parents, our top priority continues to be what is
in the best interest of our children. Though elements of our lives
will change, our family will always remain intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge and Cypher were one of Hollywood's most famous lesbian
couples, after Ellen DeGeneres and Ann Heche, who announced their
breakup last month.
</P>
<P>
   Cypher gave birth to the couple's 3-year-old daughter and
1-year-old son. In January, they revealed to Rolling Stone magazine
that rock legend David Crosby was the children's biological father,
donating the sperm so the couple could conceive through artificial
insemination.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge's publicist, Sheila Richman, told The Associated Press
that the couple would not discuss custody issues or any other
details of the split.

<HEADLINE> American Fights French Extradition  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- With the law closing in after nearly 20 years on
the run, former American antiwar activist Ira Einhorn made a rare
public appeal to France's prime minister to reconsider extraditing
him to the United States for a new trial in the murder of his
ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn, 60, fled the United States in 1981, shortly before he
was scheduled for trial in a Pennsylvania court. He was sentenced
in absentia to life in prison for the murder of his girlfriend
Holly Maddux in 1977. Her corpse was found stuffed in a trunk
inside a closet of his Philadelphia home.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn accused Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham and
other U.S. officials of lying to France to win his extradition,
saying they would never grant him a day in court since he was
already convicted once for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   He sat smiling at a Paris news conference with his arms folded
accross his chest when asked to make the case for his innocence.
Asked if he felt any compassion for the family of his slain
ex-girlfriend, Einhorn replied: ''What I have to say to the Maddux
family is: 'Let them eat tomatoes'.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Abraham said Einhorn's comments exposed him as
''arrogant and unrepentant.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The true character of Ira Einhorn I think was revealed,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn has denied killing Maddux and blames her death on a U.S.
government conspiracy against him. He claims the U.S. government
does not have a right to intervene in the judiciary process by
seeking to return him to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin signed extradition papers in
July after receiving assurances that Einhorn would receive a new
trial and would not face the death penalty if found guilty. France
does not have the death penalty and under French law cannot send
foreign nationals to countries where they would face capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn's case has become a cause celebre for leftist French
politicians and human rights groups that oppose the United States'
use of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham has said that if Einhorn faced trial in Philadelphia, he
would not be eligible for the death penalty because the state did
not have capital punishment when the crime occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Einhorn's lawyers said at Tuesday's news conference that they
had asked Jospin, in an appeal dated Sept. 18, to reconsider his
extradition order.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin has four months to respond to the request, and lawyers
said they could then lodge a final appeal with the Conseil d'Etat,
France's highest legal administrative body.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Einhorn will continue to live in a village near
Bordeaux, where he is under constant police surveillance.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic's Wife Joins in Campaign  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Struggling in the polls just days
before elections, Slobodan Milosevic has turned to his Marxist wife
for help -- and her withering diatribes against the opposition and
the West are setting the tone for Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Mirjana Markovic is openly campaigning with
her husband and running for a federal parliament seat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's most autocratic leaders, Milosevic faces a
popular challenger, Vojislav Kostunica, in the presidential race.
Polls show Kostunica in a clear lead.
</P>
<P>
   In fiery campaign speeches, Markovic divides the country into
patriots and traitors. The elections, she tells voters, are a
do-or-die battle in the defense of the state against ''evil''
Western ''neocolonialism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''NATO has again attacked Yugoslavia through traitor
opposition,'' Markovic, 58, told a recent campaign rally. Political
opponents, she added, were ''mental retards'' and ''dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Her tough tone leaves no doubt that the Milosevic regime is
prepared to go all the way to fight any opposition victory in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic, dubbed by her many enemies as ''the Lady Macbeth of
the Balkans'' and ''the Red Witch,'' had a key role in Milosevic's
climb to power.
</P>
<P>
   When Milosevic's popularity plummeted in 1993 because of his
shift from communism to nationalism, Markovic formed her own
left-wing JUL party to keep true Marxist followers in the ruling
party fold.
</P>
<P>
   The co-founders of Markovic's party say that at their opening
meeting, she asked: ''Which is the strongest organization in the
world?''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Mafia,'' someone in the crowd replied.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say JUL -- which combines extreme-left rhetoric with the
practices of early capitalism -- was formed along Mafia lines, with
no popular backing, but strict rules that made its leaders rich and
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The party only once -- in 1998 in Serbia's sister republic of
Montenegro -- ran alone in the elections, receiving less than 1
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic and Milosevic met in high school in their hometown of
Pozarevac, in central Serbia. She came from a distinguished
communist family and boasted that one day her Slobo would be as
prominent a leader as Josip Broz Tito, the communist president of
Yugoslavia at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Markovic, a sociology professor at Belgrade University,
was instrumental in helping Milosevic -- then a raising communist
party apparatchik -- oust their longtime friend and patron Ivan
Stambolic as the head of Serbia's Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Stambolic was abducted in Belgrade and has not seen
since. The opposition has accused Milosevic's secret police of
being behind the kidnapping, alleging Stambolic knew too much about
the Milosevic family.
</P>
<P>
   Even more hard-line than Milosevic, Markovic persuaded her
husband not to recognize opposition victories in local elections in
1996, triggering months of demonstrations before he changed his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   When independent media editor Slavko Curuvija challenged
Milosevic's decision to go to war with NATO over Kosovo last year,
she publicly charged he was helping the alliance target bombs at
Belgrade. Soon after, Curuvija was assassinated. His killers were
never named.
</P>
<P>
   Biographer Slavoljub Djukic, author of a book on the ruling
couple, depicts Milosevic as a beleaguered, emotionless leader
detached from everyday reality, who trusts no one but his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic, he writes, is a reclusive woman who maintains her
husband and country are the targets of domestic and international
plots.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal, those who know the couple say, is to stay in power --
and escape the fate of Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his
wife, Elena, who were toppled in an anti-communist uprising in 1989
and executed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without Mira,'' as Mirjana is known in Serbia, ''Sloba would
not be where he is now,'' Djukic said.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic, a short, plump woman who always wears dark dresses and
no makeup, is detested by opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Milosevic's associates dislike her, maintaining her
tirades against the opposition and the West, delivered in her
high-pitched voice, are irritants to both Milosevic's allies and
foes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no better propaganda for the opposition then when
state media carries Mira's speeches,'' said the head of the
opposition election campaign, Cedomir Jovanovic.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her speeches are so irritating that even Milosevic's
supporters switch channels when they see her.''

<HEADLINE> Two Plays Become Actor's B'Day Gift  </HEADLINE>
By MATT WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Many people start thinking of retirement at 60.
Not Sir Alan Ayckbourn.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran British dramatist marked the milestone last year by
writing ''a birthday present for myself'' -- two plays running at
the same time in separate theaters, featuring one cast.
</P>
<P>
   The separate but intricately related ''House'' and ''Garden''
constitute a singular theatrical event. Premiered last year at
Ayckbourn's home theater in the Yorkshire coastal town of
Scarborough, they opened Aug. 9 at the Royal National Theater,
where they are running in repertory with -- among other plays --
''Hamlet'' and ''Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   Both plays are sold out for the run. Theatergoers may see them
in the order of their choice, or just see one.
</P>
<P>
   ''House'' is a wrenching but also hilarious drama about a wife,
Jane Asher's deliciously cool Trish Platt, so fed up with her
philandering businessman-husband Teddy (David Haig) that she has
rendered him invisible. (''Marry a Platt, and that's that,'' is her
concise estimation of events.)
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Teddy's indiscretions are plain for all to see in
''Garden,'' which takes place on the extensive grounds of the
lushly appointed suburban home where ''House'' is set.
</P>
<P>
   Both plays end with the same line, ''Ah well, that's life, I
suppose,'' and an extended curtain call, as the 32-strong company
hotfoot it through the National's backstage labyrinth to take their
bows in two separate auditoriums. (Ayckbourn estimates the dash can
take 87 seconds.)
</P>
<P>
   A garden fete follows in the National auditorium, replicating
offstage the activities that the people in ''House'' and ''Garden''
are preparing for onstage.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was intended as a party,'' says Ayckbourn, who adds,
''There are things that come off them, I hope -- how we are all
walk-ons in other people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it is: While Teddy chugs back and forth between shows,
playing one character before two different audiences, some
characters feature more prominently in one script than the other.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderfully named Gavin Ryng-Mayne (Malcolm Sinclair), a
visiting novelist with a seductive manner as smooth as his silken
hair, has a scene to freeze the blood in ''House,'' while the
sillier and more amorphous ''Garden'' is largely given over to the
separate marital woes of neighboring doctor Giles (Michael Siberry)
and his hysteric of a wife, Joanna (Sian Thomas).
</P>
<P>
   Asher -- a well-known and admired English actress -- commandeers
''House,'' playing an Ibsen-style heroine who won't be done in by
domestic malaise. But she gets a scant single scene in ''Garden,''
peering over a garden wall.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically for Ayckbourn, relationships come in for a
rough critique throughout, although ''House'' at least suggests
that the younger generation may get it right where their parents
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Just as typical is the playwright's sheer love of craft and of
theatrical invention. He has written nearly as many plays -- 56 -- as
he is years old.
</P>
<P>
   His 1984 show ''Intimate Exchanges,'' for instance, features 16
possible endings, while an early Ayckbourn hit, ''The Norman
Conquests'' from 1973, views the same events from the garden, the
sitting room and the dining room; unlike ''House'' and ''Garden,''
those plays aren't meant to be performed simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bedroom Farce'' in 1975 was a series of virtually cinematic
crosscuts, just as a more recent play, ''The Revengers' Comedies,''
unfolded a tale of vengeance across nearly six hours and two
halves. Last year's West End entry, the satiric ''Comic
Potential,'' opens off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theater Club in
November. Janie Dee reprises her Olivier Award-winning performance
as an ''actoid'' -- a robotic actor programmed to feel emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are all ingredients that are available to a dramatist,''
says Ayckbourn, who has a new play, ''Virtual Reality,'' in which
the action takes place almost entirely on mobile phones. Already
seen in Scarborough, that play is awaiting a London run next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope I don't write too many pure gimmicks,'' he goes on,
''but I do love events, and particularly when you run a theater
year in and year out, you have to keep drawing attention
occasionally to the fact that you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   The plays are a pleasure for actors, too, not least the marathon
demands of ''House'' and ''Garden.'' Chuckles David Haig, the
plays' indefatigable 44-year-old star, ''I'm fitter now than I was,
say, on May 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayckbourn, for his part, has no plans to forsake his own
marathon playwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm 56 plays in,'' he says, ''and maybe I'll do a few more. I
just want to keep going.''

<HEADLINE> Injury Delays Luxembourg Coronation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Luxembourg on Tuesday postponed the
planned coronation of Crown Prince Henri as monarch out of concern
for the health of his younger brother Prince Guillaume who remains
in a coma a week after he was injured in a car crash outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Henri was scheduled to be sworn in as Grand Duke Sept. 28 to
replace his farther Jean, who is stepping down after 26 years as
head of state.
</P>
<P>
   However the injuries to 37-year-old Guillaume and his wife,
Princess Sibilla, have cast a shadow over the planned celebrations.
Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker announced the the abdication and
coronation ceremonies were postponed until Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors tell us that the critical state of Prince
Guillaume requires the presence of his parents in Paris in the next
five to ten days,'' Juncker said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   A palace statement Tuesday said Guillaume's condition in a Paris
hospital was stable but worrying. ''We will only be able to judge
the evolution of neurological condition in several days,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Duke Jean, his wife Grand Duchess Josephine-Charlotte and
Crown Prince Henri were at the stricken prince's bedside. Princess
Sibilla injuries were less serious and she was able to leave the
hospital Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchy remains deeply popular in Luxembourg and the nation
of 365,000 has been shocked and saddened by the injuries to the
Grand Duke's youngest son.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Grand Duke Jean announced he would stand aside as
monarch of the prosperous little nation wedged between Belgium,
France and Germany. He has been head of state since November 1964,
when his mother, Grand Duchess Charlotte, abdicated.
</P>
<P>
   Under Luxembourg's constitutional monarchy, the Grand Duke's
role is largely ceremonial, but he must sign all bills before they
can become law and has power to dissolve parliament.

<HEADLINE> Putin Considers Clinton Warning  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is urging Russian President
Vladimir Putin to shelve plans to sell laser technology to Iran,
telling him it could be adapted to a nuclear weapons program, an
administration official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader took the request seriously, but the follow-up
is critical, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has raised the prospective sale with Putin at least
twice -- at an eight-nation economic summit meeting in Japan in July
and this month while the two leaders were in New York for the U.N.
Millennium Summit -- the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal was framed in the context of the campaign the
administration undertook in 1993 and accelerated in 1996 to stop
the ''leakage'' of dangerous technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The official told The Associated Press he was convinced Clinton
had managed to get Putin focused on the problem. His promise to
consider the appeal was reassuring, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russian experts apparently are not so convinced as
Americans that the laser technology could help Iran in what the
United States believes is a secret program to acquire nuclear
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Iran contends the technology it seeks would be used for peaceful
purposes, but U.S. officials are skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, strapped for money, has pursued a lucrative relationship
with Iran, often at the cost of roiling Russia's relationship with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A second U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, said the
process, atomic vapor laser isotope separation, was internationally
recognized as sensitive nuclear technology.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the United States would strongly object to
transferring this technology to any country whose nuclear
activities are suspect.

<HEADLINE> Student pleads innocent in holding teacher's aide hostage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) - A student accused of holding a
teacher's aide hostage inside a school for emotionally disturbed
youngsters in February has pleaded innocent to kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Fischer, 18, of Pennsauken, also pleaded innocent to
robbing a gun store to steal the weapon used in the three-hour
standoff. He entered his plea Monday before state Superior Court
Judge John A. Almeida here.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, who is being held in the Burlington County Jail in lieu
of $500,000 bail, must undergo a psychiatric evaluation before his
next court appearance, scheduled for Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly held a teacher's aide hostage inside a bathroom at
the Hampton Academy in Westampton, a private school for students
with behavioral and learning problems, on Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Fischer pulled a gun on a fellow student in the
bathroom after the student refused to give him a cigarette. The
aide persuaded Fischer to trade him for the student hostage.
</P>
<P>
   A SWAT team surrounded the school and negotiated with Fischer,
who eventually released the aide unharmed and surrendered without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was charged with kidnapping, aggravated assault,
criminal restraint and weapons offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The weapon used - a .22-caliber gun - had been stolen two days
before from Walt's Shooting Supplies in Delran, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Botticelli's Divine Comedy on View  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Botticelli's illustrations for Dante's Divine Comedy
were reunited and put on display together in Italy on Tuesday for
the first time in centuries.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi inaugurated the exhibit of 92
drawings, ''Sandro Botticelli: Painter of the Divine Comedy,''
which runs through Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe the Renaissance master executed the ink drawings
between 1480 and 1495. Most are unfinished. Seven belong to the
Vatican library; 85 are from a Berlin museum.
</P>
<P>
   The first known historical reference to the manuscript is in a
1540 document that says it was commissioned by a member Florence's
ruling de' Medici family. It is unclear when the manuscript was
broken up, but the Vatican library is known to have acquired its
drawings in 1658 from Queen Cristina of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The reunited manuscript was exhibited this spring in Berlin and
will travel to London's Royal Academy next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rome exhibition -- at a remodeled stable at the presidential
palace called the Scuderie Papali -- adds historical and cultural
context for Botticelli and Renaissance Florence by including works
of the artist's contemporaries such as Leonardo da Vinci and rare
books from the period.

<HEADLINE> IMF Sees Global Economy Growing  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Surging oil prices and the sinking
euro are rattling markets, but the International Monetary Fund
predicted Tuesday the world economy could demonstrate better growth
this year than it has in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Economies should also improve at healthy rates in 2001, led by
the powerful U.S. expansion, more growth in Europe and a continued
recovery from the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98, the IMF said
in its latest World Economic Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF predicted the global economy will grow by 4.7 percent
this year, an 0.5 percentage point increase from the last such
prediction in May.
</P>
<P>
   That would match growth last recorded in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But oil prices hovering at levels unseen since the 1990 Persian
Gulf crisis could spoil the rosy picture, IMF officials
acknowledged a week before the annual meetings here of the IMF and
its sister institution, the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mussa, the IMF chief economist, warned of several other
potential downsides, including the euro's slide against the U.S.
dollar and the Japanese yen as well as the record U.S. trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Strong growth is recorded in virtually all the world's
regions,'' Mussa told a news conference. ''And it should sustain
better than 4 percent growth next year, but there are still some
downside risks because of oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Mussa warned that if the healthy U.S. economy grinds to a sudden
halt, that could harm prospects elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Activists who see economic globalization as a menace to ordinary
people everywhere say they will be out in force as the IMF and
World Bank annual meetings formally begin next Tuesday. They hope
thousands of people will block roads in a repeat of demonstrations
that marred a World Trade Organization meeting last year in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters intend to remain nonviolent, said Alice Dvorska,
a spokeswoman for the Initiative Against Economic Globalization.
But she accused the big international lending agencies of funding
projects, such as dams in the Third World, that forcibly ruin the
lives of powerless poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The programs of the World Bank are displacing 3.2 million
people, and that's the real violence,'' Dvorska said.
</P>
<P>
   IMF economists said the world economy should grow at the rate of
4.2 percent in 2001, raising the May forecast by 0.3 percentage
point.
</P>
<P>
   Among potential pitfalls: the imbalance in America's current
account, the broadest measure of U.S. trade, which is running this
year at an annual rate of more than $400 billion after hitting a
record $331.5 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 182-nation IMF also is concerned about the euro, the single
currency launched by 11 members of the European Union, that
recently was worth 85 cents to the dollar -- its lowest since being
launched in January 1999 at $1.16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile oil prices, currently trading above $36 a barrel in
New York, are higher than the IMF assumed in its forecast.
Officials acknowledged privately this could cut projected economic
growth in industrialized countries by 0.2 percentage point as their
fuel bill rises by another $40 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   Mussa said the global economic growth estimate could fall to
around 3.75 percent for next year if oil remains high for an
extended period.
</P>
<P>
   The pinch of more expensive fuel has stirred protests across
Europe, raising fears of a new energy crisis. But some expert urge
calm, noting that despite higher prices, many consuming nations are
much more energy efficient than they were during the oil shocks of
the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, IMF economists predicted growth of 5.2
percent in 2000, 0.8 percentage point above the May estimate. In
2001, they project growth to ease to 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF said this would represent the intended ''soft landing''
that the Federal Reserve has been trying to achieve through a
series of interest rate increases to keep growth -- and inflation --
under control.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF warned rates may have to go up again.
</P>
<P>
   For Japan, the No. 2 global economy, IMF economists predicted
growth of 1.4 percent this year and 1.8 percent next year. Japan
has struggled for years, only to achieve a recovery that ''remains
fragile and subject to downside risks,'' the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook is better in Europe, with nations using the euro
projected to show 3.5 percent growth this year and 3.4 percent next
year.

<HEADLINE> Census Response Rate Tops 1990  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two-thirds of Americans returned their census
forms this year, reversing a long slide in initial participation in
the official national head count, the government reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The final 2000 census response rate by mail or Internet was 67
percent, two percentage points higher than the mailback rate in
1990, Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That result halts a ... slide and actually begins to reverse
it,'' said Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta.
</P>
<P>
   The wider participation also saves money, Prewitt said, because
every percentage point of mailed response represents 1.2 million
households that don't have to be visited by Census workers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to that improvement in response the $6.5 billion effort
''will be in the black,'' he said. ''The American people stepped
forward and sent in their forms and that made it less expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census had budgeted for a 61 percent response rate,
following declines from 78 percent in 1970 to 75 percent in 1980
and 65 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Census field workers are now completing follow-up visits to
homes that failed to answer their forms, said Prewitt.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990 rate was topped despite controversy about questions on
the long form which some people felt were intrusive. Prewitt said
the return rate for the short form was about 11 percent better than
for the long form, but the difference was made up during follow-up
visits to people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   The actual tabulation of the nation's population must be
delivered to President Clinton by Dec. 31. The Supreme Court last
year ruled those figures must be used to reapportion the 435 seats
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Population figures, adjusted by using a statistical method known
as ''sampling,'' are scheduled for release by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers will be based on adjustments to the head count
after a survey of 314,000 households. Sampling has provoked
controversy and continues to face scrutiny in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of sampling say it helps account for people missed in
prior counts, especially the poor, minorities and inner-city
residents -- segments of the population that tend to vote
Democratic. Opponents contend that only an actual head count can be
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The state and local numbers are used in drawing legislative
district lines and allocating billions of dollars in federal and
other aid.
</P>
<P>
   The top response rate, 76 percent, was scored by Iowa and 14
states topped 70 percent, the agency said. Puerto Rico had the
lowest rate at 53 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dow Sheds 23; Nasdaq Climbs 81  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rallied Tuesday on bargain
hunting and analysts' enthusiasm, but the overall market struggled
to rebound after a slide triggered by anxiety about corporate
profits and rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chips remained down a day after the Dow Jones industrial
average and Nasdaq composite index tumbled more than 100 points
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading, the Dow was down 22.29 at 10,786.23.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 8.19 to 1,452.70, and the tech-dominated Nasdaq climbed
81.41 to 3,807.93.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have generally been down this month, after a healthy
rally in August that sent some issues soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some call it a rebound, some call it bargain hunting, but on
balance, the uptake in the market leaves a lot to be desired,''
said Alan Ackerman, a senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
''Overall, investors are still nervous over energy prices, the euro
and an economic slowdown which may prompt quarterly earnings to be
a bit lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks rallied early in the day after Cobalt Networks
announced it was being acquired by Sun Microsystems in a $2 billion
stock deal. The computer server manufacturer's shares rose $14.88
to $56, a 36 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Software company Ariba was also up $9.06 at $153 after it
announced it would provide e-commerce support systems to Transora,
a global business-to-business Web site for food, beverage and
consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
   Intel traded up $3.31 at $59.13 after Banc of America Securities
upgraded the chipmaker's shares to ''buy'' from ''market perform.''
The recommendation came less than a week after the same bank
downgraded the company, whose stock has been on a downward trend
since the beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' enthusiasm also helped push another chipmaker, Micron
Technology, up $5.44 to $63.44 on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of Tuesday, investors repeated what has become a
pattern this September -- unloading the stocks of companies that
even hint at disappointing quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the third-quarter less than two weeks away, a
number of companies have said their results will be below Wall
Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of indicators suggest the economy is
moderating, which raises questions about the impact slower economic
growth will have on corporate profits. A Commerce Department report
Tuesday said housing construction rose modestly in August, but at
levels below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa was down $1.44 at $25.69 after the aluminum manufacturer
became the latest company to revise its earnings outlook downward
because of rising energy costs and softening demand. The company's
third-quarter earnings will still be 35 percent above last year,
but that wasn't enough to satisfy investors.
</P>
<P>
   Federal-Mogul dropped $1.25 cents to $8 after its top officer
stepped down and the auto-parts manufacturer warned of
lower-than-expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings warnings also sent Ingersoll-Rand down $4.19 to $35.56
after warnings. The tool and machinery manufacturer blamed the bad
news on weakness in the euro, Europe's chief currency, and lower
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices, which have climbed as high as $37 per barrel
of crude oil this week, are adding to the pressure on corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 674.00 million
shares, ahead of the 649.89 million shares in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.27 at 516.41.

<HEADLINE> Court TV Cancels Show  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Court TV has scrapped its ''Confessions'' series
after only two weeks, saying it erred in telecasting the
much-criticized program with videotapes of criminals confessing
their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The second, and last, ''Confessions'' episode aired Sunday on
the cable network.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the first time we've made a mistake,'' said Henry
Schleiff, chairman of Court TV. ''Hopefully, we'll make more
favorable decisions as time goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before it aired, the so-called reality series attracted
criticism from people who considered it a lurid exercise in bad
taste that was insensitive to crime victims' feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The first show, which aired Sept. 10, featured the confessions
of New York City criminals. They included Daniel Rakowitz, charged
with killing his female roommate in 1989 and boiling her body, and
David Garcia, a prostitute found guilty of murdering a client in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Schleiff vigorously defended the program, saying it
was ''kind of ridiculous'' for a network that covers trials and
criminal investigations not to show bad people describing their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   But, upon reflection, he said Court TV should have taken into
account the feelings of crime victims. And he said one criticism of
the show -- that the confessions were placed in virtually no context
-- hit the mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''The depth of these feelings was probably something we
underestimated,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Court TV had bought 13 episodes of the series from producers
Richard Kroehling and Eric Nadler, both TV newsmagazine veterans.
The final 11 won't air, but Schleiff said tapes of some confessions
may be used at some point in another format, perhaps a documentary
about criminal confessions.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Confessions'' debut was seen in 265,000 households,
roughly double the number of homes that were tuned to Court TV on
the same night a year ago. Ratings for the final telecast were
unavailable.

<HEADLINE> Staph Vaccine Proves Effective  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- A vaccine has been shown for the first time to
protect against life-threatening staph infections, a major hazard
among hospital patients, researchers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The genetically engineered vaccine was tested first in kidney
dialysis patients, and it cut their risk of staph blood poisoning
in half for nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am quite encouraged by this. It could be a major
breakthrough in this area,'' said Dr. Steve Black of the Kaiser
Permanente Vaccine Study Center in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Black presented the results in a last-minute addition to the
program of the annual infectious disease meeting of the American
Society for Microbiology.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine, called StaphVAX, was created at the National
Institutes of Health and is being developed by Nabi Corp. of Boca
Raton, Fla., which financed the latest study.
</P>
<P>
   Staphylococcus aureus is a common and ordinarily harmless
inhabitant of the human nasal tract. It can live for days outside
the body on almost any surface and spreads widely in hospitals,
where it can cause serious infections among those who are already
sick, especially if they have weak immune defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Staph can be deadly if it invades the bloodstream. It can lead
to pneumonia, encephalitis, liver abscesses and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   Staph infections are relatively common among people who use
needles frequently, such as diabetics and dialysis patients,
elderly people in nursing homes and those who are hospitalized for
surgery and a variety of other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors conducted the first large test of StaphVAX in dialysis
patients because typically between 1 percent and 3 percent of them
get bloodstream staph infections each year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Naso, Nabi's research director, said the company will
seek approval soon from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to
produce and sell the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The study enrolled 1,804 patients at 90 dialysis centers in
California. Half got the vaccine, while the rest took dummy shots.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine appeared to quickly lower the risk of staph. After
10 months, there were 11 serious infections among those getting the
vaccine, compared with 26 in the unprotected group, a 57 percent
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine triggers the body to make fresh antibodies against
staph. After one year, the patients' antibody levels dropped, and
their protection against staph began to fade.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julie Gerberding, head of hospital infections at the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, noted that staph is an
especially difficult problem for dialysis patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can get this much protection in them, it might work
even better in other patients,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Staph infections are of particular concern because the bacteria
is growing immune to the antibiotics commonly used to treat it.
Half of all staph that circulates in hospitals is resistant to
methicillin, the standard drug. Now it is developing resistance to
vancomycin, the main backup drug.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the new vaccine could be given to build up staph
resistance in surgery patients, who are prone to the infection. It
might also be used in nursing homes, among diabetes patients and in
people who are hospitalized for a variety of problems.
</P>
<P>
   He said researchers will also probably explore the possibility
of giving booster doses to people who must keep up resistance for a
long time, such as those on dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Black said that until researchers began analyzing their results
last week, there was no clear evidence that boosting staph
antibodies would have any effect on serious infections. Virtually
everybody has some staph antibodies, since the bacteria are so
common.

<HEADLINE> Fu Is China's Grand Dame of Diving  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The waif has become a woman who's
chasing a place in diving history.
</P>
<P>
   China's Fu Mingxia, who became a world champion at age 12, first
took Olympic gold at age 13, and then retired, burned out at age 19
after winning another two golds at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, is
back -- older, wiser and, her coaches say, a better diver than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Fu's chase for the record books will be a centerpiece of Olympic
diving that starts Friday (Thursday night EDT). At Sydney, Fu is
aiming to overtake U.S. diver Greg Louganis, who won four golds, as
the winningest Olympic diver in history.
</P>
<P>
   Fu insists, however, that history is not uppermost in her mind.
At her last two Olympic outings, she was straight out of the
Chinese sporting machine, doing what she had been trained since age
10 to do.
</P>
<P>
   But at Sydney, Fu's determined to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't though about it,'' she said of her prospective
fourth and fifth golds. ''The reason I'm diving here is not to
attain this or that, it's because I like diving. I haven't said I
must do this or that, or set myself very high demands.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl who captured hearts at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992
with her twisting dives from the perilous heights of the 10-meter
platform is now a woman with an easy laugh. At 23, she's also the
grand ol' dame of a team where the other three women are still in
their teens.
</P>
<P>
   After Atlanta, Fu became a student, studying economic management
at Beijing's prestigious Qinghua University, learning English, and
gaining so much weight ''I didn't want to put on a swimming
costume,'' she said in an interview last year.
</P>
<P>
   Years of training and competition had exhausted her. ''I didn't
really miss it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a couple of years, she had second thoughts. She tried
out for her college diving team, hooked back up with her longtime
coach, and began brushing off the rust.
</P>
<P>
   The time away and new experiences have seasoned Fu, helping her
rediscover her love of the sport and better equipping her for
Sydney, said the head of China's team, Zhou Jihong.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's practically unheard of, especially for a female athlete,
to stop for two years and get back to such a high level,'' Zhou
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mentally, and in other areas, she has improved, she's
even-keeled and mature,'' Zhou added. ''Overall, she's better than
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Fu says age in not necessarily an asset.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're small, you don't really have any opinions, it's
easy to get the gold,'' she said. ''As you get older you have to
control lots of different things -- the pressure that the media puts
on you, the demands you put on yourself, how to perform to your
ability in competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In training at Sydney, Fu looks anything but pressured. She
laughed when she fluffed dives and joked around with Xiong Ni,
another Chinese veteran who has come out of retirement to compete
at Sydney. It's 26-year-old Xiong's fourth Olympics: He won silver
in 1988, bronze in 1992 and gold in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Fu first etched her way into history in 1991, when she became
the youngest-ever diving world champion. At Barcelona, photos of Fu
seeming to fly over the Spanish city on her way to gold were among
the defining images of those games.
</P>
<P>
   At Atlanta, Fu became the first woman in 36 years to win the
springboard and platform at the same Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   At Sydney, Fu will compete only the 3-meter springboard, both in
individual competition and in the Olympic debut of synchronised
diving, where pairs do identical dives.
</P>
<P>
   Fu's partner in synchronized -- and among her greatest
challengers for the individual medal -- will be 18-year-old Guo
Jingjing. Guo placed fifth in platform at Atlanta, took springboard
silver at the 1998 World Championships, and won the springboard at
a World Cup meet at Sydney earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Diving as a pair, Fu and Guo looked like mirror images of each
other in training. They have similar builds -- Fu is 5-foot-3 and
weighs 108 pounds; Guo is 5-4 and 97 pounds. Both wore dark
swimsuits, with ''China'' emblazoned on the chest, had their hair
tied back in pony tails, and dived in almost perfect unison.
</P>
<P>
   Another star of China's team is 16-year-old platform diver Li
Na. One story going around is that Li dived before she could swim
and that her father used to have to fish her out of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou, the team leader, said that wasn't as outrageous as it
sounds.
</P>
<P>
   She said she too couldn't swim when she herself got picked as a
youngster to be a diver.
</P>
<P>
   The coach ''tied a rope around our waists,'' she recalled.
''Those who could swim up from their dives did so, those who had
trouble got pulled out.''

<HEADLINE> Looking Ahead at the Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- For grudge matches at the Olympics, it
would be hard to top the United States against Australia in
softball.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, Lisa Fernandez against Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The American women are the defending gold medalists, losers of
just one game in the 1996 Olympics. And it wasn't just any old
game, either.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez had a perfect game with two out in the 10th inning
when Joanne Brown, an ex-teammate at UCLA, converted the courtesy
runner softball teams are allowed in extra innings by hitting a
two-run homer to beat her in an early-round game at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the second defeat in 117 games for the U.S. team.
Then, some time later, someone sent Fernandez a picture postcard of
the Australians celebrating the victory, a little reminder of an
unpleasant moment that did not sit well with the American star.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was motivation to keep improving,'' she said, ''not
something to laugh about.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got worse before they got better.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez was burned again in 1998 when her throwing error
allowed the winning run to score in Australia's 2-1 victory over
the United States at the world championships, ending a 42-game U.S.
winning streak. In the finals, she exacted some revenge with a 1-0
win, hitting a home run and throwing a one-hitter that gave the
Americans their fourth world title in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, mate.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the teams have played often with the Americans
losing three games but winning the last five before the Olympics.
Fernandez was set to start against the Australians in the latest
rematch (Wednesday night EDT) after the Americans had a 112-game
winning streak ended by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The game between Australia and the United States will by shown
by MSNBC on Thursday along with rowing semifinals, cycling track
finals and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will show women's individual all-around finals in
gymnastics, swimming finals in the women's 200-meter breaststroke,
men's 200 backstroke, women's 100 freestyle and men's 200
individual medley relay, as well as swimming and a U.S. beach
volleyball match in the morning and late night coverage of the U.S.
men against Lithuania and volleyball between the U.S. men and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC has boxing and men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez geared up for the Olympics with five consecutive
perfect games, striking out 162 batters in 67 innings. She won 10
straight games and compiled an earned run average of 0.03. Not even
Nolan Ryan was ever that unhittable.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Sydney, Fernandez threw another perfect game
against the University of Hawaii, in which she struck out all 16
batters before the game was called by bad weather, probably saving
the hitters further embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   So how does Fernandez do it?
</P>
<P>
   Start with a herky-jerky windmill motion that leaves hitters
rubbery-legged wondering what's coming next. Riser? Sinker? Swerve?
Curve? She throws at about 68 mph but from the softball distance of
40 feet -- more like 37 when the ball is released -- hitting her can
be confounding.
</P>
<P>
   Even for major leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez has thrown in charity settings against two-time
National League MVP Dale Murphy, David Justice and Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Justice was not amused at some windmill pitcher, a woman wearing
shorts, trying to get him out. ''This isn't softball,'' he said.
''This is professional baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez struck him out.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Justice recalled the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's way too close, bro,'' he said. ''She throws gas. And
that changeup, that's tough. I don't care who you are, she'd be
tough to hit. You're not used to the ball coming from down there,
windmilling like that. You'd need time to get used to that and even
if you got time to prepare, it would be hard to hit.''

<HEADLINE> Australia Has Dangerous Habitat  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- If it were a scary movie, it would
stretch credibility: a land at the bottom of the Earth, brimming
with swimming, scuttling and slithering beasts that can dispatch
you more excruciatingly than a Bond villain's most diabolical
deathtrap.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the stuff of both reality and hearty legend in
Australia, where the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics
featured the planet's most lethal jellyfish -- and where the
national motto could well be, simply, ''Don't pet it.''
</P>
<P>
   Struan Sutherland, the nation's father of dangerous-creature
research, keeps it short in ''Venomous Creatures of Australia,'' a
book whose very existence is alarming. ''Australia,'' he writes,
''is inhabited by some of the most venomous land and sea creatures
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a reputation many here don't mind a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an aspect of pride to this. But there is also a lot of
tourist-baiting. We like to worry tourists,'' says Martyn Robinson,
a naturalist at the Australian Museum. ''People are very into
dangerous animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Western knowledge of this marsupial-rich nation's fauna often
begins with the kangaroo and ends with the koala. But look deeper;
therein danger lies.
</P>
<P>
   There's the land-sea one-two punch -- crocodiles and sharks.
There are spiders: The red-back, a streaked nub of nastiness
related to the black widow, pops up across the continent. There are
snakes: The death adder, a bush snake, has a name that says it all.
</P>
<P>
   There are aquatic perils: The terrifying box jellyfish can cause
unholy pain and even whole-body shock with just a touch; its sting
has killed 70 people since 1900. And there's a supporting cast of
hundreds: Even the platypus, an Olympic mascot, has venom-filled
stingers on its hind legs -- and that thing's a mammal, for goodness
sake.
</P>
<P>
   On some Queensland beaches, swimming is impossible for six
months each year because of box jellyfish. And in some portions of
the Northern Territory, crocs make sure you can't swim at all.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney has its own signature creepy-crawly -- the funnel-web
spider, whose lethal venom caused a wave of arachnophobia in the
1970s. Sutherland and his research team squelched the uneasiness
when, in 1981, they developed a successful antivenin for funnel-web
spider bites. (Sutherland's autobiography is notably entitled ''A
Venomous Life.'')
</P>
<P>
   The tradition isn't new. Epochs ago, the ''megafauna,'' an
8-foot high kangaroo, roamed Australia, as did a creature that
alliteration-giddy scientists dubbed the ''demon duck of doom'' -- a
500-pound, meat-eating bird.
</P>
<P>
   All this has provoked travel humorist Bill Bryson to dub
Australia a ''wondrously venomous and toothy country'' -- a land
''where even the fluffiest of caterpillars can lay you out with a
toxic nip, where seashells will not just sting you but actually
sometimes go for you.'' And this is a guy who loves the place.
</P>
<P>
   Such assessments don't come only from the outside. The
Australian Institute of Marine Science, for example, is hardly
circumspect about box jellyfish danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you are stung, your chance of survival or even getting
yourself to the shore is virtually zero,'' it says, calling the
pain ''so excruciating that you will probably go into shock and
drown.''
</P>
<P>
   The legend has become part of the culture. There's a TV series
called ''The Crocodile Hunter,'' where host Steve Irwin explores
unusual wildlife. In 1972, a musician named Slim Newton recorded a
popular song called ''The Redback on the Toilet Seat.'' A popular
1990s Australian band was called Venom P. Stinger.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly fair, though, to suggest that Aussies face a daily
gantlet of zoological apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1980 and 1990, 18 Australians died from snake bites, 11
from shark attacks, 12 from other marine animals, eight from
crocodile attacks -- and one from a spider bite.
</P>
<P>
   Yet creatures pop up in weird ways. In January, a teen-ager
barely recovered after accidentally drinking a box jellyfish
tentacle left in a jar of water in a surf club refrigerator. Just
last week, a kangaroo smashed through a family's front door in
northern Australia and terrorized it for three hours before being
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the discovery, years ago, that nylon protected
flesh from box jellyfish stingers. Legions of beach fishermen,
learning this, waded into the waters clad in pantyhose. Not pretty,
but effective.
</P>
<P>
   Aussies point out that America has vicious critters, too, like
bears and wolves and coyotes. But at least they'll growl or snarl
while they tear you apart. In Australia, most dangers are silent
and invisible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have big bears, so that's what you focus on,'' says
Katy Crass, who helps the museum answer the world's e-mail queries
about Australia's natural world. ''If we had bears, we wouldn't be
writing books about jellyfish. You can be sure of that.''

<HEADLINE> 'Fair' Shot for U.S. Women's Soccer  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- In the U.S. women's soccer lineup,
Michelle Akers' place in midfield has been taken by Lorrie Fair.
</P>
<P>
   That's about all those two players have in common.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not Michelle, and I never will be,'' said Fair, getting
her third Olympic start Wednesday when the United States played
Nigeria. The U.S. team needed a win or a tie to make sure of
advancing to the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like she left, and I'm expected to be her, because
it's not going to happen,'' said Fair, who then pointed at her
body. ''First of all, the dimensions are all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers, who retired from international play just before the
Olympics because of a shoulder injury, stood out with much more
than the mane of red curls atop her 5-foot-10 frame.
</P>
<P>
   She was a pioneer in her sport, perhaps the greatest all-around
women's soccer player of all time, a physically imposing force on
the field and a vocal leader.
</P>
<P>
   Fair is 5-foot-3 with long, dark hair. Just 22, she was 7 years
old when Akers scored her first international goal in 1985 and
rides the wave of success her predecessor helped pave. She is
energetic, personable and a pretty good player, but she's not one
to shout instructions during the heat of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not too good of a leader,'' Fair said with a confessional
laugh. ''I'd rather almost not be a leader. I guess I'd rather just
do it. Not so much lead by example, but just go out and do it. I
don't get people riled up. If a team's in the huddle, I'm not the
one to give the speeches and motivate the team, I'm kind of the one
that goes, 'OK, OK, OK. Let's go do it!' Then I run out on to the
field and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair was part of an excellent midfield performance in last
week's 2-0 victory over Norway, when the Americans were winning
most of the contested balls near the center circle. The run of play
was more even in Sunday's 1-1 tie with China, but Fair's touches
were confident.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lorrie brings this constant buzz,'' midfielder Julie Foudy
said. ''She's like the Energizer bunny.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the summer, Fair was a starter who expected to
return to the bench at any time. Akers valiantly tried to overcome
her injury and did return for a few games before the pain became
too much.
</P>
<P>
   Coach April Heinrichs wanted to make sure Fair's spirit didn't
waiver during that time, and met with the young midfielder to let
her know her important role.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never really know how someone is going to respond to
having started for a couple of games and then have a veteran
return,'' Heinrichs said. ''I wanted to make sure that Lorrie Fair
understood she made great progress this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Shorter by 7 inches, it would seem that Fair wouldn't be able to
win the headers at midfield as Akers did. Fair has shown otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Height alone will not get you one head ball,'' Heinrichs said.
''The single most important quality in heading for women is wanting
to head. We have some players that do, and some that don't.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Heinrichs said, come judgment and technique. Height
is fourth when it comes to heading.
</P>
<P>
   ''As little as she is, she's very good in the air,'' defender
Joy Fawcett said. ''She's got so much energy, and leaves it out
there on the field.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. Developer Gives $80 Million  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rags-to-riches California developer donated
$80 million to the Smithsonian Institution -- its largest individual
gift ever -- to present a new look at the nation's past at the
National Museum of American History.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian Secretary Lawrence Small said Tuesday that some of
the money will go to an exhibit on the American presidency. He also
spoke of new attention to military history.
</P>
<P>
   That was suggested by the donor, Ken Behring, a California
developer and former owner of the Seattle Seahawks of the National
Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Behring said he asked Small: ''Can we get through to people the
pride that we should have in what's made this great country?''
</P>
<P>
   He said Small replied: ''If you'll put up some money, we'll do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And Behring said he wants people to come out of the museum
saying:
</P>
<P>
   ''I know now what my forefathers went through so that I can be
free and so that I can have the opportunity to chase the American
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Small told a news conference Behring suggested establishment of
a commission to oversee the project.
</P>
<P>
   ''(It) will be made up of people from all sectors of American
life: scholars, historians, people who have involvement in all the
different thematic areas of our society -- known Americans,
well-respected Americans -- to help us guide that process,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, he said, the committee will ''pick the areas on
which we want to focus in the development of this society.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the presidency, Small said, the museum will
examine ''the price that people have paid to defend the society,
the whole military history of the United States, the cultural
history of the United States in the broadest terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Detailed plans for ''The American Presidency: A Glorious
Burden,'' due to open Nov. 15 with the help of $4 million from the
Behring gift, are to be announced next week.
</P>
<P>
   The American history museum will have the designation ''Behring
Center'' inscribed under its name.
</P>
<P>
   Behring earlier gave $20 million to the American Museum of
Natural History, the first of 16 museums, plus the National Zoo,
that are run by the Smithsonian. His latest gift brings
contributions to the Smithsonian to a record of almost $200 million
for the fiscal year ending this month, up from $147 million the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Behring, 72, told of his rise from
poverty in Wisconsin to becoming what he said was one of the
largest builders of homes in the United States. The Smithsonian
said in a statement that he is ''among America's wealthiest people
-- a personification of the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Behring said he felt the time had come to give back some of the
wealth America let him earn.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm an American, and I'm a very proud American,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Health Insurance Bill Passes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill passed in the House Tuesday forces
federal employees to comply with child support orders to provide
health insurance for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed by a voice vote, authorizes the federal
government to enroll a government employee and his or her family in
the government's health insurance plan when a court has ordered
coverage for the children.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, ''a federal agency is unable to insure that a child
is covered in accordance with a court order,'' said Rep. Elijah
Cummings, D-Md., the measure's sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1990 U.S. Census, 78 percent of noncustodial
parents had health coverage available through their employers, but
only 23 percent had their children covered voluntarily, Cummings
noted.
</P>
<P>
   ''All children need and deserve access to comprehensive health
and mental health services that provide preventive care when they
are well and treatment when they are ill,'' Cummings said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure is pending in the Senate.

<HEADLINE> ''High noon'' in Buffalo teachers dispute  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - ''High noon'' was set to arrive in the
contract showdown between Buffalo teachers and the 47,000-student
district with the delivery of a state mediator's make-or-break
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides expected to respond to the report within hours of
receiving it Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is sort of like high noon,'' Buffalo Teachers Federation
President Philip Rumore said while awaiting the report. ''This is
where we're going to have to start making our decisions. Rather
than having a shootout, hopefully we'll have a resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The district's 3,700 teachers have twice walked off the job
since the school year began while union and district negotiators
have clashed over salary and health benefits for retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Rumore, the union and its three other officers are charged with
contempt for the latest walkout in violation of a judge's order
last week. They face trial in state Supreme Court Thursday and
could be fined and jailed if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''That certainly can happen,'' Rumore acknowledged. ''But we
need to focus on today.''
</P>
<P>
   The contempt trial will be sooner than either district or union
leaders would like, but Justice Kevin Dillon said he would only
postpone it if the union promised to refrain from more walkouts in
the meantime. The union refused.
</P>
<P>
   The highly anticipated proposal from the Public Employment
Relations Board mediator ''is not just another piece of paper,''
said Richard Curreri, director of PERB's office of conciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is supposed to be an entire package proposal, which will be
treated as an entire package. Which means, the BTF will say yes or
no and the district will say yes or no,'' Curreri said.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education scheduled a 7:30 p.m. meeting to discuss
the report. The union's executive committee planned to meet at 9
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always hopeful,'' Rumore said. ''As far as the BTF is
concerned, we're going to do our darndest to work towards a
settlement tonight that both sides think is fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, meanwhile, were hoping they'd seen the last of the
last-minute walkouts that have canceled classes and forced them to
find last-minute child care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a snow day. You have to have a backup plan,'' said
Sonya Johnson, the mother of a Buffalo fourth-grader who complained
parents don't know from one day to the next whether there will be
school.
</P>
<P>
   ''This should have been handled five months ago, settled,'' she
said. ''Let the teachers get back in the classrooms and it won't be
so much chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   While a Supreme Court judge has issued an order forbidding union
officials from engaging in job actions, no one has legal authority
to force a contract resolution on the union and district. PERB
mediators cannot compel the sides to negotiate and state law does
not grant binding arbitration to school district disputes. The
dispute could go to a fact-finding hearing if the PERB proposal is
rejected.

<HEADLINE> Venus Can't Understand Mac's Darts  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Venus Williams didn't toss her racket,
hurl profanities or throw a tantrum. She didn't berate officials or
insult fans.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she didn't act like John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' good behavior earned her no points, but it was a topic
of conversation after her Olympic debut Tuesday, a 6-2, 6-2 victory
over Henrieta Nagyova of Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the 27th in a row for Williams. But when it
comes to McEnroe, she can't seem to win.
</P>
<P>
   The latest salvo from her most vocal critic came in a column in
a London newspaper. McEnroe, an expert on lousy tennis etiquette,
said Williams and her sister Serena ''have no respect for anyone in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus' reaction: You cannot be serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know John McEnroe,'' she said. ''I've never had a
conversation with him. He doesn't know me. So I find it difficult
to form an opinion on someone I don't know, and I find it difficult
that he has formed an opinion on myself and my sister, seeing he
doesn't know us. I don't know why he's saying these things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the column, McEnroe repeated his earlier assertion that males
on the junior and senior circuits could beat the sisters. He also
complained that Venus lacks humility.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm always honest,'' she said, ''and the fact is I'm a good
player and I have a lot of abilities. I think I've always been a
nice person, basically, and pretty positive on everything and
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' latest victory was her first since winning the U.S.
Open earlier this month. Coming off that emotional triumph and the
long trip to Sydney, she showed no signs of a letdown against
Nagyova.
</P>
<P>
   From the first game, when she belted two aces, Williams was
overpowering. Whether rushing the net, leaping for an overhead or
on her heels at the baseline, she came up with one putaway after
another.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps her best effort was a lunging forehand winner down the
line that gave her a 4-1 lead in the first set. She then walked
casually to her chair, as if she hits such shots every day.
</P>
<P>
   Which she does.
</P>
<P>
   Her sister watched from the stands. They'll play doubles
together, giving Venus a shot at two gold medals to go with her two
Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet against her. The only player seeded ahead of her in
singles is American teammate Lindsay Davenport, who lost to
Williams in the finals at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hasn't been beaten since Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario upset
her at the French Open. They could meet in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just seems like every tournament, at the end I've come out
the winner,'' Williams said. ''I just take every match one at a
time, and then at the end I'm standing with the trophy. It's been
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Williams is giving her opponents much
respect, she's not giving them much of a chance.

<HEADLINE> Pataki extends Thruway fuel price reduction program  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A nickel-per-gallon reduction in this
summer's gasoline prices at New York state Thruway rest stops has
been extended to New Year's Day, the Pataki administration
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, the Thruway Authority eliminated lease fees
charged to private gas stations at the 27 travel centers along the
superhighway, enabling station operators to reduce fuel prices. The
authority normally leases the Mobil and Sunoco stations to
operators in exchange for a lease fee based upon the number of
gallons of fuel sold.
</P>
<P>
   The move is aimed at encouraging more motorists to use the
Thruway and once they're on, keeping them from going off for
cheaper fuel. More motorists staying on the Thruway should mean
increased earnings from concession booths at the stops and reduced
processing costs at toll plazas, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot price reduction program that went into effect in May and
expired Tuesday saved motorists about $1.35 million in fuel costs,
officials estimated. Consumers would save another $900,000 at the
pump under the extension, Gov. George Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   ''By extending this successful program, we'll ensure travelers
continue to save, while boosting New York's year-round tourism
industry during the busy autumn travel season,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that about 18.8 million gallons of fuel are sold
at Thruway rest stops from September through December.
</P>
<P>
   The 641-mile long Thruway is the nation's longest toll road.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women's Polo in Medal Round  </HEADLINE>
By PETE IACOBELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. women's water polo team
probably didn't need another tuneup at the Sydney Games, but it
will get one anyway.
</P>
<P>
   With Canada's 7-4 loss to Netherlands on Tuesday, the Americans
advanced to the medal round along with the Australians and the
Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why U.S. coach Guy Baker came back for the
Canada-Netherlands game five hours after his team's first loss of
the Olympics, 7-6, to Australia. And maybe that's why he left the
Ryde Aquatic Leisure Center smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what's ahead,'' Baker said. ''We know what we came to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, it will be to pound Kazakstan and perhaps work out
some power-play problems like just about everyone else here has
done.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakstan, a former Soviet Republic, hasn't been so powerful at
the first-ever women's Olympic tournament. It snuck into the draw
by defeating Japan in April for the Asian qualifying spot.
</P>
<P>
   Australian coach Istvan Gorgenyi makes clear his views of
Kazakstan: He sums up the tournament as ''five evenly matched
teams'' -- not even counting Kazakstan, which his club defeated 9-2
in its opener. Kazakstan also suffered a 10-3 loss to Canada and
15-6 defeat by Russia, though it fell only 8-6 to Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Russia called time-out just before halftime ahead 9-2 on
Kazakstan and scored on an extra-swimmer goal. U.S. attacker Brenda
Villa says that attitude can cost you.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to look past anyone,'' Villa said. ''That's
what we're taught, one period at a time, one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans might like what they see when they get a good
look.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one seemed that down about the Australian loss, the
United States was only 4-of-13 on power play possessions. The
Americans also gave up three goals on extra-player opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We keep hurting ourselves,'' U.S. star Maureen O'Toole said.
''Our six-on-five defense was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Who better to work things out against than undersized,
not-as-talented Kazakstan?
</P>
<P>
   Baker says the power-play is everything at the Olympics, the
difference between winning and losing. ''The team in this
tournament that does it best will take home the gold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States had plenty of chances to tie the Aussies on
the power play, but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can fix that,'' driver Courtney Johnson said. ''And we
will.''
</P>
<P>
   The team the Americans will face in the medal round is anyone's
guess. Australia and Netherlands can each win their fourth game of
the round robin and clinch the first two spots.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. victory in that situation would leave it third.
</P>
<P>
   But if Australia falters against Canada and Russia conquers the
Dutch, an American win would make them the top seed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter who it is at this point,'' Baker said.
''It's going to be a tough opponent who knows you well.''
</P>
<P>
   The teams will take Thursday off before starting the medal round
Friday (Thursday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans can keep up their solid play a nice medal could
await.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has shown fierceness in defense, the ability
to strike from outside with Villa and 19-year-old Ericka Lorenz,
and the ability to dominate low with Kathy Sheehy.
</P>
<P>
   But the team seems to feed off O'Toole, their 39-year-old
playmaker who's been in the middle of every big U.S. moment in her
first and only Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time you look at her, it's like, 'Wow, she's made a
great play' or she's doing something we can't believe,'' said
Villa, 19 years younger than O'Toole.
</P>
<P>
   Baker sat out defender Robin Beauregard, who scored twice in the
United States' two-minute miracle comeback tie with Canada, for the
Australia game because of some soreness in her knee from an old
injury.
</P>
<P>
   He expects her to be ready for the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing better he would like than see all his
starters on the bench right next to her for most of this one.
</P>
<P>
   Against Kazakstan, that could happen.

<HEADLINE> Men's Volleyball Pushed to Limit  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- One more defeat, and the U.S. men's
volleyball team might as well start packing for the flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Two teams in our pool aren't going to make it to the next
round,'' said outside hitter Mike Lambert, explaining both the
tournament setup and the American predicament. ''We've got three
matches left, and the way I look at it, we've got to at least win
two of those.''
</P>
<P>
   After two rounds of preliminaries at the Sydney Olympics, the
United States is 0-2 and struggling to keep up morale.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're either good enough to win, or we're not good enough to
win,'' a weary coach Doug Beal said after the Americans were
soundly beaten by a better Russian team Tuesday, 25-18, 25-23,
21-25, 25-17.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome was more or less expected, but it's the loss to
Argentina on Sunday that hurts more.
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.S. team must beat Yugoslavia on Thursday (Wednesday
night EDT) and South Korea two days after that. A victory over
Italy in the final Group B match probably is asking too much.
</P>
<P>
   While they know there isn't much room for error, the Americans
were quietly confident of advancing to next week's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is time left in this tournament, so it's important that
we turn things around quickly. I think this team can do that,''
said setter Lloy Ball. ''We'll see what we're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight match, a strong blocking scheme slowed
down the most dangerous U.S. scorer, 6-foot-7 George Roumain. He
finished with 18 kills, but many more shots were slapped down by
lanky 7-1 Russian Alexei Kazakov.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Americans held their own for a while, playing with
more intensity and fewer mistakes than in the loss to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Russia led only 18-17 in the first game as the proud former
superpowers, who have five gold medals between them, went at each
other furiously, taking turns pounding uncontested balls into the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought our emotion was better. I tried to spark some of
that throughout the match, but it's discouraging when things don't
go your way,'' Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans quickly faded, and even though they rallied from
two games down to win the third, they gave the momentum back with
some sloppy play in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes it's the passing, sometimes it's the serving,
sometimes it's the hitting,'' Lambert said. ''It's like, 'Here's a
bag full of errors, distribute it any way you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   The team got more bad news Tuesday: Backup middle blocker Jeff
Nygaard, who has been sick almost since arriving here, might have
mononucleosis. He played just one point in the opener and didn't
even leave the hotel for Tuesday's match.

<HEADLINE> Cyclist Nothstein Must Beat Nemesis  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The four-year plan has developed
perfectly for Marty Nothstein. He's in the match sprint semifinals
and within sight of the gold medal that eluded him in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein, of Trexlertown, Pa., will ride Wednesday against Jens
Fiedler, the two-time Olympic gold medalist from Germany who beat
him by a tire width at the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big day. I've been waiting for it four years,''
Nothstein said Tuesday. ''I've been training extremely hard. Every
training session has been geared for these next couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   If he beats Fiedler, Nothstein will advance to the gold medal
race. He's trying to become the first American cyclist to win gold
since Steve Hegg won the individual pursuit at the 1984 Los Angeles
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited and I know I'll be waking up bright and early,
thinking about the race,'' Nothstein said. ''It's going to be a
restless night of sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothstein beat Craig MacLean of Britain in two matches, sweeping
the best-of-3 pairing. Fiedler beat countryman Jan van Eijden,
setting up another showdown with his old rival.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marty Nothstein knows how I think,'' Fiedler said. ''He knows
about me and I know about him.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sprint riders competed, the Olympic velodrome was buzzing
with excitement after the Germans and Urkrainians broke the world
record in team pursuit twice within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans also became the first to go under the four-minute
mark, winning the 4,000-meter race in 3 minutes, 59.710 seconds.
They took more than a second off the world record that Ukraine had
set in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''To describe in any words is impossible on how we felt to ride
a world record, but we knew we were going to win,'' said Daniel
Becke.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic duel that drove fans into a frenzy. In the
semifinals, the Ukrainians were timed in 4:00.830, breaking the
Olympic record the Germans had set in Monday's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Dunc Gray Velodrome is proving during the Olympics to be one
of the world's fastest tracks. Seven Olympic and three world
records have been posted through the first four days.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Nothstein, two other Americans competed.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Arrue of Woodland Hills, Calif., was 11th overall after
finishing third in a race to determine final placing in the
tournament-style match sprint. He was eliminated from medal
contention Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tanya Lindenmuth of Trexlertown, Pa., lost both of her
quarterfinal races to five-time world champion Felicia Ballanger of
France. It was a tough lesson from the world's best rider, but
Lindenmuth savored the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rode great,'' she said with a broad smile. ''It's nice to
put some fear into Ballanger. She kept her eye on me the whole
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindenmuth, 21, led on the backstretch of both rides but
Ballanger pumped her massive legs and blew past the young American
each time. There wasn't much Lindenmuth, riding at her first
Olympics, could do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to keep my head above water,'' she said. ''I'm
still learning.''

<HEADLINE> Coroner: Driver of NJ Transit bus died of heart ailment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENNIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - The driver of an NJ Transit bus
that plowed into a house died of a heart ailment, according to an
autopsy performed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia-to-Cape May bus veered off Route 47 and crossed
over two medians before jumping an embankment and ripping into an
unoccupied frame home about 9 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police driver James R. Rapp slumped over in his
seat just prior to the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy, performed by Dr. Elliot Gross, showed that Rapp,
49, of Blackwood, died of caridac arrhythmia due to coronary
atherosclerosis. Gross, who is medical examiner for Cape May and
Cumberland counties, would not say whether Rapp died before or
after the bus hit the house, however.
</P>
<P>
   Toxicology tests also will be performed on the body, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven passengers were aboard the bus, but only three were
injured. All but one have been released from Burdette Tomlin
Memorial Hospital. Beatrice Smith, 73, of Millville, remains in the
intensive care unit there.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which was knocked off its foundation by the impact of
the 15-ton bus, is being evaluated by the owner's insurance company
and an engineer to see if it can be repaired, township building
inspector Mike Koochambere said.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made about whether to condemn it, he said.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Sailors Could Use More Wind  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Where's the wind?
</P>
<P>
   That shifty, patchy stuff that's puffed across Sydney Harbor and
out on the Pacific Ocean for three straight days isn't cutting it
for the Olympic regatta.
</P>
<P>
   The sight of catamarans flying across the water and sailors
struggling to keep them level has been replaced by the sight of
catamarans bobbing along and crewmen stretched out catching rays.
</P>
<P>
   The big Soling boats managed to get in two races on Tuesday, if
you could call them races.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very marginal sailing, really,'' said U.S. Soling
skipper Jeff Madrigali, who had a yo-yo day by finishing second and
15th to drop to ninth overall in the 16-boat fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last race finished in a dying breeze, in a lump,'' said
Madrigali, the 1996 bronze medalist. ''We basically drifted along
on the runs. There's just not a lot of lanes out there when you get
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   The breeze never got above 8 knots on the ocean. In the harbor,
it was even more placid.
</P>
<P>
   The Tornado catamarans didn't race at all, which didn't give the
spectators up on a bluff -- one waving a German flag -- anything to
cheer about.
</P>
<P>
   The windsurfers got in one race before the wind flaked away,
forcing the second women's race to be abandoned before they reached
the top mark, and the men's race to be abandoned before it started.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali, the reigning world champion, shouldn't have any
trouble making the cut when the fleet is pared to 12 for match
racing. But he, like everyone else, wishes it was a little more
exciting.
</P>
<P>
   So far in the Olympics, Madrigali recalls he and his two-man
crew hiking out just once to try to keep the 26-foot boat level.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tough out there,'' he said. ''Nobody's done very well,
with the exception of Norway. Everyone else is pretty much up and
down. It's not easy for anybody out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's Herman Horn Johannessen won Tuesday's first race and is
the overall leader.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of strong wind is due to a battle of the breezes, with
the westerlies keeping the sea breeze from building.
</P>
<P>
   Forecaster Andrew Tupper said he wasn't expecting strong wind in
the near future, but he did expect steadier winds on Wednesday than
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The final two Soling fleet races were scheduled for Wednesday
(Tuesday night EDT), and each crew gets to drop its worst race. The
16-boat fleet will be pared to 12 for a series of match races, with
the medals to be decided in the harbor off the Sydney Opera House
on Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali has had wildly inconsistent finishes of fourth, 14th,
second and 15th. He figures that after dropping his worst race,
he'll probably finish sixth or seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to get too down on ourselves,'' Madrigdali
said. ''We had two good races, we're in the middle of the pack and
it looks like we're going to get through to the match racing and I
think that's where we can do our damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrigali has a new crew in these games: Craig Healy of Tiburon,
Calif., and Hartwell Jordan of Discovery Bay, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If the wind cooperated, Wednesday shaped up to be the busiest
sailing day yet, with eight of the 11 classes racing. The Europe,
Laser and men's and women's 470 classes were to have their first
races, weather permitting.
</P>
<P>
   On the windsurfing course, Lanee Butler of Aliso Viejo, Calif.,
jumped up two spots to 13th overall after finishing sixth. Mike
Gebhardt of Fort Pierce, Fla., remained in eighth place after
finishing 17th. Gebhardt is a former silver and bronze medalist.

<HEADLINE> Pitching Keeps U.S. Unbeaten  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Three games played, three earned runs
allowed, three wins and counting. The U.S. baseball team is onto
something.
</P>
<P>
   A team that wondered about its inexperienced starters has moved
to the front of the Olympic baseball field because those young
pitchers are doing much better than anyone imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers say it all: only three earned runs allowed in three
games, all victories. Kurt Ainsworth got the latest, pitching 6 2-3
innings of a 6-2 win Tuesday over the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Ainsworth followed the lead of Ben Sheets and Jon Rauch, two
other high draft picks who made impressive starts in the first two
games and got things rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talk to each other every day and pump each other up,
saying, 'You've got to have a good performance today to give the
team a chance to win,''' Ainsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands (1-2) scored a run in the first inning, then got
shut down as Ainsworth threw his 93 mph fastball pretty much where
he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   That made it three impressive starts by the class of '99 --
Sheets was picked in the first round by Milwaukee, Rauch in the
third by the White Sox, Ainsworth in the first round by San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a staff you could throw on a big league team and not
be embarrassed,'' said catcher Pat Borders, the MVP of Toronto's
1992 World Series championship. ''They could be all right.
</P>
<P>
   ''They all throw real hard. They've all got a ways to go in
terms of experience and honing their skills, but they're all real
good. Their composure's been great. They're very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Their confidence is starting to rub off on an offense that's
doing just enough to win.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have been lightweights at the plate so far,
batting .267 as a team -- weak by Olympic standards. They haven't
needed a lot of runs because their pitching has been so good.
</P>
<P>
   ''God bless 'em if they keep doing it,'' outfielder Mike Neill
said. ''I'm sure we'll ride their backs all the way to a medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from 31-year-old outfielder Ernie Young, the Americans
didn't do much offensively Tuesday against a junkball pitcher. Rob
Cordemans mixed his 88 mph fastball with a change-up that dipped to
66 mph and left the Americans spinning in circles and losing their
bats after awkward swings.
</P>
<P>
   ''That guy threw slow and slower,'' said Young, who doubled home
a pair of runs and had a solo homer. ''He kept it a close game.
You've got to give him credit somewhat.''
</P>
<P>
   Young's two-run double put the United States ahead in the first
and his solo homer to right made it 3-1 in the third. Doug
Mientkiewicz doubled off the warning track in center to drive in
another run in the sixth and later added a sacrifice fly. Brad
Wilkerson also hit a solo homer.
</P>
<P>
   The victory left the United States and Cuba as the only unbeaten
teams in the eight-team tournament. Cuba rallied from a four-run
deficit to beat South Korea 6-5 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States plays South Korea on Wednesday in Game 4. It
won't face Cuba until the second-last game of the round-robin,
which determines the four teams for medal play.
</P>
<P>
   That young rotation is in for a tougher test in the next few
days, with games against South Korea, Cuba and Australia ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Personal things don't mean anything to me right now,''
Ainsworth said. ''You don't get anything extra for something
special, like a no-hitter. It's all about winning.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find New Obesity Gene  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Australian scientists have identified a new
gene responsible for controlling appetite in humans -- a discovery
experts said could lead to the first gene-based drug to treat
obesity and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Collins, a professor of microbiology at Deakin University
in Melbourne, discovered the gene while researching diabetes in
Israeli desert rats. The gene, which he called Beacon, cranks up
the appetite and the rat version is identical to the human one.
</P>
<P>
   The find, presented Tuesday at a conference of the European
Society for the Study of Diabetes, is the third gene linked to
obesity, after leptin and NPy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sir George Alberti, president-elect of the
International Diabetes Federation, said a drug based on Beacon
could be available sooner than one targeting the other two genes
because the rat and human genes are a 100 percent match. This means
drug research could proceed more quickly than normal because the
results in rats would be more relevant to humans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a very exciting development. It could be a very
important step in the whole obesity, diabetes pathway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins and his team took sand rats from the Negev desert in
Israel to a laboratory in Melbourne for diabetes research. On their
cactus diet in the desert, the rats were lean and healthy. But
placed in a Western environment, where rat chow was abundant, some
ate a lot, got fat and developed diabetes; others ate reasonable
amounts and remained lean.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted the researchers to look for genetic differences.
They removed the rats' brains, examined every gene to find whether
any were more active in the fat rats and came up with the Beacon
gene.
</P>
<P>
   Genes direct the formation, or expression, of proteins that a
cell uses to function, repair or defend itself, and to divide. In
the obese rats, the Beacon gene was working in overdrive, forming
too much appetite-stimulating protein.
</P>
<P>
   Once they had deciphered the sequence, or unique code, of the
rat gene, the scientists searched for a match on an Internet gene
databank.
</P>
<P>
   They found an 81 percent match with the earthworm, said Dr. Paul
Zimmet, professor of diabetes at Monash University in Caulfield,
Australia, who participated in the research.
</P>
<P>
   About 800 million years of evolution separate the earth worm
from the Israeli sand rat, said Zimmet, adding that a gene which is
preserved 81 percent over 800 million years of evolution must play
an important role.
</P>
<P>
   Collins then searched the libraries of human genetic information
for anything that matched the rat gene sequence. He found the
identical gene sequence in human DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon gene produces a protein that stimulates the appetite.
NPy does the same thing, whereas leptin switches off the appetite.
In some obese people, the body does not respond to leptin.
</P>
<P>
   Collins then produced the protein from the human Beacon gene and
injected it into the brains of lean rats with normal behavior of
the gene. They gained about 5 percent of their own body weight in 7
days.
</P>
<P>
   When he injected protein from both the Beacon and NPy human
genes, the rats ate even more and ballooned by 10 percent in a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary studies show the human gene is the same across
various regions and ethnicities, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, Collins said, is to subject the protein to
hundreds of chemicals to see if any can block its action.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that a drug could fix the problem if the gene is
pumping out too much of the protein. The proposed drugs would then
be tested on rats before being given to humans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might for all we know be a bubble, but it looks really good
next to Leptin and NPy because the animal is an exact model of
human obesity and diabetes,'' Zimmet said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the gene, located on chromosome 19, is
scheduled to be published in the journal Diabetes next month.

<HEADLINE> UN Tribunal: No Deal for Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- The U.N. war crimes tribunal will
''never, never, never'' accept an immunity deal for Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, the chief prosecutor told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte said investigators were in fact
preparing to expand Milosevic's indictment for war crimes in Kosovo
to include atrocities during the 1992-95 Bosnian War and genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reports earlier this year that the U.S. government
might offer Milosevic an immunity deal if he steps down from
politics, Del Ponte said she would never allow such an outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's impossible,'' she said in an interview with The
Associated Press. ''It's impossible because the indictment against
Milosevic can be withdrawn only after a request from the prosecutor
to the judges. And I'm now the prosecutor and I will never, never,
never request a withdrawal of the indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who is seeking re-election as Yugoslav president on
Sunday, was indicted last year for ordering war crimes against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo before NATO's 78-day air campaign drove
Yugoslav troops out of the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte also expressed concern at the decline in the number of
indicted suspects apprehended by NATO peacekeepers in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's about two or three months that we have had no arrests of
fugitives, so I'm a little bit disappointed about that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she added she was ''still confident'' that all the suspects
would be arrested ''sooner or later,'' and called on NATO to ''play
a proactive role to arrest these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 70 Serbs, Croats and Muslims indicted by the
International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, fewer
than 40 are in custody. Besides Milosevic, prominent fugitives
include former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and military
chief Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
   The last arrest on behalf of the tribunal took place June 24,
when British troops detained Bosnian Serb Dusko Sikirica in
Prijedor, Bosnia. Prosecutors say he was in charge of one of the
most notorious internment camps of the Bosnian war. He has pleaded
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said she will push for more arrests when she travels
to the United States next week and meets with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and other top
officials. It will be her first visit to Washington as prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte, a former federal prosecutor of Switzerland, made a
name for herself targeting money-laundering in Swiss banks by
international organized crime syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has set up a task force to track down the financial
assets of fugitives and is trying to expand the two-person team
investigating ways to seize the assets of indicted suspects so they
can be used to compensate victims of atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my experience, it's always very important if you can cut
the financial possibilities of an accused, especially of the
fugitives,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, at Del Ponte's urging, the tribunal's 14 judges
recognized victims' rights to financial reparations. However they
stopped short of agreeing to consider monetary claims at the
tribunal and instead asked the U.N. Security Council to look at
means for redress.

<HEADLINE> House names post office for retiring senator  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal building in Newark will get a new
name - the Frank R. Lautenberg Post Office and Courthouse - under a
measure passed by the House Tuesday to honor the retiring New
Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
   The building at 2 Federal Square would be a second tribute to
Lautenberg. In June, the Senate passed a measure attaching
Lautenberg's name to the Secaucus Transfer Station, a transit hub
under construction in Hudson County.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief discussion on the House floor, Rep. Donald Payne,
D-Newark, called Lautenberg ''one of our state's most accomplished
and dedicated public servants.''
</P>
<P>
   The House approved naming the post office for Lautenberg by
voice vote. The Senate will likely concur, as will President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, who is leaving the Senate after 18 years, said he
was ''honored and humbled by this kind gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Naming post offices after people has become a popular pursuit in
Congress, although for many years it was done only for the
deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the practice is commonly bestowed posthumously. The
House named post offices for three other people on Tuesday -
Maryland's first black Supreme Court justice, who died last year; a
Pennsylvania advocate for the disabled, who died in May; and a
former member of the Georgia state Assembly who died in January.
</P>
<P>
   The House changed its rules in 1995 to allow post offices to be
named for the living. But to cut down on requests, House rules
require that an entire state delegation be united behind a proposal
in order for it to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The six Republicans and seven Democrats who represent New Jersey
in the House all signed onto legislation introduced July 26 by
Payne and Rep. Frank LoBiondo, R-Vineland.
</P>
<P>
   LoBiondo called Lautenberg ''a great ally and friend to the
citizens of New Jersey.'' Rep. Frank Pallone, D-Long Branch, said
Lautenberg earned a reputation as ''the senator who gets things
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Pallone added, ''I only hope that this naming of the post office
is just the first of many opportunities that we will have after he
retires this year to name things after him.''
</P>
<P>
   One idea that did not fly was renaming Newark International
Airport after Lautenberg. The idea, floated in June by Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., was quickly shot down by officials in New York and
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark building that will bear Lautenberg's name is commonly
referred to as the ''old'' courthouse and post office. Typical of a
Depression-era federal building, it has a post office on the ground
floor and courtrooms and judges' chambers on upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a federal building named for former New Jersey Rep.
Peter Rodino, who presided over the impeachment hearings of
President Nixon, and the ''new'' courthouse, which opened in 1992
and is named for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of a post office does not normally entail noticeable
changes to a building's appearance or how people refer to it. The
Postal Service merely buys and installs a $200 plaque noting the
honoree's name and the date the law passed Congress.

<HEADLINE> Movie Star Wanted for Polanski Film  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Wanted: movie star -- no experience required.
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker Roman Polanski has placed a classified ad to find a
leading man for his upcoming film ''The Pianist.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which appeared in Monday's edition of Britain's Guardian
newspaper, seeks a man aged 25 to 35 for the role. ''Acting
experience not essential but he needs to be sensitive, vulnerable
and charismatic,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The film, scheduled to begin filming in Warsaw in January, is
based on the autobiography of Polish composer Wladyslaw Szpilman,
who escaped death in a Nazi concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Polanski, the director of ''Rosemary's Baby'' and ''Chinatown,''
also escaped the Nazis as a child in Poland. His mother died in
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels there is someone out there, not necessarily an actor,
who embodies what he feels about Szpilman,'' casting agent Alex
Johnson told The Guardian. ''Obviously the ability to play the
piano would help, but he is looking at this in a very broad way.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' QB Griese Questionable  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Denver Broncos were still unsure on Tuesday
about the seriousness of the injury to quarterback Brian Griese's
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Griese partially tore cartilage in his throwing shoulder on
Sunday against Oakland, and the Broncos didn't know if he will
return to practice Wednesday or play on Sunday against Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no exact timetable of when (team trainer Steve
Antonopulos) will make a decision,'' team spokesman Paul Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   Griese was driven to the ground by an Oakland defender early in
the second quarter of the Broncos' 33-24 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The shoulder injury was similar to a more severe injury to his
throwing shoulder last season. He was sidelined for two games in
November and underwent successful surgery at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Antonopulos said Monday the latest injury is unrelated to last
season's injury and the surgery to repair it.
</P>
<P>
   He said there is a 50 percent chance Griese, the NFL's top-rated
passer, will play Sunday.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Hollis
Thomas signed a five-year contract extension Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal, which extends throught the 2005 season, were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Thomas, a key part of the defensive line, is
another move to ensure long-term stability on the Eagles roster.
Thomas was due to become an unrestricted free agent after the 2000
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles now have 14 key players signed through 2002: Brian
Dawkins, Bobby Taylor, Troy Vincent, Al Harris, Carlos Emmons, Hugh
Douglas, Corey Simon, Mike Mamula and Hollis Thomas from the
defense, as well as Duce Staley, Donovan McNabb, Jon Runyan, Tra
Thomas and Koy Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   Detmer, Tra Thomas and Mamula are signed through 2002. The rest
in that group are signed through at least 2003.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Hollis has 15 tackles, one for a loss, and one sack.

<HEADLINE> Poverty 10X Higher World Bank Says  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Poverty in countries of the former
Soviet Union has increased tenfold since the collapse of communism,
the World Bank reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In its first study of poverty and inequality in Eastern Europe
and Central Asia, the international lending institution said it was
disappointed its $35 billion in loans to the region have not paved
a smoother transition to a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clear that in a system where the government is weak, the
overall effectiveness of our loans is not, and can't be, as
effective as in areas with stronger, efficient governments,'' World
Bank Vice President Johannes Linn said in releasing the 500-page
study at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's disappointing, and with the benefit of hindsight, we
would have done some things differently,'' Linn added.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting for the first time in the capital of a former communist
country, the World Bank, along with its sister lending organization
the International Monetary Fund, hope to showcase the Czech
Republic as a former Iron Curtain success story.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Czech Republic is a front runner to join its rich
Western neighbors in the European Union, its eastern neighbors are
still reeling from the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Soviet states alone, cumulative economic output
plunged nearly 50 percent over the last 10 years, while output in
other Eastern Europe countries shriveled by 15 percent, according
to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   All that contributes to a population stuck in unprecedented
poverty, with roughly 21 percent living on less than $2 a day level
in 1998, compared to only 2 percent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Tajikistan topped the list, with just under 70 percent of its
people living in poverty. At the other end were the Czech Republic
and Slovenia, where less than 5 percent of the populations are
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was in the middle of the pack, with roughly 20 percent
living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many in the region weren't poor 10 years ago,'' said World
Bank economist Ana Revenga, who co-authored the report. ''They had
jobs, livelihoods, expectations for pensions, and then had the rug
literally pulled out from under them overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   While maintaining the World Bank's loans to the region were
still worthwhile, Linn said they would have been more effective had
the Bank required more local political participation in the reform
efforts and focused more on fostering social safety nets for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   That would have entailed closer work with other non-governmental
organizations, Linn added.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the World Bank has fine tuned its lending
criteria to refuse loans to countries with high levels of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the end, the government needs to want to make changes, and
when that is not the case, then we stop lending,'' Linn said.
''It's a learning process.''

<HEADLINE> MLS Playoff Has Unusual Format  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   After going back to the traditional for the regular season,
Major League Soccer is employing perhaps the most unusual playoff
format in U.S. sports.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two rounds of the playoffs, up to three games are
played in each series, with the first team to five points advancing
(teams get three points for a victory, one for a tie).
</P>
<P>
   That means a team that gets a win and a tie in its first two
games must still play a third game. If a series is tied 1-1-1 after
three games, it would be decided by penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes it a little bit difficult for the fans to
understand,'' Colorado Rapids coach Glenn Myernick said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The system is a hybrid of soccer's traditional system --
home-and-home, total goals -- and the U.S. major sports' system --
best-of-three games, best-of-five, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have preferred an aggregate, two-game series,'' Dallas
Burn coach Dave Dir said.
</P>
<P>
   In openers played Friday, Saturday or Sunday, Kansas City beat
visiting Colorado 1-0, Los Angeles won 1-0 at Tampa Bay, Chicago
beat visiting New England 2-1 and New York/New Jersey beat visiting
Dallas 2-1 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago played at New England on Tuesday night, while
Wednesday's schedule has Kansas City at Colorado, Tampa Bay at Los
Angeles and New York/New Jersey at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City, the No. 1 seed in the playoffs, beat the Rapids as
Miklos Molnar scored in the 18th minute -- his fourth goal in four
games since returning from an injury. Tony Meola, who led MLS with
a record 16 shutouts during the regular season, blanked Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played maybe our best 90-minute game in Kansas City and
still came up short,'' Myernick said. ''We feel very confident we
can take the series back to Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars, in the playoffs after finishing with the
league's worst record in 1999, beat Dallas on Adolfo Valencia's
goal with 10 seconds left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had felt they were out of form and they came in much
stronger than I had anticipated,'' Dir said. ''They were able to
disrupt our rhythm defensively.''

<HEADLINE> Sutton Relishes Beating Tiger Woods  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Despite failing to win a major
championship this year, Hal Sutton still achieved the greatest
personal victory of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He beat Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton won the 1983 PGA Championship -- going toe-to-toe with
Jack Nicklaus at Riviera -- but says nothing can top his one-stroke
victory over Woods in The Players Championship in March.
</P>
<P>
   ''It ranks at the top of my list in personal achievements,
especially in wake of what Tiger is doing,'' Sutton said Monday at
a luncheon where The Players Championship announced $1.3 million
for charity. ''He started playing a year and a half ago at a level
most people don't know anything about. And he's kept it going, as
we all know.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, fed up with white flags of surrender seemingly waved at
Woods, said he would not be intimidated and then proved it with a
near flawless final round for a one-stroke victory on the TPC at
Sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Woods made it interesting with an eagle on the par-5 16th, but
he couldn't muster a birdie on the final two holes. That's the way
Sutton envisioned it unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told (wife) Ashley the night before that I've got to get to
16 ahead by three. I had planned on him making eagle,'' Sutton
said. ''But I knew 17 and 18 ... we both had to play the same way.
I felt I could beat him if we had to play the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's greatest accomplishment in golf was being on the
winning Ryder Cup team at The Country Club a year ago this week. As
for his only major?
</P>
<P>
   ''I was young and didn't know any better,'' said Sutton, the
last man to win wire-to-wire in the PGA Championship. ''At the time
I did that, Jack wasn't playing at quite the same level Tiger is
playing today.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   TIGER WANNABE: Despite winning the career Grand Slam and
setting scoring records in each of the four majors, Tiger Woods
always says his most impressive feat is getting into the Tour
Championship in just seven tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Howell knows what he means.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can appreciate that a whole lot because that's what I'm
trying to do,'' the NCAA champion from Oklahoma State said.
</P>
<P>
   Howell has earned $213,213, and will need about $190,000 more to
get his full-exempt card for next year without going to qualifying
school. He already has earned enough for conditional status,
meaning he can take unlimited sponsors' exemptions the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   That only makes Woods' feat that much more illustrious. He took
only three exemptions, winning in his fifth start at Las Vegas and
getting into top 30 on the money list with another victory at
Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ''Incredible,'' Howell said. ''I'd have to win, and hope a lot
of people got hurt, to get into the Tour Championship.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ON THE WEB: Titleist has a new three-piece ball that Davis
Love III and Phil Mickelson have been testing, but they'll have to
wait another month to put it in play because the U.S. Golf
Association's conforming ball list is still at the printer.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be a problem for ball companies next year.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA is working on a plan to update its conforming list
every month by posting approved balls on its web site. Eventually,
it can do away with the biannual publication.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not quite ready, but it's going to happen,'' the USGA's
Dick Rugge said.
</P>
<P>
   That will give companies a lot more flexibility in their
research and development. The deadline for the spring list is Dec.
31. Missing that even by a matter of days means companies would
have to wait until October for their product to be available for
play.
</P>
<P>
   It could also reduce the size of the mammoth, twice-a-year
booklet. Companies often submit dozens of balls so they don't have
to wait six months should they decide to take a certain product to
market.
</P>
<P>
   With the Web site listing, they can submit only what they want
to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got 1,500 balls on the fall list,'' Rugge said. ''Most
of those balls will never see the light of day. With a shorter lead
time, that list will be pared down.''

   SWOOSH STORIES: Two tidbits from the 18-month negotiations
between Nike and Tiger Woods that led to the five-year deal worth
about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lead negotiator for Nike was Ian Todd, head of global
marketing. Todd worked for IMG when Woods first signed with the
swoosh in 1996 for $40 million. He remains close with Alistair
Johnston, who's head of worldwide golf operations for IMG and
supervises Woods' agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very interesting situation because he was sitting
entirely on the other side of the fence,'' Johnston said. ''During
the course of negotiations, when tempers got frayed, our
relationship kept things on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Golf World magazine first reported a year ago that a new
deal for about $85 million to $90 million was being discussed. That
indeed turned out to be the base amount -- even though Woods won
four major championships during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money comes from profit sharing and other revenue
sources in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not trying to capitalize on his ongoing performance,''
Johnston said. ''Nike respected that in us and, I think, at the end
of the day delivered a good agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   DIVOTS: The Kroger Senior Classic will leave The Golf Center
at Kings Island, Ohio, in 2002, for the new TPC at River's Bend, an
Arnold Palmer course that is supposed to open in May. ... Quite a
week for IMG agent Mark Steinberg. He finalized the $100 million
deal for Tiger Woods, then became a father for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   STAT OF THE WEEK: Mark Calcavecchia has 13 second-place
finishes since 1990, second only to Greg Norman (17).
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FINAL WORD: ''Probably the single most thing I admire about
Tiger Woods is he can sign a $100 million deal today, and wake up
tomorrow with the same desire to be the best in the world.'' -- Hal
Sutton.

<HEADLINE> Book: Blair Lied About Donation  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A new book alleges that Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his Treasury chief both lied about the details of a
much-criticized $1.4 million campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The donation from Formula One auto racing tycoon Bernie
Ecclestone, who subsequently lobbied Blair successfully for an
exemption from a ban on tobacco sponsorship, came to light in
November 1997, six months into Blair's term.
</P>
<P>
   The book, by journalist Andrew Rawnsley, says Blair lied when he
said in an interview that he had asked a parliamentary committee
about the propriety of the donation. It said Treasury chief Gordon
Brown lied when he said publicly that he did not know about the
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Blair and Brown denied the allegations Tuesday,
but the controversy added to the woes of a governing Labor Party
battered by last week's fuel crisis and plunging opinion poll
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very serious matter,'' opposition Conservative Party
leader William Hague said. He called for an investigation by the
Committee on Standards in Public Life.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party eventually refunded the money to Ecclestone.
</P>
<P>
   Rawnsley said Blair never asked the parliamentary committee
about the contribution, inquiring instead about another donation
made by Ecclestone.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's office said Tuesday the new accusations by Rawnsley were
''a second-rate mix of reheated allegations that were made at the
time plus some colorful quotes that add up to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were published Tuesday in the Daily Mail,
extracted from Rawnsley's book ''Servants of the People,'' which is
being published Sept. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's popularity has slumped since the fuel price protests
last week, when gasoline stations across the country ran dry.
</P>
<P>
   An ICM poll published in The Guardian newspaper on Tuesday,
agreed with other recent surveys that Blair's Labor Party has
fallen behind the opposition Conservative Party for the first time
since the 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed that 38 percent of those asked would vote for
the Conservatives if the election were held now, compared with 34
percent for Labor and 22 percent for the Liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of the sample were dissatisfied with Blair's
performance in office, compared with 29 percent who held that
opinion in July. The poll, based on interviews with 1,055 adults on
Sept. 15-17, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Hussein to Kuwait: Stop Stealing  </HEADLINE>
By TAREK AL-ISSAWI
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iraq may be an international
pariah, battered by war and a decade of sanctions. But when its
leader Saddam Hussein speaks -- particularly when he threatens
Kuwait or makes pronouncements about oil -- the repercussions can be
far-reaching.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Iraqi allegations that Kuwait was stealing oil,
combined with a warning that Iraq will take unspecified steps to
''stop the theft,'' oil prices shot to 10-year highs on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, which was attacked by Iraq a decade ago following
similar threats, denied the accusations and appealed to the
international community to stand up to Saddam. The United States
issued a stern warning.
</P>
<P>
   Saddam followed up with an analysis of the current oil market in
his state-controlled newspapers Monday, saying world leaders were
worried demand far outstripped supply. ''Thus, the grip of
superpowers ...on oil countries will tighten and there is a benefit
for us in this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He declared no one could control those who were masters of their
own oil -- taken by some as a veiled threat to decrease Iraqi
output. Saddam has harshly criticized Saudi Arabia and other
countries for agreeing to increase output to bring prices down.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Iraq's government newspaper al-Jumhouriya said the
United States wants ''the price of oil to be suitable for it and
not for others,'' and questioned whether Saudi Arabia had enough
reserves to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq produces a little more than 3 million barrels a day,
earning millions of dollars as it struggles to rebuild after the
Gulf War and a decade of U.N. sanctions imposed to punish it for
invading Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's output is just over a third of U.S. ally Saudi Arabia's
8.253 million barrels a day. But with prices so high, every barrel
counts.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi Oil Minister Amer Mohammed Rashid acknowledged earlier
this month that a shortage of equipment and spare parts Iraq blames
in part on sanctions had forced it to abandon plans to raise output
to 3.4 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
   According to one analyst, the Iraqi accusations are no more than
an attempt by Baghdad to present itself as the victim of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iraq has embarked on a campaign to show that it is being
treated unfairly because of the sanctions, and this is a widely
held view in the Arab world and to some extent in Europe and the
United States,'' said James A. Placke of Cambridge Energy Research
Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Theft of Iraqi oil was one of the reasons Iraq gave for invading
Kuwait in 1990; a U.S.-led coalition force drove Iraq out seven
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq flexed its muscles recently, flying a jet fighter over
Saudi airspace for the first time in more than a decade. But Placke
and other analysts said Iraq does not have the military capability
to carry out threats.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Al-Misfer, political science professor at Qatar
University, said the Western interpretation of Iraq's comments was
inaccurate and claims of Iraqi threats ''were an excuse used by the
United States and its supporters in the region to completely
destroy Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Iraq's accusations, U.S. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said Saddam ''should understand that the United States and
our British friends are fully prepared to take whatever action is
necessary to prevent him from trying to repeat his past actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad quickly toned down its rhetoric, claiming on Monday that
the comments simply meant Iraq was about to get advanced equipment
that will help it drill more wells and restore old ones in areas
where the government claims Kuwait is stealing oil.
</P>
<P>
   Oil prices peaked at $34.90 a barrel Monday. Analysts said the
market will shift its focus soon.
</P>
<P>
   While no official comment has come out of Saudi Arabia, the
kingdom's papers, which usually reflect the government's position,
condemned Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   ''Military action awaits him if he takes any foolish,
uncalculated steps. Today is not like yesterday, back when he had
military might,'' the Arabic-language daily Al-Bilad said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, Defense Minister Sheik Salem Al Sabah said in an
interview published Sunday that the Iraqi leadership ''will pay a
high price this time if it carries out any foolish military act
against Kuwait.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi leadership is ''treacherous,'' and cannot be trusted,
Sheik Salem was quoted as telling Al-Rai Al-Am daily.
</P>
<P>
   A Saudi Foreign Ministry official has said a meeting of Gulf
states affirming solidarity with Kuwait could be held in the coming
days.

<HEADLINE> Frankel case prompts debate over need for federal insurance regulations </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Insurance companies, state regulators and
federal lawmakers all say that Martin Frankel swindled more than
$200 million from insurance companies thanks to shortcomings in
state insurance rules.
</P>
<P>
   But they're divided over whether imposing new federal
regulations would safeguard against fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, individual states regulate insurance companies
without federal oversight. And a congressional report released this
week shows that a lack of uniform policies and communication among
state agencies allowed Frankel to concoct what investigators say
was a $200 million embezzlement scam.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony submitted to a House subcommittee that held a
hearing on the report Tuesday, Michigan Rep. John Dingell said
state insurance regulators ''were either too blind to see, or too
unwilling to acknowledge, the scam Mr. Frankel perpetrated, openly
and fearlessly, over a period of eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   He says federal regulations will be needed if states don't
quickly become better industry watchdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators say Frankel ran an unlicensed insurance
brokerage from his fortress-like Greenwich estate. He disappeared
in May 1999, leaving behind piles of smoldering documents. He was
arrested in Germany months later with a bundle of loot, and
convicted on passport fraud and tax evasion charges. He is now
fighting extradition to the United States where he faces charges of
embezzling more than $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Frankel bought small insurance companies in
Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Missouri and raided
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankel case is giving insurance companies and state and
local officials the opportunity to discuss whether the industry
should be federally regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Insureres are split on the issue. Some say uniformed regulations
are needed; others say the creation of federal rules will disrupt a
multi-billion industry.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a group of
state insurance regulators, wants Congress to let each state make
its own improvements. They say a law enacted last year already puts
in place stricter state regulations that could guard against the
type of scam investigators say Frankel pulled off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't see that legislation is necessary,'' said Lee
Covington, a NAIC chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Urban, who testified on behalf of three groups
representing insurance industries, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''My company and the other companies I represent today do not
see federal regulation as an appropriate approach to modernization
of state regulation,'' said Urban, who is also the president of the
Grange Insurance Companies.
</P>
<P>
   Urban said federal regulation could stifle competition among
insurance companies and bog them down with paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   But Drayton Nabers Jr., chairman of the Protective Life
Insurance Company, said a federal regulatory system is worth
considering.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the American Council of Life Insurers, Nabers said
a federal regulation system would mean insurance companies
operating in more than one state would have to deal with only one
regulatory agency. However, he acknowledged that companies doing
business in a single state might prefer a more simple and less
expense state regulatory system.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the insurance business to remain viable and serve the
needs of its customers effectively, our system of insurance
regulation must become far more efficient,'' Nabers said. ''This is
not a call for less regulation. It is a call for strong regulation
administered efficiently.''

<HEADLINE> Male employee files gender bias lawsuit against Girl Scouts  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A graphic designer for the Girl Scouts has filed
a sex discrimination lawsuit charging that the organization has
denied him job promotions because he is a man.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Picca of Cliffside Park, N.J., says court papers that in
the 15 years since he began working at the Girl Scouts' Manhattan
headquarters, he has been denied one promotion and not allowed to
apply for two others.
</P>
<P>
   Picca's lawyer, Leonard Flamm, said he will ask the court to
certify the lawsuit as a class action that would include the
approximately 115 men who work for the Girl Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Picca's court papers include a list of 10 women and one man in
the New York office who have been appointed or promoted to
positions senior to his since 1988. The lone man, promoted in 1997,
was fired in 1999, papers say.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 employees in the graphics and design department where
Picca designs brochures, charts and the like, three are men, say
papers made public Tuesday in Manhattan's State Supreme Court. The
lawsuit says the 11 women hold positions equal to or senior to
Picca's, whereas only one of the men does.
</P>
<P>
   The Girl Scout's ''glass ceiling practices, policies and
customs'' have caused Picca ''severe emotional distress,
degradation, shame, humiliation and embarrassment, loss of dignity,
pain and suffering,'' court papers say.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Christie, the Girl Scouts' manager of media services, said
she had not seen Picca's lawsuit and could not comment on it
directly, but she said the allegation of discrimination surprised
her.
</P>
<P>
   Christie said few organizations had worked as hard as the Girl
Scouts to assure diversity and fairness in hiring and promoting -
in terms of race, ethnicity and gender. The Girl Scouts were cited
in a national business magazine as one of the country's best places
to work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Men just can't seem to crack the promotion barrier,'' Flamm
said. He said Picca earns between $50,000 and $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Flamm emphasized that the lawsuit targets only the Girl Scouts'
corporate organization, not the numerous councils around the nation
that deal directly with scouting activities.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 27; Nasdaq Advances 99  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rebounded Tuesday on bargain
hunting and analysts' enthusiasm, but blue chips appeared unable to
recover from a slide triggered by anxiety about corporate profits
and rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average continued to slide a day after
it and the Nasdaq composite index tumbled more than 100 points
apiece. In afternoon trading, the Dow was off 27.00 at 10,781.52.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were higher. The tech-dominated Nasdaq
climbed 99.43 to 3,825.95. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose
9.66 to 1,454.17.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have generally been down this month, after a healthy
rally in August that sent some issues soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some call it a rebound, some call it bargain hunting, but on
balance, the uptake in the market leaves a lot to be desired,''
said Alan Ackerman, a senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
''Overall, investors are still nervous over energy prices, the euro
and an economic slowdown which may prompt quarterly earnings to be
a bit lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Individual tech stocks rose on positive news.
</P>
<P>
   Cobalt Networks announced it was being acquired by Sun
Microsystems in a $2 billion stock deal. The computer server
manufacturer's shares rose $15.88 to $57, a more than 38 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Software company Ariba rose $11.06 to $155 after it announced it
would provide e-commerce support systems to Transora, a global
business-to-business Web site for food, beverage and consumer
goods.
</P>
<P>
   Intel traded up $4 at $59.61 after Banc of America Securities
upgraded the chipmaker's shares to ''buy'' from ''market perform.''
The recommendation came less than a week after the same analyst
downgraded the company, whose stock has been on slipping since the
beginning of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' enthusiasm also helped push another chipmaker, Micron
Technology, up $6.50 to $64.50.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of Tuesday, investors repeated what has become a
pattern this September -- unloading the stocks of companies,
particularly those on the Big Board, that even hint at
disappointing quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   With the end of the third-quarter less than two weeks away, a
number of companies have said their results will be below Wall
Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of indicators suggest the economy is
moderating, which raises questions about the impact slower economic
growth will have on corporate profits. A Commerce Department report
Tuesday said housing construction rose modestly in August, but at
levels below analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa was down $1.69 at $25.44 after the aluminum manufacturer
became the latest company to revise its earnings outlook downward
because of rising energy costs and softening demand. The company's
third-quarter earnings will still be 35 percent above last year,
but that wasn't enough to satisfy investors.
</P>
<P>
   Federal-Mogul dropped $1.38 to $7.88 after its top officer
stepped down and the auto-parts manufacturer warned of
lower-than-expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings warnings also sent Ingersoll-Rand down $3.81 to $35.94
after warnings. The tool and machinery manufacturer blamed the bad
news on weakness in the euro, Europe's chief currency, and lower
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices, which have climbed as high as $37 per barrel
of crude oil this week, again added to the pressure on corporate
profits. Light, sweet crude sold for $36.48 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Energy stocks, which advanced Monday as oil prices gained,
drifted lower Tuesday. Exxon Mobil was down $1.33 at $88.31, Baker
Hughes fell $1.15 to $36.50.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by more than a 6-to-5
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 789.63
million shares, ahead of the 759.64 million shares in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.15 at 516.83.

<HEADLINE> Monet Painting Stolen from Museum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The painting ''Beach in Pourville'' by
French impressionist Claude Monet, has been stolen from a museum in
western Poland, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Workers at the Poznan branch of the National Museum discovered
Tuesday afternoon that someone had cut the painting from its frame
and replaced it with a copy, spokesman Andrzej Borowiak said.
</P>
<P>
   The painting is valued at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Police experts were working to determine when the theft took
place.
</P>
<P>
   All border crossings were immediately alerted to try to prevent
the work -- Poland's only Monet -- from being smuggled out of the
country, Borowiak said.
</P>
<P>
   Monet painted several canvasses of Pourville, in Normandy. The
coasts of Normandy were a frequent subject for Monet, who depicted
the beaches and dramatic cliffs there in sunshine and in storms.

<HEADLINE> U.S., N. Korea Talks to Resume  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. and North Korean negotiators will resume
talks next week in New York in an attempt to end a stalemate over
Pyongyang's development and export of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The talks also will focus on U.S. allegations that North Korea
sponsors terrorism and on terms of an accord that froze North
Korea's nuclear weapons program in exchange for two civilian
reactors and supplies of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The last round of missile talks ended in July with North Korea
insisting its program was a sovereign exercise in self-defense, but
also with indications from economically distressed Pyongyang that
it might curb the program in exchange for payments of about $1
billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   From Pyongyang's standpoint, the meetings that begin Sept. 27
offer an opportunity to air complaints that energy supplies under
the nuclear freeze agreement have been inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The third issue, terrorism, needs to be resolved before North
Korea can hope to win U.S. acceptance. The Stalinist North is
listed by the State Department as a supporter of terrorism, and
thereby under U.S. law is barred from receiving other than
humanitarian assistance such as food.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
Monday, said the talks could go on a few days or longer, depending
on the progress made.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with North Korea have been on the upswing since
South Korean President Kim Dae-jung two years ago undertook a
process of reconciliation with Pyongyang, North Korea's leader, Kim
Jong Il gradually warmed to the overture and they met at the summit
in June.
</P>
<P>
   But a search at the Frankfurt, Germany, airport of the North
Korean delegation to the United Nations' Millennium Summit earlier
this month touched off a ripple of ill will.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation canceled its trip to New York, and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright subsequently said she regretted the
incident and that the search by German security personnel was not
authorized by U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, North Korean Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun decided
not to attend the U.N. General Assembly meetings last week. State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ''unavoidable reasons''
were behind the cancellation and it was not aimed at slowing
momentum toward improved relations.
</P>
<P>
   The visit had been foreseen as a possible opportunity for
Albright to meet with the foreign minister, which would have
shifted the improving relationship into higher gear.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling in Thailand, Defense Secretary William Cohen cautions
that despite easing of tensions on the Korean peninsula, the United
States will stay vigilant as long as North Korea keeps a huge army
on its border with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are encouraged by the steps that we see being taken. But we
must remain vigilant because of the size of the army that the North
Koreans still maintain,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was heading to South Korea later Tuesday for a three-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that there has been a reduction in the tensions
that previously existed,'' Cohen acknowledged. But, he added, this
is only the ''first stages ... toward a reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be very cautious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is believed capable of targeting virtually all of
Japan as well as other Asian countries with its missiles. And a
potential long-range threat was cited by the Clinton administration
as one reason for considering a U.S. missile defense program -- a
decision President Clinton has deferred to his successor.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, North Korea's export of missile technology to
Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and other countries has alarmed U.S. officials
as a devastating challenge to American attempts to curb
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department formally announced the talks Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Small explosion, fire forces evacuation of building at Rutgers-Newark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A buildup of hydrogen from a leak in
laboratory apparatus caused a small explosion and fire at Rutgers
University's Newark Monday night, the university said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 6 p.m. blast forced the evacuation of a classroom building.
No one was injured, and no toxic fumes were released.
</P>
<P>
   Boyden Hall, where the blast occurred, was reopened Tuesday
morning, although the laboratory where the incident occurred
remained closed for cleanup and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are immensely relieved that there were no injuries or loss
of life from this accident,'' said Gene Vincenti, the university's
associate provost. ''Alarm systems in the building immediately
alerted occupants to evacuate, and faculty and staff in the
building took quick action to make sure everyone left the building
quickly and in an orderly manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The university said initial reports that the blast was caused by
a student science experiment gone awry were incorrect, noting the
lab was not in use at the time.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by Newark and Rutgers officials said a buildup
of hydrogen in an inert atmosphere glove box caused the blast. The
box is used in biology experiments that require a controlled gas
environment, such as those that work with certain types of
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment had not been used since July, and no bacteria were
present when the explosion occurred, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   It could take several days to determine what caused the gas
leak, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion destroyed the glove box, blew out several windows,
caused ceiling tiles to fall, and broke some glassware stored on
shelves.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Hostage Sighting Reported  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim guerrillas continued to
elude thousands of military troops seeking to rescue 19 hostages
from a southern Philippine jungle Tuesday, despite reports that
some of the captives had been seen alive.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of civilians fled from the sporadic clashes on remote
Jolo island, and thousands of others were trapped inside a tight
military blockade of rebel areas, refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada said he would only halt the four-day
assault if the Abu Sayyaf rebels free all their captives, including
six foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let them release the hostages and that's the time we can
talk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said some of the fleeing rebels were attempting to
escape to nearby islands, but Estrada said there was no information
any had been able to break through naval ship patrols.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are believed to have speedboats bought with some of
the more than $15 million ransom they reportedly received from
Libya and Malaysia for freeing other hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The three separate Abu Sayyaf factions that were holding the
hostages merged into two as they fled the assault, presidential
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   One group is holding American Jeffrey Schilling and Filipino
Roland Ulla, who was kidnapped from a Malaysian diving resort in
April. The other is holding two French journalists, three
Malaysians and 12 Filipino Christian evangelists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are believed to be planning to use the hostages as
human shields and bargaining chips, Puno said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the assault began Saturday, the military has overrun three
major Abu Sayyaf camps and smaller hide-outs, but found no sign of
the hostages there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yesterday the reports from the field said some of the hostages
were sighted,'' Puno said Tuesday. ''We're very hopeful that this
will pan out.'' He declined to provide details, and a military
spokesman indicated the sighting may have been as long as two days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Gen. Generoso Senga, also indicating the military
still had no clear idea of where the rebels were, suggesting the
assault could take longer than the one week the military has
estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Officials continued a news blackout on most details of the
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said he believed all the hostages were safe, but offered
little proof.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the history of kidnappers, when they kill their victims,
they leave their bodies to show what they have done,'' he said.
''In as much as we haven't seen any bodies of the hostages, we
believe that they are all still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels had threatened to attack southern cities and behead
Schilling, of Oakland, Calif., if they were attacked by the
military.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested two suspected Abu Sayyaf members Tuesday in
Zamboanga city, about 85 miles from Jolo, they believe are members
of an explosives team.
</P>
<P>
   One, Fauzi Dansalan, said he was arrested in Manila in
connection with a bombing several months ago at a shopping mall but
was cleared and released. The other, Ahmad Hanapi, is a servant for
the mother of Schilling's wife, Ivi Osani, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Osani is the second cousin of rebel spokesman Abu Sabaya and the
widow of a rebel killed by government troops several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who converted to Islam in 1994, visited an Abu Sayyaf
camp with Osani on Aug. 28 and reportedly was abducted because of
an argument over religion with the rebels. Osani was not seized.
</P>
<P>
   Seven rebels have been killed and 20 captured in the four days
of fighting, while six government troops were wounded, military
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Germany,Spain Continue Fuel Protest  </HEADLINE>
By ED McCULLOUGH
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Truckers in Sweden eased fuel price
protests Tuesday, but Spanish farmers on tractors clogged roads
across the country and German truckers slowed traffic to a crawl
for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of demonstrators declined, protesters
angered by high prices across Europe -- where fuel taxes range from
51 to 73 percent -- continued to press their governments for relief.
The protests began Sept. 4 in France.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish truckers withdrew from oil harbors and freight terminals
in Stockholm and in the major port of Goteborg, and farmers pulled
back 625 tractors from downtown plazas in cities around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think the dialogue with the government has been quite
fruitful so far and we want to wait and see what Prime Minister
Goeran Persson will say,'' said Lars Hook of the Federation of
Swedish Farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But Spanish farmers riding slow-moving tractors blew whistles
and set off firecrackers as they clogged roads all over Spain to
press demands for cheaper diesel fuel, which has gone up 55 percent
since August of last year to about $1.70 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Farm lobbies, who organized the one-day protest, said tractor
processions rolled through 34 provinces, while demonstrators
blockaded fuel depots in some places.
</P>
<P>
   Some 50 tractor-borne farmers chugged into Madrid under a chilly
drizzle and rumbled up the capital city's elegant main boulevard to
the Economy and Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, about 300 fisherman blocked the entrance of fishing
boats to southwest port of Huelva for seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Castellon on the east coast, some 65 boats blocked the
entrance of the port at dawn and prevented unloading of oil from a
British Petroleum fuel tanker, Spanish National Radio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will cut off everything there is to cut off unless we get
what we want,'' said Manuel Carlon, leader of the Madrid branch of
the Coordinator of Agricultural and Ranching Organizations, one of
Spain's largest farm associations.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tuesday's nationwide protests in Spain were scheduled
to last one day, but Carlon said farmers would take to the streets
again Oct. 13 if fuel prices remain high.
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiment was heard in Britain, where fuel protests were
called off last Thursday for 60 days to give the government time to
respond to demands for lower fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am sure action will be taken if nothing happens,'' said Len
Johnson, a spokesman for truckers who blocked a Shell terminal in
northeastern England.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, 200 truckers slowed traffic to a crawl Tuesday on a
busy autobahn exchange near Frankfurt. Traffic backed up for about
six miles.
</P>
<P>
   Another 400 truckers and taxi drivers carried out the same
tactic in the center of Hamburg.
</P>
<P>
   The protests began earlier this month as prices for gas and
diesel fuel soared this year due to high world prices for oil and a
strong U.S. dollar, the currency that world oil sales are priced
in.
</P>
<P>
   Europe adopted high gas taxes decades ago as an environmental
measure to discourage excessive fuel consumption. Taxes range from
51 percent in Greece to 73 percent in Britain, where diesel cost an
average of $4.33 a gallon last month.
</P>
<P>
   Most governments, including Spain, refused to lower fuel taxes.
Sweden's government even plans to boost the diesel fuel tax by 1
cent a liter. Protests in France ended after the government agreed
to tax concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Some governments have proposed partial remedies. Finland
announced a cut in the road tax for its truckers, while last week
Germany pledged to implement measures to help commuters pay for gas
and needy apartment dwellers to pay for heating oil.

<HEADLINE> Soccer: U.S. 3, Kuwait 1  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Carrying a burden it didn't want,
the U.S. men's Olympic soccer team broke new ground.
</P>
<P>
   The group composed mostly of young professionals, none of whom
had anything to do with the failures of the past, advanced to the
quarterfinals by winning their group with a 3-1 victory over Kuwait
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all expected to get through our group,'' said Landon
Donovan, who scored one of the goals. ''U.S. soccer is not a point
anymore where we're saying, 'Let's try to get a point here and pull
off a win there.'
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going into every game thinking we can win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dating to 1924, the Americans had never advanced beyond the
first round of an Olympic tournament. Their record was a dismal
4-12-6 in 11 Olympic appearances before Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But this team was the first one made up almost exclusively of
professionals, a byproduct of the development of Major League
Soccer since its inception four years ago. There has never been a
U.S. Olympic squad anywhere near this good, and the team advanced
by tying strong teams from the Czech Republic and Cameroon before
shutting down the unpredictable Kuwaitis.
</P>
<P>
   ''The youth national teams really haven't done that well for
U.S. soccer,'' said Danny Califf, who scored the first U.S. goal.
''This is a really big, big step for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team's quarterfinal game will played Saturday in
Adelaide. A victory there puts the Americans in good position for
their first-ever Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we're going to be satisfied with just getting
out of our group,'' defender Jeff Agoos said. ''I know it's a major
accomplishment for this team and this sport, and we recognize that
and we appreciate that and we're thankful to be a part of that.
Hopefully, we've got some more games to play. We came here to get a
medal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans got an assist from Winter Olympics weather at
these Summer Games. It was a cool, rainy night at the Melbourne
Cricket Ground, and the sun-and-sand Kuwaitis were so uncomfortable
that their substitutes stood rather than sit on the bench during
the first half. They looked like miserable commuters waiting for a
late bus in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a factor for our players,'' Kuwait coach Radojko
Avramovic said. ''They aren't used to these conditions, and that's
part of what stopped them playing. We tried to tell them to play,
to play, to play, but nobody was listening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans dominated every facet of the game, out-shooting
Kuwait 17-8 and taking 10 corner kicks to Kuwait's one. After
several close calls, Califf finally broke through with his goal in
the 40th minute. Chris Albright followed in the 63rd and Donovan in
the 89th.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be totally honest, we felt we played better in the first
two games than we did today,'' coach Clive Charles said. ''But we
were fortunate enough that we were able to score at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Substitute Bader Najem scored in the 83rd minute for Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Califf's goal was a solid header off a corner kick from Agoos.
Albright got his goal when he beat Jamal Abdulrahman to a long ball
to the left of the net and slotted a tight-angle shot past
goalkeeper Shehab Kankone.
</P>
<P>
   Najem's goal, on a counterattack, made the U.S. bench nervous,
but Donovan scored on a 2-on-1 break with Josh Wolff to secure the
win.
</P>
<P>
   The 19,684 fans seemed lost in the 95,000-seat MCG as they
deserted the front-row seats and watched the game from sheltered
seats underneath the mezzanine and the partial roof overhang. The
rain stopped during the first half, but the damage was done. One of
the linesmen kept the crowd entertained by sliding down hard more
than once while trying to follow the run of play.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans left the field all wet, but happy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a buildup of U.S. soccer,'' Olsen said. ''We're the
next generation of U.S. Olympians, and every year we try to improve
and this year we're doing it. And who knows what happens from here?
We'll see how we do, and the next group has to do better.''

<HEADLINE> Moynihan saluted by New York lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York lawmakers paid tribute to Daniel
Patrick Moynihan on the floor of the House, praising the retiring
senator as a working man, scholar, diplomat and legislator.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only in America,'' crowed Harlem Democratic Rep. Charles
Rangel, describing Moynihan's rise from the slums of Hell's Kitchen
and jobs shining shoes to the Senate's leading intellect.
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent was Rep. Rick Lazio, who hopes to succeed the
four-term Democrat. The Suffolk County Republican was in upstate
New York campaigning in his race against Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio submitted a statement for the record calling Moynihan ''a
truly eloquent voice in Washington for all of us in the Empire
State'' and saying he would be ''deeply honored to serve as his
successor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For New Yorkers, Senator Moynihan has always been one of our
home grown heroes, our proud gift to the nation,'' said Rep.
Carolyn Maloney,D-Manhattan, who led off the salute.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans praised Moynihan's bipartisan,
gentlemanly style over his 24 years in the Senate and his work on
issues from the Northern Ireland peace process to Social Security
to transportation funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always defied New York's upstate-downstate state of mind,''
said Rep. James Walsh, R-Onondaga County.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sherwood Boehlert described his unique relationship with
Moynihan - the senator's farm in Pindar's Corners is in Boehlert's
central New York district.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am his congressman and I can tell you one cannot wish for a
better constituent,'' Boehlert said.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a quip from GOP Rep. Peter King, of Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got the short straw. I represented Senator D'Amato,'' King
said, referring to Alfonse D'Amato, Moynihan's longtime Senate
colleague from New York, who was defeated in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 16 New York lawmakers praised Moynihan's career.
Washington D.C. delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton also spoke on his
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan sat in the chamber for the nearly hour-long salute,
taking a little bow and offering a handshake after each of his
colleagues spoke. Liz Moynihan, who ran her husband's campaigns,
took in the proceedings from the gallery. She received nearly as
much praise as her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today we pay tribute to a great man, Liz Moynihan's husband,''
said Rep. Anthony Weiner, D-Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan called the tribute ''lovely.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Wonderful things were said all the way from Buffalo to Long
Island,'' he said. ''It makes an old man feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, President Clinton signed legislation naming
the federal courthouse in Manhattan after Moynihan.

<HEADLINE> Antitrust Head Klein Leaving Justice  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Antitrust chief Joel I. Klein, who launched
the case to break up Microsoft and won record criminal fines
against international price fixers, will leave government at the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to seek new challenges,'' Klein said in a
statement Tuesday. ''I have done what I set out to do here, and our
work is on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, 53, intends to take time off and then begin a search for
his next job, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein ''will not be wanting for suitors. His job search could be
one of the great auctions,'' predicted Professor William E. Kovacic
of The George Washington University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   During Klein's tenure, which began Oct. 18, 1996, the government
blocked or altered about 170 mergers. In 220 criminal price-fixing
cases, 52 executives were sent to prison, corporations paid $1.7
billion in fines and individuals paid another $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic ranked Klein among the three most influential chiefs
ever to head the Justice Department's antitrust division, along
with Thurmond Arnold in the Roosevelt administration of the late
1930s and early 1940s and William Baxter in the first Reagan
administration in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will be remembered as the man who brought the antitrust
division back into the courtroom after about 15 years of living on
settlements, guidelines and speeches,'' Kovacic said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein will leave before the courts render a final verdict on the
Microsoft case, but he won the first round. U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled after a trial that Microsoft
illegally used monopoly power to thwart innovation by competitors
and ordered it split into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft appealed the verdict and the Supreme Court is to
decide soon whether to hear the appeal directly, as Klein and
Jackson proposed, or to have the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia hear the appeal first, as the company
prefers.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of Klein's litigation campaign won't be known
until appellate courts finally resolve the Microsoft case and
Klein's cases against American Airlines for predatory action
against low-cost competitors and against Visa and MasterCard for
limiting competition in credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joel Klein has been a champion for America's consumers. He has
fought tirelessly for marketplace competition, and Americans have
enjoyed better products, more choices and lower prices as a
result,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In cracking a worldwide vitamin price-fixing cartel, Klein's
division obtained the largest criminal fine in Justice Department
history for any kind of crime: $500 million levied against F.
Hoffmann-La Roche, a Swiss firm. BASF, a German firm, paid a $225
million fine in the vitamin case.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. firm Archer Daniels Midland paid $100 million for
fixing the prices of food and feed additives lysine and citric
acid. For fixing the price of graphite electrodes used in mini
steel mills, SGL Carbon AG, a German firm, paid $135 million and
UCAR, a U.S. firm, paid $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition from Klein's division led to abandonment of an $11
billion merger between Lockheed Martin and Northup Grumman in the
defense electronics and strategic aircraft industries. WorldCom and
Sprint dropped their $129 billion telecommunications merger after
Klein and his staff objected to increased concentration in
long-distance, Internet backbone and business data services.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, Klein signed antitrust cooperation
agreements with Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Israel,
Japan and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The department announced that Klein's principal deputy, Doug
Melamed, 54, will replace him as acting assistant attorney general
in charge of the antitrust division.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Against Saddam Not Working?  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Answering charges that the U.S. policy against
Saddam Hussein is a failure, a Pentagon official said Tuesday that
there's ''no better ...alternative'' to the strategy already being
used in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, senators
questioned the 10-year effort against Saddam that has left him in
power, cost the United States billions of dollars and has been
losing international support.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that the current policy is a failure,'' said Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. ''What do we have to show for the risk and
the cost?
</P>
<P>
   ''What ... are we trying to achieve? Do we have the best
policy,'' asked Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ''Why is the United States
virtually alone -- save Great Britain -- in its military efforts.
Does the international community have a better policy option to
which more nations will give support?''
</P>
<P>
   Edward S. Walker Jr., assistant secretary of state for Near
Eastern affairs, acknowledged that ''Iraq under Saddam remains
dangerous, unreconstructed and defiant.'' The Clinton
administration, he said, continues its work to contain Saddam
militarily and support Iraqi opposition leaders hoping to overthrow
the regime.
</P>
<P>
   Walter B. Slocombe, under secretary of defense for policy, said
the administration is already using the ''full range'' of tactics
against Saddam. Those are economic sanctions, diplomacy,
intelligence gathering and military force, including enforcing
no-fly zones over Iraq jointly with Britain so Saddam cannot
threaten his neighbors or his own country's minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The United States provides some 20,000 sailors, soldiers and
airmen, 200 aircraft and 25 ships to the effort, considered one of
its major theaters of military operation, said Gen. Tommy R.
Franks, commander in chief of the U.S. Central Command. The
Pentagon has said that the enforcing the no-fly zone alone, costs
nearly $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are satisfied after intense consideration over a long
period of time that there is no better fundamental alternative to
the basic policy that we are following,'' Slocombe told the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   He said Saddam knows that the ''only way to prevail is by
outlasting the United States'' or undermining the international
coalition against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were to let our impatience or our unwillingness to
tolerate these costs drive us to abandon our longer-term effort,
Saddam would have won in the only way he can and the costs to our
interests would be immense,'' Slocombe said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner criticized allies in the region for pursuing diplomatic
and trade relations with Iraq while simultaneously providing bases
and other military help to the U.S. forces fighting him.
</P>
<P>
   Franks responded that ''maintaining a coalition is hard work and
is not without problems,'' adding that the nations each had their
own ''interests and priorities.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Push for Landmark Vote  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A majority of senators appealed for a vote on
a landmark conservation bill Tuesday. They face a fight with
powerful opponents who promise to kill what they consider a federal
land grab and a spending mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters released a letter from 63 senators who
favor the bill, which would provide $3 billion a year for buying
land, restoring coastlines and protecting wildlife. That majority
ensures that supporters could prevent a filibuster if the bill
comes to a vote before the clock runs out on the session next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need to have a unanimous vote. We have to have
filibuster-proof to win,'' said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La. ''There
are senators who have said they will use their prerogatives to hold
up the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters sent their letter to Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., urging a
vote on the Conservation and Restoration Act. Supporters say it
could also be attached to some other legislation before the session
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now I don't think that the CARA legislation could be
passed in its present form, but there's work going on and I hope we
can enlarge the loop of who's involved in that effort,'' Lott said.
''I'm for it.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton supports the bill. Any provision would have to
be reconciled with the House, which overwhelmingly approved a
similar bill in May.
</P>
<P>
   Despite broad bipartisan support, critics have been vocal about
stopping the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Western Republicans complain bitterly that the government
already owns too much land and mismanages what it has. Lawmakers
who serve on the budget and appropriations committees fought hard
against the bill for designating how money is spent, rather than
leaving decisions up to Congress each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they can win even if they have 63 on board,''
said Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would create a $3 billion-a-year fund for 15 years to
pay for an array of activities, from restoring beaches to creating
urban parks. The money would come from oil and gas leases,
primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide $450 million a year for federal land
purchases and another $450 million for states to buy property. The
remaining money would be spent on conservation programs, but only
if Congress spends the $450 million for federal land purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Despite inducements such as doubling payments to local
governments to replace lost tax revenue for federal land, Western
Republicans still don't like the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 701.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Derby Winner May Return  </HEADLINE>
By MARV SCHNEIDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus, out of
racing since May with a hoof injury, probably will make his
comeback Saturday in the Jerome Handicap at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''The primary goal is the Breeders' Cup,'' trainer Neil Drysdale
said Tuesday of the Nov. 4 races at Churchill Downs, where the colt
is expected to end his racing career in the $4 million Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not necessary for him to win. This is a preparation
race. I want to emphasize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before officially entering Fusaichi Pegasus in the 1-mile
Jerome, Drysdale wants the approval of Japanese multimillionaire
owner Fusao Sekiguchi and Coolmore Stud, the Irish breeding
operation which bought the colt for about $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale called Jerome ''a good stepping stone'' for the
Breeders' Cup, but said Saturday's race is ''unattractive because
it's a much stronger field than usual. The weight is especially
unattractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus is being asked to carry 124 pounds, even though
he hasn't raced since finishing second to Red Bullet in the
Preakness. His impressive credentials can be blamed for that.
</P>
<P>
   Four or five other 3-year-olds are expected to enter the
$150,000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Hook and Ladder, who has never run in a stakes race, is assigned
113 pounds. ''That's a large spread,'' Drysdale said. ''I've seen
him run, and he can run.''
</P>
<P>
   Other likely candidates for the Jerome are Mighty, 117; El
Corredor, 117; Big EE, 114, and Albert The Great, 113.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale cautioned that although his colt has come along nicely
since hurting his hoof in June, the horse is not completely fit.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a workout or two shy,'' the trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   But Drysdale said bringing Fusaichi Pegasus back now ''gets us a
little bit ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned the Jockey Club Gold Cup on Oct. 14 as another
possible race before the Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale has not raced Fusaichi Pegasus until now because he
didn't want to chance aggravating the hoof, and to give the colt a
chance to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He started racing in December and he raced until May. That's a
lot for young horse,'' Drysdale said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the horse was out of training, it was a matter of getting
him fit again -- one race at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus will begin his stud career next year, and is
expected to fetch as much as a record $200,000 stud fee.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Diana Mocanu a New Hero  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRU ALEXE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- Before Diana Mocanu won an Olympic
gold medal for swimming -- the country's first -- the 16-year-old was
virtually unknown beyond the walls of her high school. Now she is
Golden Diana and all Romania is at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   Her teachers and schoolmates alike broke off their classes and
crammed around a television set at the Sports High School in her
gritty eastern Romanian hometown to watch Mocanu swim the finals of
the 100-meter backstroke, school principal Jean Preda said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When she won, everyone, including her mother who works as a
janitor at the school, burst into tears, hugging each other and
cracking open bottles of champagne, Preda said.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she left, the best we were hoping for was an honorable
place in the finals,'' said her sister Luminita Mocanu, 26, by
telephone. ''Maybe in her heart she had this dream, but she didn't
tell us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Mocanu was practically unknown even in her hometown before her
victory Monday, which set an Olympic record. Overnight, she became
a national hero and was the top story in most newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Golden Diana. A 16-year-old girl from Braila became
(Romania's) first ever Olympic champion for swimming,'' read the
headline of Evenimentul Zilei daily. ''We found Gold in Sydney with
a 16-year-old swimmer,'' cheered another daily, Adevarul.
</P>
<P>
   While sports and Olympic medals are cherished in any country,
Olympic glory means even more to Romanians, who are desperate to be
seen in the eyes of the world as more than a poor, potentially
unstable Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mocanu's victory was even more sweet after two Romanian
weightlifters were thrown out of the Sydney Games for testing
positive for anabolic steroids, shaming the nation. Although
Romania's women gymnasts will also be bringing home gold, Moncanu's
medal was the country's first in swimming.

<HEADLINE> Media Execs Ask Putin For Meeting  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Angry editors from Russia's most prominent private
media company asked President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday to meet
with them and seek a solution to the escalating battle for control
of the company.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Putin's office to the plea
by top editors and directors working for broadcast and print
outlets of Media-Most, which the natural gas giant Gazprom, partly
owned by the government, is trying to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most includes NTV, the only widely-seen TV channel in
Russia that isn't controlled by the government, and the pressure
from Gazprom is seen by many media watchdogs as a Kremlin attempt
to crack down on media critical of the government.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom says the dispute is a straightforward matter of
legitimate contract obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most, which also includes the widely respected radio
station Ekho Moskvy and the newspaper Segodnya, has been under
government pressure for months. Its offices were raided by masked,
armed police in the spring and its head Vladimir Gusinsky was
jailed for four days in June on charges of defrauding the
government in a privatization deal.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges were unexpectedly dropped in July, prompting
speculation that Gusinsky had cut a deal. The deal became known
this week: an agreement to sell Media-Most to Gazprom for $475
million in debt, plus an additional $300 million, in return for the
government dropping the case against him.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom previously had guaranteed huge loans to Media-Most and
says the company has failed to pay $211 million that it owes.
Andrei Tsimailo, a member of the Media-Most board of directors,
denied Tuesday that the company was in default, but Gazprom said it
was preparing to go to court.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky now says he signed the sale agreement under duress and
considers it invalid. One of the agreement's provisions was that
the sale would be in exchange for guarantees of freedom and safety
for Gusinsky and his business associates, according to a text of
the agreement carried in Russian news media.
</P>
<P>
   By asking for a meeting with Putin, ''we are not asking the
president to help settle the debt problem between Media-Most and
Gazprom. We are asking for the president to listen to us,'' said
Aleksei Venediktov, chief editor of Ekho Moskvy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confronted with a political, not a financial problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Kiselyov, chief director of NTV and one of the country's
most influential news commentators, denounced the agreement as
''unprecedented in the history of our Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most's news organizations had previously kept silent about
the agreement because ''we wanted to reach a real economic
compromise,'' he said at a news conference. But he said the recent
push by Gazprom to acquire the company shows there is a political
component.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader who opened up the
country's media, on Tuesday called the agreement ''crude blackmail
by the state.'' Gorbachev leads an NTV advisory council.

<HEADLINE> Nielsen accuses Maloney of 'money laundering'  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Republican Mark Nielsen filed a formal
complaint with state elections officials Tuesday, alleging that
Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Maloney has ''laundered'' money from an
old state Senate campaign to help his current bid for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to an old washing machine and a laundry basket
filled with fake cash outside the state Elections Enforcement
Commission, Nielsen charged that Maloney deliberately circumvented
federal election law by using money from a 1988 state Senate race
for his current campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney's campaign called the complaint, which followed a news
conference by Nielsen on the same topic last week, an ''act of
desperation'' by a candidate devoid of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen admitted he could not prove any laws were violated in
what he called a multi-step process to divert about $35,000 to
Maloney's congressional campaigns - including more than $17,000 to
his current effort.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Maloney had clearly violated the spirit of campaign
finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Viewed individually, each of these transactions may be legal.
Viewed collectively, however, they represent an illegal conspiracy
to circumvent state and federal election campaign law,'' said
Nielsen, who said he also is considering filing a complaint with
the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by Nielsen, Maloney has been raising money for a
political action committee run by his friends, the Connecticut
Democratic Leadership Roundtable. That committee, which is intended
to help Democratic candidates for state office, has contributed
more than $21,000 to Maloney's 1988 state Senate campaign, Nielsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative campaign, in turn, has given the money to
Maloney, who has plowed much of it back into the congressional
race, Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Maloney's campaign said the congressman had done nothing
improper. The money given to his 1988 campaign was used to pay off
debt that remained from that race - primarily in the form of loans
from Maloney himself, said spokeswoman Betsy Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money is owed to Jim Maloney, where it came from to begin
with,'' Arnold said. As an individual, Maloney is entitled to loan
money to his own campaign, Arnold added.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold called Nielsen a ''hypocrite'' for filing the complaint
on the same day he was traveling to Washington, D.C. to attend a
fund-raiser sponsored by a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold also charged that Nielsen wanted to distract attention
from a Democratic complaint that his campaign headquarters has a
''sweetheart deal'' with its Watertown landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, Mark Nielsen has taken his campaign outside the
5th District in an effort to avoid talking about issues that matter
to our families,'' Arnold said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen called the complaint about his headquarters groundless.
The Washington fund-raiser, by the Associated Builders and
Contractors, is expected to bring in about $20,000, Nielsen's
campaign said.

<HEADLINE> Deutch Investigation On Hold  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon chose not to immediately pursue
indications that John Deutch had mishandled secret information
while serving there, because the computers on which he stored the
data were in the CIA's possession, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was all about a potential compromise of classified
information on computers that we did not have in our possession,''
Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said. ''It's not clear
to me how we would have proceeded without reinventing a lot of the
effort that CIA investigators were doing at the very same time
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the Pentagon did not begin its own probe until
February 2000, when the CIA provided the results of its
investigation into Deutch's handling of classified information
during his tenure at the spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the spy agency's probe focused on Deutch's actions
while CIA director, from May 1995 to December 1996. Deutch moved to
the CIA from the Pentagon, where he was undersecretary of defense
for acquisition and later the deputy defense secretary, a post with
extensive responsibilities for intelligence matters.
</P>
<P>
   In June and July 1998, the CIA alerted the Pentagon that Deutch
had kept classified defense information on his personal computers
while he served at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, Pentagon officials cooperated with
CIA investigators regarding defense information that Deutch had
access to while CIA director, but the Pentagon did not begin its
own investigation until last February, Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's intent was to ''take a look in a very
comprehensive way at what CIA's investigators have been working so
hard on for this roughly year and a half,'' Quigley said. To have
begun an independent investigation earlier, focusing on Deutch's
years at the Pentagon, would have been duplicative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said he could not estimate when the Pentagon's
investigation will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Defense Department documents allege that Deutch
mishandled secret intelligence and military information by creating
documents and journal entries on computers, floppy disks and memory
cards at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch has apologized for his behavior. He now teaches at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<HEADLINE> Intruder Arrested at White House  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An intruder was arrested at the White House
guest residence during last week's state visit of Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Secret Service said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Dipal Pandya, was discovered Saturday night at Blair
House, the historic home across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White
House where official guests are lodged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister was not in the residence at the time. He
was never in any danger,'' said Secret Service spokesman Marc
Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee was attending a reception elsewhere in Washington at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Pandya was ever inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly would provide no further details or comment on how
Pandya managed to evade tight security around Blair House. He also
would not comment on whether similar breaches have occurred before.
</P>
<P>
   Pandya, 27, also refused to discuss details of the incident but
denied Indian media reports that he was caught in the prime
minister's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't anywhere close to any bedroom or any house for that
matter,'' Pandya said in a telephone interview from his home in
Mattawan, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Pandya, who said he works in the computer software industry,
would not say why he came to Blair House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very innocent. There was no harm to anyone or intended
harm to anyone,'' Pandya said. ''It was a very simple thing, and it
was turned into a big, massive affair for me which caused a lot of
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Pandya was charged with unlawful entry and appeared Monday in
U.S. District Court, said Channing Phillips, spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Pandya was released on recognizance, and a trial is scheduled
Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents give no indication that Pandya was armed.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service controls access to the White House complex,
of which Blair House is part. When a visiting head of state is
staying at Blair House, the Secret Service typically blockades the
sidewalk in front of Blair House, and an adjacent street. Public
vehicle traffic is already excluded from Pennsylvania Avenue in
front of the White House and Blair House.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee ended his visit Monday.

<HEADLINE> Judge rules against city in battle over benefits for AIDS victims  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge has ruled that the city
mistreated poor people with AIDS by subjecting them to bureaucratic
mismanagement and delays in housing, health and other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In a 97-page decision handed down Monday, U.S. District Judge
Sterling Johnson found that officials violated the Americans with
Disabilities Act by ''chronically and systematically failing to
provide (AIDS patients) with meaningful access to critical
subsistence benefits and services.'' He called the consequences
''devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ordered the city Division of AIDS Services to comply
with rules mandating that applications for benefits be processed
within 30 days. He appointed a federal magistrate to monitor the
agency over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also found that state officials failed to review the
city's administration of benefits and services, as required by
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ''This a tremendous victory for people living with AIDS in New
York,'' plaintiff attorney Armen Merjian said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   City officials had no immediate comment. A spokesman for state
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer declined comment, saying Spitzer's
office had not received a copy of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The opinion stems from a class-action lawsuit filed in Brooklyn
federal court on behalf of 25,000 plaintiffs citywide who have AIDS
or other HIV-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's ruling detailed testimony - heard earlier this year at
a bench trial - by plaintiffs who described getting the run-around
from the Division for AIDS Services for months, if not years. One
55-year-old man, Henry Bradley, said he was denied access to
thousands of dollars in medical benefits for two years - an ordeal
that caused his fingernails and teeth to fall out.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics cited by Johnson showed that in one out of three
cases, the city failed to meet its own 30-day deadline for
responding to requests for services.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thousands of people have been tremendously mistreated by the
very agency charged with assisting them,'' said Merjian, a staff
lawyer for Housing Works, Inc., an AIDS service organization.
''This is no small bureaucratic glitch. It's a series of
life-threatening violations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Division of AIDS Services was formed in 1985 to help AIDS
victims get welfare, home heath care, housing and other benefits.
Since then, activists have clashed with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over
his attempts to overhaul the agency by cutting staff and shifting
services to churches and community groups.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Rod McGeoch, who led the Sydney 2000
bid to host the Olympics, is hospitalized with encephalitis, an
inflammation of the brain, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said that McGeoch was admitted to a private
hospital last weekend. He had run a section of the torch relay in
Australia's Victoria state last week but hasn't been able to take
part in any other Olympic festivities.
</P>
<P>
   McGeoch resigned from the board of the Sydney Organizing
Committee for the Olympic Gamesand lost his role in games
preparation late in 1998 after questions were raised over how his
business life might have affected his SOCOG role.

   IN THE DARK: Two miners' lanterns that carried the Olympic
flame from Athens to Sydney's Olympic Stadium have disappeared, and
police fear they may have been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   The two lanterns contained backup flames for the Olympic torch
and had been closely guarded around the clock during the 100-day
torch tour of Australia. They were used to light the Olympic torch
on several occasions when the flame went out.
</P>

   Brian Dale, an organizing commitee torch relay spokesman, said
the lanterns disappeared on the night of the opening ceremony
Friday.

   SOCCER UN-HOOLIGANS: If only other soccer fans were like the

   Some 400 supporters waited for the players to arrive for their
Olympic game against Slovakia at Canberra's Bruce Stadium. A bus
pulled up and the Slovak players trooped off.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of spitting, jeering and insulting their team's
opponents, the Japanese fans began to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know any English or German fans but I've heard about
their reputation,'' said Yuji Tamade, a 22-year-old bank clerk from
Osaka. ''I don't know why they do the things they do. It's not in
our nature to behave like that at soccer games.
</P>
<P>
   ''We respect our opponents and we applaud their fans. Surely,
that's how it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese team also behaved as it should, edging Slovakia 2-1

faces Brazil in Brisbane on Wednesday, needing just a point to gain

<HEADLINE> Operators of janitorial firm admit evading more than $500,000 in taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - The operators of a politically connected
janitorial firm admitted Tuesday to evading hundreds of thousands
of dollars in federal payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ebon Services International Inc., of Newark, had contracts with
businesses and agencies in northern New Jersey and New York City,
primarily the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, but also
the city of Newark and the U.S. Veterans Administration, now called
Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Those agencies and their officials are not accused of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment handed up in August 1998 said Ebon's
principals evaded nearly $1 million in taxes and penalties, then
sought to conceal the company's assets by making scores of small
transactions totaling nearly $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea bargain reached with prosecutors, Ebon chairman
James E. Felton Jr., 67, of South Orange; his daughter, Cynthia
Ramsey, 34, of South Orange; and Scarlett Bradley, 49, of
Irvington, agreed that the tax loss was between $550,000 and
$950,000.
</P>
<P>
   Felton's wife, Elizabeth, 60, pleaded guilty to bankruptcy
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment outlined a complex scheme to evade paying certain
payroll taxes to the Internal Revenue Service, beginning in the
late 1980s and continuing into the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ebon failed to pay the IRS the ''withholding taxes'' - some
income, Social Security and Medicare taxes - it took from its
employees gross pay, and also did not pay the matching amount and
unemployment taxes for each worker, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebon employees, who never saw the money and apparently thought
it was paid, are credited with having paid it and are not liable,
the U.S. attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The case reportedly stemmed from the prosecution of Jackie
Mattison, a former state assemblyman and chief of staff for Newark
Mayor Sharpe James. Mattison was convicted of accepting bribes from
Bradley's husband, Bill, an insurance broker, in exchange for
lucrative city contracts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Mattison, then still working for the city, lobbied city
council members to approve a tax abatement for a corporation
controlled by Felton, a longtime confidante of James, according to
The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the council rejected a James administration
bid to forgive more than 80 percent of two city loans Felton had
defaulted on, the newspaper said. The loans were among several
extended to Felton in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS attempted to collect the money from Ebon by issuing
levies on its customers, allowing the IRS to get money the customer
would be paying to Ebon, the indictment said. It issued levies on
the city of Newark and the Port Authority in October 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to conceal Ebon funds from the IRS, its operators
falsely told the tax agency that the company had gone out of
business in 1992, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Ebon actually operated until at least Dec. 31, 1993, through a
paper company, QEM Enterprises Inc., incorporated Nov. 12, 1991, in
the name of Cynthia Ramsey, even though she was not married at the
time and was then known as Cynthia Felton, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The operators then solicited and got business for QEM from some
Ebon customers by making it appear as if Ebon was no longer
operating, evading the IRS levies, the indictment said.

<HEADLINE> Warship named after submarine safety pioneer Charles Momsen  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROTON, Conn. (AP) - U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Charles Momsen, who
pioneered ways to rescue submariners in underwater disasters, will
be honored with a warship in his name.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Momsen, a destroyer, is scheduled to be christened in
2007, U.S. Navy Secretary Richard Danzig announced Tuesday at the
Nautilus submarine museum.
</P>
<P>
   Among the honored guests at the announcement were survivors of
the 1939 sinking of the submarine Squalus off the coast of New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Momsen led the rescue of 33 Squalus crew members and helped
develop devices to rescue sailors trapped in stricken submarines,
including the ''Momsen lung,'' a submarine escape breathing device.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an honor long delayed,'' said Squalus survivor
Carl Bryson of New London, who said he owes his life to Momsen's
work.
</P>
<P>
   Momsen's granddaughter, Helen Hart Momsen, said the family hopes
the USS Momsen ''would serve in compassionate peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Danzig said the Navy is honoring Momsen as a Navy leader,
scientist, visionary and a man of action, as well as for his
compassion in trying to find ways to make submarines more safe.
</P>
<P>
   ''He saw a problem he cared deeply about, and he committed
himself to dealing with it,'' Danzig said.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is unusual for the Navy to name a surface ship after
someone best known for submarine work, but he added that the ship's
name will remind sailors in ships and in submarines that there is
one Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Momsen's submarine safety work, he commanded an attack
group of submarines in the East China Sea during World War II that
sank five Japanese ships and damaged eight others.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he directed a fleet of surplus ships that
evacuated Japanese from Pacific islands.
</P>
<P>
   He later was commander of the submarine force of the Pacific
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Momsen retired in 1955 and died in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Momsen will be the 42nd ship of the Arleigh Burke class
of guided missile destroyers.

<HEADLINE> Mastectomy store to return one-breasted sculptures to shop windows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   METUCHEN, N.J. (AP) - The owner of a store that caters to women
who have undergone breast cancer surgery will return sculptures of
one-breasted women to the shop's windows Wednesday morning after
local officials backed off their criticism of the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a complaint from an anonymous resident, Metuchen
police visited the Women's Health Boutique on Monday and asked the
owner, Nancy Graf to remove the sculptures from the window.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief James Keane said the woman was concerned that her
young son passed the store and saw sculptures of nude women.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are part of an art exhibit called ''Lila's Breast''
dramatizing the impact of breast cancer on women. It was conceived
by Robbinsville resident Ann Hutton to memorialize her mother,
Lila, who died of the disease at age 42. She recruited amateur
models, about half of whom had undergone mastectomies, to pose for
plaster casts of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint to Metuchen officials came to the borough's zoning
office, which referred it to police, Keane said.
</P>
<P>
   Although a detective went to the store and asked Graf to remove
the sculptures from her window, Keane said the artwork ''clearly is
not obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be taken as offensive to some people, but not to the
police department,'' he said. ''In retrospect, it would have been
better if we didn't go down there at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief said if Graf had refused to remove the sculptures from
her windows, ''there wouldn't have been anything we could do about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf said she plans to return the sculptures to the store
windows Wednesday morning, adding she's gratified by the show of
support she has received from cancer survivors and others.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel badly (the woman who complained) didn't use this as an
opportunity to educate her child about breast cancer rather than
overreacting,'' she said. ''These sculptures represent more than
art in a store window. Behind every one of them is a real human
being who has gone through cancer.''

<HEADLINE> Bad Gums, Bad Heart Seen Linked  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Floss-haters, take heart.
</P>
<P>
   A new study rebuts evidence suggesting that gum disease may lead
to heart trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean gums shouldn't be attended to by floss and
brush. But the results question theories stemming from a growing
area of research into the relationships among infection,
inflammation and many diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the new study does not settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Previous researchers have suggested that bacteria in the mouths
of people with gum disease may create heart problems by causing
clots to form in coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Others have theorized that substances released by the body in
response to infection may also cause plaque buildup in arteries
when the process -- known as the inflammatory response -- drags on
indefinitely, as happens in chronic infections such as gum disease.
</P>
<P>
   The theories have led some to reason that vigilant flossing and
brushing could prevent not only gum disease but also heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead author of the latest study, published in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, says his
findings don't support that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no evidence that any dental treatment will have a
positive impact on chronic coronary heart disease, said researcher
Philippe Hujoel, an associate professor at the University of
Washington's dentistry school.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any link between gum disease and heart problems,
it's either ''very small or very hard to reliably detect,'' Hujoel
said.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the U.S. adult population has either
reversible gum disease, known as gingivitis, or periodontitis --
advanced disease affecting the tissue and bone that support the
teeth. Heart disease -- the nation's leading killer -- affects an
estimated 12 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Mangan, chief of infectious diseases and immunity at the
National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, said the
study ''could change the way we take a look at this link between
infectious disease and cardiovascular disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mangan said the study doesn't prove there is no
connection and noted that upcoming University of North Carolina
research suggests a link between heart disease and gum disease
exists in women, but not men.
</P>
<P>
   The contradictory findings ''highlight the importance of
continued investment in research in this area,'' said Dr. Sidney
Smith, an American Heart Association spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Hujoel and colleagues examined data on 8,032 adults aged 25 to
74 who participated in a national health study from 1982 to 1992.
No participant had a history of heart disease but about half had
mild or advanced gum disease.
</P>
<P>
   During the study, 1,265 had at least one ''coronary heart
disease event,'' including heart attacks, heart bypass surgery and
hospitalization for heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Those with gum disease were all much more likely to be
low-income, black, older and overweight. They also tended to suffer
diabetes and high blood pressure, and to smoke cigarettes and drink
alcohol -- all heart disease risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   While they also were more likely than those with healthy gums to
develop heart disease, the link evaporated when the researchers
factored in the other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Hujoel said previous studies failed to control for the
cardiovascular risk factors prevalent among people with gum
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Herzberg of the University of Minnesota, whose research
has found a gum disease-heart disease connection, said his findings
remain ''biologically possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new study shows other risk factors should not be
discounted and give researchers ''more guidance in the design of
future studies.''

<HEADLINE> Committee Hears Cuba Embargo Debate  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once Cuba was a main consumer of American
rice. And it could be again -- if only the 38-year embargo on the
communist island were lifted, a rice industry official told a
federal panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only real winners from these sanctions are the suppliers
of lower quality rice elsewhere in the world,'' said Richard E.
Bell of the USA Rice Federation. ''The big losers are the U.S. rice
industry and the Cuban consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   What would happen to the U.S. and Cuban economies if the
sanctions ended was the focus of a hearing before the U.S.
International Trade Commission, an independent, nonpartisan federal
agency. The hearing was part of a study the agency is preparing at
the request of the House Ways and Means Committee on the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 witnesses over two days, the hearing is one of the
biggest public forums held in Washington on the sanctions. It comes
as momentum grows in Congress for easing the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report, due Feb. 15, won't offer an opinion on
whether the sanctions should continue. But most speakers at the
hearing did, debating whether it hurts Fidel Castro's communist
government, innocent Cubans -- or U.S. businesses that miss out on
opportunities for trade.
</P>
<P>
   Bell said that before the sanctions were imposed in 1962, Cuba
was the largest export market for U.S. rice. If the embargo were
lifted and rice consumption, which has been diminishing, returned
to normal levels, Cuba could import up to 600,000 tons a year,
mostly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the equivalent of 20 percent of annual rice
imports in recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But embargo supporters say U.S. business interests don't justify
ending the embargo. They say the Cuban economy is so weak, it would
have little money to import U.S. products. They also claim that
Cuba has been unreliable in its trade with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions ''promote U.S. economic security and serve to
protect American business interests and the nation's economy from
the illegal, corrupt, command control, failed economic practices of
Cuba's communist regime,'' said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Even if there was money to be made in Cuba, sanction supporters
said that should not be the basis of easing the pressure on the
Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is the belief of U.S. policy that it is as immoral as it is
unacceptable to simply stand by and allow one of our closest
neighbors to languish unendingly under a brutal dictatorship run by
a psychopath and conduct business as usual,'' said Rep. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republicans objected to the presence at the hearing of
Fernando Remirez, head of the Cuban Interests Section.
</P>
<P>
   Remirez highlighted how the Cuban economy has been recovering
since the widespread shortages that followed the collapse of its
ally, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo, he said, was always unjustified. But with the end
of the Cold War, ''it has even run out of pretexts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a world where the 21st century has arrived, where
integration and globalization provide the conditions to work, a
policy of embargo is absolutely out of place,'' he said.

Senate OKs China Trade Bill

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate approved permanent normal trade status for
China, marking a turning point in a half-century of stormy relations between the
world's strongest power and the most-populous nation. The vote effectively ends
the annual debate over whether trade should be used as a tool to sanction
China's communist government for its weapons and human rights policies. It also
sets the stage for China market-opening measures that could mean billions of
dollars in new business for American manufacturers and farmers.

authorities said. One person was killed and nine were rescued, the Coast Guard

possibly on board the plane continued. It was not clear if the plane, which is
able to land on water, had crashed or landed after running out of fuel.

   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim guerrillas continued to elude thousands

Thousands of civilians fled from the sporadic clashes on remote Jolo island, and
thousands of others were trapped inside a tight military blockade of rebel
areas, refugees said. President Joseph Estrada said he would only halt the
four-day assault if the Abu Sayyaf rebels free all their captives, including six
foreigners.

Carla Del Ponte said investigators were in fact preparing to expand Milosevic's
indictment for war crimes in Kosovo to include atrocities during the 1992-95
Bosnian War and genocide. Milosevic, who is seeking re-election as Yugoslav
president on Sunday, was indicted last year for ordering war crimes against
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo before NATO's 78-day air campaign drove Yugoslav

endorsement deals he has with 11 companies, according to this week's issue of
Golf World. The magazine cited a variety of sources familiar with the contracts,
which range from the $100 million deal Woods signed Friday with Nike to a
five-year, $10 million deal with the company that performed Lasik eye surgery on
Woods a year ago. On the course, Woods already has earned close to $8.3 million
this year with three tournaments still to play.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer Mathews Still Ill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eddie Mathews has not made much progress in
battling a heart problem that hospitalized him more than three
weeks ago, according to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't gotten worse, but he hasn't improved, basically
that's what the doctor said two days ago,'' Judy Mathews said from
the family home in Del Mar, Calif. ''He has a lung infection, he's
still in intensive care, runs a fever on and off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like it's going to be a long recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   One of 16 players in major league history to hit 500 home runs,
Mathews has been hospitalized since Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mathews took her 68-year-old husband to the emergency room
at Scripps Green Hospital in La Jolla after he had trouble
breathing, and he was diagnosed with a heart problem.
</P>
<P>
   A third baseman, Mathews played 17 big league seasons. He was
the only person to play with the Braves in Boston, Milwaukee and
Atlanta, and was a member of three World Series teams -- two with
the Braves and one with the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   Mathews hit 512 homers -- tied for 13th on baseball's career list
with Ernie Banks -- and batted .271 with 1,453 RBIs. He also played
for Houston and Detroit before retiring in 1968, and later managed
the Braves in part of the 1972 season, all of 1973 and part of
1974.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves China Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted Tuesday to permanently
normalize trade with China, opening the world's most populous
nation to American products, services and ideas about capitalism
and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The 83-15 vote, sending the bill to President Clinton for his
signature, represents the biggest step in U.S.-China relations
since President Nixon's 1972 visit to the Great Wall and ends the
divisive annual debates over U.S. trade policy toward the Communist
country.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, those arguing that the United States must do more to
bring China's communist government into the international community
prevailed over critics warning that Congress was putting profits
ahead of principle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will find, I believe America has far more influence in
China with an outstretched hand than with a clenched fist,''
Clinton said after the Senate vote. ''The more China opens its
markets to our products, the wider it opens its doors to economic
freedom and the more fully it will liberate the potential of its
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed PNTR, or the permanent normal trade relations
bill, last May. The legislation, backed by a powerful coalition of
business and farm groups, was hailed by Clinton as one of the most
important events in U.S.-Chinese relations since Nixon reopened
contacts for the first time since Mao Tse-tung brought the
communists to power in China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   ''This historic legislation will be remembered as the key that
opened the door for America to sell its products and services to
the world's largest emerging marketplace,'' said Robert Burt,
chairman of The Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   The bill revises a 1974 law under which trade relations with
communist states are subject to annual review. Since the 1989
crackdown on the Tiananmen democracy movement, congressional
critics of China have made concerted, if unsuccessful, efforts
every year to rescind normal trade status because of Beijing's
human rights and weapons proliferation abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The bill to make trade relations permanent is an outgrowth of a
U.S.-China agreement last fall under which China, as a condition
for entering the World Trade Organization, made major concessions
in reducing tariffs and opening its markets. China is expected to
join the WTO later this year or early next year, and the United
States, in order to enjoy the benefits of China's commitment to WTO
free market rules, must grant permanent trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., stressed that it will still be up to
Americans to take advantage of new market opportunities. ''Passage
of PNTR will be one for the history books, of profound implication
to the United States, but once it passes then we Americans have to
put our shoulders to the wheel, we have to follow up.''
</P>
<P>
   With WTO entry, China's tariffs on U.S. made manufactured goods
would fall from an overall average of 25 percent to 9 percent by
2005. Duties on America's primary food products would drop from 31
percent to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   China would be required to open its financial and service
industries to American companies, allow greater outside ownership
in its telecommunications industry and allow Americans full
distribution rights within the country.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture exports alone could grow by some $2 billion a year,
helping reduce China's current $68 billion trade surplus with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to be the first ones here. This has big potential
for agriculture states like North Dakota,'' said North Dakota Gov.
Ed Schafer, chairman of the Republican Governors Association, in a
call from Beijing where he is heading a state trade delegation.
Under the pact, he said, China must increase its quota of
tariff-free wheat imports fivefold to 350 million bushels a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''One out of eight jobs in Illinois depends upon exports and
passage of this critical measure means that Congress' vote will
impact the lives of 600,000 Illinoisans and their families,'' said
Illinois Gov. George Ryan, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But others questioned the wisdom of giving up trade as a policy
tool for forcing China toward more responsible behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that we will deeply regret this stampede to pass
this legislation and the way in which we have taken all the human
rights, religious freedom, right to organize, all of those concerns
and we just put them in parentheses, put them in brackets, as if
they don't exist,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation calls for setting up a congressional-executive
commission to monitor human rights in China and creates a so-called
surge mechanism to help American industries and workers hurt by an
increase in Chinese imports.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Army Launches Pro-Education Ads  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army, one of the nation's largest
employers of youth, joined with the Advertising Council on Tuesday
to launch a three-year public service ad campaign to encourage
students to complete their schooling.
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, in partnership with the Department of
Education, focuses on teens ages 12 to 14 and encourages them to
stay in school regardless of the personal obstacles they face, such
as dysfunctional families.
</P>
<P>
   Army Secretary Louis Caldera said the Army's involvement is not
related to recruiting for its ranks. He said it addresses the
Army's long-term interest in promoting education among all sectors
of society.
</P>
<P>
   The Army will invest between $1.5 million and $2 million a year
in the three-year ad campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It reinforces the message that the Army is committed to
American youth,'' Caldera told a Pentagon news conference.

<HEADLINE> Russian Journalist Trial Date Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian authorities have set a trial date for a
correspondent for U.S.-funded Radio Liberty, whose arrest in
January helped draw international attention to Russia's treatment
of civilian prisoners in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Babitsky said Tuesday that he had been told the trial
would be held Oct. 2 in the town of Makhachkala in the southern
Russian region of Dagestan, adjacent to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Interior Ministry accused Babitsky of knowingly using
false documents. If convicted, he faces up to two years in a labor
camp. He denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney and the judge in the case agreed on the trial date,
but it could change, Babitsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky was detained in January by Russian agents in the
breakaway republic of Chechnya for not having proper accreditation
after he reported on the war from the rebel side, angering the
Russian military.
</P>
<P>
   Babitsky was held for two weeks in a detention center in
Chechnya, where he said he saw prisoners tortured by Russian
police. He then disappeared for weeks, causing co-workers to say
they feared the military had killed him.
</P>
<P>
   He resurfaced in Russian custody in February and was eventually
released on condition that he not leave Moscow. A travel ban was
later lifted.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Re-Sign LB Keith Burns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- The Denver Broncos re-signed linebacker
Keith Burns on Tuesday after making room for him on the roster by
waiving linebacker Steve Russ.
</P>
<P>
   Burns played for the Broncos from 1994-98 before going to the
Chicago Bears, who waived him during training camp this year.
</P>
<P>
   Burns, drafted in the seventh round from Oklahoma State in 1994,
has 63 tackles, one interception and 1&AMP;frac12; sacks in his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Russ, Denver's seventh-round draft pick in 1994, played two
seasons with the Broncos. He spent the 1995 and 1996 seasons on the
military reserve list so he could complete his Air Force
commitment.

<HEADLINE> Intruder Arrested at Blair House  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An intruder was arrested at the White House
guest residence during last week's state visit of Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Secret Service said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Dipal Pandya, was discovered Saturday night at Blair
House, the historic home across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White
House where official guests are lodged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister was not in the residence at the time. He
was never in any danger,'' said Secret Service spokesman Marc
Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee was attending a reception elsewhere in Washington at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Pandya was ever inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly would provide no further details or comment on how
Pandya managed to evade tight security around Blair House. He also
would not comment on whether similar breaches have occurred before.
</P>
<P>
   Pandya, 27, also refused to discuss details of the incident but
denied Indian media reports that he was caught in the prime
minister's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't anywhere close to any bedroom or any house for that
matter,'' Pandya said in a telephone interview from his home in
Mattawan, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Pandya, who said he works in the computer software industry,
would not say why he came to Blair House.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very innocent. There was no harm to anyone or intended
harm to anyone,'' Pandya said. ''It was a very simple thing, and it
was turned into a big, massive affair for me which caused a lot of
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Pandya was charged with unlawful entry and appeared Monday in
U.S. District Court, said Channing Phillips, spokesman for the U.S.
attorney's office in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Pandya was released on recognizance, and a trial is scheduled
Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents give no indication that Pandya was armed.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service controls access to the White House complex,
of which Blair House is part. When a visiting head of state is
staying at Blair House, the Secret Service typically blockades the
sidewalk in front of Blair House, and an adjacent street. Public
vehicle traffic is already excluded from Pennsylvania Avenue in
front of the White House and Blair House.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee ended his visit Monday.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules Gov't Deserves Money  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A Philippine court ruled Tuesday that
nearly $627 million in Swiss bank deposits belonging to the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos should go to the government, saying he
and his family could not have amassed that much money legally.
</P>
<P>
   If the government obtains the money, it would be the largest
amount ever recovered from the billions of dollars Marcos and his
wife Imelda are alleged to have amassed during his 20 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basis of this decision is that the amount was grossly
disproportionate to the salaries of the Marcos couple during the
period of their incumbencies,'' said Justice Catalino Castaneda Jr.
of the anti-graft Sandiganbayan court.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore ''there is prima facie presumption that that was
unlawfully acquired,'' Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the presumption can be disputed, the Marcos family did
not present evidence that the funds were legally acquired and even
said the money didn't belong to Marcos, Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judgment is hereby granted in favor of the Republic of the
Philippines and against respondents, declaring the Swiss deposits
... forfeited in favor of the state,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos served as president from 1966 until he was ousted in a
popular revolt in February 1986. He and his family were driven into
exile in Hawaii, where he died three years later without admitting
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The court determined that the combined salaries of Marcos and
his wife, who served as governor of metropolitan Manila and as
minister of human settlements, were equivalent to only $304,300
over the 20-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss bank deposits amounted to about $356 million when they
were discovered shortly after Marcos was toppled. Interest payments
have increased that to about $627 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has ruled that the money can be
released to the Philippine government if Imelda Marcos is convicted
of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the deposits, and if
victims of human rights violations during Marcos' administration
are compensated.
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-court settlement with the Marcoses could also free the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers claim that winning a case showing that the
money could not have been legally acquired by the Marcoses will
meet the Swiss court's conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Marcos family can appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court
within 15 days.

<HEADLINE> Nader seeking New York's Independence Party nomination  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Consumer advocate and Green Party
presidential candidate Ralph Nader is seeking the November ballot
line of New York's arm of the national Reform Party, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's campaign manager, Theresa Amato, said he became
interested in running on the New York Independence Party line after
its state party officials reached out to him and suggested the
possibility in August. She said the New York officials seemed
''eager'' to consider Nader for their presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   After an early infatuation with Reform Party candidate Patrick
Buchanan, New York's Independence Party leaders have balked at
having the conservative commentator as their standard-bearer. Even
so, Buchanan has already qualified for the New York ballot where he
will appear as the Buchanan-Reform candidate. He is the candidate
of one faction of the national Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Nader had been campaigning as the Green Party candidate in
recent months. One leader of the Green Party in New York said he
was concerned that an Independence Party candidacy by Nader might
hurt the Greens.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Independence Party has the third ballot slot,
right after the Republican and Democratic parties. Green Party
candidates come much further down the ballot, in the seventh spot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would end up hurting a lot of Green Party candidates across
the state,'' said Mark Dunlea, a Green Party leader and a candidate
for state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlea said he fears Nader supporters will vote for him on the
Independence Party line and never get down to the Green Party spot.
</P>
<P>
   Amato dismissed those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who want to vote Green will vote Green. People who
consider themselves Independents will vote for the Independence
Party,'' Amato said. ''That's true in any case where there's a
candidate running in multiple parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Independence Party officials will meet this weekend in Albany to
designate a presidential candidate who will appear on their party
line on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   State Chairman Frank MacKay has said that all leading
presidential candidates have been invited to make pitches for the
nomination. Amato said she will attend the Independence Party
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay said there is ''tremendous amount'' of support within his
party for Nader and urged him to come to the party's convention in
person, or at least have his vice presidential running mate, Winona
LaDuke, attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he came himself, it would be a slam dunk,'' MacKay said.
</P>
<P>
   The Independence Party in New York, much like the Reform Party
on the national level, has been plagued by infighting, with
factions backing separate candidates at different times.
</P>
<P>
   Amato said that besides seeking the Independence Party
nomination, Nader is also looking for the Liberal Party endorsement
in New York. It is expected to go to Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other states, New York allows candidates to run on
more than one ballot line and count all the votes from each line.

<HEADLINE> Opponents speak up at public hearing on Verizon rate proposal  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Consumer advocates geared up Tuesday to
voice strong opposition to Verizon Communications' argument that it
needs to double basic telephone rates in order to survive in a
deregulated market.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Public Utilities began a monthlong series of
hearings Monday to hear Verizon's petition to raise its
lowest-in-the-nation basic rate from $8.19 a month to as much as
$17.50, offering customers packages with built-in services like
caller ID and call-waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, which provides about 98 percent of the local telephone
service in New Jersey, has also asked the board to declare the
state an unregulated market so it can begin changing its prices.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors and consumer advocates have said the market is not
competitive because of the prohibitive cost of leasing Verizon's
telephone wires and computers needed to provide local telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the plan forces people to pay more for services
they don't want.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think that people should necessarily pay for things
that they've already rejected in the marketplace,'' said Anthony
Wright, program director for New Jersey Citizen Action.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Verizon president Dennis Bone testified that
providing local service to residential customers costs the company
$35.70 a month while it only receives $8.19, a rate that hasn't
changed since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Bone said the new packages, which range from $15 to $17.50 a
month, discount premium services while allowing Verizon, formerly
Bell Atlantic New Jersey, to offset losses on basic phone service.
</P>
<P>
   The $17.50 package includes unlimited local calling and 25
minutes of regional toll calling, while the two less expensive
plans charge 3 to 14 cents per minute for local calls of more than
five minutes or when calls exceed 25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said Verizon's claim that the basic rate is the lowest in
the nation is misleading because the premium services cost more
than in other states and telephone calls in New Jersey cross
shorter distances because the state is small and the most densely
populated
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. officials object to the plan to add 25 minutes of
free regional calling in one of the packages.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would take away the incentive for people to use AT&AMP;T or
other companies for that regional toll calling,'' spokesman Jon
Mellor said. ''It's anticompetitive in a nutshell.''

<HEADLINE> Fashion Week Springs Ahead with de la Renta, Tracy, BCBG and Hannant </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Oscar de la Renta was deep into ''panic time,
worse than ever'' late last week, but you would never have known it
at his Tuesday preview as spring Fashion Week forged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't expecting to see half of his collection until just
three days before the show, since manufacturing in Italy
necessitates shipping the clothes. Still, de la Renta's showing was
a seamless study in dozens of ways to wear opulent eveningwear,
from pink ostrich feather blouses to imposing, full-bodied pouf
skirts, so round and buoyant they just might require an extra
closet.
</P>
<P>
   Many items could be called show pieces, such as an orange suede
halter top bedecked with chunks of quartz, matched with his
sharp-pleated skirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a great sense of fantasy to my collection, especially
in evening,'' said de la Renta, who just for fun had shredded a
fabric on a cocktail dress to make it appear like long, loopy
feathers. ''It's in the way that some of the clothes are just
dreamy layers of tulle with embroidery. They're not dresses for
everybody, but they certainly make a woman dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection rounded out with pretty pieces, such as floral
embroidered pants with matching blouses, and some whimsical
oddments, like a safari jacket surprisingly paired with a white
evening skirt, completely covered in shimmy fringe. And there were
plenty of sexy, midriff-baring leather tops that might be just
right for well-toned audience members such as Sarah Jessica Parker
of ''Sex in the City.'' And would she wear Oscar's teeny, pleated
''tennis skirt,'' not much bigger than a tennis ball?
</P>
<P>
   If you ask, in the words of the song, ''Who wears short
shorts?'' the Ellen Tracy customer is probably not the first answer
that comes to mind. Yet at the Tuesday preview, abbreviated shorts
appeared in everything from gold or white pearlized leather to
black and white gingham, along with bare legs and high-heel
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks very modern and strong. It shows a lot of leg, but
it's quite a ladylike look because of the (3/4-length) jacket,''
says Ellen Tracy head designer Linda Allard. ''It's all about the
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard knows what's ladylike. The company caters mainly to
customers, such as Tipper Gore, who are typically career women. For
a more covered look, Allard sent out a slew of elongated, almost
knee-length jackets, most notably in zebra-print denim.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the fashion circuit, on Monday evening BCBG was up
at bat. The show is often popular as a reliable harbinger of the
season's trends. Down the runway came transparent fabrics that
flirted with bareness; A-line trench coats; metallic shine; prints
either floral or geometric; and soft shades from beige to pink and
light green. Everything seemed to be contained in the season's wrap
belt.
</P>
<P>
   A series of art deco, 20s-inspired looks caught the eye of
Hollywood celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch, front row with his
client Lauren Holly, who said she gravitated toward a brown beaded
sleeveless dress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The '20 dresses are so feminine and soft,'' said Bloch
backstage after the BCBG show. ''There's just a little
ornamentation, like new Hollywood, elegant but not too over the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the runways, Douglas Hannant presented a collection that
was fairly out of Africa, yet updated for the urban jungle. Safari
shirts and earth tones of brown suggested life on the plains,
though the look was modernized for the cosmopolitan traveler with
skirt slits higher than Mount Kilimanjaro. Safari pockets decorated
bustiers, safari shirts looked tantalizing thanks to peekaboo
holes, and ball skirts went natural in a treatment made of straw.
</P>
<P>
   Hannant, whose customers include Sharon Stone, Mila Jovovich,
Brooke Shields, Sigourney Weaver and Jane Seymour, said he wanted
to show ''the idea of my woman going to Africa and experiencing the
culture there.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court: Gov't Gets Money  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A Philippine court ruled Tuesday that
nearly $627 million in Swiss bank deposits belonging to the late
dictator Ferdinand Marcos should go to the government, saying he
and his family could not have amassed that much money legally.
</P>
<P>
   If the government obtains the money, it would be the largest
amount ever recovered from the billions of dollars Marcos and his
wife Imelda are alleged to have amassed during his 20 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basis of this decision is that the amount was grossly
disproportionate to the salaries of the Marcos couple during the
period of their incumbencies,'' said Justice Catalino Castaneda Jr.
of the anti-graft Sandiganbayan court.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore ''there is prima facie presumption that that was
unlawfully acquired,'' Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the presumption can be disputed, the Marcos family did
not present evidence that the funds were legally acquired and even
said the money didn't belong to Marcos, Castaneda said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Judgment is hereby granted in favor of the Republic of the
Philippines and against respondents, declaring the Swiss deposits
... forfeited in favor of the state,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos served as president from 1966 until he was ousted in a
popular revolt in February 1986. He and his family were driven into
exile in Hawaii, where he died three years later without admitting
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The court determined that the combined salaries of Marcos and
his wife, who served as governor of metropolitan Manila and as
minister of human settlements, were equivalent to only $304,300
over the 20-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss bank deposits amounted to about $356 million when they
were discovered shortly after Marcos was toppled. Interest payments
have increased that to about $627 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss Federal Supreme Court has ruled that the money can be
released to the Philippine government if Imelda Marcos is convicted
of criminal wrongdoing in connection with the deposits, and if
victims of human rights violations during Marcos' administration
are compensated.
</P>
<P>
   An out-of-court settlement with the Marcoses could also free the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers claim that winning a case showing that the
money could not have been legally acquired by the Marcoses will
meet the Swiss court's conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Marcos family can appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court
within 15 days.

<HEADLINE> Woods, Duval To Play in World Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Tiger Woods has selected David
Duval as his partner for the World Cup in December, putting
together the players who are No. 1 and No. 3 in the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Woods could choose his partner because he is No. 1 in the world.
The only other time he and Duval were paired in match play, Lee
Westwood and Darren Clarke defeated them 1-up in a best-ball match
on the first day of the Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Woods won the World Cup last year in Malaysia while playing with
good friend Mark O'Meara, when it was a stroke play event in which
both scores counted. Woods had a 21-under 263, while O'Meara had a
282 in their five-stroke victory over Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup, sponsored by EMC, is now part of the World Golf
Championships, and will feature two rounds of best ball and two
rounds of alternate shot.
</P>
<P>
   It will be played Dec. 7-10 at Buenos Aires Golf Club in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Duval is recovering from back problems. He withdrew in the first
round of The International in August and has not completed a
tournament since he and Woods were paired together in the final
round of the British Open, which Woods won by eight strokes to
complete the Grand Slam.

<HEADLINE> Gorbachev Opens Exhibit About Wife  </HEADLINE>
By NICK WADHAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- With tears in his eyes, former Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev on Tuesday opened a museum exhibit about his
wife, Raisa, calling her a willful and intelligent companion who
struggled for women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before touring the exhibit, which opened just before the
anniversary of Raisa Gorbachev's death from leukemia last year,
Gorbachev said he appreciated the sympathy he received during his
wife's illness, despite Russia's turmoil and the suspicion with
which she was regarded by many Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand how hard it is for people now, and in this
situation people found the strength, the moral strength, to pay so
much attention to Raisa, and I'm thankful for that,'' he said
tearfully.
</P>
<P>
   The small exhibit emphasized how Gorbachev's wife broke the mold
in Soviet society, where leaders' wives had stuck to the
background, and public elegance was considered an extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   She adopted Western fashion and played a prominent role next to
her husband, even though many Soviet citizens disliked her for it.
On display were pictures of her with Nancy Reagan, both in fur
coats, and next to her husband consoling survivors from a
devastating 1988 earthquake in Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could say that only with the arrival of (Raisa Gorbachev)
was the idea of a first lady created in the Soviet Union,'' said
Tamara Shumnaya, director of the Museum of Contemporary Russian
History, which is holding the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit featured a few pictures from Raisa Gorbachev's early
life and highlighted the work she did as first lady, when she
helped establish a cultural fund and raised money for sick
children.
</P>
<P>
   There were also curious pieces, like a giant music box the size
of a suitcase given to her during a visit to Japan, and portraits
of her and her husband painted on two dried leaves -- a gift from
India.
</P>
<P>
   The elegance and style that brought her the suspicion of many in
her country won Raisa Gorbachev admiration in the West, and she
helped bring a human face to the people living on the other side of
the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a breakthrough for our society,'' said First Deputy
Minister of Culture Natalya Dementyeva. ''We were the Evil Empire,
and she brought that image down.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, resentment toward Gorbachev's wife waned once she was
hospitalized in Germany last July. The exhibit displayed a few of
the letters that poured in from Russians around the country, as
well as get-well cards from children in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''After she died, people understood her contribution to
history,'' said Nina Fetisova, a museum visitor. ''It is
unfortunate it didn't happen during her lifetime.''

<HEADLINE> 20 Arrested After Ivory Coast Clash  </HEADLINE>
By AMBA DADSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- At least 20 soldiers have been
arrested after what the government described as an attempt to
assassinate Ivory Coast's junta leader, an army official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A tense calm hung over the commercial capital Tuesday and banks
and schools were open after being hastily closed the day before.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 arrested soldiers were being held for allegedly
attempting to assassinate military leader Gen. Robert Guei on
Monday, an army official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the government had ''concrete proof'' of the
assailants' plans to overthrow Guei, but refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
   Some civilians have questioned the military regime's repeated
claims that Guei's political rivals are plotting to overthrow the
government. A few even question whether the gunfire was staged by
the regime as an excuse to clamp down on its enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Several Abidjan newspapers reported Tuesday the soldiers were
members of the presidential guard unit that handles Guei's personal
security. That could not be independently confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Guei said Monday that restive elements attacked his home but
were repelled. Two presidential bodyguards were killed and at least
four soldiers seriously injured in the exchange of fire, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire came amid growing tensions in the military and
deepening political and ethnic divisions ahead of Oct. 22
presidential elections set to return the country to civilian rule.
Guei has declared himself a candidate in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Since Guei took over in a coup last December, Ivorian soldiers
have mutinied twice over perks and pay. They were promised large
bonuses for supporting the coup, but the bonuses have only been
partially paid and different amounts were given to different units.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions also have been flaring in recent days over whether
Alassane Dramane Ouattara, a popular opposition leader, will be
allowed to run in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Until the December coup, Ivory Coast had long been considered a
bastion of stability in an unstable region.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights organization Amnesty International released a
report Tuesday lashing out at the Ivorian junta, saying some
soldiers consider themselves above the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Military groups have put into place a parallel justice system
that has marginalized the legal judicial system, killing, sometimes
in public, presumed offenders, using violence against lawyers and
arresting and mistreating journalists,'' the report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Among its charges, the Amnesty delegation, which toured Ivory
Coast in May, specifically noted a series of raids on the village
of Daoukro, the hometown of former President Henri Konan Bedie,
where numerous witnesses described soldiers ''beating and
torturing'' people in an attempt to get back the goods and money
they felt had been stolen by the Bedie regime.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Foil Kosovo Bomb Plot  </HEADLINE>
By ELENA BECATOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO-led peacekeepers foiled a plot
to detonate a bomb in Kosovo, following a massive search Tuesday in
a Serb enclave outside the province's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of NATO-led peacekeepers swept into the Kosovo Serb
village of Gracanica, just outside the capital, Pristina, before
dawn, uncovering plastic explosives, weapons and detonators,
peacekeepers said.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were arrested, two of whom are believed to be
current or former members of the Yugoslav army's special forces
unit based in the southern Serbian town of Nis, the province's top
U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner said.
</P>
<P>
   All three were turned over to U.N. police and were being held in
the provincial capital Pristina. Six people were originally
detained, but three were later released, peacekeepers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very serious. It is an obvious attempt to destabilize
Kosovo and to target the democracy, peace and security of Kosovo,
and the world must know about it,'' Kouchner said. ''Be assured
that if others attempt to come to Kosovo, we will stop them too.''
</P>
<P>
   The gravity of the find was particularly troubling to Kosovo's
administrators, coming less than a week before upcoming
presidential elections in Yugoslavia on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials administering Kosovo decided to permit
balloting in the province, which is still officially part of
Yugoslavia even though Slobodan Milosevic's forces pulled out last
year after a 78-day alliance bombing campaign. The campaign forced
the Yugoslav president to end his crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities have reportedly said they will set up 300
polling stations around Kosovo. Although authorities in Kosovo say
they have not been informed on where they will be set up, Kouchner
said no public or municipal buildings may be used.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers will not prevent voting stations being set up in
churches or private homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Voting will occur mainly in Serb enclaves around the province,
as Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have said they will boycott the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's search involved some 300 British and Swedish
peacekeepers, who raided two houses and a bar. The search began at
midnight and lasted until just after dawn, said Brig. Robert Fry,
who heads peacekeepers in central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The find included three pounds of plastic explosives,
detonators, wiring, assorted ammunition, three pistols and an AK-47
assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purpose of the equipment we confiscated and the intention
of all three people detained ... was to create fear and intimidate
the people of Kosovo,'' said Lt. Gen. Juan Ortuno, commander of the
NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Military and civil authorities in Kosovo ''will not allow any
external or internal threat to undermine the stability of the
province,'' Ortuno said.

Senate OKs China Trade Bill

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today approved permanent normal trade status
for China, marking a turning point in a half-century of stormy relations with
the world's most-populous nation. The 83-15 vote, sending the bill to President
Clinton, was the biggest step in U.S.-China relations since President Nixon's
1972 visit. The vote effectively ends the annual debate over whether trade
should be used as a tool to sanction China's communist government for its

<HEADLINE> Lewis States Appeal to NFL Fine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis on
Tuesday appealed to the NFL his $250,000 fine for obstructing
justice in a murder case.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis stated his case to league officials in a conference call.
NFL Players Association spokesman Carl Francis said the appeal was
placed under review, and a decision will probably be announced
within a month.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was originally charged with murder in the death of two men
outside an Atlanta nightclub following a post-Super Bowl party in
January. The Pro Bowl linebacker ended his trial by pleading guilty
to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue levied what is
believed to be the highest fine in league history for an infraction
not involving substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue, in his ruling, said the fine was based on Lewis'
failure to tell police the full story, creating ''a public
perception that he had something to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In doing so,'' Tagliabue added, ''he put his own livelihood
and reputation needlessly at risk, and he caused great harm to
other NFL players and to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue also ruled that Lewis will be fined another $250,000
and be subject to suspension if he violates any of the terms of his
12-month probation.

<HEADLINE> Ad Backing GOP Shoots At Diversity  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A conservative group is airing TV ads urging
voters to support Republicans, featuring a woman who says she
pulled her son out of public school because there were drugs,
violence and ''a bit more diversity than he could handle.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad is running in Kansas City, Mo., where a bitter battle
over school desegregation is being fought. The Republican Ideas
Political Committee plans to show it and other ads in additional
markets this fall, founder and conservative commentator Richard
Nadler said.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Republicans are wary of the unsolicited help.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have anything to do with that group and certainly
wouldn't have anything to do with any ad campaign they're
running,'' said Daryl Duwe, a spokesman for the Missouri Republican
Party.
</P>
<P>
   A radio ad, called ''A Black Republican,'' features a black man
talking about how he became a Republican. ''Democrats taught me to
hate wealth. The Republicans helped me to get some,'' he says.
Other ads deal with privatization of Social Security: one
criticizing Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore and the other
supporting Republican George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal is to elect Republicans,'' said Nadler.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said he's raised $83,000 so far and hopes to collect more
than $100,000 by November. He would not name the other cities where
he plans to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City ad, the narrator tells the story of her
fictional family: a daughter who did well in public school and a
son who wanted to attend a private school.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Jason started hangin' with the wrong crowd, we had to act
fast,'' she says. ''We didn't want him where drugs and violence
were fashionable. It was a bit more diversity than he could
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   She emphasizes the word ''diversity'' and, as she says it, a
multiracial group of children is seen hanging out near a stairway.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-second ad goes on to promote educational savings accounts
that give parents tax breaks to save for tuition. It ends with the
words ''Vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Jenny Backus said the
ad had ''Willie Hortonesque echoes in it,'' a reference to a 1988
ad by an independent group about a Massachusetts prison furlough
program. The ad was widely viewed as a racist swipe at Democrat
Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important to stand up and say there's no room for tactics
like this,'' she said. ''Instead of being deplored, diversity
should be celebrated.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC Chairman Joe Andrew called on Jim Nicholson, his GOP
counterpart, to repudiate the ad. ''This race-baiting ad feeds
people's worst fears about the real challenges facing schools
today,'' Andrew wrote Nicholson on Tuesday. ''I hope you'll agree
that the ad is repugnant to all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Bill Pascoe criticized
Andrew for releasing the letter to the media before the RNC had
received it. ''We're not going to comment on a letter we haven't
received about an ad we haven't seen from a group with which we're
not familiar,'' Pascoe said.
</P>
<P>
   Ad expert Kathleen Hall Jamieson agreed the ad had a racial
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of making a case for parental choice it appears to
make the case against diversity,'' said Jamieson of the University
of Pennsylvania. ''Diversity is a code word for either a social
class the woman finds offensive or a racial minority the person
finds offensive, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   Nadler, who wrote the ad, said he did not intend to make a
statement about race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not used to clearing my language through liberal
Democrats before I write it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Ideas Political Committee, formed in the spring,
is a federally registered political action committee that fully
discloses its donors and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler said his efforts are funded by his family and some New
York investors, including William Witter, son of Dean Witter, whose
name is synonymous with the investment company.

<HEADLINE> Blast Kills 2 in Cambodia's Capital  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS DECHERD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- An explosion near the royal palace
in central Phnom Penh killed two people and injured nine Tuesday,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the explosion was caused by a bomb or some
other device, said So Chivy, an intelligence officer with the
national military police. Unconfirmed reports said a man driving on
a motorcycle threw a grenade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The blast occurred at a street corner in Don Tenh district, a
mixed residential and business area.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we know is that one lady, a bread seller, was killed,''
So Chivy said. ''She was pushing her cart along the street when the
explosion happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He said 10 people, including one child and three women, were
hospitalized, most with serious injuries. One of the injured had
died, he said. He did not know the identity of the dead person.
</P>
<P>
   ''This appears not related to politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A relative of the dead woman wailed from the balcony of the
house where she lived as police carried her body away. Blood was
splattered on the street.
</P>
<P>
   No other details were available and no one immediately claimed
responsibility for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Security in the capital had improved in the past 18 months after
officials, using random road checks, collected a cache of
unlicensed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Cambodians remained armed as the country
struggled to emerge from three decades of turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge in the late 1970s -- when
nearly one in four Cambodians died -- was sandwiched by two long and
bitter civil wars.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations peacekeeping operation brought substantial aid
and relative stability in the early 1990s, but peace was not
achieved until remnants of the Khmer Rouge collapsed in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bidders Delay Bribery Trial  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL FOY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A federal magistrate is expected to
postpone the Oct. 16 trial date for Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, the
alleged masterminds of the Salt Lake Olympic bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors are ready for the trial, but lawyers for the
bid leaders say they need more time to study 400 boxes of
government evidence. They also plan to travel overseas to interview
former International Olympic Committee members involved in the
worst scandal in Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government wants to do it as soon as possible,'' Justice
Department attorney Richard Wiedis said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The defense hasn't decided when it could be ready, although
previously lawyers said they may need a year -- a request
prosecutors likely would oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have a long way to go,'' said Max Wheeler, Johnson's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Magistrate Ronald Boyce will set new-motion and trial
deadlines Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A defense motion seeking an unspecified delay says the 15-count
felony indictment against Welch and Johnson is so sweeping and
novel and the government case so massive that a trial delay is
inevitable. Even Boyce, who is handling preliminary matters for
senior U.S. District Court Judge David Sam, doubted it could begin
so quickly when he set the Oct. 16 trial date.
</P>
<P>
   Welch, who was president of the Salt Lake bid committee, and
Johnson, vice president, were charged with showering IOC members
with $1 million in favors, from cash payments for travel and
scholarships to pricey gifts and employment schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment accuses them of conspiring to bribe IOC members
who in 1995 awarded Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Games. It also
accuses Welch and Johnson of concealing their dealings from a board
of trustees -- a charge they emphatically deny. They maintain their
favors for IOC members were customary for bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said whatever trial date Boyce sets will be subject to
further delay too.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a big deal. It's routine and frequently the dates
that are set have to be changed for one reason or another. This is
preliminary scheduling,'' Wheeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers have been forced to negotiate the payment of
their attorney fees by the Salt Lake Organizing Committee, which
says it will resume the payments only if Welch and Johnson drop all
legal claims against organizers for past compensation or wrongful
termination.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney fees for Welch and Johnson have topped $700,000, SLOC
president Mitt Romney has said. Wheeler said his law firm ''has not
been paid anywhere near that amount.'' His firm is working with
Welch's lawyers as a single defense team, and Wheeler said he
didn't know the total for defense billings.
</P>
<P>
   Welch also has hired Brigham Young University law professor
Michael Goldsmith, a former New York organized-crime prosecutor.
Goldsmith was brought on to buttress defense claims that
prosecutors had to stretch conspiracy and fraud statutes to fit the
once-loose world of Olympic lobbying.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Vietnam Trade Approval  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should approve a new trade agreement
with Vietnam despite human rights abuses and the Southeast Asian
nation's uncertain environment for U.S. business, the Clinton
administration said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging Congress does not have time enough in its current
session to deal with Vietnam, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky urged approval of a new bilateral trade agreement when
it is submitted next year.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky called the agreement ''an historical step forward in
our economic relationship with Vietnam'' that would promote
economic and government reform in the communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration leaves office Jan. 20. Even if
Republican candidate George W. Bush should defeat Vice President Al
Gore in the November election, the Vietnam deal probably would be
sent to Congress because it is thought to enjoy significant
bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   Backing is not universal, however. Members of two house
subcommittees, meeting jointly Tuesday, questioned why the United
States would want to help the communist nation with improved trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Vietnam government continues to systematically violate the
human rights, civil liberties and religious freedom of its
people,'' said Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, chairwoman of the
International Relations subcommittee on international economic
policy and trade. The Florida Republican called Vietnam ''one of
the most repressive countries in the world'' and said the
repression ''keeps it one of the poorest, with an average annual
per-capita income of $330.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade agreement, signed in July after four years of
negotiations, must be approved by Congress. Barshefsky said it was
not submitted to the 106th Congress because the administration
focused this year on winning normal trade relations with China,
which passed the Senate on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said she does not dispute Vietnam's human rights
record, but the Clinton administration believes dealing with
Vietnam will build ''international momentum ... for reform within
the country'' -- the same argument it used against critics of the
China trade legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., complained that the agreement
would use tax dollars to subsidize American businesses setting up
in Vietnam and allow Vietnam to charge relatively high tariffs on
U.S. goods going to Vietnam while paying low tariffs on its goods
coming to America.
</P>
<P>
   ''This communist dictatorship ... they are going to think we are
a bunch of saps -- and I do, too,'' said Rohrabacher, a member of
the International Relations subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Ros-Lehtinen also asked about risks associated with doing
business in Vietnam, specifically the state of property rights, the
rule of law and other protections for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky agreed that economic change has slowed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think U.S. investors need to proceed with great caution and
care,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam in
1994, restored diplomatic relations in 1995 and reopened the U.S.
Embassy in Hanoi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is planning to visit Vietnam in November, the first U.S.
leader to do so since the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War ended
in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Defends Deutch Probe Delay  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon chose not to immediately pursue
indications that John Deutch had mishandled secret information
while serving there, because the computers on which he stored the
data were in the CIA's possession, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was all about a potential compromise of classified
information on computers that we did not have in our possession,''
Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. Craig Quigley said. ''It's not clear
to me how we would have proceeded without reinventing a lot of the
effort that CIA investigators were doing at the very same time
frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the Pentagon did not begin its own probe until
February 2000, when the CIA provided the results of its
investigation into Deutch's handling of classified information
during his tenure at the spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the spy agency's probe focused on Deutch's actions
while CIA director, from May 1995 to December 1996. Deutch moved to
the CIA from the Pentagon, where he was undersecretary of defense
for acquisition and later the deputy defense secretary, a post with
extensive responsibilities for intelligence matters.
</P>
<P>
   In June and July 1998, the CIA alerted the Pentagon that Deutch
had kept classified defense information on his personal computers
while he served at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   In the months that followed, Pentagon officials cooperated with
CIA investigators regarding defense information that Deutch had
access to while CIA director, but the Pentagon did not begin its
own investigation until last February, Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's intent was to ''take a look in a very
comprehensive way at what CIA's investigators have been working so
hard on for this roughly year and a half,'' Quigley said. To have
begun an independent investigation earlier, focusing on Deutch's
years at the Pentagon, would have been duplicative, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said he could not estimate when the Pentagon's
investigation will be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Internal Defense Department documents allege that Deutch
mishandled secret intelligence and military information by creating
documents and journal entries on computers, floppy disks and memory
cards at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch has apologized for his behavior. He now teaches at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

<HEADLINE> Time Pressing on Clinton Peace Quest  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's long quest for a
legacy-building Middle East peace accord hit another snag but he
minimized the problem and said he'll keep trying -- before the goal
slips beyond his time and reach to await his successor in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush both are pledged
to the cause of Middle East peace, scripture for any candidate.
Earlier this year, Bush accused the administration of pressuring
Israel on peace terms, and Gore vehemently denied it, saying it was
the Republicans who tried ''to bully Israel'' when they were in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that sparring four months ago, topic hasn't been a
major issue between them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Tuesday he is still positive about prospects that
Israel and the Palestinians will come to terms, ''as long as they
get back to the work'' after an Israeli decision to call time out.
</P>
<P>
   After saying that probably would mean few days to assess the
state of negotiations, the Israelis announced that the two sides
would meet on Wednesday to discuss a basis for renewing their
talks.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis also said Yasser Arafat has hardened the
Palestinian position on unsettled issues, none more intractable
than the future status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the episode only showed the difficulty of the
issues at stake. ''They're both feeling the pressure of these hard
issues and the press of time,'' he said. ''... And I think you
should expect, from time to time, both sides to express some
exasperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the press of time applies to him, as well. His term ends
four months from Wednesday. He has made the peace effort his top
foreign policy priority, taking a personal role in bargaining
efforts for more than seven years. His record of economic success
scarred by scandal and impeachment, Clinton would like to leave a
Middle East peace landmark as President Jimmy Carter did, 22 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carter presided over bargaining that led to a peace agreement
between Israel and Egypt. Even the scene was the same -- Carter's
Camp David accord was reached at the presidential retreat where
Clinton convened 14 days of intense negotiations between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, before conceding on July 25 that
they could agree.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, he said they had made progress that could point to a
later accord, and that it could happen before the end of his term.
''Not because it's my administration, that's irrelevant,'' Clinton
said then. ''They're operating on their timetable, not mine...
</P>
<P>
   ''The only relevance of my being here is that I've been working
with them for eight years.''
</P>
<P>
   As his predecessors did, and the next administration will,
although the new president may not be as directly and personally
involved as he has been.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had Republicans and Democrats alike up to their ears in
the Middle East peace process for a long time,'' he said at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   He said he convened the last summit even though he worried that
it would be like going to the dentist without Novocain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I mean, this is not easy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed that on Tuesday after the time out episode. ''There
are no easy decisions now,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He's kept at it since Camp David, meeting with Arafat and Barak
when they were at the United Nations in New York earlier this
month. He told Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and U.S. envoy
Dennis B. Ross to keep at it, too. Clinton's quest led him to touch
down in Cairo on Aug. 29, for a 90-minute conference with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   But the deadlock persists and the clock is winding away, toward
the Jewish holy days that begin Sept. 29 the reconvening of the
Israeli parliament in late October, with Barak's governing
coalition shaken by defections over his concessions to Arafat in
the peace effort, and the election of Clinton's successor on Nov.
7.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has praised Clinton's work for a settlement, he has
coupled it with implied criticism. ''There can be no lasting peace
if the Israelis, for whatever reason, feel like they must accept an
agreement because it makes us happy,'' he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the Camp David summit, ''while failing to bridge all
the gaps,'' showed the administration's resolve to everything the
United States can do for a settlement. Gore said that as president,
he would ''demonstrate the same resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his accusation of interference in Israeli politics in
a speech to the America Israel Public Affairs Committee on May 22.
Bush said it wouldn't happen if he were president. ''In recent
times, Washington has tried to make Israel conform to its own plans
and timetables, but this is not the path to peace,'' the Republican
nominee said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Gore told the same audience that in 1991,
officials in the administration of Bush's father tried to use U.S.
loan guarantees ''as a stick to bully Israel,'' but he helped stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that in the Clinton administration, ''unlike our
immediate predecessors, we chose to get intimately involved'' in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we also established a firm new rule ... that we must not
and would not in any way try to pressure Israel to agree to
measures that they themselves would not seek,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Mammograms Don't Reduce Death  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Annual mammogram screening for breast cancer
among women over 50 does not reduce the rate of death from the
disease when compared to women who receive competent physical
breast examinations alone, according to a large Canadian study.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that women who are unable or unwilling to get
mammograms can protect themselves equally well from breast cancer
death by getting thorough annual physical breast examinations, said
Dr. Cornelia J. Baines of the University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Baines is co-author of a study appearing Wednesday in the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Some breast cancer experts questioned the results of the
Canadian study. They noted that out of seven similar studies in
Europe and North America, the Toronto study is the only one to not
show a clear survival advantage for mammography.
</P>
<P>
   And the American Cancer Society is continuing to recommend that
women over the age of 40 get annual mammography examinations, a
position endorsed by the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Baines emphasized that the study does not mean that women should
abandoned mammograph screening.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not questioning the value of mammography screening
compared to no screening,'' she said. ''We are questioning the need
to have mammography if you don't want it and can get a good
clinical examination. ... It's clear that screening mammography
versus nothing (no exam) reduces cancer deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she continued, ''If you happen to be among those women
who can't afford mammography or don't like it and the pain and
tenderness associated with it, go get a good clinical breast cancer
physical exam and you will be protecting yourself against breast
cancer death.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert A. Smith, director of cancer screening at the
American Cancer Society, expressed skepticism about the findings
and said there are unresolved questions about the way patients were
selected and about the quality of the X-ray mammography techniques
used.
</P>
<P>
   ''It stands out as being the only trial that at its conclusion
the groups that received mammography had higher rates of advanced
breast cancer than the groups not offered mammography,'' said
Smith. ''The problems with the Canadian study are well known.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel C. Sullivan, head of the biomedical imaging program
at the National Cancer Institute, said the Toronto study ''suggests
that good, careful physical examination might be as good as
mammography. I am not sure that everybody is convinced of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute, said Sullivan, recommends that
women over 40 get a mammogram exam ''every one to two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Smith and Sullivan said that the advantage of mammography
is that it spots smaller tumors, which means disease is detected
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have data from all over the world that shows that the
smaller the tumor the less likely that the cancer will have
(spread),'' said Smith. ''The advantage of mammography is that it
finds small tumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said that earlier detection with mammography may mean
that the cancer can be treated with less radical therapy, such as a
small incision to remove a lump, followed by radiation. Larger
tumors must be treated by mastectomy, removal of the whole breast,
followed by chemotherapy or radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Baines agreed that tumors detected by physical examination alone
were larger than those found by mammography.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, in terms of avoiding death by breast cancer,'' she said,
''it doesn't seem to have added any benefit to have the mammograph
detecting earlier cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Toronto study, 39,405 women volunteers, aged 50 to 59,
were divided into two groups -- one that periodically received both
mammography and careful physical examinations, and a second group
that received physical examinations only. Both groups were given
training in breast self examination, or BSE, but Baines said it is
not clear if this played a role in the results. The patients were
enrolled between 1980 and 1985 and followed for an average of 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   The initial screening found 267 invasive (spreading) breast
cancers in the mammography group and 148 in the physical-exam only
group.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1993, the different screening techniques had
detected about an equal amount of cancer. There were 622 invasive
tumors and 71 in-place tumors in the mammography group, and 610
invasive tumors and 16 in-place tumors in the physical exam-only
group.
</P>
<P>
   The number of breast cancer deaths also was nearly equal: 107
for the mammography group and 105 deaths in the other group.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, said Baines, is that ''the addition of annual
mammography screening to physical examination has no impact on
breast cancer survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Baines, however, noted that all the patients in the study
received highly competent physical breast examinations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The quality of the examination in our study is better than
that generally found in medical practices,'' she acknowledged.
Baines said that other studies have shown that ''a lot of work has
to be done to improve the competence of the breast physical exams
that are now being done.''

<P>
   ''They tried to silence her in China. But she spoke out for
women's rights as human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''They criticized her book about children. She took the
proceeds, nearly a million dollars, and gave it to children.

<P>
   ''All her life, Hillary has stood up for what she believes in.
For better schools, better health care. Now, she'll stand up for

   IMAGES: Footage of Clinton in a classroom with children, with
the words ''fought for teacher testing''; in a hospital with a
bedridden elderly woman, with the words ''worked to expand health
coverage''; and in a pink suit with her hair in a girlish flip,
standing at a podium at the 1995 women's conference in Beijing,
with the words ''spoke out for women's rights.'' Then her book ''It
Takes A Village'' is pictured, with the words ''gave nearly $1
million to children's causes,'' followed by more shots of Clinton
with schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: This ad portrays Clinton as a brave crusader who
persists in trumpeting her righteous causes despite the onslaught
of an ominous yet unnamed ''they.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's continued interest in improving health care
despite her failed 1994 effort to reform it is relatively
well-known, viewers may be puzzled by some of the ad's other
references. Her fight ''for teacher testing'' refers to work she
did as Arkansas' first lady to improve public schools there and her
advocacy of competency tests for teachers, which was criticized by
teacher unions. Her work in China refers to her appearance at a
women's rights conference in Beijing in 1995 in which she condemned
infanticide and other abuses at a time when the U.S. government was
downplaying criticism of Chinese human rights violations.
Transmission of the speech was blacked out by Chinese authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The ad's dramatic tone and its portrayal of Clinton as a lone
warrior continuously under assault by a vast unnamed entity may
bring to mind another vast conspiracy that she's famous for having
complained about. But it may also resonate with voters who do see
the first lady as a woman who's been unfairly criticized and who's
not afraid to stand up for what she believes in, even when she
takes heat for it.
</P>
<P>
   The ad may also remind voters of her Republican opponent Rep.
Rick Lazio's repeated attacks on her during their debate one week
ago.

<HEADLINE> US-China Trade Glance  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Highlights, according to a White House fact sheet, of
the
results of permanent normal trade relations with China and China's
entry into the World Trade Organization:
<TEXT>
<P>
   --The Agriculture Department estimates that China's WTO accession
would result in $2 billion annually in additional agriculture
exports by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   --China makes significant, one-way market-opening concessions,
including increasing access to its markets for agriculture,
services, technology, telecommunications, and manufactured goods.
China also agrees to eliminate ''unseen'' barriers, such as
exclusive rights to import and distribute goods.
</P>
<P>
   --On U.S. priority agricultural products, tariffs will drop from
an average of 31 percent to 14 percent by January 2004, with even
sharper drops for beef, poultry, pork, cheese, and other
commodities. China will significantly expand export opportunities
for bulk commodities such as wheat, corn, and rice.
</P>
<P>
   --Industrial tariffs on U.S. products will fall from an average
of 24.6 percent in 1997 to an average of 9.4 percent by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   --China will phase in trading rights and distribution services
over three years, and also open up sectors related to distribution
services, such as repair and maintenance, warehousing, trucking,
and air courier services.
</P>
<P>
   --China will eliminate tariffs on products such as computers,
semiconductors, and related products by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   --China will open its telecommunications sector and significantly
expand investment and other activities for financial services
firms. It will greatly increase the opportunities open to
professional services such as law firms, management consulting,
accountants, and environmental services.

<P>
   --For the first 12 years, the United States can take effective
action in case of increased imports of a particular product from
China that cause or threaten to cause market disruption in the
United States.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Cuban Sea Plane Crashes  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- A plane taking off from Cuba was hijacked
Tuesday morning and crashed in the Gulf of Mexico, authorities
said. One body was recovered and nine people, including three
children, were rescued, the Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the plane had run out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-made Antonov AN-2 Colt took off from Herradura
Airport in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, and was believed to have gone down
about 90 miles southwest of Key West and 75 miles northwest of
Havana, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors were rescued in the Gulf of Mexico more than 200
miles west of that area, the Coast Guard said. It said the hijacked
plane was heading west when it went down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently it was hijacked, and the pilot indicated they only
had 1&AMP;frac12; hours fuel,'' said Lauren Gail Stover, associate director of
Miami-Dade County Aviation Department.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard jet carrying rafts reached the area Tuesday
afternoon, as did a Coast Guard cutter and two Florida Air National
Guard fighter jets. A U.S. AWACS plane on a training mission from
Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina picked up an emergency beacon
in the area, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard said one body was recovered and nine survivors --
three men, three women and three children -- were pulled from the
wreckage by the crew of a passing cargo ship, the Chios Dream.
</P>
<P>
   One man suffered severe head and neck injuries and was to be
flown by a Coast Guard helicopter to Key West for medical
treatment, Coast Guard Rear Adm. Thad Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard cutter headed to meet the freighter and pick up
the other survivors. Their conditions were not immediately
available, and Allen said it was too soon to say whether they would
be brought to shore for medical treatment or remain on board.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials initially reported that as many as 18 people
were on the plane, but Allen said the survivors told the ship's
crew that only 10 were aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The plane disappeared from U.S. radar shortly before 11 a.m.,
Stover said.
</P>
<P>
   The long-range single-engine bush plane is used for passenger
flights, crop-dusting and forest fire suppression.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic control in Havana notified the air traffic control
center in Miami at 8:45 a.m. that an aircraft was being hijacked
and flying northwest out of Cuba, said Kathleen Bergen, a Federal
Aviation Administration spokeswoman in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA had no voice or radar contact with the aircraft, Bergen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Zavala, a supervisor at Cuba's Institute of Civil
Aeronautics in Havana, said by telephone that the plane was used
for agricultural work. He declined to provide other details.
</P>
<P>
   A similar aircraft was stolen by its pilot and four other Cubans
and flown to Miami on June 19, 1991. That plane landed safely at
Miami International Airport, directed in by air-traffic controllers
who had both radar and radio contact with the pilot after he began
his flight to Florida.

<HEADLINE> Haiti's Supreme Court Justice Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Clausel Debrosses, the 85-year-old
chief justice of Haiti's Supreme Court, has died in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The exact cause of his death Monday was unknown, and the date of
his funeral has not been announced yet. Minister of Justice Camille
Leblanc confirmed Debrosses' death on local radio reports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Three other members of the nine-member court have died in recent
years and have not yet been replaced. Court vice president Pradel
Jean will stand in as chief justice until new court members are
chosen, Leblanc said.
</P>
<P>
   Constitutionally, the senate must propose a list of three
candidates to the president, who appoints the justice.
</P>
<P>
   As a reward for his loyalty to constitutional government, former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide appointed Debrosses, who was
already a member of the court, as chief justice in 1994, after U.S.
troops intervened in Haiti to put an end to three years of
military-backed rule and restore a democratically elected
government to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, his strident plea in favor of the reestablishment of
the death penalty, abolished by the 1987 constitution, drew fire
from human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   In his last important case, Debrosses last year refused to
consider the suit brought by lawmakers against President Rene
Preval, who, in January 1999, had locked them out of Parliament to
end an 18-month struggle with the majority party.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Ad Makes Network Debut  </HEADLINE>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An anti-smoking commercial showing body bags
being stacked outside a tobacco company office building is running
on NBC's Summer Olympics telecast after being rejected by all four
major networks earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial was developed by the American Legacy Foundation,
an organization created and financed as part of the tobacco
industry's 1998 agreement to pay $206 billion over 25 years to
settle suits by 46 states over the costs of treating sick smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is mounting the largest anti-smoking campaign
ever, spending an estimated $150 million a year on ads alone.
</P>
<P>
   It has committed about $15 million to buying time on the
Olympics telecasts that started last week and run through Oct. 2 on
NBC and cable networks MSNBC and CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the hard-hitting ''Body Bags'' ad has been
run on any of the four major broadcast networks.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation tried to place it and another commercial in which
young people tried to question tobacco executives about their
marketing tactics on the NBC, ABC, CBS and Fox broadcast networks
in February.
</P>
<P>
   The ads don't identify the locale but they were filmed at the
New York headquarters of Philip Morris Cos., the parent of the
nation's biggest cigarette company.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Healton, president of the foundation, said all four of
the networks rejected the two ads which drew criticism from Philip
Morris and several state attorneys general. The settlement
agreement had said the money provided for anti-smoking ads would
not be used to personally attack or vilify companies or
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation withdrew the ads temporarily as a result of the
complaints but resumed using them after its board discussed it,
Healton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Body Bags,'' which was designed to illustrate the consequences
of smoking, has been carried for months on the MTV cable network
and on local TV stations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It shows 1,200 body bags stuffed with paper being stacked
outside a tobacco office building to illustrate how many people die
each day from tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ''Body Bags,'' the foundation has prepared
several more commercials for use during the Olympics and afterward
that use body bags in scenes that the tobacco companies have used
for years in advertising cigarettes, Healton said.
</P>
<P>
   Body bags are draped over horses galloping into the sunset in
one ad, propped up at a table with young women partying in a
nightclub in another and dragged across sunbathers at the beach in
a third commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ''What if tobacco ads told the truth?'' the ads ask.
</P>
<P>
   Healton said the admakers ''wanted to counter the image linking
smoking to health and beauty and love.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Olympics telecasts are ''a fantastic venue for us''
because a ''substantial portion'' of American teens will see them.
</P>
<P>
   NBC spokeswoman Maria Battaglia said the network decided to run
the ad because some elements of it were changed from what NBC was
originally shown, the overall campaign appears to be effective and
the ad itself has been running elsewhere without negative feedback.
</P>
<P>
   ''So far we have had no negative reaction to it and don't
foresee any,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan McCormick, a Philip Morris spokesman, declined to
comment about the anti-smoking ads being run during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, ''We don't believe some of what they have done has
been consistent with the spirit'' of the settlement agreement.

<HEADLINE> It's official: Seltzer beat Rep. Forbes in Dem. primary  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) - She spent only $40,000 on her campaign,
but it was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Seltzer, a 71-year-old former librarian, was declared the
winner by a 35-vote margin Tuesday in her primary contest against
Republican-turned-Democrat Rep. Michael Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's exciting and thrilling,'' Seltzer said. ''I think the
real winners are the voters. They proved that each and every vote
makes a difference and each person is very, very important.''
</P>
<P>
   The final vote from the recanvass of the Sept. 12 primary was
Seltzer 6,077 to Forbes 6,042, said Suffolk County Democratic
Elections Commissioner Neil Tiger. Seltzer will face Republican
Felix Grucci, the Brookhaven Town Supervisor, in the Nov. 7 general
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm surprised, but I'm going to support the Democratic
nominee,'' Forbes said, adding that he planned to call Seltzer and
wish her well. ''I hope people will rally behind her.''
</P>
<P>
   Some big names have already wished Seltzer well. She said she
has gotten calls from U.S. Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton,
state Democratic party Chairwoman Judith Hope, and Rep. Carolyn
McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he would return to Long Island, spend more time with
his family and go into some kind of business.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a three-term congressman who switched parties last year,
amassed a $1.4 million war chest, some of that coming from a
fund-raiser last April that featured President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer entered the race after other local Democrats backed out
under pressure from party leaders in Washington. Seltzer has said
her showing proved that local Democrats were not happy about having
a one-time Republican foisted on them.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she said she won because her views better
represented her Congressional district, because she is pro-choice,
supports some gun control, and wants campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes voted for impeachment and opposes abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not important how much money you have,'' Seltzer said.
''If you're right on the issues, you can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer immigrated from Poland at age 8 and worked as a school
librarian for 13 years. In the 1970s, she served one term on a town
council, her only previous elected office. After losing
re-election, she enrolled in law school at age 50. She works for
free for a Long Island environmental group and has written a book
on children's rights.
</P>
<P>
   As for her no-frills budget, Seltzer said: ''I don't like to ask
people for money.''
</P>
<P>
   But now her campaign is going to have to raise more money, as
she plans to run a ''grassroots, door-to-door'' campaign against
Grucci.
</P>
<P>
   Only two incumbents have lost in primaries this year: Democrat
Rep. Marty Martinez of California and GOP Rep. Merrill Cook of
Utah.

<HEADLINE> Lazio calls notion that he was too aggressive ''sexist''  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Rep. Rick Lazio said Tuesday that it's
''sexist'' to portray his behavior during the Senate debate as too
aggressive toward Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that somehow that there's a double standard because
you're a man or a woman, and you can't make a point forcefully if
you're a man, and the person you're making the point with is a
woman, I just think that's sexist,'' he said Tuesday during a
campaign stop at an Internet company in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's debate, the Republican left his podium and
strode over to Clinton's side of the stage brandishing a contract
to ban soft money from the campaign. A photograph captured Lazio
towering over the first lady, pointing his finger as she pulled
back.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, called Lazio's behavior
''menacing,'' while the first lady shrugged it off, saying ''the
thing that probably prepared me best in dealing with things like
that was having two younger brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Lazio came back with his own sibling story, saying:
''If she wants to characterize me as, you know, debating with her
brother, that's fine. Listen, I have three older sisters. I know
what that's like.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson called Lazio's accusation ''bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Poor Rick,'' the Clinton spokesman said. ''Let me be the first
to offer him my support.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio told reporters: ''I don't think people in the Senate worry
about whether you're a man or a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's gender came up repeatedly in a new letter sent out
by state GOP Chairman William Powers. He uses the term ''woman''
five times in the new letter, the latest in a series of
fund-raising letters sent out on behalf of his party's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have high hopes that you'll help us ... stop this ambitious,
ruthless, scheming, calculating, manipulating woman from fooling
voters,'' Powers writes. In a postscript, he adds: ''Hillary
Clinton is an angry woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the emphasis on gender, Power's spokesman Dan Allen
said, ''There's nothing behind that ... If we use the words Hillary
Rodham Clinton 50 times it gets kind of redundant, so you've got to
use other words.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter also states: ''She's been at the front and center of
every Clinton-Gore scandal and this has been the most seedy,
shameless and corrupt administration in American history ...
Morality matters and character counts and by her own words, deeds
and actions, Hillary Rodham Clinton has disqualified herself from
earning the public's trust, let alone public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new statewide poll of female voters found only 16
percent say they respect the way Clinton ''stood by'' her husband
during revelations of his affair with a White House intern.
Fifty-three percent say she ''handled a difficult situation well.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 502 female voters statewide, conducted Sept. 5-9 by
Manhattanville College in Westchester, has a 4-point margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   Women are evenly divided on the carpetbagger issue, with 38
percent saying her lack of New York roots is not a concern and 38
percent saying it is.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the poll found women favor Clinton over Lazio 47 to 42
percent. Among white women, Lazio had the edge, 49 to 40 percent.
Thirty-seven percent of white women said the first lady does not
share their moral or ethical values.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio campaign also announced Tuesday that it is closing its
''Friends of Rick Lazio'' soft-money committee. Campaign spokesman
Dan McLagan said the remaining money was being refunded to donors.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign had called the committee a symbol of
Lazio's ''hypocrisy'' in light of his ban on soft money.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Food Tag Codes Animal Treatment  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Starting Wednesday, the government will allow
farmers to display a seal on meat and dairy products to attest that
they treat their cattle and chickens humanely.
</P>
<P>
   But the voluntary standards are so stringent that few farmers
initially can meet them.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the ''Free Farmed'' seal, farms would have to
eliminate cages for laying hens and stop using forced molting, the
withdrawal of food and water to increase egg production. Dairy
cattle would have to have access to pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Standards designed to improve farm conditions for broiler
chickens and beef cattle also are in the package. Rules for hog
farms are being written.
</P>
<P>
   The American Humane Association developed the standards and set
up a new organization, Farm Animal Services, to inspect farms that
want to use the label. The Agriculture Department is to monitor the
inspection process.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to improve the lives of farm animals, look for
this label,'' said Adele Douglas, executive director of Farm Animal
Services, said Tuesday. ''If your grocery store doesn't have it,
ask the manager why not. The more consumer demand there is,
producers will respond to that and the animals will be helped.''
</P>
<P>
   The new program was being announced at a news conference
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Products with the label initially will be available primarily in
natural food stores and upscale supermarkets. A handful of farms
have been approved for the program so far: an egg producer in
Wisconsin, a group of dairy farms in northern California, cattle
producers that supply a Montana processor.
</P>
<P>
   The new program comes after McDonald's Corp. began last month
forcing suppliers to improve the handling of animals in
slaughterhouses and implement humane standards on egg farms.
Although McDonald's continued to allow hens to be caged, its
standards require the birds be given more room, and the rules also
will ban forced molting.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many production situations nowadays where animals
are kept in close confinement and are not able to present many of
their normal behaviors,'' said Joy Mench, director of the Center
for Animal Welfare at the University of California, Davis. ''In
many cases they may not be able to turn around or lie down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Free Farmed'' doesn't mean the animals are necessarily
free-ranging. Chickens still could be kept indoors. However, the
standards include minimum space requirements for both cattle and
chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Farms that raise broiler chickens will not be allowed to feed
them antibiotics to stimulate growth. Meters will have to be
installed on water lines. Cattle ranches would have to provide
adequate windbreaks and shade, and the use of antibiotics as a
growth stimulant also would be barred.
</P>
<P>
   The seal will bear the words ''Free Farmed'' and ''American
Humane Association Monitored.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is based on a British system developed by the Royal
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the program say that the U.S. market will
initially be limited, but they expect it to grow as consumers
become aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''A large portion of the American people are very concerned
about the social concerns of animal husbandry,'' said John
Brunnquell, president of Egg Innovations of Port Washington, Wis.,
the only egg producer now approved for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Farm groups say that growers already treat animals well, because
it's in their interest to ensure the animals stay in good health.
Industry groups also have voluntary animal-welfare standards for
producers to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''A cow that's well cared for is going to be a much better part
of your dairy farm,'' said Chris Galen, a spokesman for the
National Milk Producers Federation.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Remembers '85 Quake Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Flags were lowered to half-staff, memorial
Masses were celebrated in empty lots where buildings once stood,
and ambulances sounded their sirens Tuesday to commemorate the 15th
anniversary of the massive 1985 earthquake in Mexico City that
killed more than 9,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local officials gathered in the main plaza of North
America's largest city and held a moment of silence to remember the
victims of the 8.1-magnitude quake, which also destroyed 400
buildings and weakened 5,700 others.
</P>
<P>
   The government came in for harsh criticism because of its
slowness in responding to the disaster, which struck in the early
morning hours of Sept. 19, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many of the deaths occurred in poorly constructed
government offices, apartment buildings or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Diodoro Carrasco said the tragedy motivated
the government to be better prepared for the next big quake, which
scientists have warned is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ''The population has to be alert and this is the goal of these
new information systems for natural disasters,'' Carrasco said at
the ceremony, also attended by firefighters and rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the 1985 quake, Mexican authorities implemented a
seismic alert system consisting of a series of sensors placed along
a seismic gap in the Pacific Coast state of Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   The system, part of the National Disaster Prevention Center,
could give Mexico City residents as much as 50 seconds warning
prior to a major earthquake, allowing them to seek safer areas --
such as open spaces outside.
</P>
<P>
   The alert system is only set off by quakes of magnitude 6.5 or
higher, and only works if an earthquake originates between the
Pacific Coast resort towns of Acapulco and Zihuatanejo. That was
not the epicenter of the 1985 quake.
</P>
<P>
   The area was chosen because of logistical reasons and the
estimated probability of future quakes.
</P>
<P>
   That stretch of the Pacific Coast registered three 7.5-magnitude
earthquakes between 1899 and 1907, but no major earthquakes have
occurred since 1911, leading scientists to believe another major
earthquake might be due soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Mexican television stations broadcast images of
Mexico City buildings that are still considered dangerous and
uninhabitable 15 years later, but which have neither been repaired
nor demolished.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smut Group Readies Report  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federally created commission studying online
child protection will recommend to Congress that an independent
research bureau be created to review filtering software and may
also push for a special kid-friendly Internet zone, its chairman
says.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has toyed with many recommendations for how to
keep children safe while not running afoul of privacy and free
speech concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no magic bullet,'' said Donald Telage, chairman of
the Commission on Child Online Protection and a former president of
Network Solutions, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The panel includes representatives from government, industry --
such as The Walt Disney Co., Yahoo! and America Online -- and
activists like the Washington-based Center for Democracy and
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the group rated all of its possible recommendations
on the basis of cost, effectiveness, privacy and First Amendment
issues, and other criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Telage said in an interview, he expects the commission will
recommend that an independent research bureau provide evaluations
of online filtering products.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that make those products are very secretive with their
lists of ''banned'' sites and how they scan for objectionable
content. Telage said the commission would heighten competition and
expose false claims.
</P>
<P>
   Telage said there is a ''50-50 shot'' that new Web domain
categories could be created, like ''.kids,'' reserved for
kid-friendly content. Others have advocated ''.xxx'' for adult
sites, although Telage said the commission has free-speech
reservations about that suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Age verification techniques, content labeling and education
initiatives also are under discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Even a seemingly simple suggestion like boosting funds for law
enforcement agencies for more pornography-related prosecutions
faced intense debate.
</P>
<P>
   More prosecutions could have a chilling effect on purveyors of
porn, argues Donna Rice Hughes, an anti-porn activist who gained
notoriety for her relationship with 1988 presidential candidate
Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the reasons we have such enormous abuse in the
obscenity area is that they know they're not going to be
prosecuted,'' Rice Hughes said. ''Some very well-placed
prosecutions could send a loud, clear message that there is some
risk associated with this.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet industry representative considers it futile, since
U.S. regulations and prosecutions couldn't touch foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deterrent effect of increased prosecution outside the U.S.
borders is precisely zero,'' said John LoGalbo of PSINet, Inc. The
company's founder, William L. Schrader, is on the commission.
''There's a lot of pornography outside the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   But J. Robert Flores of the National Law Center for Children and
Families pointed to the adult industry chastising its own members
for some especially hard-core pornography, after it brought the
unwanted attention of local legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ''This industry is extremely sensitive to the smallest
prosecution,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was established under the Child Online Protection Act,
which has been roundly lambasted by the courts. In June, a federal
court upheld the injunction against the law, calling it too
restrictive, confused and impossible to enforce. None of the judges
in any court that has reviewed the law has ever voted to uphold it.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is due to present recommendations to Congress
Oct. 21.

<HEADLINE> Besiktas Upsets Barca, 3-0  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
<P>
   England's Leeds beat AC Milan 1-0 on Lee Bowyer's freak goal in
the last minute Tuesday night in the European Champions League, and
Turkey's Besiktas upset Barcelona 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   On a rainy night in northern England, Bowyer's 20-yard shot was
caught by Brazilian goalkeeper Dida, who couldn't control the
slippery ball and allowed it to drop into the net behind him.
</P>
<P>
   In other games, Bayern Munich picked up its second straight
victory of the first round, beating Norway's Rosenborg 3-1, and
Spanish champion Deportivo de La Coruna got a late goal to beat SV
Hamburg 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Juventus of Turin, held to a 4-4 tie last week by
Hamburg, bounced back to beat Panathinaikos 2-1, Paris-St. Germain
routed Helsingborgs 4-1, Anderlecht won 1-0 at home over PSV
Eindhoven, and Manchester United played a scoreless tie at Dynamo
Kiev.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's schedule had Spartak Moscow at Real Madrid, Sporting
Lisbon at Bayer Leverkusen, Sparta Prague at Lazio of Rome, Shaktar
Donetsk at Arsenal, Valencia at Heerenveen, Lyon at Olympiakos
Piraeus, Galatasaray at Sturm Graz and Glasgow Rangers at AS
Monaco.
Group E
Juventus 2, Panathinaikos 1
</P>
<P>
   At Turin, David Trezeguet scored on a header off Jonathan
Bachini's corner kick with seven minutes left. Juventus went ahead
in the 35th when Alessio Tacchinardi's 25-yard shot hit the
crossbar and rebounded off the back of goalkeeper Antonis
Nikopolidis into the net. Yiannis Goumas tied it with seconds left
in the half. Juventus and Deportivo (each 1-0-1) are tied for
first, with Hamburg and Panathinakos (each 0-1-1) tied for third.
</P>
<P>
Deportivo de La Coruna 2, Hamburg 1
</P>
<P>
   At La Coruna, Lionel Sebastian Scaloni scored on a quick goal in
the final 30 seconds. Walter Pandiani put Deportivo ahead off a
rebound in the 43rd minute, but Sergey Barbarez tied it in the 53rd
when he headed a bouncing ball into the goal.
</P>
<P>
Group F
Bayern Munich 3, Rosenborg 1
</P>
<P>
   At Munich, Jan Derek Soerensen put the visitors ahead in the
38th, but Bayern rallied on goals by Carsten Jancker (53rd minute),
Giovane Elber (77th) and Thomas Linke (80th). Bayern (2-0) leads
the group, followed by Paris-St. Germain and Rosenborg (each 1-1)
and Helsingborgs (0-2).
</P>
<P>
Paris St. Germain 4, Helsingborgs 1
</P>
<P>
   At Paris, Nicolas Anelka (25th), Laurent Robert (63rd), Correar
Dionisio Christian (81st) and Tal El Karkouri (90th) scored for the
home team. Bjorn Johansen scored for Helsingborg in the 45th.
</P>
<P>
Group G
Dynamo Kiev 0, Manchester United 0
</P>
<P>
   At Kiev, Ukraine, Dynamo Kiev's players all shaved their heads
for the game, played in a steady rain. Man United's Dwight Yorke
hit the crossbar in the 19th. Man United (1-0-1) leads the group,
followed by PSV Eindhoven and Anderlecht (each 1-1) and Dynamo Kiev
(0-1-1).
</P>
<P>
Anderlecht 1, PSV Eindhoven 0
</P>
<P>
   At Brussels, Didier Dheedene scored in the 81st on a deflection
off Theo Lucius that dribbled past goalkeeper Ronald Waterreus.
</P>
<P>
Group H
Besiktas 3, Barcelona 0
</P>
<P>
   At Istanbul, Ahmet Dursun scored in the 38th and 75th minutes
and Pascal Nouma got a goal in the 87th. All four teams in the
group are tied at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Leeds United 1, AC Milan 0
</P>
<P>
   At Leeds, Bowyer's shot was one of the few either club had.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Novel Survives On Stage  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some stories are so strong they resonate on
stage even if the dramatic adaptation is less than sterling.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with ''A Lesson Before Dying,'' Romulus
Linney's straightforward reworking of Ernest J. Gaines' powerful
novel of a young black man looking at death and the disillusioned
teacher who shows him how to die.
</P>
<P>
   The play, the season opener at off-Broadway's Signature Theater
Company, is set in 1948 Louisiana. Jefferson, played by a fiercely
brooding Jamahl Marsh, is facing the electric chair for a murder he
didn't commit. Resigned yet unrepentant, he considers himself no
better than an animal -- a hog, to be exact -- which is what even his
own attorney called him.
</P>
<P>
   The youth's godmother, portrayed with a wonderful matriarchal
grandeur by Beatrice Winde, is determined Jefferson should die with
dignity: ''Like a man,'' she says, enlisting a disillusioned black
teacher named Grant Wiggins in her cause. He would seem to be a
strange choice. Wiggins hates his job, hates the South, hates what
he has become, obsessions that actor Isiah Whitlock Jr. conveys
with considerable intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, during their weekly meetings, the two men bond,
particularly after Wiggins gives his pupil a notebook in which to
write. The world Jefferson can barely see from the jail begins to
take on new meaning. And the seeds of self-esteem begin to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Linney has condensed Gaines' tale to its bare bones, often only
leaving the message, which, at times, sounds more preachy than
poetic. Fortunately director Kent Thompson, who directed the
original production at the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, makes
things move swiftly, so the sermons fly by.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins' scenes with his married girlfriend (Tracey A. Leigh)
are brief, but they give some insight into a man who is still
somewhat of a mystery by the time the final curtain falls.
</P>
<P>
   What we mostly get on stage is his anger, battling not only his
own inner demons but the preachings of a sanctimonious minister
(John Henry Redwood) who thinks Wiggins should only be concerned
with the boy's soul, not his few remaining days on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Lesson Before Dying'' builds strongly to its preordained
ending. Even though the outcome is never in doubt, the play's last
moments are unexpectedly brutal, not to mention heartbreaking.
Jefferson finally does die. Yet by doing so, he shows his teacher
how to live.

<HEADLINE> Embattled INS Official Retires  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The city's top Immigration and
Naturalization Service official, under fire for the agency's
treatment of foreign visitors, will retire in two weeks, the agency
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials called for the resignation of David Beebe, 55,
last month after a Chinese businesswoman was forced to strip search
and was jailed for two days after inspectors incorrectly thought
her passport might have been altered.
</P>
<P>
   Under Beebe's watch, the city was dubbed ''Deportland'' by some
Asians because of reports of unfair treatment of Japanese and other
travelers at Portland International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   His retirement takes effect Oct. 3, said Johnny Williams,
western regional director of the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Beebe's decision to retire was his and his alone,'' he
said. ''He cares deeply about his agency and about his employees.
Under the current circumstances, he believes that he can serve both
best by retiring from public service.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said a team of experts has recommended improving
customer service, employee training and community relations.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines announced this month that it is discontinuing
its last two direct flights from Portland to Japan, and said the
treatment of foreigners by INS officials here was a factor in its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Beebe apologized to the woman forced to undergo the search. Guo
Liming, 36, has filed a $500,000 claim against the INS and lawsuits
against some INS employees.
</P>
<P>
   More charges of insensitivity among INS inspectors were made
Tuesday, as the Oregonian newspaper reported that Claudia Young, a
German national traveling with her U.S. husband and baby, was
strip-searched, handcuffed and detained for a day before her
deportation. Her visa was not in order.
</P>
<P>
   W. Scott Cihlar, INS Portland district assistant director for
detention and removals, said officers had no choice but to deport
Claudia Young. But he said officers would seek other solutions if a
similar case occurred.

<HEADLINE> Beach Volleyball Format Questioned  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Beach volleyball is an unpredictable
sport, full of bounces and emotional twists that can turn a blowout
into a struggle faster than a Rob Heidger spike.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Americans reacted defiantly to any implication
that Heidger and partner Kevin Wong lost on purpose Tuesday in
order to secure an easier draw in the final 16 of the Olympic men's
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to win the game. That's all there is to it,'' said
their coach, Dane Selznick. ''Volleyball is a game of momentum.
Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering their second consolation match against top-seeded
Julien Prosser and Lee Zahner of Australia, Heidger and Wong needed
to score at least nine points to guarantee they would survive to
the next round, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   They took control early, surging to a 9-4 lead by forcing the
Australians to one side where Heidger's intimidating 6-foot-8 frame
waited to block and slam. Then one of those notorious shifts
occurred, with Prosser and Zahner assuming command to tie the match
and go on to a 15-11 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams benefited from the result, and so did the sport.
Prosser and Zahner advanced to the final 16, delighting a host
nation and volleyball officials eager for continued sellout crowds
at the spectacular Bondi Beach venue.
</P>
<P>
   Heidger and Wong also advanced despite the loss because they had
a better point differential -- points scored compared with points
allowed -- than the other two teams that split their two consolation
games Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By being the so-called ''lucky loser'' to advance on points
differential, Heidger and Wong realized another benefit. They
automatically were placed in the bracket rung where the top-seeded
team would have gone if it won its first match.
</P>
<P>
   The logic was simple -- the ''lucky loser'' would have the
toughest match of the round to gain a quarterfinal berth. Once
again, though, a beach volleyball curve jumbled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Prosser and Zahner lost their opening match Sunday to the
Mexican duo of Joel Sotelo and Juan Ibarra in the biggest upset of
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   So Heidger and Wong, instead of getting penalized for failing to
win both consolation matches, drew the 24th-seeded Mexicans in a
match for a quarterfinal berth when men's play resumes Friday
(Thursday night EDT). The other consolation survivors play much
more highly regarded competition -- either the fourth-seeded Swiss,
or the Brazilian teams seeded third and second.
</P>
<P>
   Both Heidger and Wong said they were unaware of exactly how many
points they needed against Zahner and Prosser to guarantee they
advanced, win or lose. They said they played hard throughout the
match and had tuned out all talk beforehand about point totals
required to make them the ''lucky losers.''
</P>
<P>
   Selznick said he told the players before the match they needed
to score at least eight points to give them an unassailable points
differential. The goal was to advance, whether by winning or being
the ''lucky loser,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other players complained about a system that awarded a loss with
an easier route to a possible quarterfinal berth.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not 'faster, higher, stronger.' It's lose,'' said Fabio
Diez, a member of the Spanish team that also survived consolation
by defeating a Czech Republic team.
</P>
<P>
   Michal Palinek of the losing Czech side, now out of the
Olympics, called the system ''stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an Olympic ideal,'' he said. ''It's better to lose in
this case. That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials overseeing the beach volleyball competition defended
the format as fair overall, even with the glitch of rewarding a
losing team.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not an absolutely perfect system,'' said Sinjin Smith,
president of the international volleyball federation's beach
volleyball world council. ''The fact that we had to pick a team
that lost (to advance to the next round) puts us at a
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted the final consolation match Tuesday, which followed
Heidger and Wong's loss to Prosser and Zahner, involved two teams
that knew they had to win to advance because the Americans already
had secured a final 16 spot with the best points differential.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't see anything out of the ordinary that would make
anyone think there was a problem,'' Smith said. ''We're all happy
with the way things turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   To Heidger, it's all about beach volleyball. He pointed out how,
in their first Olympic match, he and Wong led Canada's Jody Holden
and Conrad Leinemann 14-9 and had five chances at match point. The
Canadians fended them off, recovered to tie the game and eventually
won 17-15 to relegate the Americans to the consolation round.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big swings happen,'' he said of blowing the lead against
Prosser and Zahner on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The other American men's team -- Dain Blanton and Eric Fonoimoana
-- won their opening Olympic match on Sunday to qualify for the
final 16, in which they will face the Norwegian team of Jorre
Kjemperud and Vegard Hoidalen.
</P>
<P>
   No matches were scheduled for Wednesday, with the women's
competition holding its final 16 round on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis, the third-seeded
Americans, will face the Cuban duo of Tamara Larrea and Dalixia
Fernandez, while fourth-seeded Holly McPeak and Misty May face
Lucilla Perrotta and Daniela Gattelli of Italy.

<HEADLINE> Modest Pension Break for Lawmakers  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress, reaching out for a
cost-of-living pay raise in an election year, also stand to receive
a modest pension break in legislation making its way to President
Clinton's desk.
</P>
<P>
   The provision would roll back mandated increases in
out-of-pocket contributions toward retirement and affect lawmakers
as well as other federal workers. For members of the House and
Senate, the change would mean a savings estimated at $700 a year
for 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement provision was tucked quietly into a larger
measure to finance the Treasury Department and several other
federal agencies. The bill cleared the Republican-controlled House
last week on a largely party-line vote of 212-209 and is awaiting
final action in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not said whether he will sign the measure, but the
concerns raised by the White House are unrelated either to the
retirement sweetener or a $3,800 cost-of-living increase that
lawmakers are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   There was no public debate on the issue in the House. But
Democratic leaders, aware of the delicacy of the matter during an
election year, cautioned lawmakers in advance about it, said
Democratic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed with the votes of 197 Republicans and 15
Democrats. Voting no were 187 Democrats, 20 Republicans and 2
independents.
</P>
<P>
   As the bill originally cleared the House in July, lawmakers
would not have been able to benefit from the provision rolling back
out-of-pocket contributions toward retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But several officials in both parties said that in House-Senate
negotiations, from which Democrats said they were excluded, the
provision was expanded to include lawmakers at the urging of Sen.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee. Stevens' office had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., chairman of the subcommittee that
drafts the Treasury spending measure, said the provision was
designed to roll back increases in out-of-pocket contributions that
were passed into law a few years ago as part of legislation to wipe
out the federal deficit. ''It was decided that federal employees
should do their part by increasing the portion of the retirement
that they pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the budget in surplus -- several years before anticipated --
Kolbe said some lawmakers pressed to scrap increases planned for
2001 and 2002, and instead revert to the contribution rate in
effect when the original law was passed.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., senior Democrat on the subcommittee
that Kolbe chairs, offered the original rollback proposal in
committee, although it did not apply to lawmakers. ''I knew it was
in there,'' he said of the expanded provision. ''I didn't get
involved in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer added, though, ''my own view is that members ought to be
treated like any other federal employee.''
</P>
<P>
   The same measure clears the way for the $3,800 cost-of-living
increase for lawmakers, their third such boost in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, lawmakers receive a cost-of-living increase
in their pay based on the boost Clinton proposes for all federal
workers. The only exception comes when Congress votes to deny
itself the increase.
</P>
<P>
   No such ban passed either House this year when lawmakers were
crafting the Treasury Department spending bill, the measure that
has been used in the past to block congressional pay raises.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders saw to it that a procedural vote was held on the
issue so some lawmakers could say they had registered their
opposition to raising their own pay.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of living increase would amount to 2.7 percent of the
current salary of $141,300.

<HEADLINE> Colon denies fatally beating his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH FORMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - A 20-year-old Waterbury man admitted in
court Tuesday that he hit his girlfriend's 2-year-old daughter
while under the influence of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Ivo Colon denied he killed Keriana Tellado.
</P>
<P>
   Colon is on trial facing capital felony and murder charges.
Prosecutors claim he killed Tellado on July 17, 1998 by smashing
her head repeatedly against a shower wall.
</P>
<P>
   He has testified that Keriana died from falling down stairs in
her mother's Waterbury apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But on the stand Tuesday, Colon said ''it's possible'' he hit
the toddler very hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't know your own strength,'' Colon said, describing his
drug-induced state.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contend Colon was enraged at the prospect of his
girlfriend reuniting with Tellado's father, Francisco Tellado.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason you were so angry at Keriana Tellado ... because
that was the link between your girlfriend, your lover, Virginia
Quintero, and her husband that was getting out of jail?'' Waterbury
State's Attorney John Connelly said. ''You wanted to eliminate that
link.''
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' Colon responded.
</P>
<P>
   But outside the courtroom, Francisco Tellado, the girl's father
said the prosecutor was ''correct.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes me mad (Colon) can't be a man about stuff and admit
what he did was wrong,'' Tellado said. ''The facts point to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colon blames Keriana's death to Quintero. The girl's mother is
charged with failing to protect her daughter and lying to police
about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''Virginia was jealous of me when I went to the street,'' Colon
said, through a Spanish interpreter. ''I would go out with friends
and go to parties. She got upset because she could not leave. She
had to take care of the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Tellado said Quintero would never harm her three
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know Virginia would never hit my kids,'' Tellado added. ''As
much as I hate what she did, there is no way in hell she could have
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly argued that Colon hid Quintero and her three children
in her apartment during much of the summer to prevent anyone from
finding out that he had beat Keriana with his belt, punched her in
the face and twisted her arm to break it.
</P>
<P>
   But public defenders brought in Quintero's landlord, Sam
Procopion, to testify that the doors and windows of her apartment
could easily be opened from the inside. The defense said there was
no way that Quintero was held against her will.
</P>
<P>
   ''If she wanted to leave, she could do whatever she wants,''
Colon said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon, who was 18 at the time of his arrest, admitted to police
he beat both the girl and her sister with a leather belt when they
wet themselves about a week before Keriana died.
</P>
<P>
   The defense was expected to resume its case Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Rising oil prices, low inventory trouble energy secretary  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - With oil prices soaring to a new 10-year high
this week and cold weather fast approaching, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson said Tuesday the Clinton administration is considering
releasing oil from the strategic reserves to combat home heating
oil price spikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''All options are on the table to deal with this issue,''
Richardson said after a meeting with House Democrats. ''The
president has to make the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy officials estimate heating oil costs will jump to $1.31
per gallon this winter, up from $1.19 last winter and 80 cents the
winter before that.
</P>
<P>
   A typical winter home heating oil bill is predicted to cost $901
this year, up from $765 last year, energy officials say. That
figure could rise higher if temperatures are colder than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Those prices could be spiking just as voters head to the polls
in November, which has made the issue a political hot potato.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he was also troubled by low heating oil
inventories, which are 35 percent below last year's level.
</P>
<P>
   After their meeting with Richardson, House Democrats accused
Republicans of playing politics with energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, the squirrels are better prepared for this winter
then the Republicans have allowed the American people to be,'' Rep.
Edward Markey, D-Mass., said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats blamed Republican leaders for failing to pass
legislation in the U.S. Senate reauthorizing the strategic oil
reserve, which technically expired March 31 although it has
continued to be funded. They contend that it would be complicated
for President Clinton to release oil without the Senate's
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   John Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, called that claim ''ludicrous.'' He said Democrats were using
that claim as cover for the president's inaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is heating oil prices are going to be astronomical
because we haven't had an energy policy for eight years now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in the Northeast, including Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., have been pressuring the administration to release oil from
the 570-million-gallon strategic oil reserve since prices began
rising last year. So far, the administration has refused. But
earlier this year Clinton authorized a two-million-barrel heating
oil reserve specifically for the Northeast, where home heating oil
use is the highest.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three percent of New York households use oil for heat -
more than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, a bipartisan group of Northeast lawmakers called
for the early release of $400 million in emergency funds from the
Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to President Clinton, Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, R-New
Hartford, said early release of LIHEAP funds would prevent
households from having to wait two to four weeks after high home
heating bills arrive this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The looming home heating oil problem was one of several issues
Gov. George Pataki discussed in a meeting with the New York
delegation Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Want High-Tech Votes  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush cast themselves
as high-tech champions Tuesday as they competed for cash and
endorsements from Silicon Valley chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president was raising $3 million from about 300 valley
executives, and he assembled a list of 100 industry supporters.
Bush, who has raised twice as much high-tech money as his
Democratic rival for the presidential race, claimed the backing of
400 ''New Economy'' leaders in a San Jose newspaper ad.
</P>
<P>
   In a duel of position papers, each campaign also offered details
on what its candidate would do to promote an industry that has
become a driving force of the nation's economy. And each sought to
demonstrate its support with testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Randlett, the head of Web business-application developer
Red Gorilla, said the Clinton administration's economic record was
enough to keep him in the Democratic fold.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last eight years could not have been better,'' said
Randlett, a longtime Democratic activist in the valley. ''To change
economic policies right now seems foolhardy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Computer Corp., based in Round
Rock, Texas, said, ''In terms of the business climate, what we've
seen here in Texas is that the governor is an ardent supporter of
entrepreneurship and of a free market new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The romancing of Silicon Valley reflects the explosive growth of
the high-tech industry -- and its political and financial clout.
</P>
<P>
   ''New Economy'' businesses have more than doubled their
political contributions just in the past two years, according to
the independent Center for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have made $22.1 million in donations since the
start of last year, with Democrats getting just over half of that.
But in the presidential race, Bush has collected nearly $1 million,
more than double Gore's take.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a lot richer than we used to be,'' said Terry
Christiansen, professor of political science at San Jose State
University. ''It's both the Silicon Valley discovering the
politicians and the politicians discovering Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for the valley was fought Tuesday through policy
documents focusing on the industry's most pressing concerns.
</P>
<P>
   --Privacy: Bush pledged to appoint a federal chief information
officer who would develop and enforce policies to safeguard
personal information on the Internet. Gore called for an
''Electronic Bill of Rights for Privacy,'' guaranteeing consumers
the right to know how and why their personal information is being
collected.
</P>
<P>
   --Foreign workers' visas: To alleviate worker shortages, Gore has
proposed increasing the number of ''H1-B'' visas from 115,000 to
200,000. Bush supports raising it as well but has not proposed a
specific number.
</P>
<P>
   --Exports and national security: Bush has endorsed legislation
that allows firms to export products that are ''already readily
available in foreign or mass markets.'' Gore would take steps to
''avoid unnecessary restrictions on high-tech exports.''
</P>
<P>
   --Internet sales taxes: Bush supports the current moratorium on
such taxes, and would extend it several years. Gore backs a 3-year
moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   For all the promises of new laws and regulations, what many
young entrepreneurs here said they want most is for government to
stay out of the way.
</P>
<P>

   The Palm Pilot-wearing Gore was mingling in Atherton with about
300 high-tech executives Tuesday evening at the home of Eric
Schmidt, CEO of software maker Novell Inc. The event was expected
to raise some $3 million for the Democratic National Committee.

   Five months ago, Gore set a new record for Silicon Valley

   Refusing to concede the high-tech spotlight, the Bush campaign
placed an advertisement in Tuesday's San Jose Mercury News listing

<HEADLINE> Commission warns of cost-gouging in school construction  </HEADLINE>
By SHERRY CONOHAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Widespread cost-gouging and unscrupulous
bidding practices found in the repair of school roofs could
continue when the state's record-setting $8.6 billion school
construction program gets under way, a state agency warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the final report of its three-year probe of school roof
construction, the State Commission of Investigation urged that
stringent oversight measures be established to prevent the problems
from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a huge amount of money being invested in school
construction and renovations and our concern is that the rip-offs
and manipulations we found could easily occur here,'' Leslie Z.
Celentano, chairwoman of the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The school construction law provides $6 billion for the 30
so-called special needs districts designated by the state Supreme
Court. The other $2.6 billion is available for the other districts
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the report, Gov. Christie Whitman asked Attorney
General John J. Farmer Jr. to make recommendations on safeguards
that are needed, including making bidders prequalify.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she asked the state Economic Development Authority,
the state Department of Education, and the Office of the Inspector
General to develop an education program for local school districts
so they aren't victimized by corrupt construction practices.
</P>
<P>
   The school construction law gave the EDA oversight
responsibility for the 30 special needs districts, and about 45
others subject to state monitoring or eligible for financial aid of
55 percent or more of a project's cost.
</P>
<P>
   The SCI report said the oversight responsibilities given the EDA
are not enough. It recommended creating a special unit in the state
Department of Community Affairs to develop model specifications,
review project specifications, oversee construction and enforce
building contracts for all public schools and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   State Inspector General Edward M. Neafsey noted that the SCI
report dealt with roofing projects totaling $37.8 million whereas
the state and school districts will be spending $8.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should heed their warnings,'' Neafsey said. ''Our
office looks forward to working closely with the SCI in getting the
warning out to school districts throughout the state on what to
look for and how to avoid problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph R. Malone III, R-Burlington, the co-sponsor
of the school construction funding law, said it's critical to have
oversight of how the money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're preaching to the choir here,'' he said. ''If it's
misspent or poorly spent, the taxpayers of this state are going to
go nuts - and rightfully so.''

<HEADLINE> Airport construction site evacuated because of fumes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Workers left a construction site at Newark
International Airport for several hours Tuesday after fumes
sickened some of them.
</P>
<P>
   The fumes arose when two construction materials were mixed, said
Allen Morrison, a spokesman for the airport operator, the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It produced some fumes that ultimately led to some people to
complain of headaches and nausea,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 workers asked to be examined at nearby hospitals,
Morrison said. The results of those checks were not available
Tuesday evening, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen workers were working at what had been Terminal C's
hourly parking area when the incident happened about 10:30 a.m., he
said. They were building a new parking facility and additions to
the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   Workers returned about 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   No passengers complained, and terminal operations continued
without interruption, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   What the materials were, and how they came to be mixed, is under
investigation by Port Authority police, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   He could not immediately say if they were combined by accident.

<HEADLINE> Concerns Raised Over Education Theft  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a second major fraud probe this year,
Education Department officials Tuesday couldn't say for sure just
how much money the agency has lost to waste, fraud or abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you there has been a concentrated effort to address
all of the concerns; I can't give an exact dollar figure,''
Lorraine Lewis, the agency's chief inspector told a House Education
and Workforce investigations subcommittee hearing, focusing on the
alleged theft of $1.9 million for schoolchildren who live on Indian
reservations and military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Citing an ongoing investigation, Lewis also said she could not
give details on how grant money for South Dakota schools districts
ended up in at least two Maryland bank accounts this spring. The
money, the Justice Department alleges in civil federal court
filing, was spent on a Cadillac, a Lincoln Navigator and a building
in a Maryland suburb of Washington, and distributed to other
Maryland bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry centered on the latest allegation of theft from its
$34 billion annual budget. Lewis said nearly all of the money and
property had been recovered, but questions about past thefts and
financial missteps resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The department has had trouble clearing its audits, according to
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress,
which by law reviews the books of more than 20 federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a Senate panel considers the rare action of
forcing a GAO audit of the federal agency; House lawmakers approved
a bill in June.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, auditors are asked by individual lawmakers to examine
agency finances, said GAO spokesman Jeff Nelligan.
</P>
<P>
   Education Department officials said Tuesday they've address the
troubles by reviewing its new computer systems and increasing
employee scrutiny, among other actions.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling recent incidents -- including a $1 million employee
theft ring uncovered in March, $77 million in loans forgiven for
falsely claimed deaths or disabilities, more than $150 million in
grants paid twice to the same winners -- lawmakers asked when it all
end, and what has it all cost taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should know the answer to that,'' countered Rep. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's top Democrat, Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind., praised
department efforts, but cautioned officials over the effect of the
scandals: ''I don't want things to take place in Washington or
elsewhere that somehow erode taxpayer confidence in the public
education system.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil action filed in July, the Justice Department alleges
that $1.9 million intended for two South Dakota school districts
was diverted on March 31 into two bank accounts in Upper Marlboro,
Md. Somehow the districts' correct bank account numbers were
substituted on a direct-deposit form submitted to agency officials
and entered into the department's electronic payment system, said
the Justice complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department filing says the money placed into those
two accounts was used to draw cashier's checks to pay $46,900 for a
Cadillac Escalade, more than $50,000 for a Lincoln Navigator and
$135,000 for the building in Maryland. The document says the rest
was diverted into other bank accounts. No criminal charges have
been filed in case yet, said Channing Phillips, spokesman for the
U.S. attorney's office in the District of Columbia. He declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have to empty the pop machines to make payroll, but
it came close,'' said Chris Anderson, superintendent of the
600-student Bennett County Schools system in Martin, S.D., which
along with Wagner Community Schools in Wagner, S.D., was left
waiting a month for its funds.
</P>
<P>
   Impact Aid is a $906 million department-run program meant to
help school districts educate children living on Indian
reservations or military installations. Such places are federal
lands that don't generate the local property taxes that usually
fund local school programs.
</P>
<P>
   Aides for the Senate sponsor of the bill, Tim Hutchinson,
R-Ark., say Senate leaders back the bill. It's not clear whether
President Clinton would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he has no choice,'' said Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich.,
who blames past failed audits for creating an environment ripe for
''waste, fraud and abuse.''

<HEADLINE> Troy State To Make I-A Debut at Neb.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Troy State will make its NCAA Division I-A
football debut next season at top-ranked Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska athletics director Bill Byrne announced Tuesday that
the Alabama school agreed to a two-year series, beginning next
September in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans, ranked No. 1 in Div. I-AA, are moving up to I-A
after this season. They will receive $475,000 for next year's game
and the 2002 season opener, also in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne has been trying to find an opponent for Texas Christian,
which agreed to play Nebraska this year and next, but backed out of
the deal. San Jose State filled this year's opening.
</P>
<P>
   Byrne said it's been difficult to find an opponent who is
willing to come to Lincoln on such short notice. Football schedules
are usually worked out several years in advance.

<HEADLINE> Israel Suspends Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN LAUB
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- After Israel called a time-out in peace talks
on Tuesday -- and then called it off just hours later -- the
Palestinians called their own time-out, saying they wanted an
explanation for Israel's ''confusing'' behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The brinkmanship reflects the deadlock that has characterized
the talks since the collapse of the Camp David summit in July, and
comes as the United States drafts bridging proposals that could be
presented as early as the weekend in a final effort to close the
gaps and conclude a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Palestinian leadership decided not to resume the
negotiations without having an official clarification by the Prime
Minister of Israel about his decisions today, which confused us,''
said a statement released after the senior Palestinian negotiators
briefed Yasser Arafat in the West Bank town of Ramallah. ''First he
asked us to stop the negotiations and later in the evening he asked
us to resume it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, Arafat's top negotiator, said the mood at the
meeting was ''angry.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We informed the Americans and other international parties
about the way the Israelis are behaving,'' Erekat said. ''Israel
can't play with the negotiations. It's very clear they are trying
to find a strategy to get out of the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's security advisor,
Danny Yatom, announced a time-out that would last for a few days at
most, saying the break was needed to assess the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no doubt that the Palestinians need to be not only
good in public relations, but also straightforward in the
negotiations,'' Yatom told Israel army radio, referring to Israeli
complaints that the Palestinians have rolled back on understandings
reached in previous sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Arafat has not budged since the Mideast peace summit
at Camp David in July, which broke down over the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Negotiations will be resumed when Chairman Arafat will be
ready to take the ideas that were raised at Camp David by President
Clinton or the ideas that were raised by the Americans since then
as a basis for negotiation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, within hours, Barak spokesman Gadi Baltiansky was
announcing that Erekat and Israeli negotiator Gilead Sher were to
meet Wednesday to assess the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth angered Palestinians, who said it looked as
if Israel was trying to set them up to take the blame for the
talks' collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat was furious he heard of the offer to meet Sher over the
radio, and not through a call from his counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the United States would not abandon its
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're both feeling the pressure of these hard issues and the
press of time. I don't think it's more complicated than that,''
Clinton said in Washington. ''And as long as they get back to the
work, you should feel positive about it. ... We've just got to keep
working at it, and try to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks are hung up over who will be sovereign over a key
Jerusalem shrine sacred to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims
as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians insist on full control of the shrine, home to
two major mosques marking the spot where tradition says Prophet
Muhammad ascended to heaven. They have said that at most they would
allow symbolic Islamic sovereignty there.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has suggested it is ready to consider less than full
Israeli sovereignty, but has ruled out Palestinian or Islamic
control over the area where the Jewish temple, the most sacred
shrine of Judaism, stood in biblical times.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians have made some progress on core
issues, including the future borders of a Palestinian state and the
fate of Palestinian refugees. Both sides have accused each other in
recent days of rolling back on understandings reached at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have not spoken publicly about compromise
proposals. However, negotiators have said one idea is to transfer
sovereignty over the key Jerusalem shrine to the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians have rejected the proposal, but Israeli media
reports have said Barak was willing to consider the idea.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 139; Dow Falls 19  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rebounded Tuesday on bargain
hunting, giving the Nasdaq composite index its biggest gain in more
than two months. But blue chips struggled through a volatile
session, unable to recover from a month-long slide prompted by
anxiety about corporate profits and rising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's performance represented a partial recovery from the
market's sharp drop of recent sessions, including Monday, when
investor worries about the same issues sent the Dow Jones
industrials and the Nasdaq down more than 100 points each.
</P>
<P>
   The tech-dominated Nasdaq rose 139.12 to 3,865.64, its largest
advance since July 12. But the Dow fell 19.23 to 10,789.29 after
trading in an 80-point range throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which also has a large
representation of high-tech stocks, rose 15.39 to 1,459.90.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts weren't particularly impressed by Tuesday's
improvement, pointing to unresolved questions about oil prices,
which have climbed to levels not seen in a decade. Light, sweet
crude sold Tuesday for $36.51 on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after trading as high as $37 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some call it a rebound, some call it bargain hunting, but on
balance, the uptake in the market leaves a lot to be desired,''
said Alan Ackerman, a senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Hyman, chief investment strategist at Weatherly
Securities, said, ''at least for today, you had the belief by some
investors that technology is much less affected by these energy
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech advance followed what has generally been a down
month for stocks, many of which spiked higher in August as it
became clear that the Federal Reserve was done raising interest
rates for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a fairly horrendous 13-day period, some buyers came into
the Nasdaq looking at some of these growth stocks as cheap,'' Hyman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobalt Networks' shares rose $16.06 to $57.19, a 39 percent
increase, on news it was being acquired by Sun Microsystems in a $2
billion stock deal.
</P>
<P>
   Intel traded up $4 at $60.38 after a Banc of America Securities
analyst reversed his recommendation of a week earlier and upgraded
the chipmaker to ''buy'' from ''market perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' enthusiasm also helped push another chipmaker, Micron
Technology, up $7.19 to $65.19.
</P>
<P>
   And barnesandnoble.com got a $1.38 boost to $5.94 after the
online bookseller announced an exclusive relationship with the
portal Yahoo!. Amazon.com, barnesandnoble.com's chief competitor,
slipped $2.06 to $40.75.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those gains, investors repeated what has become a
pattern this September -- unloading the stocks of companies,
particularly those on the Big Board, that even hint at
disappointing quarterly profits.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are worried about how slower economic growth will
affect earnings. A Commerce Department report released Tuesday
showing lower than expected growth in housing construction was the
latest indication that the economy is moderating.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa fell $1.31 to $25.81 after the aluminum manufacturer
became the latest company to revise its earnings outlook downward
because of rising energy costs and softening demand.
</P>
<P>
   Federal-Mogul dropped $1.25 to $8 after its top officer stepped
down and the auto parts manufacturer warned of lower-than-expected
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings warnings also sent Ingersoll-Rand down $4.06 to $35.69,
after the tool and machinery maker predicted lower profits because
of weakness in the euro, Europe's chief currency, and lower demand.
</P>
<P>
   Energy stocks, which advanced Monday as oil prices gained,
drifted lower on profit-taking. Exxon Mobil was down $1.65 at $88
and Baker Hughes fell $1.52 to $36.13. Enron dropped $4.26 to
$85.36.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dow Jones utilities average, which tracks utility
stocks, fell 4.12 percent as investors took profits on one of the
few market sectors that has shown fairly consistent growth this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers on the New York
Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.22 billion shares,
ahead of the 1.16 billion shares in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index rose 6.63 to 523.31.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.39 percent.
European stocks were mixed, with Germany's DAX index rising 0.67
percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 falling 0.10 percent, and France's
CAC-40 up 1.12 percent.

<HEADLINE> Senate Speeds Up Visa Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate resuscitated legislation Tuesday to
let computer software and other high-tech companies bring in more
workers. It still faces high hurdles: some lawmakers are determined
to tie it to other immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   Senators decided 97-1 -- only Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., voted
against -- to force a vote later this week on whether they should
consider the popular high-tech worker visa bill known as H1B.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats want amendments, however, to deal with other
immigration questions, mainly involving Hispanics. Republicans say
if Democrats succeed, it probably will kill the popular measure for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are under way. ''We're still talking,'' said John
Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss. ''We're taking it one step at a time,'' said Ranit
Schmelzer, spokesman for the minority leader, Sen. Tom Daschle,
D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton predicted Saturday that Congress would pass
the bill and did not mention linkages to other immigration issues.
</P>
<P>
   The House has yet to consider the H1B visa bill, but ''if the
Senate can pull a clean H1B bill through, I think it would
facilitate our ability in the House,'' House Majority Leader Dick
Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   The House members pushed through three immigration bills
Tuesday, including one to stop what some lawmakers called unfair
deportation of aliens for past crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress broadened the number of crimes that would
trigger deportation and included retroactivity provisions, which
led to the deportation of some noncitizens who had steered clear of
trouble after earlier minor brushes with the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under current law, many legal residents can be deported for
minor offenses that were not deportable offenses when they pled
guilty to them,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, a supporter of
fixing the 1996 law. ''The bill will bring sensible relief for
those who have paid for past infractions and will give people a
chance to remain in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which now goes to the Senate, also would allow aliens
deported for minor offenses under the 1996 law to appeal for the
right to return.
</P>
<P>
   The House also decided to make it easier for foreign-born
adoptees to get American citizenship, including automatic
citizenship for some, and extended until 2003 a program that sets
aside 10,000 visas a year for foreign religious workers to conduct
activities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   H1B visas allow skilled workers to enter the United States for
specified periods to do specific jobs for which employers say
American workers are unavailable. The technology industry says the
need is as high as 300,000 a year. Labor unions say the high-tech
industry recruits overseas mainly to hire a less expensive work
force than Americans provide.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would increase the number of visas for each of
the next three years to 200,000 a year. Otherwise, the current
115,000 falls to 107,500 in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 and
65,000 a year after that.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bill's popularity, it ran into problems when Clinton
said in May that any visa increase had to be linked to the changes
involving Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders insist the two questions have nothing to do
with each other and should be considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment would offer permanent residence to political
refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Haiti similar to
that granted people from Cuba and Nicaragua. Another amendment
would grant amnesty for illegal immigrants who have lived in the
United States since 1986. The current registry deadline is 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president believes that we can and should do both of those
things,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday. ''And we'll continue
to work to get both of those things done.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 2045.

<HEADLINE> Slight Progress in Budget Battle  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican leaders said Tuesday that they
would address Clinton administration demands for more money for the
Internal Revenue Service amid signs of slight progress in Congress'
budget battle with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With the Oct. 1 start of fiscal 2001 less than two weeks away,
bargaining was underway among lawmakers, White House aides and
staff on many of the 11 unsigned spending bills that finance
federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the bills -- both covering defense -- have become law.
Republicans would like to adjourn Congress by mid-October in time
for the final weeks of the presidential and congressional
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of work to do,'' said White House budget chief
Jack Lew.
</P>
<P>
   Lew spoke as he emerged from a bargaining session with
Republicans over education, one of the highest profile disputes.
But he could as well have been describing the task that remains on
the entire budget front.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate debated a near-$33 billion measure that would provide
$30.4 billion for the Treasury Department and smaller agencies, and
$2.5 billion for Congress' own operations. Passage was expected on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   That measure contained $8.6 billion for the IRS, about $300
million below President Clinton's latest request. Because of
spending shortfalls on that and counterterrorism programs that
Clinton wants, White House officials have called the bill
''unacceptable'' but not used the word ''veto.'' Instead, they have
indicated that the money could be provided in later bills --
something that top GOP senators said they could do, though they
used no figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are sympathetic to that,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also repeal the 3 percent federal tax on
telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   And it would let members of Congress receive a $3,800 pay raise,
or 2.7 percent, putting their salaries at $145,100 beginning in
January. More than 1,000 top executive branch officials -- starting
with the vice president -- would receive the same percentage
increase.
</P>
<P>
   On other budget fronts, Republicans were putting final touches
on a proposed measure financing the Interior Department and
cultural programs.
</P>
<P>
   Participants speaking on condition of anonymity said the
proposal would provide about $500 million less than the $970
million Clinton wants for purchasing new federal, state and local
park lands. The measure would also provide $1.75 billion for
battling forest fires, said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., an author
of the bill, compared to Clinton's $1.6 billion request.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also include language the administration has
opposed blocking proposed restrictions on the use of land in the
Northwest's Columbia River basin, and exempting New Hampshire's
White Mountains from policies aimed at limiting logging.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring their resolve on the issue, the House voted 401-20
to again pass a measure aimed at using 90 percent of next year's
projected budget surplus to pay down public debt.
</P>
<P>
   The debt bill, which also passed the House on Monday, was
attached to a measure that would expand retirement savings in hopes
of increasing the likelihood that the Senate will consider it.

<HEADLINE> China Vote Sets Stage for New Era  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Final congressional passage of landmark
legislation to normalize trade relations with China sets the stage
for a new era of economic engagement with the world's most populous
country, supporters of the action said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics said the upcoming effort to hasten the demise of
China's one-party communist rule with a dose of good old fashioned
American capitalism could be a long and difficult struggle.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, was emphasizing the positive Tuesday
as he savored the 83-15 Senate vote that cleared the measure that
ended two decades of annual congressional review of China's trade
privileges. He said the action would ''extend economic prosperity
at home and promote economic freedom in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made economic engagement one of the hallmarks
of his presidency, said that normalized trade ties with China will
''strengthen those within China who fight for higher labor
standards, a cleaner environment, for human rights and the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   That view could prove simplistic, however, according to China
experts who said America's battles to open China were in some ways
just beginning with the expanded trade opportunities that will come
once China joins the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real struggle now lies ahead of us in trying to get China
to obey the rules of the WTO,'' said Greg Mastel, a China expert at
the New America Foundation, a Washington research organization. He
said other difficult issues that have long strained relations
between the two countries are not going away either.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will still have all sorts of disputes on human rights,
Taiwan and trade,'' he said. ''Permanent normal trade relations
will not be the solution to all of our problems in China.''
</P>
<P>
   And the economic benefits from the legislation may also be hard
to see -- especially in the bottom-line, the trade deficit between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   A major government study done on the issue by the U.S.
International Trade Commission predicted that America's huge
deficit with China, which hit a record $68.7 billion last year,
second only to Japan, will widen even with all of the
market-opening offers China has made to get into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The ITC report predicted that American exporters will benefit
from the lower tariffs on farm goods and manufactured products,
forecasting a rise in U.S. exports of 10 percent in the first year
of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study predicted Chinese exports to the United
States would rise as well, going up by 7 percent, as Chinese
companies become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   And since China sells $6 in toys and shoes and other products to
the United States for every $1 America sells in China, ($81.8
billion in Chinese imports to the United States vs. $13.1 billion
in U.S. exports to China) the trade gap under the percentage
increases forecast by the ITC will widen.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the trade deal used the ITC figures to predict a
loss of 872,000 jobs over the next decade as Chinese imports make
bigger in-roads into the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions charged that American businesses were fighting for
the deal because of the opportunities it would open to move more
high-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs to China to take advantage of
low wages.
</P>
<P>
   But trade experts say the bigger economic upheaval from the
agreement will occur in China.
</P>
<P>
   If China follows the advice of reformers and tears down its high
trade barriers, it faces the prospect of massive unemployment in
its huge, inefficient state-owned businesses. Some studies suggest
as many as 14 million people may be thrown out of work over the
next five years in rural and urban areas of China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and its allies in business are counting on
the reforms going forward, despite the temporary dislocations,
because of a belief that China has a strong desire to take its
rightful place as one of the leading economies of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   On the political side, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have
some fence mending to do within their own party. Democrats in the
Senate and House who voted for the China bill did so over the
determined opposition of organized labor, a key party constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta insisted after the Senate
vote Tuesday that labor will unite behind Democratic candidates in
November because of the strong desire to retain the White House and
take over the GOP-controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
also favors the China trade normalization.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exporters will not start seeing the benefits of China's
market-opening offers until the country is admitted into the
Geneva-based WTO, which sets the rules for world trade.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said that
could still occur this year after final negotiations with all
countries at the WTO are complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are shooting for and what we believe is achievable is
to have the WTO vote on both China's and Taiwan's accession this
year,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Nader: Social Security Is Solid  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Ralph Nader said Social Security has an
''extremely solid'' economic base and on Tuesday urged George W.
Bush and Al Gore to stop trying to convince the public that the
retirement program is headed for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea that Social Security is going to run out of money is
simply nonsense,'' Nader, the Green Party presidential candidate,
said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The program has an ''extremely solid'' economic base that will
provide benefits until 2037, even under the ''pessimistic''
assumptions by Social Security trustees who use a 1.7 percent
average annual growth rate to estimate their projections, Nader
said. He said that growth rate is about half the average over the
last century.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said the program would have enough money to pay out
reduced benefits, indexed to inflation, for about 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Social Security does not need to be saved, it needs to be
improved, which can be done by calmly making gradual changes,'' he
said. ''Panic fueled by opportunistic politicians and investment
firms poses the only serious threat to the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader criticized as ''unsound policy'' a proposal by Bush, the
Republican candidate, to allow workers to divert a portion of their
payroll taxes that fund Social Security into the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ''Advocates of privatization assume that the stock market will
continue to grow rapidly, while simultaneously assuming that
overall economic growth will plunge sharply,'' he said. ''They
can't have it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Privatization also fails to address program costs, he said,
pointing to such systems in Chile and Britain that spend nearly 20
percent of their revenues on overhead costs such as advertising and
executive bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Nader proposed gradual changes, such as adjusting the benefit
formula for widows and widowers or other poverty-prone individuals.
He also suggested raising the income cap on Social Security taxes,
or expanding the tax to include executive bonuses and stock
options.

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Campaign For Bush  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When George W. Bush's sister visited a New
Jersey senior citizens center this week, his campaign planned to
have her shake a few hands and leave. ''No. I don't think so,''
objected Gov. Christie Whitman, who added a speaking engagement.
</P>
<P>
   It is the latest example of Republican governors taking more
control of the presidential campaigns in their states, partly due
to frustration with the Bush headquarters in Texas. Calling the
governors a major asset, Bush advisers say they had planned all
along to turn state leaders loose in September.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the governors are now out in force against
Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   John Engler of Michigan, Jim Gilmore of Virginia and Mike
Huckabee of Arkansas appeared on weekend news shows on Bush's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Engler, Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Bob Taft of Ohio and Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin had news conferences Monday to promote Bush's
new ''blueprint'' for middle-class voters.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Bill Owens conducted a telephone news conference
Tuesday to criticize the vice president's school plans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Gov. Paul Cellucci of Massachusetts gave
failing marks to Gore's ''education report card,'' and Montana Gov.
Marc Racicot blamed Clinton-Gore administration policies for
allowing the spread of fires that devoured forests in the West.
</P>
<P>
   A number of GOP governors, including George Pataki of New York,
Thompson and Whitman herself, plan to travel outside their states
for Bush, the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are tremendously popular in their states and bring a
great deal of credibility to our arguments,'' said Bush strategist
Karl Rove.
</P>
<P>
   With state electoral votes the key to winning the White House,
Bush could benefit from Republican dominance in state capitals.
There are 30 Republican, 18 Democratic and two independent
governors. Republicans govern in 15 of the 24 most competitive
states -- states in which voters have switched party allegiance in
the last three presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Govs. Gray Davis of California, Parris Glendening of
Maryland and Tom Carper of Delaware have campaigned for the vice
president, but they're greatly outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several Republican governors and their staffs have
complained in recent weeks that Bush isn't taking advantage of
them. The Austin team doesn't put governors on national TV enough,
doesn't listen to advice urging Bush to attack Gore, moves slowly
to book surrogates in their states and burdens the busy politicians
with unnecessary briefings, or so the complaints go.
</P>
<P>
   The grumbling coincided with Gore's surge in polls. It has
subsided somewhat, now that governors are getting -- or taking --
more responsibility and the race shows signs of remaining tight.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also is at odds with a number of GOP governors for
proposing a quick-fix prescription drug plan involving states. The
governors have kept quiet, hoping to iron out their difference once
Bush gets in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a sense that there's been some missed opportunities,''
Engler said, adding that the Bush campaign began to ''share some of
the load'' with governors this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides say governors were understandably anxious to help,
but the campaign bided its time until voters were paying attention.
Acting sooner would have wasted money and energy, the aides say.
</P>
<P>
   Engler recently took over surrogate operations in Michigan; his
staff lines up state department heads and other Bush allies for
local interviews and appearances, as well as coordinating campaign
trips by allies from outside Michigan. Rove will soon visit
Michigan, where GOP activists plan to urge him to sharpen attacks
against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is looking for assistance from Washington, as well as the
states. He recently hired Capitol Hill veteran Ed Gillespie to help
shape his message.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats are totally scripted for all assorted different
avenues of attack and are incredibly disciplined, with them all
saying the same thing,'' Engler said. ''The Republicans haven't
approached things from that perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman was one of three GOP governors who attended the
Democratic National Convention to respond to criticism of Bush. She
said the Bush campaign normally seeks her staff's guidance when a
surrogate comes to New Jersey on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's younger sister, Doro Bush Koch, visited Monday and the
original schedule had her stopping by a senior citizens center to
shake hands and do nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way they were going and I said, 'No. I don't think
so,''' Whitman said. ''I thought that would be a waste of time so
we set it up so she could have a speaking opportunity before 200
people.''

<HEADLINE> With BC-NJ--School Roofs, Bjt  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The major findings in the State
Commission
of Investigations probe of school roof construction:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -Conflicts of Interest/Professional Misrepresentation: Project
design consultants presumed by district officials and boards of
education to be independent experts have been secretly compensated
by roofing material suppliers. Hundreds of thousands of dollars in
payments were funneled by a major roofing materials manufacturer to
a consultant who repeatedly wrote project specifications favoring
the firm's projects.
</P>
<P>
   -Manipulation of Public Bidding and Contracting: Design
consultants, working in secret partnership with manufacturers and
suppliers of roofing materials, routinely crafted ''proprietary''
project specifications that favor a given set of projects, thus
eliminating competition in the awarding of contracts.
</P>
<P>
   -Questions of Safety: In some instances, project plans were
drawn or merely copied by individuals who were not licensed
architects. In others, no design professionals were utilized at
all. Less expensive and sometimes interior roofing products were
used in place of specified materials without knowledge of the
school district.
</P>
<P>
   -Inadequate Oversight: Ranking school district officials placed
millions of taxpayer dollars at the disposal of consultants,
contractors and roofing manufacturers' sales representatives
without asking the most basic questions about their qualifications
and possible connections. District officials responsible for roof
maintenance struck up social relationships with roofing
consultants.
</P>
<P>
   -Improper Labor Practices/Payroll and Tax Violations: In some
instances, contractors were able to secure school roofing work by
submitting low bids secretly conditioned on the fact that their
laborers would be paid substantially less than the legally mandated
prevailing wage. Certified payroll forms submitted in connection
with school roofing projects were replete with phony employee
social security numbers and false data relative to hours worked and
hourly wage rates paid.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Releases Injured Brown  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Orlando Brown, who hasn't played since his
right eye was struck by a referee's penalty flag last season, was
released Tuesday by the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Brown sustained permanent damage to his right eye in a game
against the Jacksonville Jaguars on Dec. 19.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7, 350-pound offensive tackle dropped to one knee in
pain and staggered toward the sideline. He came back onto the field
and shoved referee Jeff Triplette to the ground. Brown said he
became enraged because he was afraid of going blind. His father
lost his sight to glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have had a difficult time putting him back on the
field in view of his personal concerns and his inability to recover
from the injury,'' Browns coach Chris Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year veteran was initially suspended indefinitely, but
the NFL lifted its penalty in February. The team placed Brown on
the physically-unable-to-perform list Aug. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said previously that he blamed the league for his
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't the Browns,'' he said. ''I just hope they (the
league) take up their part of the bargain. I don't think they can
go around hurting people and taking people out by hurting them and
not want to take care of them. I don't think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been unable to lift weights or run since being
injured. Last month, he said he still has blurred vision, but said
he hoped to play again.
</P>
<P>
   He retained lawyer Johnnie Cochran Jr. to explore the
possibility of a lawsuit against the league.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's agent, Tom Condon, did not return a message seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Team president Carmen Policy said the decision to release Brown
was done in stages. But when team doctors said Brown would not be
able to play in the 2000 season, the Browns felt they had no other
recourse but to let him go.
</P>
<P>
   ''The symptoms have not subsided and we do not think he is close
to being approved by the doctors to return to play,'' Policy said.
''We are convinced that there is absolutely no light at the end of
the tunnel in terms of Orlando returning to the playing field in
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy referred to Brown's situation as a ''human tragedy'' and
said the team would continue to provide emotional support for
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried about him, and everybody connected to the
Cleveland Browns is worried about him,'' Policy said. ''We want the
best for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy said that if Brown was medically cleared to play and
wanted to come back with Cleveland, the Browns would welcome him.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was the only player on Cleveland's roster who also played
for the Browns before former owner Art Modell took his team to
Baltimore in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Cuban Plane Crashes  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- A small plane that left Cuba with 10
people aboard Tuesday was hijacked before it crashed into the Gulf
of Mexico, authorities said. One man was killed and the others were
found clinging to debris and rescued by a cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
   The crew of the Chios Dream, a Panamanian-registered freighter,
recovered one body and the survivors -- three men, three women and
three children -- from rough seas nearly 300 miles off the Florida
coast about five hours after the plane took off, the U.S. Coast
Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   One man had severe head and neck injuries. A Coast Guard cutter
planned to meet the freighter Tuesday night and pick up the
survivors. The most seriously injured were to be flown to Key West
for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Details of who was on the flight and where it was going were
unclear late Tuesday. It was unknown whether the plane ran out of
fuel; the Coast Guard said it was heading west -- away from both
Florida and Cuba -- when it went down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently it was hijacked, and the pilot indicated they only
had 1&AMP;frac12; hours fuel,'' said Lauren Gail Stover, associate director of
Miami-Dade County Aviation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Antonov AN-2 Colt took off from Herradura Airport in Pinar
del Rio, in Cuba's western province. Based on the last radar
location given by Cuban air traffic controllers and an emergency
beacon signal picked up by a U.S. AWACS plane, the Colt was
believed to have gone down about 90 miles southwest of Key West,
U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors, however, were pulled from the water more than 200
miles west of that area, the Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard Rear Adm. Thad Allen said he is ''not really sure''
why there was such a vast discrepancy between where the plane was
believed to have crashed and where it actually did.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a lot of these cases, as they emerge, there is a lot of
confusion,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials initially reported that as many as 18 people
were on the plane, but Allen said the survivors told the ship's
crew that only 10 were aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic control in Havana notified the air traffic control
center in Miami at 8:45 a.m. that the aircraft reported a possible
hijacking, said Kathleen Bergen, a Federal Aviation Administration
spokeswoman in Atlanta. The plane headed west out of Cuba, and
contact was lost 15 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA had no voice or radar contact with the aircraft, Bergen
said. The Pentagon also said it had no radar contact with the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The AWACS plane based at Tinker Air Force base in Oklahoma was
on a training mission when it picked up the beacon and was diverted
to the Coast Guard search.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Zavala, a supervisor at Cuba's Institute of Civil
Aeronautics in Havana, said by telephone the plane was used for
agricultural work. He declined to provide any other details.
</P>
<P>
   The long-range single-engine bush plane is used for passenger
flights, crop-dusting and forest fire suppression. U.S. officials
initially described the Russian-made plane as a sea plane.
</P>
<P>
   A similar aircraft was stolen by its pilot and four other Cubans
on June 19, 1991. That plane landed safely at Miami International
Airport, directed in by air traffic controllers who had both radar
and radio contact with the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The 1966 U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act allows Cubans who reach U.S.
soil to apply for U.S. residency. The communist government in Cuba
says the law violates 1994 and 1995 migration accords with the
United States aimed at encouraging orderly, legal immigration.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Home Visits Not Preventing Abuse  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Regular visits by nurses to the homes of
low-income, unmarried teen-age mothers may not be as effective at
preventing child abuse as previously thought, new research
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   The visits had little effect in homes where the mothers were
routinely threatened or beaten by their partners -- and such
domestic violence was present in one-fifth of the homes studied.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors initially studied home visits in Elmira,
N.Y., more than 20 years ago, and those studies contributed to the
development of similar experiments in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   While disappointing to social welfare activists who considered
the Elmira program evidence of a promising solution to a troubling
problem, the results may not necessarily apply to other programs,
the authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Elmira is a semirural community in upstate New York and the
participants were high-risk women who may have experienced more
domestic violence than women in a more heterogenous population, the
authors said in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they said their findings may help others develop more
successful home-visit programs.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers examined data on 324 Elmira mothers and their
children who took part in the initial study between 1978 and 1980.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year follow-up, previously reported, showed that women who
received regular counseling-oriented visits from nurses during
their pregnancies and first two years of their children's lives had
reported substantially fewer instances of child maltreatment than
women who had no visits.
</P>
<P>
   In their new analysis of the data, the authors found that nearly
half of the women -- 48 percent -- reported some form of domestic
violence during the follow-up, and the benefits of the home visits
in preventing child abuse decreased as the frequency of domestic
violence increased.
</P>
<P>
   The authors theorized that violent men in the battered women's
lives might have also abused their children. They also suggested
that batterings may have compromised the mothers' caregiving
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the same periodical called the results
significant given the increasing popularity of home-visit programs
prompted in part by the Elmira experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The number of children served by home visits nationwide more
than doubled in the 1990s, to at least 550,000 last year.

Senate OKs China Trade Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate voted 83-15 today to approve normal trade
status for China, the biggest step in U.S.-China relations since President
Nixon's 1972 visit. The vote marked a turning point in a half-century of stormy
relations with the world's most-populous nation. The approval effectively ends
the annual debate over whether trade should be used as a tool to sanction
China's communist government for its weapons and human rights policies.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has received about 800
additional reports of tire tread separation, blowouts and other problems with
Firestone tires since the government last updated the numbers on Aug. 31, the
agency said. It said there now have been reports of more than 400 injuries.

   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- A single-engine plane taking off from Cuba was
hijacked this morning and it crashed in the Gulf of Mexico: The Coast Guard said
one body was recovered and nine survivors -- three men, three women and three
children -- were pulled from the wreckage by the crew of a cargo ship, the Chios

   CHICAGO (AP) -- George W. Bush told Oprah Winfrey and her millions of female
TV viewers that he gave up drinking at age 40 because alcohol ''was beginning to

and raised his right hand, as if taking the presidential oath. Both Republican
Bush and Democrat Al Gore -- who had answered her questions a week earlier --

10-point lead in a new poll in Arizona, where Bush, the Republican, held a
14-point lead in May. Gore had a 2-to-1 lead among women while he and Bush were
about even among men in the poll. Bush has a 17-point lead in Nebraska, the same

Study: Mammograms Don't Reduce Deaths

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Annual mammogram screening for breast cancer among women
over 50 does not reduce the rate of death from the disease when compared to
women who receive competent physical breast examinations alone, according to a
large Canadian study. The study shows that women who are unable or unwilling to
get mammograms can protect themselves equally well from breast cancer death by
getting thorough annual physical breast examinations, said Dr. Cornelia J.
Baines of the University of Toronto. Baines is co-author of a study appearing

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Looks at Special Teams  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG ALDEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Top-ranked Nebraska isn't about to let
sloppy special teams play jeopardize its quest for a national
title.
</P>
<P>
   The kicking game has been the only weakness for the Huskers
(2-0), who have allowed just three offensive touchdowns this
season. They've given up just one fewer on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it will be important for us to start winning the
special teams game,'' coach Frank Solich said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams jumped to the top of Solich's priority list Sept.
9 when Nebraska visited Notre Dame. The Huskers looked to be headed
for a comfortable victory when the Irish returned a kickoff and
punt for fourth-quarter touchdowns that forced overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska went on to win 27-24, but the fact that the Irish were
able to break through the Huskers kick coverage at all, let alone
twice, alarmed Solich and his staff heading into the off week.
</P>
<P>
   So in addition to getting a head start on preparing for Iowa,
the Huskers spent a lot of time on the kickoffs, punts and extra
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were not playing at a level where we needed to play at in
any one of those areas,'' he said. ''To be able to win a football
game against a quality team like Notre Dame and play the way we did
on special teams against them is a credit to our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich thinks that through a few personnel changes, which he
won't identify, and a new look or two he expects a sound kicking
performance Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers will be tested right away by Iowa's Kahlil Hill, a
return threat Nebraska didn't have to face in last year's
season-opening 42-7 victory in Iowa City.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, a junior who was suspended for his sophomore season,
returned two punts and a kickoff for touchdowns in 1998. Hill
hasn't broken one for a score yet this year, but is averaging 25.9
yards on kickoff returns and 14 yards on punts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have made improvement, but to say that it will go
from where it was to those areas being perfect is maybe a
stretch,'' he said. ''But what we expect to see is vast
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after such the emotional win at Notre Dame, won on Eric
Crouch's touchdown run in overtime, Solich was happy to give up the
momentum in favor of balancing the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers' traditionally strong running game is its usual
self, averaging 389.5 yards. But the passing attack is down, even
for Nebraska. Crouch is just 11-for-25 with three interceptions and
has the Huskers only passing TD.
</P>
<P>
   With receivers like Matt Davison, Tracey Wistrom and Bobby
Newcombe, Crouch said the numbers should improve.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've only thrown the ball 25 times. That's not too many
throws to judge it by,'' he said. ''We have the talent and ability
to move the ball on every play. I know we need to get better at
passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich wants to throw more, but doesn't plan on opening up the
offense too much. He wants Crouch throwing around 20-25 passes per
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're forced to put the ball in the air as many as 30
times, generally in Nebraska's system that means you're in
trouble,'' Solich said.
</P>
<P>
   The offense could get a well-rounded workout against the
Hawkeyes, who didn't win a Big Ten game last year and are off to an
0-3 start. Iowa is allowing 161 rushing yards and 261 passing.
</P>
<P>
   But Crouch remembers the Hawkeyes held the Huskers to just a
touchdown in the first half of last year's game.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a physical football team,'' Crouch said. ''Just
because they're 0-3 doesn't mean we're not going to be facing their
best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskers also used the week off to heal up, although they got
out of Notre Dame without any serious injuries. Senior I-backs Dan
Alexander (knee, ankle) and Correll Buckhalter (knee) didn't
practice last week, but are expected to be ready for the Hawkeyes.

<HEADLINE> David Wells' Start Pushed Back  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- David Wells was pushed back in Toronto's rotation
because he has gout in his right big toe and was rescheduled to
pitch against the New York Yankees on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Trachsel, 7-13 with a 4.74 ERA this season, took Wells'
place for Tuesday's series opener, pitching against Andy Pettitte
(18-7).
</P>
<P>
   ''It started bothering David on Monday morning,'' Toronto
manager Jim Fregosi said. ''He got on his medication right away,
but it's still bothering him a great deal today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gout is the result of a build up of uric acid in the blood. It's
hereditary, but it also can be caused by eating rich foods and
drinking alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Wells refused to talk about it to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, 19-6 with a 4.15 ERA, pitched against Pettitte last
Thursday at Yankee Stadium. Neither got a decision as Toronto won
3-2 in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The 37 year-old left-hander, still vying for his 20th win after
three tries, will make three more starts this season if he's able
to pitch Thursday. If he's pushed back further, he'll have two
starts to accomplish the feat for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   The injury comes at a bad time for the Blue Jays, who entered
the day 3&AMP;frac12; games back of Cleveland in the AL wild card race.
</P>
<P>
   This past weekend, the Blue Jays lost starters Chris Carpenter
and Joey Hamilton to injuries. Carpenter is likely done for the
season after being struck in the face by a ball, and Hamilton is
questionable for his next start with a sore right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's nothing you can do about it,'' Fregosi said. ''It's
unfortunate because Carpenter was just starting to throw the ball
like he can.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Music Copyright Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House leaders on Tuesday approved a bill
reversing a measure that could have prevented artists from
reclaiming ownership of their old recordings from record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers last year backed a four-line amendment to copyright
law that changed a law artists say gives them ownership of their
''sound recordings'' 35 years after they debut. After protests from
musicians, the House unanimously passed a bill returning the law to
its former state Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great day for musicians who write their own music,''
said Rep. John Conyers, D-Ill. The Senate has not yet considered
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The furor started last year when a House panel approved a change
in copyright law that had been slipped into a bill without a public
hearing. It said that music and other ''sound recordings'' were
hired work, meaning that the performer had no right to reclaim
ownership from his or her record label.
</P>
<P>
   The change was made without a hearing or public debate because
House and Senate staffers, along with the U.S. Copyright Office,
believed that it simply wrote into law what had become a common
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But recording artists like Don Henley, Jimmy Buffett and Earl
Scruggs saw red, believing they faced big losses in potential
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both parties will now breathe easier, the artists and the
recording companies,'' said U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill passes, the law would revert to its former state and
musicians and recording companies might have to litigate to decide
who the original music belongs to.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said from the beginning we did not intend to change the law
and have worked diligently to assure that the issue of work for
hire is resolved without prejudice to anyone's position,'' said
Hilary Rosen, president and CEO of the Recording Industry
Association of America. ''The book needs to be closed on this issue
so we can get back to a united industry on so many important
challenges of the day.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Golf Has Supporters, Foes  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   The closest golf has come to the Olympics this side of 1904 is
Greg Norman and Karrie Webb carrying the torch in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   And Tiger Woods using his golf club for a javelin in a
television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   For a sport that has been around more than 500 years -- certainly
longer than water polo and table tennis -- it seems an injustice
that the best players in the world cannot compete for the gold once
every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton, who wrapped himself in the Stars &AMP; Stripes during
his stellar play in the Ryder Cup, tried to imagine what it would
be like to stand on a podium as the national anthem played and the
flag was raised.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would mean a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what would mean more? A gold medal around his neck or a
green jacket over his shoulders?
</P>
<P>
   A medal or a claret jug?
</P>
<P>
   Just about every Olympic sport brings together the absolute best
from countries in even the most remote corners of the globe. What
happens when golf comes to the Olympics, but Tiger Woods doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be like any other competition in golf,'' PGA Tour
commissioner Tim Finchem said. ''If everybody played, it would be
stronger. If not everybody played, it wouldn't be as strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics need golf a lot more than golf needs the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Golf already has its four major championships. For
pressure-packed qualify, international strife and dispute over
commercialism, it has the Ryder Cup. For those left out, it has the
Presidents Cup. For global competition, it has the World Golf
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule is crammed already. The competition is spread
across the planet, from America to Asia, from Europe to Australia.
Not everyone goes everywhere, and most are driven by the almighty
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it would be a big priority in our game, just
because we have four major championships with equal significance
every single year,'' said Woods, who already has said he's not
going to Australia for the Match Play Championship in January.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of those athletes, that is the pinnacle,'' he said.
''Now, if we had majors that were once every four years, you throw
the Olympics in there, it would have quite a bit of significance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not an opinion shared by everyone, least of all Norman,
who called it a ''crying shame'' that golf has been left out for so
long.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's time to take off the blinders and just see how
popular the game of golf really is on a global basis,'' Norman
said. ''It deserves to be in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will. And maybe it will be a huge success, even
without Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Last month in Berlin, David Fay of the U.S. Golf Association and
Peter Dawson of the Royal &AMP; Ancient received approval to recast
another Olympic proposal. They are joint secretaries of the World
Amateur Golf Council, which the IOC recognizes as the official
federation for golf.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the year, people have looked at the notion of Olympic
golf and said, 'Why should we do it?''' Fay told Golf World
magazine. ''That frustrates me. I ask, 'Why shouldn't we do it?' I
haven't come up with one reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's two.
</P>
<P>
   Try squeezing yet another tournament into an already crowded
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''As one of the older guys that believes in tradition and has
watched the Olympics all my life, I personally would like to see
it,'' Sutton said. ''But I don't know what the younger players
would think. They're doing so much now, I don't know they want to
add more tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   The other issue is television.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most other Olympic sports, it's difficult to present golf
in 10-minute packages. And given the size of the arena, it's
expensive to produce. That's one reason the PGA Tour has been so
lukewarm to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a part of the Olympics has its appeal,'' Finchem said.
''It just has to be done the right way. We're always open to
talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA Tour is doing more than just talking.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Ty Votaw conferred with his board and his players,
then fired off a letter to Fay offering full support and
cooperation to add golf to the Olympics. Webb and Meg Mallon are
among those who told Votaw they liked the idea of golfing for gold.
</P>
<P>
   The only obstacle would be rearranging the schedule, something
Votaw has had to tackle just about every year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it makes more sense for the LPGA to get involved with
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this would only be an extension of what the LPGA has
become, which is a world tour,'' Votaw said Tuesday afternoon.
''What greater world event is there than the Olympics? Having my
players walk into an Olympic Stadium with the Korean team or
Canadian team or Australian team would be the thrill of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something we're going to work on trying to do.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Worker Compensation Urged  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration on Tuesday endorsed
swift enactment of a compensation plan for nuclear weapons plant
workers sickened on the job.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Floyd
Spence, R-S.C., Energy Secretary Bill Richardson asked that a
compensation program be passed as part of an unrelated military
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson supported guaranteed funding for the compensation,
requiring the government to pay the benefits, regardless of cost,
without gaining approval each year through the congressional
appropriations process.
</P>
<P>
   Some House Republicans are reluctant to create any new benefits
entitlement, and the administration's own budget office has
expressed concern about the unpredictable long-term cost.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional negotiators had been waiting for weeks for the
administration to clarify its position. House Republicans who
favored more study had been citing disagreement between the Energy
Department and the Office of Management and Budget as reason to
hold off on a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's top health official said prospects for
achieving agreement on a compensation program had brightened.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it has a very good shot,'' said Dr. David Michaels.
''I think politically there's enough support to make this work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a Senate-passed
compensation plan could cost about $2.4 billion over the first five
years.
</P>
<P>
   After running into resistance from House Republicans, the
administration and the program's Senate backers proposed changes
that would bring the five-year cost down to about $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes under discussion:
</P>
<P>
   -- Reducing the sick workers' cash benefit from a minimum of
$200,000, as passed by the Senate, to $100,000. There was no clear
consensus Tuesday on whether that $100,000 would be the total paid
to each eligible worker or the minimum, House and Senate aides
said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Giving workers with life-threatening beryllium disease more
benefits than those with beryllium sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   -- Limiting all benefits to only those who worked in the weapons
complex at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's letter said the Clinton administration strongly
supports compensation for workers exposed to radiation or
beryllium. He made no mention of miners who breathed lung-clogging
silica while digging tunnels under the Nevada Test Site.
</P>
<P>
   Michaels said that's because the administration hasn't ''sent
its recommendations on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said it was a victory for the
administration not to speak out against compensating the miners.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were originally going to oppose this, and only include
the workers exposed to radiation or beryllium,'' he said. ''We'll

<HEADLINE> No. 12 Miami Still Fixing Package  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Hurricanes have a history of
losing back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   They've done it four times in five years under coach Butch
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   It can't happen again, not if No. 12 Miami wants to get back in
the national championship picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes (1-1), who followed their 34-29 loss at
Washington with a bye week, play at West Virginia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you lose a ballgame, people think that teams and coaching
staffs automatically jump into a panic situation,'' Davis said
Tuesday. ''Most of our kids are smart enough to understand that
it's still early in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes might not want to panic, but they should be
somewhat alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has allowed 760 yards in two games. The offense has
fumbled eight times, including five against the Huskies. And Miami,
in addition to facing the surprising Mountaineers (2-0) this
weekend, still has to play No. 2 Florida State and No. 5 Virginia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very similar to an artist painting a picture,'' Davis
said. ''After the first three or four brush strokes, are you going
to condemn the painting or are you going to wait to see it finished
and then decide if it's any good?''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ken Dorsey, admittedly rattled by the crowd noise in
Seattle, fumbled twice. A sophomore making his first career start
on the road, Dorsey showed his inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the fumbles, he tripped and fell twice and muffed
a snap. He overthrew receivers early and often, completing just 15
of 34 passes for 215 yards with a touchdown and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey unsuccessfully tried to audible despite deafening noise
from the 74,000-plus on hand at Husky Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 195-pound Dorsey has a cure for the crowd, but it
has nothing to do with hand signals or any other form of nonverbal
communication.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we have a bad play called, we're just going to have to suck
it up and run it,'' Dorsey said.
</P>
<P>
   That could help the Mountaineers, who have played Miami tough in
recent years. West Virginia beat the Hurricanes in 1997, and four
of the last seven meetings have been decided by five points or
less.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last couple of games we played against them came down to
the last drive or the last play,'' safety Al Blades said.
''Personally, to help my heart I hope it doesn't come down to that
this weekend. We want to get in and get out.''
</P>
<P>
   And get back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ''You start the season wanting to win all your games, but when
you lose one game, you can't let it affect your whole season,''
linebacker Dan Morgan said. ''When you lose a game, all you can do
is pick yourself up, dust yourself off and practice even harder to
correct your mistakes.''

<HEADLINE> 'Monday Night Football' Ratings Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Monday Night Football'' got its third straight
close finish, and the ratings were better than last year's
same-week game for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's telecast of the Dallas Cowboys' 27-21 victory over the
Washington Redskins drew a national rating of 13.5 with a 23 share.
</P>
<P>
   That's slightly better than the 13.3 the network got for Week 3
in 1999 (when the 49ers played the Cardinals), and the 13.1 for
Week 3 two years ago (when the Cowboys played the Giants).
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, last week's ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast
received a 12.2 national rating, a 20 percent drop from the year
before. Week 1's show was off 5 percent from the 1999 opener.
</P>
<P>
   ''Monday Night Football'' added comedian Dennis Miller and other
new cast members in an effort to reverse five straight years of
sliding ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Through three games, the program is averaging a 13.7 rating with
a 24 share. That is 8 percent lower than last year's 14.9/25
through Week 3, and just above the 13.6 from 1998 -- the last time
the NFL season started on Labor Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past two years, the show must contend with the Summer
Olympics. This week and next, ''Monday Night Football'' airs
opposite NBC's taped coverage of the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent
of the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given program.

<HEADLINE> Terrorism suspect to cop: 'This isn't like NYPD Blue'  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - An Algerian man accused of assisting a man
sneaking explosives into the United States was surprised at his
gentle treatment after his arrest, saying it was nothing like what
he'd seen on a popular TV show, a detective testified Tuesday at a
pretrial hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Corrigan, a New York City Police Department detective, said
Abdel Ghani Meskini mentioned during an eight-hour interview
following the Dec. 30 arrest that ''This isn't like 'NYPD Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan said Meskini thought he was being treated well compared
to what he had seen happen to suspects on the Emmy Award-winning
show. Once word of Meskini's observation circulated around his
fellow law enforcement officers, Corrigan said, ''I took a lot of
ribbing'' for being compared with Detective Andy Sipowicz, a
character on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini was arrested at his Brooklyn apartment on charges that
he assisted Ahmed Ressam, another Algerian, who was arrested
crossing the border from Canada into Port Angeles, Wash., with an
explosives-laden car.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini and Mokhtar Haouari, another Algerian arrested in Canada
and recently brought to New York City for trial, were charged with
conspiring since 1997 to support a terrorist group and conceal
support for Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan, a 15-year veteran of a terrorism task force made up
primarily of federal, state and local investigators, said Meskini
''seemed to have more of a criminal grasp of the street. It was
just a gut feeling I had.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan testified at a pretrial hearing as Meskini's lawyer,
Roland Thau, tried to convince U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan
that his client's constitutional rights were violated when he was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Two FBI agents and Corrigan testified that Meskini was
repeatedly read his rights during questioning before he was
assigned a lawyer and taken to his first court appearance. Corrigan
said Meskini never asked to talk with a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seemed very confident and comfortable during the
interview,'' he said. ''For the situation before us, I thought he
was a little too comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the interview, Corrigan said the interviewers
threatened to stop questioning Meskini, saying they were wasting
their time because he wasn't forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   But each time the suspect got more serious and provided
additional details so the interview continued, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The interview went so well that Meskini even agreed to let the
FBI and Corrigan eavesdrop on a telephone call he placed to Haouari
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that someone picked up the telephone, telling
Meskini that Haouari was not at home and that he should not call
again because the phone was tapped.
</P>
<P>
   The government has said in court papers that it was prepared to
try to force Meskini to testify against Haouari, even offering him
limited immunity so that his testimony would not be used against
him at his own trial.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan conceded that Meskini's initial interviews had gone
well enough that he thought Meskini might continue to cooperate
with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I would see him again before seeing him today in
court,'' he testified.

<HEADLINE> Antitrust Head Klein Leaving Gov't  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Antitrust chief Joel I. Klein, who launched
the case to break up Microsoft and won record criminal fines
against international price fixers, will leave government at the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The time has come to seek new challenges,'' Klein said in a
statement Tuesday. ''I have done what I set out to do here, and our
work is on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, 53, intends to take time off and then begin a search for
his next job, Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein ''will not be wanting for suitors. His job search could be
one of the great auctions,'' predicted Professor William E. Kovacic
of The George Washington University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   During Klein's tenure, which began Oct. 18, 1996, the government
blocked or altered about 170 mergers. In 220 criminal price-fixing
cases, 52 executives were sent to prison, corporations paid $1.7
billion in fines and individuals paid another $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kovacic ranked Klein among the three most influential chiefs
ever to head the Justice Department's antitrust division, along
with Thurmond Arnold in the Roosevelt administration of the late
1930s and early 1940s and William Baxter in the first Reagan
administration in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will be remembered as the man who brought the antitrust
division back into the courtroom after about 15 years of living on
settlements, guidelines and speeches,'' Kovacic said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Klein said he was proudest of the antitrust
division's litigation record and noted that his division had
confronted a more than 25-fold increase in merger volume, from $72
billion in the last year of the Bush administration to $2 trillion
this year. ''It's inevitable the marketplace will push the envelope
and try more and more aggressive mergers, and at some points, we
have had to say 'no','' Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein received bipartisan praise Tuesday from the Senate
antitrust subcommittee. ''Joel has been a terrific head of the
antitrust division. He has made a lot of difficult calls and, in
our opinion, made most of them correctly,'' Sens. Mike DeWine,
R-Ohio, and Herb Kohl, D-Wis., the chairman and ranking minority
member, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Klein will leave before the courts render a final verdict on the
Microsoft case, but he won the first round. U.S. District Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled after a trial that Microsoft
illegally used monopoly power to thwart innovation by competitors
and ordered it split into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft appealed the verdict and the Supreme Court is to
decide soon whether to hear the appeal directly, as Klein and
Jackson proposed, or to have the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia hear the appeal first, as the company
prefers.
</P>
<P>
   The full impact of Klein's litigation campaign won't be known
until appellate courts finally resolve the Microsoft case and
Klein's cases against American Airlines for predatory action
against low-cost competitors and against Visa and MasterCard for
limiting competition in credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joel Klein has been a champion for America's consumers. He has
fought tirelessly for marketplace competition, and Americans have
enjoyed better products, more choices and lower prices as a
result,'' said Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   In cracking a worldwide vitamin price-fixing cartel, Klein's
division obtained the largest criminal fine in Justice Department
history for any kind of crime: $500 million levied against F.
Hoffmann-La Roche, a Swiss firm. BASF, a German firm, paid a $225
million fine in the vitamin case.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. firm Archer Daniels Midland paid $100 million for
fixing the prices of food and feed additives lysine and citric
acid. For fixing the price of graphite electrodes used in mini
steel mills, SGL Carbon AG, a German firm, paid $135 million and
UCAR, a U.S. firm, paid $110 million.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition from Klein's division led to abandonment of an $11
billion merger between Lockheed Martin and Northup Grumman in the
defense electronics and strategic aircraft industries. WorldCom and
Sprint dropped their $129 billion telecommunications merger after
Klein and his staff objected to increased concentration in
long-distance, Internet backbone and business data services.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, Klein signed antitrust cooperation
agreements with Australia, Brazil, the European Union, Israel,
Japan and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The department announced that Klein's principal deputy, Doug
Melamed, 54, will replace him as acting assistant attorney general
in charge of the antitrust division.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Hits the Road  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame has shown it can play with
tough teams. It has shown it can overcome major injuries and come
from behind. It has shown it can win with a struggling offense. Now
it must show it can win on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd like to think we're an improved football team, but until
we go win a game on the road I don't know that we can say that,''
Irish coach Bob Davie said Tuesday. ''It's no secret we haven't had
a lot of success on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish were 0-5 on the road in 1999, matching the worst
season in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 16 Irish (2-1) have lost six straight road games
overall. The last time the Irish had a longer road losing streak
was when Notre Dame went 0-5 in Gerry Faust's last season in 1985
and then lost its first three road games under Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish are 5-10 overall on the road in three seasons under
Davie, matching Joe Kuharich (6-12) for the worst road winning
percentage by a Notre Dame coach. Faust, at 10-13-1, is the only
other Irish coach since 1913 with a losing road record.
</P>
<P>
   So the challenge is obvious. ''We have to go win a game on the
road. And that's not easy,'' Davie said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially heading to No. 23 Michigan State, a team that two
years ago embarrassed the Irish by jumping to a 42-3 halftime lead
en route to a 45-23 win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that I've ever been in a game like that, and I
hope I'm never in another game like that,'' Davie said. ''I thought
it was going to be 100. It was 40-something to something at
halftime and I'm sitting there thinking there's a bunch of ways to
get in the record book at Notre Dame as the head coach, this is not
one of them I want to look back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie said there's no reason his teams have struggled on the
road other than they've played good teams. Three of the teams they
lost to last year, Michigan, Purdue and Tennessee, were ranked.
They also had a last-second loss on a field goal at Stanford and
lost to Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Davie said the reason he expects the Irish to do better this
season is simple: ''This is a different football team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish are playing better because they are working harder to
make sure they are prepared, Davie said. That's why he expects a
better performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone wants the philosophical or the easy answer to a lot
of questions. It's everything is different. It's all about the
preparation,'' Davie said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Shane Walton talked Tuesday about changes the Irish
were making heading to East Lansing, Mich., such as leaving
earlier, going dressed in sweats rather than suits and changing
what the team will eat. Davie said there are no real changes, and
none that would help Notre Dame win.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about: 'Let's not get a punt blocked, let's block a
punt. Let's not give up a big pass, let's make a pass,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davie said he will talk to the team about how playing on the
road two years ago wasn't why the Irish were beaten so soundly, it
was because of a blocked punt returned for a touchdown by Michigan
State on Notre Dame's first possession, it was because of three
long pass plays given up by the defense, which surrendered 451
yards total offense, and it was because of seven penalties for 63
yards in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''You make an example from the last situation that those outside
influences had nothing to do with what happened. Let's not make
this more complicated than it needs to be,'' Davie said. ''You just
can't self-destruct because it does turn into a feeding frenzy when
you're on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans have won eight straight at home, last losing 25-24
against Purdue on Nov. 14, 1998. Last season they beat Oregon,
Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State at Spartan Stadium. Which is
why Davie believes this game is so important.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us to be good, we need to go win a game like this,'' Davie
said.

<HEADLINE> MLS Players: League Pushes Monopoly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The U.S. Soccer Federation effectively created a
monopoly when it designated Major League Soccer as the country's
sole Division I league, attorneys for players told a federal jury.
</P>
<P>
   The decision making MLS the only Division I league violated U.S.
antitrust laws, the players claimed Tuesday in opening statements
of a federal trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed before the 1997 season, MLS's second year in
existence, the players accused the league of five counts of
antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge threw out two of those counts, including the
argument that the league's system of centralized ownership was a
sham designed to skirt American antitrust laws and hold down player
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Federal antitrust law generally prohibits sports teams from
acting together to fix player salaries and other costs. But MLS, as
well as other new American sports leagues, have tried to avoid the
ban by organizing as a single entity -- in effect making the league
one company in which the teams are merely branch offices.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike traditional sports leagues, MLS investors pay a fee to
the league to operate a team, paying costs such as club
front-office personnel and stadium rent. The league signs all
player contracts, pays salaries out of a central fund and controls
team assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three counts remaining, only one -- the question of
whether the league operated as a monopoly -- is being addressed at
the current trial.
</P>
<P>
   MLS chief operating officer Mark Abbott said the designation by
USSF was good only for the first two years of the league, after
which other leagues could petition to get the Division I
certification.
</P>
<P>
   Because those two years are long since past, he said he doesn't
understand why the players are continuing to pursue the claim.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't understand it,'' he said Tuesday. ''We think it's a
big waste of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the players did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   MLS planned to give its opening remarks Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Convicts Seize Olympic Courtesy Van  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The driver of a van leased to the South
Korean Olympic committee was just waiting for a red light to change
when the vehicle was hijacked by two escaped convicts.
</P>
<P>
   The driver, identified only as Kwang-Ko, was one of four
occupants, including a South Korean Olympic official, who were in
the van Tuesday when the prisoners jumped in near the main site of
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stopped at the traffic lights and suddenly someone opened
the front door and got in,'' the volunteer driver told the Seven
television network. ''I tried to control the wheel of the car, but
they forced me to move out of the driver's seat. They eventually
took control of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   All four occupants were freed unharmed a short time later, and
the escaped convicts abandoned the car and fled on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The car was seized at Silverwater, a Sydney suburb adjacent to
Olympic Park and the site of the large minimum-security Silverwater
prison, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   None of the occupants was taken hostage in the escape, Sydney
Olympics organizing committee spokesman Milton Cockburn said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the occupants was Yoon Jong-koo, an official of the South
Korean Olympic committee, and the other three were South Korean
volunteers from Australia, said Choi Eun-gi, a spokesman for the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the volunteers were a married couple, Peter and Terry
Lee. Mrs. Lee, who is six months' pregnant, was taken to a
specialist maternity hospital for observation.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the New South Wales corrective services
department, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity, said
one of the prisoners was 26-year-old Chad Richards, who had been on
weekend detention. He had breached his weekend conditions and was
in prison full-time for stealing a car.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman the other man was Alan Stebens, 35, who was
serving 10 years for armed robbery and culpable driving causing
death. Stebens was due for release in April 2002.

<HEADLINE> Minority health agency renamed as ''emerging majorities'' office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - State Health Commissioner Antonia Novello
has ''informally'' renamed her department's Office of Minority
Health as the ''Office of Emerging Majorities,'' officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department spokesman John Signor said the name change,
which reflected projected demographic shifts, was ''informal'' and
used ''only internally as a way to motivate staff to come up with
new ideas'' on how to better serve the Hispanic and black
population.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Office of Minority Health remains in statute as the Office
of Minority Health. That is never going to change,'' Signor said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Novello, who was born in Puerto Rico, was appointed New York
Health commissioner by Gov. George Pataki in June 1999. She had
previously served as U.S. Surgeon General under former President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care about the name of the agency so long as we
provide the services,'' Pataki said during a visit to Washington
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Redskins Not Panicking after Losses  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- The Washington Redskins aren't panicking
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The team with the highest payroll in NFL history, touted as a
Super Bowl contender, certainly hasn't lived up to the hype in its
first three games, including a 27-21 loss to the undermanned Dallas
Cowboys at home Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has us scratching our heads looking for answers,'' fullback
Larry Centers said Tuesday as he left the Redskins' practice
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, coach Norv Turner said he doesn't plan big changes for
the team. He dismissed any talk of using backup Jeff George instead
of Brad Johnson, who has thrown costly interceptions in the fourth
quarter of the team's two losses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Brad's our starting quarterback,'' Turner said, adding that
Johnson was fine physically and barely missed some long throws to
his receivers downfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the guys we've added to the team will respond in a
great manner.''
</P>
<P>
   They better. Daniel Snyder has a reputation as an impatient
owner who wants quick results for his offseason spending spree. He
increased the team's payroll to $100 million in a bid to put it
into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder brought in aging but talented free agents like
33-year-old cornerback Deion Sanders, 37-year-old defensive lineman
Bruce Smith and 32-year-old George.
</P>
<P>
   While the defense has generally played well, the old and new
players haven't jelled. The offense hasn't made the big plays that
were a hallmark of last season, when Washington lost to Tampa Bay
in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, top receiver Michael Westbrook went down
with a season-ending knee injury in the 15-10 loss in Detroit last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very disappointing,'' said Turner, whose job security
after seven years in Washington hinges on how the Redskins do this
season. ''We're in a real critical time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because of all the mistakes the team is making.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins had two turnovers and were penalized six times for
82 yards against Dallas. A pass interference call against Darrell
Green helped the Cowboys during one touchdown drive, and a personal
foul call against offensive tackle Andy Heck ruined a potential
scoring drive in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just keep making mistakes over and over. That's killing
us,'' rookie offensive lineman Chris Samuels said. ''We moved the
ball down the field at times ... but we've got to stop making silly
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins' schedule doesn't get any easier. They play the New
York Giants (3-0), the surprising division leaders, on Sunday,
followed by Tampa Bay the following week. Baltimore, Jacksonville
and Tennessee are on the schedule for October.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't worry about the schedule. We have to fix ourselves,''
Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't bothered by boos from fans after the loss to
the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been through that before. You buy a ticket and that's
your right,'' Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But right now, we need Brad to play better, we need the
offense to play better, we need the entire football team to play
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans are antsy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest problem right now is that they've been reading too
many of the headlines from the beginning of the year that said they
were going to walk into the Super Bowl,'' said construction worker
Jim Deaton of Richmond. ''Sometimes that confidence level is your
downfall.''

<HEADLINE> CNN's Shaw To Moderate V.P. Debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- CNN anchor Bernard Shaw will moderate the Oct.
5 talk show-style debate between vice presidential candidates
Joseph Lieberman and Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, a longtime CNN anchor and host of ''Inside Politics,'' has
been with the network since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''I accept the responsibility knowing that the candidates are
the story, not the moderator,'' he said Tuesday on ''Inside
Politics.'' ''The candidates are what matter and their views so
that Americans can make judgments about their positions on
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan Commission on Presidential Debates announced its
selection of Shaw on Tuesday. PBS' Jim Lehrer has been named sole
moderator of the three presidential debates between Republican
nominee George W. Bush and Democratic nominee Al Gore in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Cheney and Democrat Lieberman will debate at
Centre College in Danville, Ky. The 90-minute debate will begin at
9 p.m. EDT and be broadcast by all major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw was moderator of the second 1988 presidential debate in Los
Angeles between then-Vice President George Bush and Massachusetts
Gov. Michael Dukakis.

<HEADLINE> Man Files Bias Suit Vs. Girl Scouts  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A graphic designer for the Girl Scouts has filed
a discrimination lawsuit alleging that the organization denied him
job promotions because of his gender, according to court records
made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Picca's lawsuit says that in his 15 years working at the
Girl Scouts' New York headquarters, he was denied one promotion and
barred from applying for two others.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Flamm, Picca's lawyer, said he will seek class-action
status for the case to include the approximately 115 male employees
at Girl Scouts corporate headquarters. It will not include the
numerous councils around the nation that deal directly with
scouting activity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten women and one man in the New York office are listed in
Picca's documents as having been appointed or promoted to positions
senior to his since 1988. The lone man, promoted in 1997, was fired
in 1999, papers say.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 employees in the graphics department where Picca
designs brochures and and other materials, three are men, records
say. The lawsuit says the department's 11 women hold positions
equal to or senior to Picca's, whereas only one man does.
</P>
<P>
   The Girl Scouts' ''glass ceiling practices'' have caused Picca
''pain and suffering,'' court papers say. The lawsuit seeks
unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   Girl Scouts spokeswoman Ellen Christie said she had not seen
Picca's lawsuit and could not comment on it directly. She said few
organizations work as hard as the Girl Scouts to assure diversity
and fairness in hiring and promoting -- in terms of race, ethnicity
and gender.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Focus on Survivors' Safety  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With memory of the Elian Gonzalez case still
fresh, President Clinton said Tuesday the health and safety of nine
Cubans who survived the crash of a hijacked plane should take
priority over political concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can imagine that there will be a lot of questions about what
should be done about the people that are found alive,'' Clinton
said during a question-and-answer session with reporters. ''I think
the most important thing now is just to worry about their care.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States assisted in the search for the downed plane in
the Gulf of Mexico, and at least one survivor was to go to Key
West, Fla., for treatment. The survivors number three men, three
women and three children. One man was found dead, and others may
remain missing.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the United States those survivors, like Elian before
them, could become eligible for asylum status in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, a 6-year-old Cuban boy whose mother died in the failed
effort to flee Cuba in a boat, was found floating off Florida last
Thanksgiving and brought to the United States for treatment. An
international custody battle ensued, and the child eventually
returned to Cuba with his father in June.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was careful in his comments in the early days of the
Elian saga, but later said the child belonged with his father in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Clinton seemed to acknowledge that similar difficult
questions may arise from the plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''How badly are they hurt?'' he asked rhetorically. ''What kind
of medical care do they need? How quickly can we get it to them? To
me, that's the overwhelming question.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the plane's passengers were trying to
reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said that Cubans intercepted
offshore are screened aboard Coast Guard cutters or at the U.S.
naval base at Guantanamo, Cuba, to see if they have a credible fear
of return to Cuba, which is a basis for claiming asylum in this
country. But they said that most of those who do not actually reach
U.S. soil end up being sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   When Cubans intercepted offshore are in need of medical
treatment, Justice officials said, they are given temporary
permission to come ashore in this country for that treatment.
During their stay, they have an opportunity to meet immigration
officials. If they have a credible fear of persecution if they
return to Cuba, they can stay and apply for asylum. Most of those
who reach U.S. soil apply for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The 1966 U.S. Cuban Adjustment Act allows Cubans who reach U.S.
soil to apply for legal permanent U.S. residency once they have
been here a year and a day. The communist government in Cuba says
the law violates 1994 and 1995 migration accords with the United
States aimed at encouraging orderly, legal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton answered questions after hailing Senate passage of his
long-sought trade pact with China. He said he is paying close
attention to high oil prices in the United States as colder winter
weather approaches and waiting to see the effect of the recent OPEC
decision to raise production.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have some time before it would be too late to affect the
supplies and availability of the products we'll need as the cold
weather sets in,'' Clinton said, adding, ''I just think we need a
few more days,'' to weigh whether the OPEC move alone is enough to
bring prices down.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in
earlier this month in Vienna, Austria, agreed to increase output by
800,000 barrels a day in a bid to cut the price to $28 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement has done little to deflate oil prices, which
remain above $35 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups are urging the administration to force down
prices by tapping the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a storehouse of
nearly 600 million barrels. Americans already are facing the
prospect of winter heating bills about 30 percent higher than last
year.
</P>
<P>
   He sidestepped a question about the timing of a report expected
Wednesday wrapping up part of the long Whitewater independent
counsel investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report would come mere weeks before the November elections,
in which first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is trying to win a
Senate seat in New York and Vice President Al Gore is trying to
succeed Clinton in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are capable of drawing their own conclusions
about that,'' Clinton said. ''I don't think I can serve much of the
public interest by commenting. I think it's pretty obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House has long complained that Whitewater and related
investigations were politically motivated.

<HEADLINE> Peru Proposes March Elections  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peru's government outlined plans Tuesday for
elections in March to choose a successor to President Alberto
Fujimori, but the main opposition leader insisted the voting should
be sooner.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether the armed forces will go along with
either plan, and the military -- which may hold the key to a
peaceful transition -- has been silent so far.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, forced to loosen his decade-long grip on power by a
bribery scandal engulfing his shadowy intelligence chief, announced
Saturday he would deactivate the National Intelligence Service and
call new elections in which he would not be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Alberto Bustamante said the elections to
replace Fujimori and the Congress would most likely be held in
March and the new president would be sworn in July 28, Peru's
traditional inaugural date.
</P>
<P>
   ''The elections could be in March but the one who has to call
them is the president,'' Bustamante said.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's opposition, growing increasingly suspicious of Fujimori's
announced plans to give up power, demanded a much quicker timetable
for him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, who pulled out of May's presidential runoff
after charging Fujimori planned to rig the results, insisted the
new vote be held within four months and an interim government
formed to oversee the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a government that has legitimacy, that respects the
people's will and doesn't twist it as they did on April 9,'' he
told a rally of thousands of supporters Monday night, referring to
the tainted first round.
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said before an election date could be set, Congress
would have to approve a constitutional amendment reducing
Fujimori's five-year term to one year. He said the measure would
have to be approved in two consecutive legislative periods -- this
year and in January.
</P>
<P>
   While officials and the opposition debated, the armed forces
kept silent.
</P>
<P>
   But in a move that confirms the military's power broker status,
Fujimori made a predawn visit to the ''Pentagonito,'' the
five-sided army headquarters complex in a Lima suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's armor-plated Mercedes-Benz pulled out of the
Government Palace at 1 a.m. and was escorted by four security
vehicles to army headquarters, where he has sometimes slept in
times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade returned to the palace in only 15 minutes, raising
speculation he may have stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   The military's silence stood in stark contrast to the swift,
solid support Fujimori received from the armed forces in 1992 when
he shut Congress, accusing it of blocking efforts to battle leftist
insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's crisis erupted when an opposition leader distributed a
videotape showing intelligence chief Vladimiro Montesinos,
Fujimori's closest adviser, apparently bribing an opposition
congressman to join government ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders demanded Montesinos' immediate arrest, but
his whereabouts remained unknown. Independent radio station CPN,
citing unidentified military sources, reported Monday that
Montesinos had been arrested. A retired army general and several
opposition leaders said the reports were a ruse.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents have suggested that Fujimori may lack the power
to order the arrest of Montesinos, who spent his years as
intelligence chief placing his men in key positions within the
armed forces and government.
</P>
<P>
   Retired army Gen. Jaime Salinas, who attempted a coup against
Fujimori in 1992 after he shut down Congress, said there have been
frequent movements of commanders between army headquarters and the
offices of the intelligence service. He said the commanders were
visiting Montesinos to receive instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Fernando Rospigliosi, who has studied
civil-military relations, was skeptical Montesinos could lead the
military to block the formation of a new democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   The high commanders ''are supporting Montesinos because they are
as compromised as he is for everything that has happened,'' he
said, ''but the most likely thing is that they are trying to
negotiate a way out favorable to them.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Music Copyright Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Tuesday passed a bill that would
restore musicians' ability to reclaim ownership of their old
recordings from record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers last year backed a four-line amendment to copyright
law that changed a law artists say gives them ownership of their
''sound recordings'' 35 years after they debut. After protests from
musicians, the House passed a bill by voice vote returning the law
to its former state Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great day for musicians who write their own music,''
said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich. The Senate has not yet considered
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The furor started last year when a House panel approved a change
in copyright law that had been slipped into a bill without a public
hearing. It said that music and other ''sound recordings'' were
hired work, meaning that the performer had no right to reclaim
ownership from his or her record label.
</P>
<P>
   The change was made without a hearing or public debate because
House and Senate staffers, along with the U.S. Copyright Office,
believed that it simply wrote into law what had become a common
practice.
</P>
<P>
   But recording artists like Don Henley, Jimmy Buffett and Earl
Scruggs saw red, believing they faced big losses in potential
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both parties will now breathe easier, the artists and the
recording companies,'' said U.S. Rep. Mary Bono, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill passes, the law would revert to its former state and
musicians and recording companies might have to litigate to decide
who the original music belongs to.
</P>
<P>
   ''We said from the beginning we did not intend to change the law
and have worked diligently to assure that the issue of work for
hire is resolved without prejudice to anyone's position,'' said
Hilary Rosen, president and CEO of the Recording Industry
Association of America. ''The book needs to be closed on this issue
so we can get back to a united industry on so many important
challenges of the day.''
------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is HR 5107.

<HEADLINE> NBC Gets Ratings Win From Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Summer Olympics in Sydney earned NBC its
first weekly win in the ratings competition, but no world records
were set. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   The first three days of the taped competition -- NBC is not
airing any of the Games live because of the 15-hour time difference
-- have averaged a 14.5 national rating in prime-time.
</P>
<P>
   That's 32 percent lower than the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta at the
same point, though domestic Games generally score higher than those
held overseas. It's also 10 percent lower than the Seoul Olympics
in 1988 and approximately 10 percent lower than what NBC promised
its advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, 16.5 million people chose to watch another
competition, ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' The Olympics
broadcast had nearly 24 million viewers that night.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, NBC averaged 16.5 million viewers in prime-time
(10.7 rating, 18 share), ABC had 10.2 million viewers (7.2, 12),
CBS had 8.3 million viewers (6.0, 10) and Fox had 6.5 million
viewers (4.3, 7). UPN had 4.1 million viewers (2.7, 5), the WB had
2.5 million viewers (1.8, 3) and Pax TV had 1.2 million (1.0, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings with 9.5
million viewers (7.1 rating, 15 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 9 million viewers (6.7, 15), and the ''CBS Evening
News'' had 8 million (6.1, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of Sept. 11-17, the top 10 shows, their networks
and ratings: ''Summer Olympics Opening Ceremony,'' NBC, 16.2; ''Who

<HEADLINE> CIA Admits Involvement in Chile  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA is acknowledging for the first time
the extent of its deep involvement in Chile, where it dealt with
coup-plotters, false propagandists and assassins.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency planned to post a declassified report required by
Congress on its World Wide Web site Wednesday that admits CIA
support for the 1970 kidnapping of Chile's top general for refusing
to use the Army to prevent the country's congress from confirming
the election of socialist Salvador Allende as president. The
kidnapping failed, but Gen. Rene Schneider was shot and died two
days later, the day Allende's election was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA admits prior knowledge of the plot that overthrew
Allende three years later but denies direct involvement. The report
says the agency had no idea that Allende would refuse safe passage
with his palace under bombardment and apparently kill himself. He
was found dead of gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   There is no evidence the CIA wanted Schneider killed for
refusing to join the coup attempt in 1970, the report said,
although the agency later paid $35,000 to the group that botched
his capture.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also disclosed a CIA payment to Gen. Manuel Contreras
Sepulveda, head of the Chilean secret police, whom it knew to be
involved in post-Allende human rights abuses. In 1993, Contreras
was sentenced to prison for a rare act of foreign-sponsored
terrorism on American soil -- the 1976 car-bomb killing of a Chilean
diplomat and an American associate on Embassy Row in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The report does not reveal how much Contreras received in a
one-time payment for his CIA services and says the payment was made
by mistake after it had been overruled by high officials. The
report says, however, that the CIA had contact with Contreras on
several occasions before and after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Payment to remnants of the group that kidnapped Schneider was
made for ''humanitarian reasons,'' to maintain their good will and
to avoid disclosure of prior CIA contacts, the report said. It said
in those contacts the agency withheld support for the Schneider
kidnapping, because agents believed the group could not pull it
off.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also describes efforts to influence news media in
Chile against Allende and to augment anti-leftist propaganda
activities by the coup-maker who toppled and succeeded Allende,
Augusto Pinochet. It spoke of CIA activities ''including support
for news media committed to creating a positive image for the
military junta,'' which is now accused of an array of abuses during
Pinochet's 17-year rule including more than 3,000 killings.
</P>
<P>
	   Civilians collaborating with the CIA, but not acting on CIA
direction, produced the ''White Book'' intended to justify
Allende's overthrow with allegations of plans to murder the high
command in the months before the coup, the report said. It said the
CIA knew at the time this was ''probably disinformation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the disclosures, the CIA report admits to no abuses or
cover-ups by CIA agents.
</P>
<P>
	   ''A review of CIA's files has uncovered no evidence that CIA
officers and employees were engaged in human rights abuses or in
covering up any human rights abuses in Chile,'' the report says.
But it chronicles clandestine contacts authorized by President
Nixon and other top U.S. officials that it said would violate
standards now followed by the agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency now carefully reviews all contacts for potential
involvement with human rights abuses, the report said. It ''makes a
deliberate decision balancing the nature and severity of the human
rights abuse against the potential intelligence value of continuing
the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Maurice Hinchey, D-N.Y., who sponsored the law that
required the report, said he takes the CIA at its word on today's
standards. But he pushed for full disclosure of past acts to
prevent U.S. support for such injustices in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I think the environment has changed, and I'm prepared to
believe the agency has changed,'' Hinchey said in an interview. ''I
think that in today's atmosphere, this would not happen. That does
not mean it would not happen in tomorrow's atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
	   The CIA report points to the worries of Nixon and other top U.S.
officials about Allende's leftist ties and their fears of rising
Soviet influence in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   ''This very sordid chapter in American history needs to be held
up to the bright light so that everyone can see what went on under
orders from the president of the United States, the secretary of
state and the attorney general,'' Hinchey said.
</P>
<P>
	   CIA spokeswoman Anya Guilsher said the report addresses key
questions Congress has had concerning CIA activities in Chile in
both the 1970 coup planning and the 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We were aware of coup plotting in 1973, but we did not
instigate it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   More CIA files and other documents on Chile are to be released
in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said last week that release
of the documents on human rights abuse and terrorism during the
regime of Allende successor Gen. Augusto Pinochet was delayed by
Sandy Berger, president Clinton's national security adviser, to
review more documents.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Basically, we want to make sure we get this done right, and we
are as responsive as we are able to, as far as the fullest-possible
disclosure of documents,'' Lockhart said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Report Slams Russia Policy  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration turned a blind eye
to corruption in Russia and has done little that's been effective
in helping to nurture a free-market Russian economy, congressional
Republicans charge in a report being released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Made public just seven weeks before the presidential election,
the 209-page report claims the White House botched the ''greatest
foreign policy opportunity for the United States since the end of
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats dismissed the report a partisan document aimed at
attacking Vice President Al Gore, who has been the administration's
point man in dealing with the Russians. Gore is co-chairman with
Russia's prime minister of the U.S. Russia-Commission on Economic
and Technical Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have worked very diligently over the last eight years to
engage the Russians to try to promote democracy and to make the
world a safer place,'' said White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart when asked to respond to the GOP charges Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He cited U.S. efforts in getting Russia to dismantle nuclear
warheads and programs aimed at fostering economic and political
reforms. ''This work is all ongoing and unfinished, but there is a
lot to be said for what's been done in the last eight years,'' said
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by 12 Republicans on the House Speaker's
Advisory Group on Russia, was completed without input from the
Democrats. ''Coming so close to election time ... it raises
questions about why an important foreign policy issue is being done
in such a partisan manner,'' complained Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The report says the United States poured too much money into the
Russian central government and relied too heavily on ties with
individual Russian personalities instead of establishing better
relations within the nation's legislature. Russians' view of
Americans has soured, the report says, and the nation is developing
stronger relations with China and other non-Western nations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the advisory group,
said the administration has used ''an amazingly narrow vision of
what the opportunity was when we won the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the claims of success by the Clinton-Gore policy
include that we haven't had a nuclear holocaust, there's not a
Stalinist state in place and that they're still building a
democracy,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Douglas Hattaway denounced the criticism. ''This
is a partisan report not worth the taxpayer-provided paper it's
written on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report:
</P>
<P>
   --President Clinton, in his early years at the White House, did
not focus on Russia. Oversight for U.S.-Russia relations fell to an
insular ''troika'' of subordinate officials: Gore, deputy secretary
of state Strobe Talbott and Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   --By using ''massing lending and aid to plug the gap in the
Russian central government's operating budget'' the administration
''exposed these funds to theft and fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration disputes this claim. Last July, Leon Fuerth,
Gore's national security adviser, said in a speech that the
administration has ''continuously sought to tighten our internal
auditing procedures to achieve accountability for U.S.
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   --The Clinton administration continued relations with former
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Anatoly Chubais,
former finance minister who heads Russia's electricity monopoly,
even after they were accused in Russia of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The report also says Gore ignored a CIA report in 1995
containing allegations that Chernomyrdin had accumulated billions
of dollars in private assets in his position as prime minister.
''He sent it back to the CIA with the word 'BULL----' scrawled
across it,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has denied that he ever wrote such a remark.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report overstates the impact our policy could have had,''
said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., a member of the House International
Relations Committee. ''The Russians need to clean up their own act.
They have crime, corruption and the mafia. To blame the American
administration for the failure of the Russian government to do
things is absurd.''

<HEADLINE> Diverse Crew Rallies for Reform  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A year ago, former GOP presidential hopeful
Gary Bauer was calling Jesse Ventura a ''bigot'' after the
Minnesota governor criticized organized religion. But on Tuesday,
the two men were sharing a joke before taking their turns on the
podium calling for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day you get Jesse Ventura, Gary Bauer and (Wisconsin
Democratic Sen.) Russ Feingold behind the same cause, we're bound
to win, my friends, we can't lose,'' said Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., at a rally for campaign finance reform on the steps of the
U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed a diverse crew that turned out on a drizzly,
blustery afternoon. Among the participants were singing group
Crosby, Stills and Nash, political activist Doris ''Granny D''
Haddock, actress Paula Poundstone, and more than a dozen members of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want our elections for sale,'' declared David Crosby,
who like other speakers dropped a mock ''ballot'' into a ballot box
for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need campaign finance reform now to ensure that any person
in elected office can run a competitive campaign and be judged on
the issues rather than the size of he or she's pocketbook,''
Ventura said, adding that reform was key to encouraging third-party
political participation.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who followed Ventura, wrapped his arms around the burly
Independence Party governor.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation sponsored by McCain, also a former GOP presidential
hopeful, and Feingold would eliminate soft money, the unregulated
donations from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The folks with the big money in Washington are sitting in the
front row, and average Americans are sitting in the back,
whispering,'' said McCain. ''This has got to change.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Why do the wealthy interests call the shots behind me?'' asked
Feingold. ''Because our campaign finance system allows, encourages,
even demands the kind of corruption we see today in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're for reform in any other area,'' Bauer, a social
conservative, said, ''I don't care what area turns you on, you're
not going to get reform in that area, when the status quo is
maintained by people who can out-shop the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Minority Tom Daschle said that Congress will likely wrap up
for the year without passing prescription drug coverage for
Medicare, a patients' bill of rights, a minimum wage increase or
new gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is no accident,'' said Daschle, a Democrat from South
Dakota. ''That is a plan bought and paid for by the special
interests working the halls of Congress this afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Chris Shays, R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., the
authors of a House campaign finance reform bill, appeared on stage
together.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need campaign finance reform new because soft money has
gone from a small loophole to the great black hole that swallowed
our election laws,'' said Meehan.

<HEADLINE> NY Fashion Week Springs Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Oscar de la Renta was deep into ''panic time,
worse than ever'' late last week, but you would never have known it
at his Tuesday preview as spring Fashion Week forged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't expecting to see half of his collection until just
three days before the show, since manufacturing in Italy
necessitates shipping the clothes. Still, de la Renta's showing was
a seamless study in dozens of ways to wear opulent evening wear,
from pink ostrich feather blouses to imposing, full-bodied pouf
skirts, so round and buoyant they just might require an extra
closet.
</P>
<P>
   Many items could be called show pieces, such as an orange suede
halter top bedecked with chunks of quartz, matched with his
sharp-pleated skirt.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a great sense of fantasy to my collection, especially
in evening,'' said de la Renta, who just for fun had shredded a
fabric on a cocktail dress to make it appear like long, loopy
feathers. ''It's in the way that some of the clothes are just
dreamy layers of tulle with embroidery. They're not dresses for
everybody, but they certainly make a woman dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection rounded out with pretty pieces, such as floral
embroidered pants with matching blouses, and some whimsical
oddments, like a safari jacket surprisingly paired with a white
evening skirt, completely covered in shimmy fringe. And there were
plenty of sexy, midriff-baring leather tops that might be just
right for well-toned audience members such as Sarah Jessica Parker
of ''Sex in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ask, in the words of the song, ''Who wears short
shorts?'' the Ellen Tracy customer is probably not the first answer
that comes to mind. Yet at the Tuesday preview, abbreviated shorts
appeared in everything from gold or white pearlized leather to
black and white gingham, along with bare legs and high-heel
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks very modern and strong. It shows a lot of leg, but
it's quite a ladylike look because of the (&AMP;frac34;-length) jacket,'' says
Ellen Tracy head designer Linda Allard. ''It's all about the
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard knows what's ladylike. The company caters mainly to
customers, such as Tipper Gore, who are typically career women. For
a more covered look, Allard sent out a slew of elongated, almost
knee-length jackets, most notably in zebra-print denim.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the fashion circuit, on Monday evening BCBG was up
at bat. The show is often popular as a reliable harbinger of the
season's trends. Down the runway came transparent fabrics that
flirted with bareness; A-line trench coats; metallic shine; prints
either floral or geometric; and soft shades from beige to pink and
light green. Everything seemed to be contained in the season's wrap
belt.
</P>
<P>
   A series of art deco, 20s-inspired looks caught the eye of
Hollywood celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch, front row with his
client Lauren Holly, who said she gravitated toward a brown beaded
sleeveless dress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The '20 dresses are so feminine and soft,'' said Bloch
backstage after the BCBG show. ''There's just a little
ornamentation, like new Hollywood, elegant but not too over the
top.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the runways, Douglas Hannant presented a collection that
was fairly out of Africa, yet updated for the urban jungle. Safari
shirts and earth tones of brown suggested life on the plains,
though the look was modernized for the cosmopolitan traveler with
skirt slits higher than Mount Kilimanjaro. Safari pockets decorated
bustiers, safari shirts looked tantalizing thanks to peekaboo
holes, and ball skirts went natural in a treatment made of straw.
</P>
<P>
   Hannant, whose customers include Sharon Stone, Mila Jovovich,
Brooke Shields, Sigourney Weaver and Jane Seymour, said he wanted
to show ''the idea of my woman going to Africa and experiencing the
culture there.''

<HEADLINE> China Vote Sets Stage for New Era  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Final congressional passage of landmark
legislation to normalize trade relations with China sets the stage
for a new era of economic engagement with the world's most populous
country, supporters of the action said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics said the upcoming effort to hasten the demise of
China's one-party communist rule with a dose of good old fashioned
American capitalism could be a long and difficult struggle.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, however, was emphasizing the positive Tuesday
as he savored the 83-15 Senate vote that cleared the measure that
ended two decades of annual congressional review of China's trade
privileges. He said the action would ''extend economic prosperity
at home and promote economic freedom in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has made economic engagement one of the hallmarks
of his presidency, said that normalized trade ties with China will
''strengthen those within China who fight for higher labor
standards, a cleaner environment, for human rights and the rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   That view could prove simplistic, however, according to China
experts who said America's battles to open China were in some ways
just beginning with the expanded trade opportunities that will come
once China joins the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real struggle now lies ahead of us in trying to get China
to obey the rules of the WTO,'' said Greg Mastel, a China expert at
the New America Foundation, a Washington research organization. He
said other difficult issues that have long strained relations
between the two countries are not going away either.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will still have all sorts of disputes on human rights,
Taiwan and trade,'' he said. ''Permanent normal trade relations
will not be the solution to all of our problems in China.''
</P>
<P>
   And the economic benefits from the legislation may also be hard
to see -- especially in the bottom-line, the trade deficit between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   A major government study done on the issue by the U.S.
International Trade Commission predicted that America's huge
deficit with China, which hit a record $68.7 billion last year,
second only to Japan, will widen even with all of the
market-opening offers China has made to get into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The ITC report predicted that American exporters will benefit
from the lower tariffs on farm goods and manufactured products,
forecasting a rise in U.S. exports of 10 percent in the first year
of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the study predicted Chinese exports to the United
States would rise as well, going up by 7 percent, as Chinese
companies become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   And since China sells $6 in toys and shoes and other products to
the United States for every $1 America sells in China, ($81.8
billion in Chinese imports to the United States vs. $13.1 billion
in U.S. exports to China) the trade gap under the percentage
increases forecast by the ITC will widen.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the trade deal used the ITC figures to predict a
loss of 872,000 jobs over the next decade as Chinese imports make
bigger in-roads into the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions charged that American businesses were fighting for
the deal because of the opportunities it would open to move more
high-paying U.S. manufacturing jobs to China to take advantage of
low wages.
</P>
<P>
   But trade experts say the bigger economic upheaval from the
agreement will occur in China.
</P>
<P>
   If China follows the advice of reformers and tears down its high
trade barriers, it faces the prospect of massive unemployment in
its huge, inefficient state-owned businesses. Some studies suggest
as many as 14 million people may be thrown out of work over the
next five years in rural and urban areas of China.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and its allies in business are counting on
the reforms going forward, despite the temporary dislocations,
because of a belief that China has a strong desire to take its
rightful place as one of the leading economies of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   On the political side, Clinton and Vice President Al Gore have
some fence mending to do within their own party. Democrats in the
Senate and House who voted for the China bill did so over the
determined opposition of organized labor, a key party constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta insisted after the Senate
vote Tuesday that labor will unite behind Democratic candidates in
November because of the strong desire to retain the White House and
take over the GOP-controlled House.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,
also favors the China trade normalization.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. exporters will not start seeing the benefits of China's
market-opening offers until the country is admitted into the
Geneva-based WTO, which sets the rules for world trade.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said that
could still occur this year after final negotiations with all
countries at the WTO are complete.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we are shooting for and what we believe is achievable is
to have the WTO vote on both China's and Taiwan's accession this
year,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speaks Out Against Milosevic  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- If Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic uses
fraud to win Sunday's presidential election, the world must strip
him of whatever stature he retains so his opponents can topple his
regime, President Clinton said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democratic opposition is stronger than ever heading into
critical elections this weekend. Mr. Milosevic has stepped up his
repression. Surely, he is capable of stealing the election,''
Clinton said at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts
before the debut of a play about human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if he does, we must make sure -- all of us, not just the
Americans and certainly not just the American government -- that he
loses what legitimacy he has left in the world and the forces of
change will grow even stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, who has been indicted for war crimes by the
international tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, is being
challenged by three candidates, including Vojislav Kostunica, who
is backed by an alliance of 18 opposition parties and is leading
Milosevic in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said defenders of human rights also need support in
Myanmar, also known as Burma, where the ruling military regime is
being confronted by Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for
Democracy party. Her party won national elections in 1990 but the
regime in the Southeast Asian country never recognized the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their only weapons are words, reason and the brave example of
Aung San Suu Kyi, but these are fearful weapons to the ruling
regime,'' Clinton said.
</P>

   Clinton spoke before the play ''Speak Truth to Power: Voices
from Beyond the Dark.'' Written by novelist and Broadway playwright
Ariel Dorfman, the play is based on writings and interviews with 51
human rights activists in Kerry Kennedy Cuomo's book, ''Truth to
Power: Human Rights Defenders Who Are Changing Our World.''

   Cuomo is the daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy and the wife
of Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo. Her book, with photographs by
Pulitzer Prize winner Eddie Adams, profiles human rights activists
to prove that there are still American heroes

trumpeter. Nobel Laureate Oscar Arias of Costa Rica opened the
program.

   He then made a surprise appearance at a fund-raiser for the
National Hispanic Foundation for the Arts, where he couldn't resist
kidding actor Jimmy Smits, one of the event's organizers.

   ''I'm here in spite of the fact that Jimmy Smits called me and
asked me to come,'' he said. ''If I have to hear Hillary say one
more time, 'That is the best looking man I've ever seen ...,''' he
said, as the audience of 450 dissolved into laughter.
