<HEADLINE> Dhaka-Washington Lock Horns on Trade Union in EPZs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- As Dhaka and Washington lock horns
on whether or not to allow trade union activities in specialized
industrial parks in Bangladesh, conflicts between workers and U.S.
companies in the Chittagong Export Processing Zone (EPZ) have
taken serious turn Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some workers of three U.S. companies in the Chittagong EPZ have
started hunger strike from Monday, demanding reinstatement of 15
workers sacked by the companies. The condition of 10 workers
worsened Tuesday, sources in Chittagong told Xinhua by phone.
</P>
<P>
The agitated workers Tuesday threatened to take further actions
to press upon the U.S. companies to fulfill their demand.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts between workers and the U.S. companies will force
the government of Bangladesh to take an intransigent attitude on
the trade union activities in the EPZs of the country, observers
here believed.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government last week decided not to allow trade
union activities in the EPZs in the country, for which Washington
has been pressing Dhaka for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has threatened to withdraw Generalized
System of Preference (GSP) facilities to Bangladesh, setting a
deadline for Bangladesh to reverse it's decision by August 15 or
face arbitration.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador in Bangladesh John C. Holzman earlier said
preferential access to U.S. market will be uncertain unless
Bangladesh opened its EPZs to trade unions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Korean and Japanese entrepreneurs, the major
investors in the EPZs, opposed the U.S. move. They cleared their
stand that they would wind up their units if trade unions are
allowed.
</P>
<P>
After several meetings and discussions with local and foreign
investors, the government of Bangladesh has reportedly decided to
help establish "welfare association" for the workers to protect
and uphold their rights in EPZs.
</P>
<P>
The government is continuing talks with the U.S. authorities to
clarify its position and retain the GSP facilities. If the talks
do not yield any positive result, then Bangladesh would face
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the latest move by the United
States would be a serious blow to Bangladesh's export as the
United States is the largest importer of Bangladeshi products.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's export to the United States amounted to three
billion U.S. dollars last year, of which ready-made garments alone
fetched 1.8 billion dollars.

An IGEPN report said that since Tuesday, at the volcano, have
been registered over 170 long term quakes, plus two hybrids (
ascent of volcano gases).
</P>
<P>
There were 145 indications of rock falls caused by the slow but
gradual growth of the eighth dome that up to now is found 65
meters high.

With these registered symptoms, the report doesn't rule out the
possibility there's an eruption and Quito city faces once again a
volcanic ash descent.

IGEPN asked Quito's citizens to be on guard of the natural
phenomenon and announced conditioned yellow alert will continue.

Since November 1999, volcano Guagua Pichincha is rather quiet
without further eruptions, but small explosions have been frequent.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Urges Ethiopia to Resolve Embassy Residence Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea Wednesday urged Ethiopia
again to respond to its petition to the International Court of
Justice documenting forcible entry of the Eritrean Embassy
residence in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in a statement available
here that Eritrea's call to Ethiopia was occasioned by an
allegation made by an Ethiopian diplomat in Asmara, Eritrea that
an unnamed individual entered the Ethiopian Embassy on June 23,
attempting to burn the Ethiopian flag.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Eritrea's petitions dated February
16 last year and February 16 this year detailed the forcible entry
and ransacking of Eritrean diplomatic premises by several dozens
of armed and uniformed Ethiopian security forces.
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen months later, Ethiopian security forces still remain
in illegal physical possession of the Eritrean Embassy residence
in Addis Ababa," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean foreign ministry also assured the Ethiopian
Embassy Wednesday that the suspect, who attempted to burn the
flag, had been promptly apprehended and was under investigation
under the Eritrean Criminal Code.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean foreign ministry called upon Ethiopia to bring any
 grievances on the attempted burning of the flag to the World
Court of Justice in the Hague, the Netherlands.
</P>

The World Court of Justice is empowered to resolve complaints
of violation of diplomatic and consular immunities under

<P>
LUSAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa has got a pledge of
a 1 billion U.S. dollars aid in a five-year agreement to promote
the sub-region' s economic development, Zambia News Agency
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The donors included Nordic countries, Canada and the World
Bank. The World Bank has already disbursed 30 million dollars out
of its total pledge of 150 million dollars, according to the news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The funds would finance various programs, including those to
reduce the brain drain, African Capacity Building Foundation
Executive Secretary Soumana Sako said Wednesday in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Katele Kalumba has singled out the
loss of skilled labor force as one of the issues that has
negatively affected Africa's capacity building efforts.
</P>
<P>
"It cannot be over-emphasized that this continent has built
capacity but failed to retain it. Consequently, some of the gains
registered in the areas of social development in the 1970s and the
early 1980s have clearly now been reversed," said the Zambian
minister.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Extends Mandate of Operation Northern Watch Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish parliament approved on
Wednesday a government request to extend by six months the mandate
of Operation Northern Watch, a force of U.S. and British warplanes
that patrol a no-fly zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This was the eighth time that the term of Operation Northern
Watch, previously known as Operation Provide Comfort, had been
renewed by the Turkish policy-makers, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The force was set up on December 25, 1996 following
authorization by the Turkish parliament to use the Incirlik base in
Adana Province in southern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A statement addressed to the parliament, which bore the
signature of Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, requested the parliament
to prolong the tenure of Operation Northern Watch as of June 30.
</P>
<P>
The government request underwent heated debate in parliament.
Some deputies expressed concern about the U.S. intention to topple
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein by bombing Iraqi civilian targets.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has often condemned the Turkish authorities
for allowing its territory to be used by the United States and
Britain to intensify their bombings against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey defended itself by saying that it had nothing to do
with the U.S. and British bombardments and that Turkey had only
carried out reconnaissance missions.
</P>
<P>
The government statement argued that Operation Northern Watch
had pursued "with a concern for the preservation of the territorial
integrity of the Iraqi state."
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the two no-fly zones set up by the U.S.-
led Western allies after the 1991 Gulf war with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from Baghdad's persecution, saying they are not specifically
authorized by United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi forces have repeatedly fired at the U.S. and British
warplanes patrolling the two no-fly zones since the two countries
launched four nights of massive air attack on Iraq in December,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says its civilian facilities have frequently been targeted
by U.S., British warplanes, causing civilian casualties. The U.S.
and Britain claim their planes only target military targets.

especially economic ties, will reach a new level with joint
efforts by both sides.
</P>
<P>

visit,also met with Bulgarian parliament speaker Iordan Sokolov
and leaders of various parliamentary factions.

consensus to develop relations with China.

legislative bodies of both countries in promoting bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Announces Elian's Imminent Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This news item disclosed U.S. Supreme Court decision not to
pay heed to the boy's distant relative's new appeal in Miami to
analyze the question of political asylum request.
</P>
<P>
The communique indicated that subsequently further details of
Elian's return, his family, fellow students and other adults
accompanying will be offered, as they'll have to wait till 16:00 o
'clock, when the Atlanta Appeals Court ban expires.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday rejected a last-ditch appeal
by the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez and allowed the six-year-
old Cuban boy to return home, ending a six-month custody battle
between Elian's father and his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court rejected an emergency request by Elian's
relatives to postpone Elian's departure for Cuba and also turned
down their appeal seeking a political asylum hearing for him.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who was accompanied by his family and his schoolmates,
are expected to fly to Havana on a chartered plane from Washington
Dulles International Airport later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said she was pleased the Supreme
Court had declined to review the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who survived a migrant boat disaster last November in
which his mother and 10 others died, has been in the United States
after he was picked up by a fisherman off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives cared for him until he was seized from
his relatives' home on April 22 in a government raid and reunited
in Washington with his father.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez is eager to take his son
back to Cuba, but his relatives have been trying to prevent him
from being sent back to Cuba with the help of many anti-Cuba
people in Miami, Florida.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Federal Reserve Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve, amid
signs that the red-hot economy may be cooling a bit, decided
Wednesday to leave key U.S. interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The widely expected move by the rate-setting Federal Open
Market Committee after a two-day closed-door meeting leaves the
federal funds rate at 6.5 percent, the highest level in nine years.
The funds rate is the interest that banks charge each other on
overnight loans.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, explaining its decision, the Fed said "recent
data suggest that the expansion of aggregate demand may be
moderating toward a pace closer to the rate of growth of the
economy's potential to produce."
</P>
<P>
"Although core measures of prices are rising slightly faster
than a year ago, continuing rapid advances in productivity have
been containing costs and holding down underlying price pressures,
" it added.
</P>
<P>
But the Fed warned that signs of a slowdown in economic growth
were still "tentative and preliminary." It noted that the labor
market was still tight, a cause for concern on wage inflation.
</P>
<P>
"The committee believes the risks continue to be weighted
mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation
pressures in the foreseeable future," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last year, the Fed has been boosting interest rates
for six times in an effort to slow the economy and keep inflation
from escalating.
</P>
<P>
Recent economic reports suggest the Fed's increases are working:
The nation's unemployment rate rose to 4.1 percent in May, up from
a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in April; retail sales were
lackluster the past two months; and the housing market has slowed
a bit.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe the economy, which was roaring ahead at
a 5.4 percent growth rate in the first three months of this year,
may have slowed to 4 percent rate or less in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
But the Fed doesn't want a repeat of the last two years, when
growth slowed in the spring only to reaccelerate sharply for the
rest of the year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Given that, many economists believe that Fed policy-makers may
need to boost rates at their August 22 meeting to keep the economy
on an even keel.
</P>
<P>
The Fed is seeking to achieve a "soft landing," in which growth
slows enough to keep inflation under control but not so much that
it threatens the country's record economic expansion.

<P>
The statement was made by Council President, France's Jean-
David Levitte following the attack by a gunman on the Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO) building in Baghdad Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Dismayed at the incident in which two FAO staff were killed by
the gunman, Council members would like to see investigation
results to come out as soon as possible, said Ambassador Levitte,
emerging from Council consultations.
</P>
<P>
Council members "reiterate their strong support to the
difficult work of the humanitarian agencies in Iraq", the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
The gunman demanded the lifting of U.N. sanctions against Iraq,
threatening to blow up the building if the demand is not met. He
then gave up to Iraqi police. Investigations are under way.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed harsh economic sanctions on Iraq in August
1990 following its invasion of Kuwait, which touched off the 1991
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has called for an end to the decade-long sanctions as
continuing disease menace and malnutrition have caused numerous
deaths, especially among children.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans to Choose Own Destiny: Trade Unions Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabweans should choose their own
destiny and guard against foreign manipulation in the process of
democracy, a leader of Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Secretary-General of the organization Isidore Zindoga
told Zimbabwe News Agency that differences between politicians
should be dealt with in a Zimbabwean way and foreigners should not
take center stage of politics in the Southern African country.
</P>
<P>
"There might be differences in Zimbabwe on major issues of
importance, but we should be careful with the role of foreigners
in the affairs of our own country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the huge voter turnout in the just ended parliamentary
election and the peaceful voting process showed that Zimbabwe had
moved to greater strides in terms of democracy.
</P>
<P>
"Although there was pre-election violence, people voted freely,
 suggesting that the intimidation did not affect the voter
turnout," he said.
</P>
<P>
Politicians, he said, should ensure that there was room for
political tolerance in order to preserve the nation's integrity.
</P>
<P>
About 4 million people out of 5 million registered people voted
in the tightly contested election, which saw the ruling Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front winning with 62 of the 120
seats, followed by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change
with 57 seats and then Zimbabwe African National Union (Ndonga)
with one seat.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been
exhorted to make deliberate efforts to integrate development
objectives with environmental protection to ensure its sustainable
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
A balance must be achieved between the two so as to create a
win-win situation, Tanzanian Minister for Regional Administration
and Local Government Kingunge Ngomable said when opening an
international conference on sustainable development in Africa held
in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"This means that to achieve sustainable development, one should
 critically analyze the two-way environment-development
interactions," the minister told participants from 19 African
countries attending the three- day meeting.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is essential to care for the environment so
as to bring greater economic benefits, and it is also necessary
to ensure economic and social development does not exceed the
capacity of Africa's resources and environment.
</P>
<P>
Ngomable also emphasized poverty must be eradicated if one was
to think of achieving sustainable development in African
countries.

<HEADLINE> It's up to Clinton to Decide Summit Date: Barak Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said here Wednesday that it is up to U.S. President Bill Clinton to
decide when to hold a three-way Israeli-Palestinian-U.S. summit in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after another meeting with visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Barak stressed that the
Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks have entered a crucial stage
and the key issues concerning the talks can only be discussed and
settled during the summit.
</P>
<P>
Strongly supporting the idea of holding such a summit, Barak
said it is time for leaders of the two sides to make decisions in
order to push the Israeli-Palestinian peace track forward.
</P>
<P>
Any agreement reached in the summit should help strengthen
Israel's security and the agreement should be acceptable by the
absolute majority of Israeli people, including the Jewish settlers
in the occupied territories, Barak noted.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Albright said the mission of her trip was to study
the possibility of holding such a summit in Washington and that she
will report her findings to Clinton, who will then decide whether
and when to organize the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiating teams are conducting
serious negotiations on final-status issues, she said, but both
sides should be clear that they cannot get 100 percent of what they
want from the other side.
</P>
<P>
"Anyway, President Clinton and myself will continue the efforts
to help move the peace process forward and help the parties
concerned to achieve peace," she said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Albright went to the West Bank city of Ramallah and
held talks there with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly told her that the Palestinian side is opposed
to holding the summit in the near future, because big gaps still
remain between the two sides on all the key issues in final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks deal with the thorniest issues between
the two sides, such as the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements,
Palestinian refugees, water, border and security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Albright returned to the region Tuesday evening and held her
first meeting with Barak until the small hours of Wednesday. She is
scheduled to go home on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Rejects U.S. Proposal on Trilateral Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Palestinian National
Authority Yasser Arafat turned down on Wednesday a U.S. proposal on
convening a three-party summit in Washington on July 15 to reach a
framework agreement on the final status issues.
</P>
<P>
Arafat held talks with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeline
Albright for more than two hours in the West Bank city of Ramallah
Wednesday afternoon. He insisted on the implementation of the U.N.
Security Council resolutions calling for Israeli full withdrawal
from the West Bank territories occupied in the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Palestinian chief negotiator in the interim
talks Saeb Erekat said the gaps between the Palestinians and Israel
were still wide and there was no basis of trust between the two
sides at present.
</P>
<P>
Against this background of stalemate the proposed trilateral
summit will fail to yield any results, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel should carry out all the signed accords and meet its
obligations related to the third redeployment in the West Bank and
the release of Palestinian detainees in order to create mutual
confidence before the proposed summit is held, Erekat added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Planning and International Cooperation
Nabil Shaath said the trilateral summit might be held late July. He
declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Palestinian source said the Palestinian-Israeli
talks reached a deadlock and would be resumed in Washington on July
4 with a view to pave the way for the trilateral summit.
</P>
<P>
Albright met Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Wednesday
afternoon for the second time in 24 hours in an attempt to bridge
the gaps between Israel and the Palestinians on the proposed summit
but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
She will leave for Washington Thursday morning to offer a report
on the results of her Middle East tour to U.S. President Bill
Clinton.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The gunman who killed two staffers
of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization early
Wednesday morning told foreign and local media that he attacked the
U.N. organization to protest the decade-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
After two hours of confrontation with the Iraqi security forces,
Fuad Haidar surrendered to the authorities and is now under custody
in the Jadria Police Bureau in central Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Handcuffed and under the watch of heavily-armed guards, Haidar
was brought out of custody to face the media.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of my attack is to let the whole world know the huge
sufferings of the Iraqi people," Haidar said.
</P>
<P>
"What I have done is totally an individual act. I do not belong
to any party and I do not have any relations with the Iraqi
government," Haidar said.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old killer, who looked very relaxed, said his aim
had been realized.
</P>
<P>
"My mother is very ill, and my family has no money. I will
rather die this way than die under the sanctions," he told the
reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to him, he has long got the idea of attacking a United
Nations-affiliated organization in the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
He said he originally plotted to abduct U.N. arms inspectors
including the former head of the U.N. Special Commission Richard
Butler, but did not succeed.
</P>
<P>
This time he chose to attack the U.N. FAO because "there are
many foreigners in this organization."
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear what kind of penalty he will receive and the
Iraqi government has so far made no comment on this accident.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed stringent sanctions on Iraq in 1990 following
its invasion of Kuwait. The 10-year-old sanctions have claimed
lives of over 1.2 million Iraqi children.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Leader Appoints New Commander of IRGC Air Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Wednesday appointed Brigadier General Ahmad Kazemi as
the new commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
Former commander of the IRGC Air Force Brigadier General
Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf had been appointed as commander of the
Security Forces in an order issued by Khamenei on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The supreme leader thanked Qalibaf for his services in the IRGC
Air Force and hoped that Kazemi, as Qalibaf's successor, could
further
improve the work of the military organ, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei, who is also the commander-in-chief of the military,
has recently changed a number of heads of the military branches,
including chief commander and chief of joint staff of the Army.
</P>
<P>
Iran's armed forces include three major branches, namely the
Army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), and the
Security Forces (police). The IRGC and the Army have their separate
air, ground and naval forces.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei made the changes amid intensifying power struggle
between the conservatives and the reformists following February's
parliamentary election, in which reformers dealt a severe blow to
the conservative establishment.
</P>
<P>
The military, controlled by the conservatives, is said to be
divided over the country's growing reformist campaign fostered by
President Mohammad Khatami since his landslide victory in the
presidential election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Army is believed to support President Khatami's reform
programs, while the elite IRGC tends to safeguard the Islamic
values formed since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> Georgia to Reduce 9,000 Amy Servicemen in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Georgian parliament Wednesday
passed a law on cutting down the national armed forces from
current 47,500 to 38,400 servicemen by the end of this year,
reported the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Before the voting at a plenary session of the legislature in
Tbilisi, Revaz Adamiya, chairman of the parliamentary committee
for national defense and security, said the reduction of the armed
forces has become necessary as a radical reform in the defense
sphere has begun recently.
</P>
<P>
The reform, including the reduction of the troops, will enable
the former Soviet republic to build a modernized army to meet the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military standards for
gaining a full membership of the alliance by 2005, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The reduction will mainly take place in logistic personnel and
the staff of the combat units will not change. By 2004, Georgia
will cut its permanent armed force to 12,000- 13,000 people,
Georgian First Deputy Defense Minister Zhoni Pirtskhalaishvily
told reporters after the session.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for this measure is the state's budget crisis.
The Georgian government cannot finance the defense sector in
existing scale, observers say.
</P>
<P>
According to the information published by the parliamentary
opposition, the servicemen of the Georgian army have not been paid
already for 14 months. The owing is planned into the budget for
2000,which will naturally cause a reduction of the Defense
Ministry's budget.
</P>
<P>
Georgia's defense budget is now no more than 20 million U.S.
dollars, an amount even less than those of its neighboring
countries Armenia and Azerbaijan.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy Elian Allowed to Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court
Wednesday rejected a last-ditch appeal by the Miami relatives of
Elian Gonzalez and allowed the six-year-old Cuban boy to return
home, ending a seven-month custody battle between Elian's father
and his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
The supreme court rejected an emergency request by Elian's
relatives to postpone Elian's departure for Cuba and also turned
down their appeal seeking a political asylum hearing for him.
</P>
<P>
"The legal battle is over," said Gregory Craig, attorney for
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. "The family will now make
immediate arrangements to return to their home."
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by Craig, Gonzalez said his family was
gratified by the Supreme Court's announcement that the family was
free to go home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who was accompanied by his family and his schoolmates,
are expected to fly to Havana on a chartered plane from Washington
Dulles International Airport later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said she was pleased the Supreme
Court had declined to review the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
"This little boy now knows that he can remain with his father,
" Reno said in a statement."I hope that everyone will accept the
Supreme Court's decision and join me in wishing this family, and
this special little boy, well."
</P>
<P>
Elian, who survived a migrant boat disaster last November in
which his mother and 10 others died, has been in the United States
after he was picked up by a fisherman off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives cared for him until he was seized from
his relatives' home on April 22 in a government raid and reunited
in Washington with his father.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father Juan Miguel Gonzalez is eager to take his son
back to Cuba, but his relatives have been trying to prevent him
from being sent back to Cuba with the help of many anti-Cuba
people in Miami, Florida.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR's Operation in Northern Angola Almost Paralyzed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Operations of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are practically suspended in
northern Angola, mainly due to the deteriorating security
situation, the Angolan official news agency Angop reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman for the U.N. agency Kris Janowski,
the military situation in northern Angola has deteriorated,
especially in the Uige Province, which confined the local UNHCR
team in a 2-kilometer distance around the town.
</P>
<P>
In the last days, armed rebels have been unleashing panic among
 locations adjacent to Uige and Negage cities, with the purpose to
prevent food supply reaching residents there.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR's Luanda-based stores are supplied with goods, said the
spokesman, but adding that those humanitarian goods will risk
being looted by attackers on the roads leading to the northern
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The airway, the only way that allows the transport of
humanitarian aid to inland provinces, is blocked as result of the
temporary closing of the Uige Airport.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR uses cargo airplanes from the World Food Program
(WFP) which land in Negage, 43 kilometers away from the Uige City,
but road transportation of goods to Uige City is "still unsafe",
said Janowski.
</P>
<P>
In May, the UNHCR has sent emergency teams to Angola, after
another U.N. mission described as "terrible" the condition of food
shortage in the northern parts of the country, where over 150,000
displaced persons face the food crisis.

KAMPALA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A total of 9.638 million
registered voters out of the 20 million Ugandans will participate
in the June 29 referendum to choose a political system for the
east African country, said a press release from the National
Electoral Commission Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The choices for the voters in the 214 constituencies across the
country are the Multi-party System and the Movement system,
according to the release.

Constitutional requirement, will start at 7:00 a.m. and end at
5:00 p.m. local time on Thursday, and the results will come out
within 48 hours following the end of the polling day.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ssemogerere, the opposition Democratic Party chief, has
urged Ugandans to boycott the referendum, saying that the
referendum is rigged and the results are already known.
</P>
<P>
The National Resistance Movement, which claims it is a

LUANDA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Angola ranks 181st in the list of
"good health services to the population" of the 191 member states
of the World Health Organization (WHO), according to a WHO report.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO annual report, after over 25 years of
civil conflicts, Angola's health services around the country have
been almost paralyzed, with many hospitals destroyed, most
residents in the inland provinces unaccessible to health systems,
the official news agency Angop reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the country with a population of some 11 million, some three
million cases of malaria are registered annually; some 120,000
Angolans suffer from the sleeping disease; while the measles is
considered as the third killer of the Angolan population,
according to a document issued by the Angolan Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Given the lack of proper health facilities across the war-torn
country, the poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, AIDS and other endemic

population.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Industrial Production Value Up 14.7 Percent in Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam obtained a year-on-year
increase of 14.7 percent in industrial production value in the
first six months of this year, Vietnam's official news agency VNA
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The highest growth rates were registered in electricity
production (12.6-13.8 percent) and textiles and garments (more
than 33 percent), VNA quoted the Ministry of Industry (MoI) of the
country as saying.
</P>
<P>
Production and consumption of industrial products increased
remarkably in the reviewed period owing to the expansion of
foreign markets and the recovery of domestic markets and services.
</P>
<P>
Products unsaleable in the past such as steel, coal, paper,
cement and construction materials sold well in the January-June
period.
</P>
<P>
Major items attaining high export turnover in the above-said
period include crude oil (1,600 million U.S. dollars), textile and
garments (804 million U.S. dollars), footwear (749 million U.S.
dollars) and computers (305 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Astronomers Find Sugar in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. astronomers have for the
first time found sugar in space, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
While working with a giant telescope in Arizona this May, the
scientists detected radio signals that indicate the presence of a
type of sugar molecule known as glycolaldehyde in a giant cloud of
gas and dust about 26,000 light-years away near the center of the
Milky Way galaxy. Such clouds are the material from which new
stars are formed, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
Glycolaldehyde is a chemical cousin of table sugar and can
combine with other molecules to form more complex sugars, such as
ribose - a basic building block of DNA.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery of this sugar molecule in a cloud from which new
stars are forming means it is increasingly likely that the
chemical precursors of life are formed in such clouds long before
planets developed around the stars," Jan M. Hollis of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt said in statement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Surge in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
for big-ticket manufactured goods shot up in May, rising a bigger-
than-expected 6 percent, the Commerce Department reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Last month's increase in orders for durable-goods, items
expected to last at least three years, was the largest gain since
December and left orders at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
218.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gain was twice as big as the 3 percent increase many
analysts were expecting. The durable-goods data, economists have
cautioned, tend to be volatile and can swing widely from month to
month.
</P>
<P>
In April, durable-goods orders fell 5.7 percent, which was a
stronger performance than the 6.5 percent drop the government
previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
Last month's performance largely reflected a 26 percent
increase in orders for electronics and electrical equipment,
including semiconductors, circuit boards and home appliances. That
was the largest gain since August 1997. In April, such orders fell
a steep 17.6 percent, not as bad as the record 20.1 percent drop
the government estimated a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment rose 3.5 percent in May,
led by an increase in demand for cars, ships and tanks. That
followed a 6.4 percent decline the month before.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile transportation sector, durable-goods
orders went up by a whopping 6.6 percent, the largest gain since
January 1985. The transportation sector is volatile from month to
month because it includes such costly items as airplanes.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket items, a good sign of current demand,
grew by a solid 2.2 percent in May following a 1 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times since
last June to slow the supercharged economy and keep inflation from
becoming a problem.
</P>
<P>
Recent economic data, including a rise in the nation's
unemployment rate in May and lackluster retail sales, have
suggested that the central bank's rate increases are working to
cool the economy down a bit.
</P>
<P>
The Fed, which went into the final lap of a two-day interest
rate meeting on Wednesday, is expected to hold the line on
interest rates rather than continuing to raise them.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Anti-trust specialists from both
the European Union and the United States will form a workshop in
Washington to discuss possible threats from business-to-business (
B2B) trades to fair competition, according to an EU official.
</P>
<P>
Mario Monti, an EU competition commissioner, made the remarks
at a midday press briefing Wednesday. "There is a huge debate on
competition policy and innovation and on June 29 a highly
promising workshop is being held in Washington organized by the
Federal Trade Commission to assess B2B exchanges' implications for
competition policy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the 15-nation bloc has a view "largely
coinciding" with that of the Americans that the competition policy
has a key role to play in what has been hailed as the new economy.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the EU would see to it that the incentive to
innovate would be maintained and that bottlenecks of economies
should be shunned and anti-trust measures be adopted to keep the
flow of innovation high.
</P>
<P>
Many of the industrial sectors have recently launched their B2B
exchanges over the computer networks in an attempt to cut down
costs in their buying programs. These sectors include automobile
manufacturers, banks and steel producers.

<HEADLINE> China Set to Beat Man-made Deserts (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Premier Zhu recently stressed that lessons should be drawn from
the ravaging desertification as a result of excessive herding and
farming on grassland, destruction of forests and prairie, and
careless mining in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the desert control program should start
with man's role in ecological protection.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has banned the public from picking sand-
fixation vegetation such as black moss. In recent years, 13
million ha of prairie were destroyed in China by those picking
black moss to sell.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Ministry of Agriculture said that from July
1, China will issue its first regulation on managing the balance
between grass and cattle. China also plans to draft a law on
desert prevention and control.
</P>
<P>
Chinese desert expert Chen Guangting said, "The urgent task for
China in handling the desert problem is to eliminate man-made
deserts instead of turning the natural deserts into oases."
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the man-made deserts are shallow as they took
less time to form, adding that considering China's technology and
natural conditions, "the deserts can be tamed in our efforts to
achieve ecological balance."
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, China has tamed deserts in the Naiman Banner
of Inner Mongolia, Yanchi of Ningxia and Linze of Gansu by 260,000
sq m. But the desert control pace is far slower than the
expansion of man-made deserts.
</P>
<P>
China is also adopting a policy of tree planters owning trees
and gaining benefits from the trees, an incentive which is
expected to stimulate farmers' enthusiasm for afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangyin, a 38-year-old farmer in Dingbian County of
northwestern Shaanxi Province, set up a privately-owned desert
control company and hired planes to spray grass seeds on the
desertland he contracted. Overseas investment is also playing a
bigger role in fighting back man-made deserts.
</P>
<P>
Experts hold that the conditions in China are now mature for
pursuing comprehensive control over man-made deserts. China's
national economic strength has been enhanced, its grain supply is
abundant and its desert-control technology is applicable in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Now an massive campaign to return farmland to grass and trees
is underway in the country, especially in western China. In
Ulanchab Prairie, about 130,000 ha of farmland will be returned to
grassland each year.
</P>
<P>
Ma Weiyi, a herdsman in Ningxia who has lived on herding for
several decades, said that he favored the government's decision to
stop farmers in Helan Mountain from herding cattle. "If cattle
continue to graze on the mountains, the Helan Mountain will become
a barren mountain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are helping herdsmen move from the state
nature reserve so that the forests and grass will no longer be a
feeding ground for cattle.

<HEADLINE> Silver Market Officially Begins Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai-based Huatong Silver
Trading Center, which has been designated by the State Economic
and Trade Commission as the first silver market in China, today
began operation officially.
</P>
<P>
The center has handled more than 400 tons of silver
transactions with a total value of 600 million yuan (72.29 million
US dollars) since it initiated trial operation on December 28,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The center today also launched a website: www.htmetal.com.cn.
Information on rules and regulations on nonferrous metals industry,
as well as related data can be obtained at the website.
</P>
<P>
Silver had long been considered a special commodity in China,
and the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, had
been in charge of its unified purchase and sale.
</P>
<P>
As silver supply exceeded demand in the past decade, the
central government announced its decision to allow silver to be
traded on the open market at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
China produces about 1,300 tons of silver annually and consumes
some 800 tons a year.

<HEADLINE> Advertising as Source of Internet Profit Doubted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Internet professionals at
the Third Asia-Pacific E-Business Roundtable ended here Wednesday
pointed out that the Internet companies should not depend their
profit on advertising.
</P>
<P>
"The concept that you can build an Internet company purely
based on advertising is completely disapproved now," said Graham
Brant, general manager of Microsoft Hong Kong Limited at the two-
day meeting, attended by more than 150 senior executives.
</P>
<P>
"Internet profit should be a combination of transaction fees,
subscription fees and advertising fees," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brant held that Internet is an additional way for the
traditional businesses to get to their customers and these
businesses are the major force pushing forward the Internet's
development.
</P>
<P>
"The companies started up to be pure Internet companies are
indeed facing some major challenges in terms of revenue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited his own company as an example.
</P>
<P>
"Microsoft, as a business, is very successful for a traditional
business. It ran MSN.com, which does not make much profit at
present, to promote its products," said Brant.
</P>
<P>
Khoo Ken Wee, managing director of the Hong Kong CASH Group,
which widely adopts Internet technology in its securities business,
shared the view of Brant.
</P>
<P>
"Earning by advertising is not going to be the best way to do
on-line business. There should be some sort of transaction engine
in the long run to sustain revenue growth," Khoo said.

<P>
The measures aim to improve the deteriorating ecological
conditions in China, especially the north which has been even more
devastated by spring sandstorms which swept nearly half of the
country, including cities of Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The desert control program, the largest of its kind since 1949,
is made up of 11 sub-projects to be carried out in more than 400
counties of 14 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities in
north and northwest China.
</P>
<P>
This year China will allocate 12 billion yuan (about 1.45
billion U.S. dollars) to stave off desertification, launching
large-scale tree planting and air-seeding campaigns over the man-
made deserts.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhibao, director of the State Administration of Forestry,
said that China is determined to prevent the spread of the man-
made deserts in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Dong Guangrong, a research fellow in environmental engineering
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said that every year about 2,
460 sq km of land in China is turned into desert -- and it's the
result of human spoils.
</P>
<P>
Estimates say that since the 1950s, desertified land in China
has reached 340,000 sq km, almost the area of three Bulgarias, due
to excessive land reclamation, herding and tree-felling, and water
resources consumption.
</P>
<P>
The man-made deserts are mainly distributed in northern Hebei,
the Inner Mongolian prairie, the lower reaches of the Tarim River
in Xinjiang as well as other places in Gansu, Qinghai and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
The distance between the nearest deserts and Tian'anmen Square
in Beijing is 72 km.
</P>
<P>
Dong, an expert on desertification, said, "Without effective
countermeasures, our cities will be swallowed by deserts due to
man's excessive exploitation of nature. That is not alarmist talk.
"
</P>
<P>
The Ulanqab and Xilin Gol prairie in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region was for decades a paradise with rich grass and
water resources for cattle; however, it is now covered with
scattered deserts formed by the rapidly increasing population and
increased herds of cattle that ate large quantities of grain,
grass and plants.
</P>
<P>
With vast areas of grassland being reclaimed for farmland,
vegetation like sand willows and sand sagebrush in deserts are
being dug up and even their roots being nibbled by cattle, the
prairies are quickly becoming deserts.
</P>
<P>
The problem of man-made deserts has caught the attention of
people all over the country, especially top Chinese leaders like
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Efforts must be made to integrate
information technology (IT) into education for all, an education
professor from Beijing University told the China Basic Education
Forum today.
</P>
<P>
Gao Liming pointed out that in modern-day society, IT has an
important role to play in education, including decision making,
sustainable development of education, and assistance and training
programs for teachers.
</P>
<P>
Though application of IT in education requires huge initial
input, it will improve the quality of education by expanding the
scale and lowering the cost, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Application of IT will also help push forward education for
everyone in China, whose ultimate goal is to meet the basic
learning needs of all children, youth and adults.
</P>
<P>
"Education for All" is a global initiative involving more than
180 countries. Its goal is to promote national strategies for
providing basic education and international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The forum is co-sponsored by the United Nations (China) Task
Force, the Chinese Ministry of Education, and Beijing Normal
University.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Strengthened Ideological and Political Work (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang stressed the importance of spreading socialist ethics and
raising the moral standards of the Chinese people at a time when
the nation is developing the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Both laws and ethics are necessary for regulating people's
behaviors, he said. Therefore, laws and ethics should interact and
play a significant role in society.
</P>
<P>
In developing socialist morality, the state must wisely balance
equity with efficiency, and promote China's fine traditions while
absorbing fine things of foreign cultures.
</P>
<P>
In the process of socialist construction, the interests of the
nation and the people must be regarded as priority while
legitimate rights of individuals are respected and fully protected,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang urged that new, effective ways should be found
to educate the Chinese people in socialist ideology.
</P>
<P>
Since the adoption of the reform and opening policy, China has
witnessed many new developments in its socialist culture.
</P>
<P>
While advocating the traditional means of promoting people's
ideological and political awareness that have proved effective,
Jiang urged his fellow Party members to explore innovative ways to
teach people about ideology and politics. He urged localities to
spread the word when people come up with their own effective
educational techniques.
</P>
<P>
Jiang underscored that the CPC, as well as officials at various
levels, must always serve the public while educating them.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that strengthening and improving the moral and
political education among the people would ultimately benefit
China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Cultivating higher ethical standards must be combined with
economic growth, Jiang emphasized.

The CPC members and officials must seek out the opinions and
complaints of the common people and focus on solving their daily
problems, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
All CPC members and leading officials should devote their
efforts to ideological and political education, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Leading party officials in localities must do their utmost to
promote the moral and political education, Jiang said, adding that
they must gain a comprehensive understanding of the work and learn
the basic laws related to it as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
All of society should participate in the socialist education
campaign, including party organs, governments, trade unions and
other public groups, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
All enterprises and institutions involved in the production of
cultural goods must place social benefits above economic returns,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at various levels should study key
ideological and political issues and grasp the social trends,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the examples set by leading officials are extremely
important for the success of the education endeavor, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The central authorities of the CPC stress that they should
govern themselves well if they are to govern the state well.
</P>
<P>
All Party members must follow the rules set by the Party's
central authorities and earn the respect of the people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes all the Party members would be enthusiastic,
confident, and hard-working as they work to reach this important
goal.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao said that Jiang offered a thorough analysis of the
true situation facing the Communist Party and the issues that have
cropped up, and pointed out the major tasks facing the state in
ethical and political education.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's remarks serve as guidelines for improving the work of
the Party and building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Hu
said.

TEHRNA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian Oil Ministry official
said on Wednesday that Iran is ready to help reconstruct Kuwait's
al-Ahmadi oil refinery which suffered heavy damage in an explosion
caused by gas leakage three days ago.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah's Secretary-General Hassan
Nasrallah had ordered his guerrillas in south Lebanon to "cease
firing until further notice", but ruled out any possibility of
disarming the former anti-Israel resistance group.
</P>
<P>
In an interview carried by local newspaper As Safir on
Wednesday, Nasrallah said that Hezbollah, which has fought against
the Israeli occupation forces in south Lebanon for 18 years, "will
turn more to domestic issues, giving priority to development
matters".
</P>
<P>
He said that Hezbollah, or Party of God, will pay more attention
to issues which are not related to religion or sect, such as "
national peace, the development of the deprived areas, and social
justice".
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is both an Islamic movement and a nationalist party."
</P>
<P>
After meeting President Emile Lahoud on Monday, Nasrallah
pointed
out,"we will not hand in our weapons because Israel continues to
pose
a threat to Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
The goals of his party are "bigger than any sect or even Lebanon
itself", he noted, especially referring to the Palestinian problem.
</P>
<P>
"The restoration of Palestine is not only a goal but also part
of the ideology of the party," he said, adding that the resistance
will remain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he spoke highly of the role of Hezbollah's long-term
guerrilla warfare in forcing the Israeli occupation troops to leave
Lebanon on May 24 this year.
</P>
<P>
On the relations with Iran, he said Hezbollah, which was
supported by Syria and Iran, would not take sides in the political
struggle between reformists and conservatives in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Orders Arrest of Reformist Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The public court of Tehran, capital
of Iran, issued arrest warrant Wednesday afternoon for two
reformist lawyers on charges of disturbing public opinion, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Rahami and Shirin Ebadi were charged with involvement in
making and distributing taped remarks against some officials, a
press release issued by the Tehran Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
The press release cited the confessions of a man, Amir Farshad
Ebrahimi, who was arrested with the tapes, in accusing Rahami and
Ebadi of having helped fabricate insulting remarks in a video
cassette and distribute the cassette.
</P>
<P>
Rahami was the lawyer for students in the recent trial of police
accused of exceeding their authority in last year's Tehran
University dormitory incident.
</P>
<P>
A raid of a Tehran University dormitory by police forces and
plainclothesmen last July sparked six days of bloody riots in
Tehran and other cities, believed to be the worst of its kind since
the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Rahami was also the defense lawyer of former interior minister
Abdullah Nouri, a prominent reformist who was sentenced to five
years imprisonment last November on charges ranging from publishing
anti-religious materials and sacrilegious articles to insult the
late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
The two lawyers will stand trial in an open court, the report
said.

JOHANNESBURG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa would have to
fork out millions of rand for its upcoming peace mission to the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) each month, the military
said on Wednesday.
</P>

Contrary to initial assumptions that the United Nations would
foot the total bill, it would reimburse South Africa for only 25
percent of the cost, South African National Defence Director of

<P>
This meant that the South African taxpayer would contribute
about 6 million rand (880,000 U.S. dollars) a month to the
country's peacekeeping duties in the DRC.

This would include a special allowance of about 5,500 rand

sentence on the necks of most developing countries," he stressed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier on China's Achievements in Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has taken
concrete actions to fulfill its commitments since the Copenhagen
summit five years ago, a senior Chinese official said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has given special attention to the
elimination of poverty and has succeeded, mainly by its own
efforts, in reducing the size of the impoverished rural population
from 250 million in 1978 to 34 million in 1999," Chinese Vice
Premier Wen Jiabao told the special session on social development
of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the percentage of the disabled
children going to school has risen from 20 percent to over 70
percent and that of the disabled people taking up jobs from 67
percent to over 73 percent, according to Wen.
</P>
<P>
The employment situation in China has remained stable with new
jobs created as its economy grows, with the employment structure
improved as the diverse economic sectors develop side by side and
the economy is restructured, and with a steady improvement of the
social security system, he said. Various undertakings such as
education, science and technology, public health, culture and
sports in China have flourished.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong and Macao have maintained prosperity and stability
ever since their return to China," the Chinese vice premier said,
"The development and progress of China, the largest developing
country in the world, constitute an important contribution to the
cause of global social development."
</P>
<P>
As China is still a developing country, Wen noted, it is bound
to come across numerous difficulties and challenges on its road
ahead towards development.
</P>
<P>
"The population and employment pressure, the poverty problem,
the gap between the urban and the rural population and between
different regions, and the increasingly acute resources and
environmental constraints are among the problems that we are faced
with," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should never underestimate the difficulties," Wen said, "
But we have confidence, determination and capability to tackle
these problems in the course of development. We will speed up
economic restructuring, improve the quality and the cost-
effectiveness of economic growth by relying on reform, open-up and
technological progress, and seek a coordinated and sustainable
social and economic development so as to ensure our people a more
affluent life."

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Work for Global Social Progress: Senior Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is ready to
work vigorously with other countries for global social progress,
Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always supported the United Nations
in its efforts for global social development," Wen said at the
special session on social development of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In preparation for the special session, he said, the Chinese
government hosted an international symposium on states, markets
and social progress and a meeting on rights of disabled in
cooperation with the U.N. in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Wen said the current meeting was of great significance to
global social development and a better tomorrow for mankind. He
meanwhile hoped the meeting would further advance the global
social development and facilitate the implementation of the
Copenhagen Declaration and Program of Action, adopted in 1995 at
the World Summit for Social Development.
</P>
<P>
Since the Copenhagen summit, Wen said, different progress has
been made in the field of social development in various countries.
</P>
<P>
"However, we have to be soberly aware that the global social
development still falls short of expectations," the Chinese
official said, "The gap in wealth between the North and the South
continues to widen, with developing countries faced with grim
challenges."
</P>
<P>
What's more, he said, the size of the world's population living
in poverty has become bigger instead of smaller, leaving many
people with no basic means for survival and development.
</P>
<P>
"These cold facts tell us that global social development is a
long and uphill battle and calls for protracted and unremitting
efforts from all governments, peoples and the international
community," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Russian Rocket Launches Three Satellites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A Russian booster rocket Cosmos-3M
launched three satellites belonging to Russia, the United Kingdom
and China respectively from Russia's Plesetsk space center
Wednesday in the northern Arkhangelsk region.
</P>
<P>
The rocket blasted off from the base at 3:13 p.m. Moscow time
(1213 GMT) and will send the three satellites into a solar-
synchronized orbit, the Russian Strategic Missile Forces press
service said here.
</P>
<P>
The satellite Nadezhda (Hope), made for the Russian Defense
Ministry by Polyot company based in the West Siberian city of Omsk,
will join the KOSPAS-SARSAT international rescue system searching
for ships and aircraft in distress.
</P>
<P>
An experimental British satellite SNAP-1, weighing nearly
eight kilograms, will demonstrate the potential of using ready-
made miniature electromechanical parts in satellites and training
university students and graduates in space technology. It has
been developed and manufactured by Surrey Satellite Technology
Company jointly with Surrey University in Guildford.
</P>
<P>
The third satellite, named Tsinghua-1, weights 50 kilograms.
It was manufactured by the same British company under contract
with China's Qinghua University. It will be the first
demonstration spacecraft of a future seven-satellite system used
for global monitoring of natural disasters, communication research
on a low orbit and training of students.
</P>
<P>
Both British-made satellites carry Global Position System (GPS)
receivers.
</P>
<P>
This is the 400th launch of a Cosmos-3M from Plesetsk since
May 15, 1967, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Cosmos-3M is a light rocket designed for putting
spacecraft into elliptical and almost circular orbits at an
altitude of from 250 to 2,000 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> China Puts Forward Proposal on Social Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China put forward a four-point
proposal here Wednesday at the special session on social
development at the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, advanced by Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao at
the special session on behalf of the Chinese government, comprises
the following four points:
</P>
<P>
-- It is the shared responsibility of the entire human race to
safeguard peace and promote development.
</P>
<P>
China maintains that international affairs should be handled in
accordance with the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter
and that every country has an obligation to safeguard peace.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful and stable international environment is the
prerequisite for social development of mankind. Without peace,
development would be impossible and people would not be able to
live and work happily.
</P>
<P>
The past century has seen monumental achievements unmatched in
history in the social development of human society. It is a
sacred mission for governments and peoples in the world to achieve
greater economic and social development and seek common progress
and prosperity of the entire mankind in the new century.
</P>
<P>
-- The right of a country to choose independently its path of
development in light of its specific conditions should be
respected.
</P>
<P>
Given the differences among countries in terms of environment,
history, cultural tradition and social system and the disparities
in their economic development level, it is impossible to ask all
countries to adopt the same development model.
</P>
<P>
The world's diversity should be respected. The principles of
sovereign equality and non-interference in each other's internal
affairs should be upheld and nobody should be allowed to impose
its development model upon others. The developing countries
should have the right to choose, in light of their own conditions,
a development path tailored to their specific national
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
-- Economic globalization urgently calls for the establishment
of a fair and reasonable new international economic order.
</P>
<P>
Economic globalization is an inevitable trend of economic
development and it brings new opportunities to countries in the
world. Nonetheless, due to the hardened irrational international
economic order, the globalization process has failed to benefit
all countries evenly.
</P>
<P>
To truly realize a social progress that benefits all requires
the establishment of a fair and reasonable new international
economic order. Countries, big or small, strong or weak, rich or
poor, are all equal members of the international family and all
have the right to take part in the discussion and formulation of
the "game rules" for international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The international organizations, the U.N. in particular, should
play an even bigger role in addressing the reasonable propositions
and demands from developing countries and in protecting their
legitimate rights and interests effectively.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries should, by taking into account the common
interests of mankind, resolve the debt issue of the poverty-
stricken countries in an equitable and reasonable manner and
provide developing countries with capital and technical assistance
without attaching any political strings. In fact, this in turn
will help developed countries themselves develop further.
</P>
<P>
-- Economic and social development remains a central task for
the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Poverty and unemployment are acute problems for developing
countries. The key to their solution lies in economic development.
Economic development provides the foundation for social progress.
Without it, it is impossible to eliminate poverty, create more
jobs and improve the lives of the people.
</P>
<P>
Social progress in turn provides an important guarantee for
economic development and facilitates a sustainable and steady
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries must keep abreast with times, adopt a
carefully-designed development strategy, always maintain social
stability, seize the opportunities, accelerate development,
reverse once and for all their backwardness and create a better
tomorrow by relying on the hard work of all their people.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Military Plane Crashes, Five Crew Members Feared Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese military transport plane
was confirmed Wednesday evening to have crashed in the Sea of
Japan, and five crew members aboard the plane are feared dead, the
Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Japanese rescue workers determined that an oil slick and debris
they collected from an area where the plane was believed to have
gone down was from the C-1 transport plane belonging to Japan's
Air Self-Defense Force (ASDF), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The plane left the ASDF's Miho base in Tottori Prefecture in
southwestern Japan for a 90-minute test flight at 2:07 p.m. (local
time), but disappeared from radar at around 2:35 p.m., when it was
flying over the Sea of Japan about 110 kilometers north of the
base.
</P>
<P>
The C-1 plane, measuring 29 meters long and 31 meters wide, is
made in Japan.

<HEADLINE> China's Contribution to Human Genome Project "Significant" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- In the just-revealed first rough
map of the Human Genome Project (HGP), Chinese scientists
completed only one percent of the sequencing of the human genome,
but the significance of their work is great.
</P>
<P>
"The work shows that Chinese scientists have created a
milestone in the epochmaking project," said Yang Huanming,
director of the Human Genome Research Center of the Institute of
Genetics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Decoding the genome involves placing in correct order the 3.1
billion base pairs, or subunits that make up human DNA. Decoding
the three billion chemical "letters" in human DNA is seen as one
of history's great scientific milestones -- the biological
equivalent of landing on the moon.
</P>
<P>
The publicly-funded HGP is an international effort involving
groups from the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan and
China. It was launched in 1990 with the goal of completing the
genome in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
China became involved in the project in September 1999 and is
the only developing country taking part in the team effort.
</P>
<P>
According to Lu Yongxiang, president of the CAS, Chinese
scientists have completed their share of the international
research project ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
This shows Chinese scientists are at the forefront of life
science research, and they can make great contributions to the
world in the field, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese scientists' achievement will promote the
development of the country's biological information, the
biological functional genome, and the development of other
frontiers of life science research in China, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have shared techniques and material used in
the international human genome project and will build their own
sets of large-scale human genome sequencing techniques.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries that are home to rich biological
resources. This has laid a solid foundation for Chinese scientists
to make the biological industry a pillar industry in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
Based on their capability of sequencing the human genome,
Chinese scientists are planning to launch their own huge
biological gene project.
</P>
<P>
They are now conducting a "super hybrid rice" genome project in
cooperation with Yuan Longping, the invented ways to cultivate
Chinese hybrid rice.
</P>
<P>
Scientists plan to sequence 430 million base pairs of the so-
called super hybrid rice in a year, and after that to sequence the
genome of pig.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Strengthened Ideological and Political Work (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
wants the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) to put more
emphasis on socialist ideological and political education to
ensure that the country's modernization drive is a success.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made the
call at the ideological and political work conference of the CPC
Central Committee, which opened here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader noted that the world is in a time of
profound change, and China is undertaking massive reforms to
improve its socialist system. The party's ideological and
political work has become even more arduous under the new
complicated circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission,
noted that the new situations demand that the party's ideological
and political work must be improved in terms of context, method
and means.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing,
members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the

<P>
In his speech, Jiang expounded on the extreme importance of the
party's ideological and political work, which, he said, is the
lifeblood of the economy and all other undertakings, the key to
achieving the tasks of the Party and the state, and the major
political advantage of the Party and the socialist country.
</P>
<P>
Only by giving full play to this political advantage can China
ensure its economy and other undertakings to advance smoothly in
the right direction, and mobilize the whole nation to work
together for development, Jiang said.

Only by doing so can the Party always promote the productive
forces, the advanced Chinese culture and the fundamental interests
of the Chinese people, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that to improve the ideological and political work,
it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the
international and domestic situations, review the past experience
and analyze the current problems, especially the theoretical and
practical problems that have a direct bearing on the mentality of
the cadres and ordinary people, and find solutions to these
problems.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the Chinese leader also touched on how to view
the development process of socialism, the evolution of capitalism,
the impact of the country's reforms on society, and the current
international environment.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen and improve the party's ideological and political
work, Marxism must be studied and promoted, and the role of
Marxism as the ideological guidance in China must be upheld, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that the Party should educate the people in
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader also stressed the crucial need to strengthen
the ideological education and deepen people's faith in socialism,
and to continuously work to bring the nation closer together. (

<HEADLINE> Barak Says He Has "Red Lines" For Talks With Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Wednesday that he has very clear "red lines" in talks with the
Palestinians and there are limits to how much territory he is
prepared to hand over to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak rejected domestic criticisms that he had decided to make "
too much" concession to the Palestinians in the final-status talks,
dismissing reports of such compromises as mere "speculations."
</P>
<P>
"Israel will never return to the 1967 borders, Jerusalem will
remain reunited and there will be no foreign army west of the
Jordan Valley," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak said he had never promised to yield 92 percent of the West
Bank territories to the Palestinians as his critics claimed. He
promised to keep an absolute majority of the Jewish settlements in
the (occupied) territories under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Barak was under attacks not only from the opposition but also
from his coalition partners for his enthusiasm to attend a summit
in Washington in which his critics said he would give up too much
for the sake of a peace agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak proposed the summit be started July 5 in Washington aimed
at striking a framework agreement on final-status issues with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, with the help of U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright returned to the
Middle East region Tuesday evening to prepare for the summit.
</P>
<P>
Yisrael Ba'aliya and National Religious Party, Barak's two
coalition partners, said they would leave the government if Barak
decides to leave for the Washington summit without modifying the
government's current negotiating positions with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Barak has reportedly presented his position on the framework
agreement to the coalition leaders on Tuesday, in which he was
offering the Palestinians a withdrawal from more than 80 percent of
the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Ill-Fated Merchant Ship Sinks off Northern Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- An ill-fated Sri Lankan merchant
ship which was attacked by Tamil Tiger rebels in the seas off the
island's northern coast two days ago has sunk along with its more
than 2,500 tons of cargo, the government said in a statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The vessel was completely destroyed together with the cargo,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ship, MV Mercs Uhana, chartered by private traders to
transport food and other essential items as well as computers to
the northern Jaffna peninsula was attacked by a suicide boat of
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels early Monday
near the island's northernmost tip of Point Pedro.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE in a statement claimed the cargo ship was carrying
arms and ammunition for government troops in Jaffna, thus they
deployed six of their elite Black Sea Tiger suicide bombers to
attack the ship and one of their explosives laden boats had rammed
into the ship, setting it on fire.
</P>
<P>
Naval officials said a sea battle had erupted as navy vessels
tried to rescue the crew from the cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
The government statement Wednesday said five of the 28 crew
were still missing.
</P>
<P>
The government accused the LTTE of trying to cause
inconvenience to the people of Jaffna by disrupting supplies meant
for the civilians.
</P>
<P>
Shipping officials said the traders had lost a lot of money as
the cargo was not insured.
</P>
<P>
Jaffna was the scene of fierce fighting until the end of last
month when the military deployed new weapons and more troops and
stalled a "rolling offensive" by the LTTE to recapture their
former stronghold of Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels are fighting for a separate homeland called
Eelam for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Pacquiao Retains Crown after Defeating Korean Foe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Filipino southpaw Manny Pacquiao
retained his World Boxing Council international super-bantamweight
crown by knocking out erstwhile undefeated South Korean Seung Kwon
Chae Wednesday in the first round of their 12-round encounter.
</P>
<P>
Pacquiao lived up to his promise to eliminate early the Korean
challenger as the 21-year-old fighter from General Santos City
stopped Chae in 1:42 minutes of the first round with a thundering
left to the head at the Araneta Coliseum in Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Chae caught Pacquiao with a strong right cross to the body but
the Filipino fighter retaliated with a combination to the body,
forcing the Korean to lower his defense.
</P>
<P>
Pacquiao took advantage of the situation and gave Chae two
uppercuts before throwing his thundering left hook that sent the
Korean fighter to his knees.
</P>
<P>
Chae was able to get back to his feet but referee-scorer Bruce
McTavish discontinued the fight after he noticed Chae wobbling
while holding his head due to dizziness.
</P>
<P>
Pacquiao improved his WBC super-bantamweight rating to No. 6
with his 20th knockout victory in 29 fights.
</P>
<P>
Pacquiao's victory also avenged the loss of nine Filipinos at
the hands of Chae, who was added to Pacquiao's two Korean victims -
- Sung Yuh Lee and Woo Ki Lee.
</P>
<P>
It was the third win for Pacquiao after winning his title from
Reynante Jamili in December last year and stopped Fil-Australian
Arniel Barotillo early this year.
</P>
<P>
The loss was the first in 24 fights for Chae, who has an
impressive 17 stoppages.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Isiah Thomas, one of the 50
greatest NBA players, is the odds-on favorite to succeed Larry
Bird as coach of the Indiana Pacers, local reports said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thomas signed a letter of intent on Tuesday to sell the
Continental Basketball Association to the NBA Players Association,
a precondition for a coaching job in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
But neither Thomas, the players association nor the NBA would
comment on the potential sale.
</P>
<P>
Thomas bought the CBA for 10 million US dollars in October. He
originally approached the NBA which offered him 10 million dollars
and a percentage of the profits.
</P>
<P>
Thomas is the front-runner to replace Bird, who resigned last
week after the Pacers lost to the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
Like Bird, Thomas is an Indiana legend. He won an NCAA
championship at Indiana in 1981 before winning two rings with the
Detroit Pistons in a 13-year NBA career that ended in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Harassment Caller Arrested in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A farmer who has repeatedly dialed
the Chinese capital's emergency telephone numbers to harass city
police has been arrested in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yandong, a farmer from north China's Hebei Province who
made a living in Beijing by repairing mobile phones and pagers and
selling second-hand cellular phones, has dialed the two emergency
phone lines, 110 and 122, hundreds of times to abuse the police
since mid-May.
</P>
<P>
But Liu isn't the only caller to berate police: On May 10 alone,
switchboard operators at both lines received over 2,000 calls. The

<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen
met here today with a delegation of the Chinese History and
Culture Educational Foundation For Youth from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his hope that young people in Hong Kong can
learn more about Chinese history and culture and make
contributions to the revitalization of the Chinese nation and the
long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that Chinese people should carry forward
their own splendid history and culture while learning from
advanced science and technology of the world and cultures of other
nations.
</P>
<P>
It is significant for Hong Kong compatriots, who are members of
the big family of the motherland, to get acquainted with the
history and culture of their own motherland and raise the national
self-confidence and sense of social responsibility, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said that experiences have shown that the "one country, two

cooperation between Vietnam and China will further develop in the
21st century through the efforts of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Luong made the remarks during a meeting with Chinese Ambassador
to Vietnam Li Jiazhong who will soon finish his term here.

During the Li's term of four and half years, the relationship
between Vietnam and China has greatly developed, Luong said.
General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of Vietnam Le Kha Phieu and General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin had met in
February, 1999, setting the framework of "long-term, stable and
good-neighborly relations with comprehensive cooperation oriented
to the future" for developing relations between the two parties
and two countries, he added.

<P>
Luong noted that signing the Treaty of Land Border between the

demarcation and promote further development of the two countries'
economic, trade and cultural relations.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese President expressed this belief that under the

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian, Chinese Premiers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov
met here Wednesday with visiting Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji, and
they exchanged views and reached broad consensus on further
advancing bilateral ties in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived here Tuesday on an official visit to Bulgaria, the
first leg of his tour of six European nations and the headquarters
of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Kostov said the fact that Zhu chose Bulgaria as the first stop
of his Europe tour represents an affirmation of Bulgaria's role in
the region. The Bulgarian government appreciates and highly
evaluates this, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sofia attaches great importance to China's positive role in
global affairs and admires the immense achievements China has made
in its reforms and opening up to the outside world, Kostov said.
</P>
<P>
Although Bulgaria sees its integration into Europe as the
priority of its foreign policy, it also attaches great importance
to the development of relations with Asia-Pacific countries,
especially China, he said.
</P>
<P>
All political forces in Bulgaria share the same view on
developing ties with China, which concerns the Bulgaria's long-
term national interests, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Kostov reiterated Sofia's long-standing one-China policy and
vowed not to establish any official contacts with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, on his part, expressed satisfaction with the development
of bilateral ties over recent years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Bulgaria was the second country to establish
diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China after its
birth in 1949 and that the exchanges between the two peoples date
back to ancient times.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates the importance attached by the Bulgarian
government to developing ties with China and the efforts made in
this regard, Zhu said. He also thanked the Bulgarian government
for its long-standing one-China policy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Bulgaria is an important country in southeast Europe
and has played an active role in promoting friendly relations with
neighboring countries and in maintaining regional peace, security
and stability.
</P>
<P>
China understands and respects Bulgaria's policy of
participating in the process of European integration, and
appreciates its policy of developing cooperation with all
countries in the world, including China, added Zhu.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier said China regards Bulgaria as a
trustworthy and important partner in Europe and it is willing to
see a greater role played by Bulgaria in promoting peace and
stability in the Balkans and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Kostov briefed each other on the recent developments in
their countries and exchanged views on promoting economic
cooperation. Kostov said he hopes that the two sides will
increase their cooperation and he welcomes more Chinese
businessmen to invest in his country.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said Bulgaria is a traditional trading partner of China,
but in recent years the volume of bilateral trade has not been
large and their economic and technological cooperation is still at
an initial stage of development. The two countries should explore
new ideas, new methods and new channels to expand their economic
and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier stressed China's readiness to join hands
with Bulgaria in actively promoting the lasting, stable and
comprehensive development of friendly bilateral relations in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
He also called for joint efforts in tapping potential in
mutually beneficial cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual respect, seeking common grounds while reserving differences
and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also urged the strengthening of Sino-Bulgarian cooperation
in international affairs so as to safeguard common interests.
</P>
<P>
Kostov expressed agreement to Zhu's views, saying he was fully
confident of the further and comprehensive development of
Bulgarian-China relations.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the two sides signed five documents on
bilateral cooperation in culture, education, health, environment,
communications, and labor and social affairs.

<HEADLINE> EU Blocks Merger of U.S. Telecom Giants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) Wednesday
blocked a planned merger of United States telecom giants WorldCom
Inc. and Sprint Corp. out of competition concerns.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation EU,
said in a statement that the planned 120-billion-U.S.-dollar
merger would create a dominant position in the market of top-level
universal Internet connectivity.
</P>
<P>
The commission argued that the combination of the merging
parties' extensive networks and large customer base would lead to
the creation of such a powerful force that both competitors and
customers would have to depend on the new company to obtain
universal Internet connectivity.
</P>
<P>
"This would have allowed the merged company to behave
independently of both its competitors and customers to dictate
conditions and prices in the market to the detriment of consumers
around the world and particularly in the 15 European Union member
states," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The commission also added that the companies' proposal to
divest Sprint's Internet business was insufficient to resolve the
competition concerns resulting from the planned merger.
</P>
<P>
The two American companies said, however, that they had
withdrawn their merger deal from the commission's review process
on Tuesday after the U.S. Justice Department sued to block the
merger with the argument that the merged company would affect the
competition in the Internet and long-distance telephone markets.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says It Blocks Big Rebel Group in Chechnya, Fighting Goes on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Wednesday that it
troops have surrounded a large group of over 200 rebels in a
forest in central Chechnya and a battle is still raging now
despite heavy losses on both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports, the fierce bloody fighting has
lasted for three days near the villages of Serzhen-Yurt and Avtury
in the central Chechen district of Shali.
</P>
<P>
So far, 12 Russian servicemen have been killed and 16 other
were wounded in this fighting, while the rebels' casualties were
much more, topping to 70-80 deaths and dozens of injuries, the
Russian presidential aide on Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky told
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Federal paratroops, motorized infantry troops, special Defense
Ministry task forces and Interior Ministry troops are involved in
this special operation aimed at eliminating the remnant militants
in the republic, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Numerous reports indicate that most of the rebels are Arab
mercenaries, and the military expects the rebels' tolls to
increase," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The press center for the Russian forces in the North Caucasus,
cited by Russian news agencies, also said a major rebel' guerrilla
formation led by a senior aide of Jordanian warlord Khattab has
run into a tight grip of federal troops in Serzhen-Yurt since
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said a Russian interior ministry convoy headed on Monday
for the village of Serzhen-Yurt to conduct identity checks and
encountered with a strong rebel group of up to 200 fighters.
</P>
<P>
The interior forces sealed off the rebels near Serzhen-Yurt
and exchanged fire with them, then more federal reinforcement
units ran into the battle. Now the fighting is continuing.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla formation has been dispersed, leaving over 60
bodies on the scene. A search and destroy operation against the
remaining rebels is being conducted, said the press center, not
naming the number of casualties among the federal troops.
</P>
<P>
Lieut. Gen. Vladimir Bokovikov, deputy commander of the
Russian forces in the North Caucasus, told journalists Wednesday
that some well-known rebel field commanders are probably among the
besieged rebels group, whose backbone is mainly made up of Arab
mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Russian military said there were still
2,300 rebels at large in Chechnya engaged in guerrilla warfare,
ambushes and terrorist acts against federal troops and civilians.

<HEADLINE> Ottawa Researchers Find Rare Virus to Kill Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A research team from the University
of Ottawa has discovered a rare virus to kill human cancer cells,
the Ottawa Citizen newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Human cancer cells are "completely blown away" by vesicular
stomatitis virus (VSV) that normally causes only minor flu-like
infections in people, said the Canadian researchers.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Bell, who heads the team, said the virus has destroyed
a wide variety of cancer cells in laboratory tests with melanoma,
lung, colon, breast and prostate cancers and leukemia.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bell, a cancer researcher and a professor of medicine at
the University of Ottawa, also said that VSV isn't the only virus
that has targeted cancer cells in laboratory tests.
</P>
<P>
Some day, patients may receive a multi-pronged cancer treatment
by means of a combination of viruses, as is the case for
chemotherapy today by using a combination of drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
A minor irritant discovered mainly in tropical countries, VSV
causes mild, flu-like symptoms. In Canada, it is reported to be
able to infect cattle, causing temporary blisters on the lip like
cold sores, but without lasting damage.

<HEADLINE> China Builds "Safety Net" for World's Oldest Water Project (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the Zipingpu
Reservoir, designed to be a "safety net" for the world's oldest
water conservation project, started today on the upper reaches of
the Minjiang River, southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
This marks a big step China has made to protect the Dujiang Dam
(Dujiangyan), an ancient but still operating water conservancy
system that continues to serve local agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Zipingpu Reservoir, six kilometers away from the Dujiangyan,
is a large-scale undertaking able to irrigate farmland, prevent
floods and generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
The 6.2 billion yuan (746 million U.S. dollars) project, with a
storage capacity of 1.1 billion cubic meters and a 156-meter-tall
dam, is expected to be completed by the end of 2006. The reservoir
also boasts a normal water storage capacity of 800 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
The International Cooperation Bank of Japan provided a 260
million U.S. dollar loan for the project.
</P>
<P>
Many experts attending today's launching ceremony described the
Zipingpu Reservoir as a "safety net" for Dujiangyan.
</P>
<P>
Professor Luo Zhewen from the State Administration of Cultural
Heritage said that upon completion, the reservoir will greatly
reduce the threat of flooding at the Dujiang Dam.
</P>
<P>
Before the 1980s, the Minjiang River annually washed more than
20 million tons of sand and stones onto the Dujiang Dam during the
summer and autumn flood seasons. The amount increased to 26
million tons annually by the start of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, 21 serious floods have occurred on the
upper reaches of the Minjiang River, a major tributary of the
Yangtze River, posing a serious threat to the Dujiang Dam and the
Chengdu Plain, a leading grain producer benefited enormously from
Dujiangyan.

<HEADLINE> China Builds "Safety Net" for World's Oldest Water Project (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The enormous Dujiangyan water conservancy project was built on
the upper reaches of the Minjiang River in 256 B.C. during the
Warring States Period (476-221 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
The 2,256-year-old project, 40 kilometers northwest of Chengdu,
capital of Sichuan Province, now irrigates 687,000 hectares of
farmland. It also supplies water for 50 big and medium-sized
cities, and hundreds of industrial enterprises in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
The Zipingpu Reservoir will reduce the amount of sand and
stones washed to Dujiangyan by 75 percent each year, according to
experts.
</P>
<P>
But more importantly, said Peng Shuming, director of the
Dujiangyan Management Bureau, the reservoir will help improve the
irrigating capacity of Dujiangyan and ease water shortages in
Chengdu and other cities in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Chengdu is one of the 300 Chinese cities suffering from water
shortages. Dujiangyan provides water for both domestic and
industrial use in the city.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Sichuan Provincial Forestry Bureau said that
tree-cutting at the sources of the Minjiang River has been stopped
since the mid-1990s. More than 10,000 lumberjacks have put down
their axes and started to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the efforts of more than 100,000 farmers who are
turning hillside farmland into forested land, local water
departments have also launched aerial-planting in the area along
the upper reaches of the Minjiang River.
</P>
<P>
These efforts have guaranteed the water sources for Minjiang
River and also the safety of Dujiangyan, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Li Chuanming, a farmer who traveled more than 100 kilometers to
the construction site today, said excitedly, "We can also use
water from Dujiangyan after the completion of the Zipingpu
Reservoir."
</P>
<P>
The area irrigated by the Dujiang Dam will reach one million
hectares by 2030, according to project plans.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to
prosper as a major and leading film production center in the world,
with outputs which can achieve the highest standards at the
international level, said Carrie Yau, secretary for information
technology and broadcasting (designate) of Hong Kong, Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government was fully aware of the talents in the
local film industry and the important contributions it made to
Hong Kong's economy and image as an international city, said Yau,
when she addressed the opening ceremony of the fourth Hong Kong
International Film and TV Market (FILMART) Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The reviving Asian economy and the strong demand for
entertainment content due to the rapid development of the Internet
business have resulted in a robust turnaround in the local film
industry, not only in terms of output but also in raising quality
and gaining international recognition, according to Yau.
</P>
<P>
She said the government has established the Film Services
Advisory Committee, with members drawn from the industry, to
advise on matters relating to the government's objective to
support and promote the development of the film industry in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
It also set up the 100 million HK dollars (12.8 million U.S.
dollars) Film Development Fund to provide financial support to
projects which are beneficial to the healthy and long-term
development of the local film industry, she added.
</P>
<P>
FILMART started in 1997 as Hong Kong's film and television
industry's first international trade fair, bringing together
producers, distributors, and suppliers and buyers in the industry
from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, the event
has grown in the past three years not only in terms of numbers of
exhibitors and participants, but also in the scope of its
activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The friendship between Tajikistan
and China combined with China's rising prosperity will ensure the
further growth of economic and trade relations between the two
neighboring countries, the charge d'affaires of the Tajik embassy
to China said today.
</P>
<P>
Added to that, Chinese President Jiang Zemin's upcoming visit
to Tajikistan will be a "historic event" that will play a positive
role in promoting good-neighborliness and mutual understanding,
and boost mutually-beneficial cooperation, Shuhrat Saidmuradov
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the heads of state of the two countries will
engage in wide-ranging discussions, including maintaining regional
security and stability and defining a strategic partnership
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Saidmuradov said that the strengthening of relations with China
has been one of top priorities of Tajikistan's foreign policy
since the establishment of their diplomatic relations in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He added that China was the first foreign destination outside
the Commonwealth of Independent States by Tajikistan President

Since then, President Rakhmonov paid three visits to China,
Saidmuradov said, adding that thanks to efforts made by leaders of
the two countries, the two sides have had sound cooperation in
political, economic, trade, cultural, scientific, technological
and energy areas, and a series of documents signed by the two have
laid a foundation for mutually beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Tajikistan and China have no disagreements on political issues.
They share the same or similar views on many international and
regional matters," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China-Tajikistan joint ventures are well-known in
Tajikistan, and Tajikistan has created a favorable investment
environment for Chinese businessmen in mining, petrochemicals,
textile, and processing industries. The two countries are now
discussing exploration of natural gas in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to take geographic advantages and consider how
they complement each other economically, so as to further expand
economic and trade exchanges," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, issues on transportation, banking settlement
and information need to be addressed as soon as possible.

</P>
<P>
Saidmuradov went on to say that Tajikistan borders northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, and they share the same
traditions, cultures and religions, adding he hopes that China's
strategy to develop the west will make Xinjiang even more
prosperous, which in turn would boost border trade and cross-
border transportation between the two countries.
</P>

Referring to next month's Five-Nation Summit in Dushanbe, the
capital city of Tajikistan, the diplomat said that the five
participating countries -- China, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Kazakhstan

international terrorism, national separatist forces and religious
extremism, and the outcome of their talks will have a profound
impact on the region and the Asia-Pacific at the large.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tajikistan, China and Kyrgyzstan will sign a border
agreement, he said, adding that from building mutual trust in
military fields in border areas, the five countries will extend
areas of cooperation to politics, economics, trade, transportation,
energy and ecology.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Complains of Israel's Delay of Ground Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has lodged
complaints about Israel's go-slow tactics to delay ground checks
aiming to ascertain whether or not the Jewish state has ended its
encroachments on the Lebanese border, local press reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan told Lebanese Prime Minister
Salim Hoss Tuesday he had urged the Israeli government to stop such
border infractions and make certain that local army commanders will
abstain from violating the U.N.-drawn Blue Line, An Nahar newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Barak has promised me to do so", Annan was quoted as assuring
Hoss in a telephone call.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged Israel on Monday to quickly terminate
the border violations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said Tuesday he was happy with
the U.N. Security Council statement, which amounted to an
international recognition of Israel's guilt "in cheating on the
compatibility of its withdrawal with U.N. resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
Lahoud expressed Lebanon's "unflinching determination to
cooperate fully with the United Nations." He also said he is
hopeful that U.N. efforts will soon "end the Israeli encroachments
on the border," the Middle East Reporter newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said after his talk on the phone with Annan that he had
impressed on the U.N. chief "the dire need for stepped up
international pressure on the Israeli side to withdraw from the
violated border locations."
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank you for your efforts to ascertain that the
Israelis will comply with the U.N. resolution and wish to reiterate
that we will never give up a single yard of our territory," Hoss
told Annan. The two leaders agreed to keep in constant touch on the
problem.
</P>
<P>
An Nahar paper quoted an unnamed Lebanese source as saying there
are 10 of the 14 encroachments still uncorrected.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. is only handling seven of the 10 remaining
encroachments because the other three fall in areas under the
jurisdiction of the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force on the Golan
Heights and not within the mandate of the United Nations
International Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).

<HEADLINE> Kenyan House Enraged by AIDS Test at U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Parliament has expressed
outrage over compulsory HIV/AIDS testing for Kenyans wishing to
travel to the United States by the U.S. embassy in Nairobi, local
media reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Norman Nyagah recounted to the House how he and five other
Kenyan members of parliament (MP) were subjected to a humiliating
experience before they were given visas.
</P>
<P>
He said the MPs were forced to strip in front of an Asian
doctor who tested them for AIDS, adding that they would take up
the matter with the U. S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
MP Newton Kulundu, one of the group recently travelled to
Washington for an international conference, told the House they
were forced to endure a compulsory HIV/AIDS test, saying it is
contrary to World Health Organization requirements.
</P>
<P>
MP Grace Mwewa added her voice to the chorus, saying she and
her colleagues spent "sleepless nights" after they were subjected
to the tests.
</P>
<P>
She wondered why Kenyan citizens are subjected to such
humiliation while American citizens wishing to visit Kenya have no
such restrictions imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
In response to the angry reaction of the House, Speaker Francis
Kaparo said the sentiments of the House were by extension the
sentiments of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
It was the duty of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take up
the matter of the "inhuman treatment of Kenyans" with the U.S.
government, Kaparo added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Residents Satisfied With PLA Troops: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 28 (Xinhua) -- A poll conducted recently by
Hong Kong media shows that 93 percent of Hong Kong residents are
satisfied with the performance of the People's Liberation Army (
PLA) troops stationed in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ground, naval and air forces of the PLA in Hong Kong have
done an "excellent" job and fulfilled their defense tasks over the
past three years, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
The PLA troops came to Hong Kong after its return to China on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The troops have strictly carried out the instructions of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and followed the rules of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central
Military Commission.
</P>
<P>
No soldier has done anything to sully the image of the PLA, and
the troops have earned the respect of local residents for their
fine performance, the poll determined.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the troops conducted many drills
after the approval of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Regional govenment.
</P>
<P>
The troops also helped the local government to maintain social
security and combat natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
After their arrival in Hong Kong, the soldiers strictly abided
by the rules and regulations of the PLA and showed deference for
the lifestyle and customs of local people.
</P>
<P>
They also participated in various social activities, including
planting trees and flowers and donating blood for Hong Kong
residents.

will again show their full support to the coming LegCo elections,
just as they did in 1998," Ip said.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Insurer Opens Nationwide Hotline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's largest property insurance
company, the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), today
opened a nationwide consumer hotline, the first ever by a Chinese
insurer.
</P>
<P>
The hotline, at 95518, provides 24-hour service to customers
and the general public for reporting accidents, consultations,
information on new policies, complaints and scheduling
appointments, said Sun Xiyue, PICC general manager, at today's
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that hotline will enable PICC to attend to policy
holders timely, whenever and wherever they need insurance service.
</P>
<P>
In the past, customers with questions or problems have had to
contact the original underwriting PICC branches, which has proved
troublesome and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
With the setting up of more than 300 call centers nationwide,
customers can now dial the local 95518 and will be served by the
local PICC branch, which can also transmit the customers'
information to the company's intranet system.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 95518 hotline, the company now also offers
new services such as 24 hour availability, rescue at accident
sites, help to customers in traffic accidents, and handling claims
within a limited time.
</P>
<P>
The hotline marks a major effort by the PICC to improve its
services by integrating its existing edge in network and staff
with electronic management, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
It is also a positive move on the side of the PICC to prepare
for tougher competition in the insurance market following China's
expected accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), he added.

<HEADLINE> China Rushes Relief Funds to Drought-hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government decided
today to divert 400 million yuan (about 50 million U.S. dollars)
worth of budgetary funds to build emergency water supply projects
in the drought-plagued areas in northern China.
</P>
<P>
According to a release from the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), the money will be used to sink wells, build
water diversion projects, store rain water and tap into the bottom
line of reservoirs in a bid to secure drinking water for local
residents and livestock in northwest, northeast and north China.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to spray drought-resistant liquids on
crops in a move to save enough grain to feed local farmers. It
will also be used to buy equipment for water transport and storage,
pumps and fuels.
</P>
<P>
The SDPC said that the relief funds are allocated specifically
for matters of "extreme urgency" facing farmers in the drought-hit
areas.
</P>
<P>
The most severe drought in the decade has turned top soil in
many areas in northern China into a 7- to 20-centimeter-thick
layer of dust, causing a shortage of drinking water for 16.2
million people and 13.7 million livestock
</P>
<P>
By June 13, 14.4 million hectares of crops had been destroyed
by drought, and crops in three million hectares of dry field and
333,000 hectares of rice paddies have been affected.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing drought since last winter has given rise to locust
plagues in northern China. More than 3.3 million hectares of crops
have been attacked by locusts.
</P>
<P>
The drought was most severe in Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia
in north China and Shaanxi, Gansu and Ningxia in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The drought has drawn the attention of the Chinese government.
President Jiang Zemin visited Ningxia and Gansu to inspect the
most affected areas from June 14-19.

<HEADLINE> Neolithic Axe Discovered in NW China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a stone hand axe believed to be from the Neolithic Age
at a site of the Qijia Culture in northwest China's Qinghai
Province.
</P>
<P>
The artifact, which experts said was probably used as a musical
instrument for special rituals, was of great value to the study of
an early state's origin, according to Professor Xu Xinguo,
director of the Qinghai Provincial Archaeological Research
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The axe weighs 35 kilograms, is 90 centimeters long and 60 cm
wide. It produced a rhythmic sound when it was knocked.
</P>
<P>
"The stone hand axe, together with some unearthed jade
artifacts, indicate the existence of a tribal power center. It
could be a great archaeological finding," Prof. Xu was quoted as
saying in today's Guangming Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Qijia Culture flourished in the transition period from the
Neolithic Age to the Bronze Age, some 3,500 to 4,000 years ago,
according to experts at the institute.
</P>
<P>
The ruins are located in Lajia Village, Minhe County, at the
upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The site includes two half-pit houses. In one house,
archaeologists found 14 human skeletons, including adults and
children, men and women. One of the women is holding a baby.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists from the Qinghai institute and the
Archaeological Research Institute under the Chinese Academy of
Social Science are working together at the site.
</P>
<P>
Three archaeologists found the stone artifact by chance when
they took shelter from the rain at the house of a local farmer,
who had kept the axe in his courtyard for years, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Chinese Prone to Dementia: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Two studies in China have both
proved that elderly Chinese are prone to senile dementia,
challenging previous opinions that China was at low risk for age-
related disease.
</P>
<P>
A study involving 2,788 people over age 60 found that 208
people suffered from senile dementia, an incidence rate of 7.5
percent. Leading risk factors were advanced age, poor educational
backgrounds and hardships associated with living in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of the surveyed women hit 9.7 percent,
compared with 5.8 percent of the men, according to the research
conducted by the Beijing Medical Research Center of Gerontology.
</P>
<P>
Another study among 1,728 retirees in Beijing also indicated
that a family history of dementia, experience of persecution
during China's Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), exposure to
electromagnetic fields, and brain trauma could also cause senile
dementia.
</P>
<P>
A report in today's Health News estimated that there might be
three million dementia patients among senior citizens in China at
present.
</P>
<P>
Chinese researchers are adopting traditional Chinese medicines
and acupuncture to treat the disease, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China, the world's most populous country, is now graying.
Demographers estimate that there will be 130 million people age 60
or above in the country this year, and by the middle of the next
century the number will reach 400 million, making up more than 25
percent of the whole population.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Hails Mapping of Human Genome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have highly
praised the completion of the working draft of human genome map,
which was accomplished by scientists from six countries and
announced on the Internet Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important scientific result, which can help human
beings know more about themselves and how to treat and prevent
some major diseases," said Yang Huanming, director of the Human
Genome Research Center of the Institute of Genetics of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have completed their share of the
international research project -- one percent of the sequencing of
human genome -- ahead of the schedule, said Lu Yongxiang,
president of the CAS, adding that this shows Chinese scientists
are at the forefront of life science research.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have shared the techniques and material of
the international human genome project and will build their own
sets of large-scale human genome sequencing techniques.
</P>
<P>
He said Chinese scientists' achievement will greatly promote
the development of the country's biological information, the
biological functional genome and the development of other
frontiers of life science research in China.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of disease-related genes have already been positioned on
the working draft, and scientists predict that all the sequencing
work of human genome will be completed by June of 2001. By then,
the accuracy of human genome map will reach 99.99 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Round of Cyprus' Peace Talks in Doubt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- With a U.S. envoy for Cyprus
winding up his visit to the island Wednesday, a wave of visits to
Cyprus by foreign envoys to prepare the new round of Cyprus talks
calmed down, leaving the prospect for the talks in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Following the heels of David Hannay, British envoy on Cyprus and
Alvaro de Soto, United Nations Secretary-General's envoy on Cyprus,
U.S. Presidential Emissary for Cyprus Alfred Moses started his
three-day visit here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The main target of all these visits was to make the third round
of talks tackle substantive issues, such as security, constitution,
property and territory.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after an abortive pro-Athens coup by
Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two communities have already completed two
rounds of proximity talks under U.N. auspices in an effort to find
a solution to the Cyprus issue, during which the two sides had
merely set out their positions and given necessary clarifications.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot side supports the U.N. formula on Cyprus,
which calls for the establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal federal
republic on the island, with a single sovereignty and international
personality.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot side, however, insists on a confederation
solution and demands the breakaway state in the north, unilaterally
declared in 1983 and only recognized by Turkey, be recognized by
the international community.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks are due to begin in Geneva on July 5.
</P>
<P>
But so far Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash refused to
confirm outright whether he will be attending the Geneva talks next
week.
</P>
<P>
Denktash is angered at the U.N. Security Council's decision
earlier this month to drop an addendum to the renewal of the
UNFICYP (U.N. Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus) mandate, which would
have registered the Turkish Cypriot side's approval of the force on
the island.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. made the decision after bowing to pressure from the
Greek Cypriot side, which said it will not give its permission for
UNFICYP's mandate to be renewed if the addendum is included.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has threatened to pull out of the talks over the issue,
or to reconsider cooperation with UNFICYP in the north.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Moses on Tuesday, Denktash said "we don't
know yet if there will be a third round," insisting that the talks
process have been damaged and that the Security Council decision is
a grave mistake.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Moses said he is looking forward to the third
round, adding, however, that he could not say whether the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides will be in Geneva too, because he "cannot
speak on behalf of the two sides."

Ugandan voters are asked to choose a political system between
the Multiparty System and the Movement System in the referendum
which will start at 7:00 a.m. and end at 5:00 p.m. local time on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will go ahead as planned unless there is a court
 injunction, Kizito said. "But it is almost impossible for a court
 injunction to be issued," he added.
</P>
<P>
Paul Ssemogerere, the opposition Democratic Party chief, has
applied for a court order to bar the referendum, but it is yet to
be granted.
</P>
<P>
Ssemogerere has urged Ugandans to boycott the referendum,
saying that the referendum is rigged and the results are already
known.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the ruling National Resistance
Movement, which claims it is a "non-political-party" system, will
win in the referendum.

<HEADLINE> WHO Issues New Recommendations on Use of Mobile Phones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty still exists about the
health effects of radiofrequency (RF) fields which mobile phones
and their base stations emit, the World Health Organization (WHO)
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Health conditions which have been ascribed to the use of
mobile phones include some types of cancer and changes in brain
activity. But no studies on humans have yet supported these claims,
" the WHO stated.
</P>
<P>
Following a recent international conference on the possible
health effects of mobile telephones conducted by the WHO, and the
release of key national reviews in Canada and the United Kingdom,
the WHO has updated its recommendations. They include:
</P>
<P>
-- The need for new studies to confirm recent findings that
mobile phones may cause changes in brain activity, reaction time,
and sleep patterns;
</P>
<P>
-- Motorists should be strongly discouraged from using mobile
phones while driving;
</P>
<P>
-- National authorities should adopt health-based EMF (the
International Electromagnetic Fields) guidelines;
</P>
<P>
-- If, because of public concern, authorities want to introduce
additional precautionary measures to reduce exposure to RF fields,
they should not undermine the science base of the guidelines by
incorporating arbitrary additional safety factors into the
exposure limits;
</P>
<P>
-- Precautionary measures should be introduced as a separate
policy that encourages, through voluntary means, the reduction of
RF fields by equipment manufacturers and the public;
</P>
<P>
-- If individuals are concerned they might choose to limit
their own or their children's RF exposure by limiting the length
of calls, or by using "hands-free" devices to keep mobile phones
away from the head and body;
</P>
<P>
-- Scientific evidence dose not indicate any need for RF-
absorbing covers or other "absorbing devices" on mobile phones;
</P>
<P>
-- While RF field levels around base stations are not
considered a health risk, siting decisions should take into
account aesthetics and public sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, in many countries over half the
population already uses mobile phones and the number of mobile
phone subscribers is predicted to reach as many as 1.6 billion
worldwide in the year 2005.

<HEADLINE> Russia Releases Suspected Lithuanian Spy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Russia has set free a suspected
double Lithuanian spy, who was detained Monday in Moscow on the
charge of working for the Lithuanian State Security Service (LSSS)
and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the Interfax news
agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pavel Ilin, 24, a resident from the Lithuanian capital of
Vilnius, was captured by the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB)
on suspicions of spying for Lithuanian and U.S. intelligence
services, but was released from custody Tuesday evening, Interfax
cited the FSB's public relations department as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the department, the arrested Lithuanian has
admitted having been a salaried agent of the Lithuanian secret
service DGB and involved in a CIA's operation aimed at penetrating
the information networks of the FSB since the beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Ilin, code-named "Student" in the FSB's records, is
proved to have done no harm to Russia's interests, and therefore
criminal proceedings will not be initiated against him. He will be
deported out of Russia in the very near future and be forfeited
the right to re-enter the Russian Federation, the FSB said.
</P>
<P>
The LSSS had said earlier that it "has never conducted and is
not conducting any hostile or subversive activity against the
Russian Federation, and does not know the person the Russian
special services have called an exposed Lithuanian citizen."

BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC) and the China Development Bank (CDB) signed an
agreement today on the acceptance of bank bills, marking that the
CDB has become China's first policy bank to handle bank bill

</P>

To meet the challenges to be faced with after China's entry

the ICBC's debts to banks rose 44.7 percent from the same period
last year and 39.5 percent from the beginning of this year.

The CDB is China's largest policy bank. It has made significant
contribution to the construction of the country's infrastructure,
basic industries and key projects.

cooperating closely with the CDB on the granting of loans,
factoring a total of 633 projects by extending 62 billion yuan in

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Seems to Relax Stance on European Defense: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military signalled that
it will not wholly reject the European Security and Defense
Identity (ESDI), a defense mechanism of the European Union (EU),
which excludes non-EU NATO members, such as Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The flexibility over the ESDI emerged following NATO Supreme
Allied Commander in Europe Joseph W. Ralston met with Turkish
President Ahmet Necdet Sezer, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and
Chief of the General Staff Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu, during his
recent visit to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News Wednesday quoted sources as saying Gen.
Kivrikoglu told Ralston the Turkish military is in favor of the
plans, but has to consult the government before reaching a final
decision.
</P>
<P>
The proposed ESDI envisages the establishment of a EU-led
decision-making structure on defense, independent from the U.S.-led
NATO and excluding non-EU members.
</P>
<P>
Eight days ago, when the EU summit in Portugal decided to
exclude non-EU NATO members such as Turkey from the ESDI, Ankara
was outraged and threatened not to allow use of its NATO facilities
for EU-led operations.
</P>
<P>
Turkish defense officials said Ankara has been an active
contributor, within the framework of NATO, to European security
since the Cold War and should not be excluded from a European
security and defense architecture.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Turkish Foreign Ministry called on EU members to
reverse its decision at its next summit in Nice, France, in
December.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear why the Turkish military has backed away from
their previous stance over the ESDI. But sources said the United
States has been asking Turkey to examine the ESDI on a case by case
basis rather than rejecting all the proposals.
</P>
<P>
Although U.S. officials have told the Turkish side that they
fully support Turkey's wish to have a place in the ESDI's decision-
making mechanism, Washington is not willing to see Turkey and
Europe damage each other in case of Ankara's boycott, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a NATO member since 1952 and a EU candidate, has made
efforts to join the European defense mechanism, under the support
of the United States which worried that the ESDI will replace NATO
and reduce Washington's role in the European security affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Ministry of Economy and Commerce of the United
Arab Emirates is reviewing all existing commercial laws, with new
laws to be issued in the coming phase.
</P>
<P>
The review on the companies law may lead to the formation of an
investments law, Wednesday's Dubai-based Gulf News daily quoted the
ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- As high oil prices boosted import bills, Turkey's
foreign trade deficit continued to grow in the first four months of
the year, reported Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The State Institute of Statistics (DIE) announced Tuesday the
deficit in the first four months increased 136.1 percent to 7
billion U.S. dollars, with exports totaling 8.6 billion dollars and
imports 15.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
During the period, growth in exports was registered at 2.5
percent and imports at 37.2 percent compared to the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The government has projected a foreign trade deficit of around
18 billion dollars for 2000, with imports totaling 46 billion and
exports 28.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish Council for Assessing Competition in
Importation put a dumping tax on polyester fibers imported from
India and China's Taiwan, reported Turkish Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Trade Undersecretariat published its circular for
preventing unfair competition in importation in the Official
Gazette Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said the low prices of polyester coming from India and
China's Taiwan are damaging domestic production.
</P>
<P>
While tax rates of 6.8-14.1 percent have been levied on Indian
polyester and 8.7-28.6 percent on polyester coming from Taiwan, no
taxes were imposed on Thai polyester.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Turkish company Fiba Holding has allied itself
with the world-leading network solutions provider Cisco System in
order to transform its operations to e-business, reported Turkish
Daily News on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tony Burton, director of Cisco System Internet's business
solutions group, said the alliance is aimed at improving Fiba's
competitiveness in the holding company's Internet-based operation
models.
</P>
<P>
Fiba Holding Chairman Husnu Ozyegin said the company aims to cut
down administrative expenses by 20-30 percent in a few years
through e-business.

<HEADLINE> Levy Urges Palestinians to Make More Concessions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel is interested in
participating in a Washington summit to negotiate settlement of the
Israeli-Palestinian issues, but much more work is needed for
preparation of such a summit, said Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his talks with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, Levy said the Palestinian side should
make necessary concessions to guarantee the success of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks have entered a
crucial stage and big gaps still remain between the two sides on
almost all key issues and these gaps are hindering the success of
the summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Levy, who has recently said he is opposed to a summit at this
moment, criticized Prime Minister Ehud Barak Tuesday night, saying
he can not understand the enthusiasm for the summit and broadly
hinting Barak is misleading the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Levy told the Israeli television that he believes Barak is
rushing toward a summit without heeding clear signs that
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is not ready to make any
concessions.
</P>
<P>
Albright said her talks with Levy was balanced and they
discussed various elements regarding the convening of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of her visit to the region is to study whether the
time is ripe for such a summit and she will report to President
Bill Clinton who will decide whether to organize the summit in
Washington, she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright returned to the region Tuesday evening and is going to
hold talks with Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah before
holding another round of talks with Barak later in the day.
</P>
<P>
She met with Barak late Tuesday night and the two discussed the
status of the Israeli-Palestinian talks and assessed various
aspects for holding the summit which Barak wants to be held early
July.
</P>
<P>
For the summit, Barak is reportedly offering the Palestinians
a "peace package" consisting of following points:
</P>
<P>
-- Both sides will declare the termination of the conflict
between the two peoples and the resolution of any future claims by
means of talks and other peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel will recognize an independent Palestinian state and
transfer more than 80 percent of the West Bank territories to the
Palestinians. The Jordan Valley will remain under Israeli control
for 10 to 12 years.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian state will not be permitted to maintain an
army with heavy weapons and the Israel Defense Force (IDF) will be
able to maintain early-warning stations in Palestinian territories
and deploy forces there in the event of an invasion from the east.
</P>
<P>
-- An agreed-upon mechanism will be set up for future talks on
Jerusalem and other issues that have not yet been solved.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is ready to have international religious figures
assist in administrating the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian refugees will not be permitted to return to
sovereign Israeli territories under the "right of return," though
Israel will take in refugees for humanitarian reasons and for
family reunion, and an international body will be established with
Israeli participation to decide on compensation and rehabilitation
for the refugees in their countries of residence.
</P>
<P>
-- The two countries will sign a free-trade agreement and
Palestinians will be able to continue working in Israel.

<HEADLINE> ADB, Vietnam Sign Four Loan Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Asian Development Bank (ADB) and
Vietnam Wednesday signed here four loan agreements, supporting
Vietnam's poverty reduction and efforts at accelerating reform of
State Owned Enterprises (SOE).
</P>
<P>
These agreements are for East-West Corridor Project, Teacher
Training Project, SOE Reform and Corporate Governance Program.
</P>
<P>
Signatories were Governor of the State Bank of Vietnam le Duc
Thuy and ADB Resident Representative in Vietnam John Samy.
</P>
<P>
The four loans were approved by the ADB last December, for a
total loan amount of 150 million U.S. dollars including 110
million U.S. dollars from the Asian Development Fund (ADF) and the
rest from the ADB's Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR).
</P>
<P>
The loan for the East-West Corridor Project in an amount of 25
million U.S. dollars is to help Vietnam rehabilitate 83 km of its
part of Road 9 under the Greater Mekong Sub-regional Project.
</P>
<P>
The ADB approved another 25 million U.S. dollars loan, as part
of the 35.4 million U.S. dollars Teacher Training Project, which
is to improve the quality and efficiency of the lower secondary
education system. The project aims to produce more teachers for
lower secondary schools in ten of the poorest provinces of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Samy said that "both projects are designed to bring about
poverty reduction, which is ADB's overarching goal".
</P>
<P>
A news release of the ADB-Vietnam Resident Mission said that
the signing today also gave a substantial lift to Vietnam's
efforts at accelerating reform of SOEs and attracting foreign
investors. Vietnam will receive two loans from ADB, totaling 100
million U.S. dollars, to carry out SOE reform and Corporate
governance program.

<HEADLINE> Manila, MILF Exhausting Efforts to Forge Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) continue to exhaust all
possibilities to forge an interim peace pact by June 30, National
Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said back-channelling efforts are now ongoing in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia where representatives of member-states of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) are gathered for their
regular meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Back-channelling efforts continue. Our representatives have
worked out a proposed interim agreement with MILF Vice Chairman
for Political Affairs Ghazali Jaafar," Aguirre said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
He noted that officials of the central committee of the MILF
are also in Kuala Lumpur, in the hope of being given a chance to
lobby for the MILF's interests.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has set a June 30 deadline
for the government and the MILF to at least come up with an
interim peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
An extension, Estrada said, would only be possible if the MILF
drops its secessionist bid and stops its criminal and terrorist
acts.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the latest draft of the interim agreement has been
sent to chief government peace negotiator Edgardo Batenga in
Manila. He said he expects the Cabinet Cluster E, which tackles
national security concerns and political matters, to discuss the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
He noted, however, that there may still be a need to further
refine the draft accord. "It was in principle complying with the
president's conditions. But perhaps some refinement is needed," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre made it clear that the OIC will not interfere in peace
negotiations between the government and the MILF, noting that the
Islamic grouping will not make any move without coordinating with
the Philippine government.

<HEADLINE> The Netherlands to Freeze Development Aid to Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands will freeze all
bilateral development assistance to Kenya by 2002, said a diplomat
at the Royal Netherlands Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Daily Nation newspaper Wednesday quoted Jelte Van Wieren, the
first secretary at the embassy, as saying the move had been
prompted by bad governance, which had made it impossible to
achieve progress in programs funded by his government.
</P>
<P>
"We are only going to continue funding programs and projects in
the field of improving governance in the country, which we also
plan to expand in future", Wieren said.
</P>
<P>
Wieren said Tuesday that his government had communicated its
decision to Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi and Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands started scaling down its development aid to
Kenya in the early 1990s from between 45 to 50 million U.S.
dollars to about 15 million dollars late last year.

further their cooperation and exchanges in economic, technological
and cultural fields and trade.
</P>
<P>
At the December meeting, high-ranking government officials,

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Precipitation for Dry Northwest China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China plans to use artificial
rainfall method to increase precipitation for its vast but dry
northwest China in the heartland of Eurasia, the country's top
meteorological official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wen Kegang, director of the China Meteorological Administration,
said artificial rainfall centers will be set up in the Hetao area
between the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, the Tianshan Mountain area in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, and the Hexi Corridor area in Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
He said in an interview with Xinhua that a national unified
command and coordination system will also be set up for the
operation of the centers.
</P>
<P>
During the past two years, Qinghai increased the rainfall by
five billion cubic meters using artificial method at a total cost
of 1.45 million U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 90 million, the inland northwest China
covers 3.04 million ha, about 30 percent of the total landmass in
China, while its water resources accounts for only 10 percent of
the total figure for China due to limited rainfall.
</P>
<P>
The annual average rainfall for the region is less than 500 mm
while the annual average rainfall for the Loess Plateau ranges
from 300 mm to 500 mm.
</P>
<P>
For the Gansu Corridor, an area of 1,000 km in length and up to
100 km in width and an important agricultural area, the annual
rainfall is less 100 mm, and the rainfall for Turpan, an oasis in
north Xinjiang, is less than 20 mm.
</P>
<P>
Despite the region's abundance in land, sunlight and heat
resources, a lack of water has been the major obstacle to the
economic and social development in the region.
</P>
<P>
To tap the rich land resources in northwest China, priority
must be given to the issue of water shortage, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Wen said a lack of proper rainfall conditions is blamed for
the long-standing drought in the region while most of the drifting
vapor over the region is swept out of the region without
generating rain.
</P>
<P>
He said potentially lots of rainfall could be yielded using
artificial rainfall methods.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- If Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak goes to a summit with U.
S. President Bill Clinton and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser
Arafat, Interior Minister Natan Sharansky will quit and remove
Yisrael Ba'aliya from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Sharansky issued the ultimatum Tuesday night after coalition
leaders were briefed on the negotiations with the Palestinians at a
meeting with Barak and members of the U.S. peace team.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in
Jerusalem Tuesday in order to assess the talks between Israel and
the Palestinians in order to make a recommendation to President
Bill Clinton on whether to convene a Camp David-style summit
meeting in which the leaders of the two sides will reach a
framework agreement for a permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
Barak has asked Clinton to convene the summit meeting next week,
on July 5, telling the president that the talks in the existing
channels have played themselves out.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has ordered a meeting in
his office to discuss security arrangements on the Temple Mount in
the wake of protests against construction work being carried out
there by the Muslim Wadf (religious trust).
</P>
<P>
The meeting will address recommendations made by the General
Security Service (Shin Bet) and by Attorney-General Elyakim
Rubinstein to close the Temple Mount Gates to any further
construction materials and heavy equipment such as tractors and
trucks.
</P>
<P>
The Shin Bet also warned the prime minister of dangerous right-
wing activity in light of the work on the mount.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli Knesset (parliament) Tuesday annulled by a large
majority the bill calling for the dissolution of the Knesset and
holding early elections which was passed on preliminary reading on
June 7.
</P>
<P>
All cabinet ministers and Knesset Members of the ultra-Orthodox
Shas party, who supported the bill on June 7, Tuesday reversed
their vote.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Court Starts Open Trial of Suspended Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday started the first
open trial of the papers and journals suspended in recent months
for disparaging Islam and religious elements of the Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
The first trial started at Branch 1410 of Tehran's Public Court,
scheduled to hear the case against Mostafa Izadi, managing director
of the suspended weekly "Ava" (Voice), the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Izadi's plaintiffs include the Intelligence Ministry,
Prosecutor-General Ayatollah Morteza Moghtadai and other officials
affiliated to the Basij (volunteer forces).
</P>
<P>
"Ava" is among the 19 papers and periodicals, most of them pro-
reform, that were shut down in the past few months by the
conservative judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The measure was considered as part of the efforts by the
conservative establishment to crack down on the growing reformist
campaign fostered by President Mohammad Khatami since he took
office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's allies won an overwhelming victory in February's
parliamentary election, ending the long-time conservative-dominance
in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives, still controlling most of the powerful
state organs including the military, have stepped up their efforts
to strengthen their rule and weaken the reformist movement.

Ophthalmology (NIO) of the Ministry of Health Wednesday launched a
Trachoma Control Program with the support of International

</P>
<P>
The ITI-supported program is launched in the following Vietnam'
s eight provinces where the blinding disease, trachoma, is still
endemic: Hai Duong, Thai Binh, Yen Bai, Vinh Phuc, Ha Nam, Thanh
Hoa, Ninh Thuan, and Binh Phuoc.
</P>
<P>
About 3.5 million Vietnamese live in the eight provinces will
benefit from more than one million doses of a Pfizer Inc-donated,
sight-saving antibiotic (Zithromax) and the major public health
program.
</P>
<P>
The donation of up to 1.2 million doses of the oral antibiotic
Zithromax is valued at 16.8 million U.S. dollars and will be

<HEADLINE> Singapore Seeking New Solutions to Meet Water Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 28 (Xinhua)-- Water-related government bodies
in Singapore are teaming up with research institutions from both
locally and abroad in an effort to seek new solutions to meet
water needs of the city state.
</P>
<P>
A forum, jointly organized by the Public Utilities Board (PUB),
the Ministry of the Environment (ENV), Nanyang Technological
University of Singapore, and the Stanford University of the United
States, is going on to provide a platform for discussions on
Singapore's water issues.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at its opening, Singapore Minister of State for Trade
and Industry Lim Swee Say said his government has to ensure that
there sill be enough clean water to meet growing water demands for
many years to come and therefore to continue to manage the supply,
use and pricing of water well.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the needs to adopt an innovation-driven mindset in
quest for creative solutions to meet his country's water needs and
attached great importance on the approach to leverage on advanced
technologies to expand the country's options in water sourcing and
water purification.
</P>
<P>
By teaming up with research institutions from both locally and
abroad, PUB and ENV will be in a much better position to stay
abreast of cutting-edge water technology and this will help ensure
that Singapore continues to have a safe and reliable water supply,
he said.

Citing the total consumption of 400 million cubic meters of
clean water a year in Singapore and the expected rising water
demand in tandem with population growth and economic development,
Lim warned that Singaporeans should never take the supply of clean
water for granted.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister of state refrained from drawing attention
to the fact that Singapore currently depends on Malaysia for fresh
water supply and Malaysia has not given green light for renewing
the two water supply contracts with Singapore which expire at
2010 and 2060 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Lim also warned that the world will be faced with increasing
shortage of fresh water in a new age marked by rapid technological
advances, saying "it is indeed ironical that four billion people
will be living in high water stress areas in an era where we talk
about completing the sequencing of the human genome."
</P>
<P>
He said that the human being is left with access to only 0.08
percent of the total water resources in the world and this
precious amount of 0.08 percent of water resources is unevenly
distributed across populated areas.
</P>
<P>
According to his citation, two thirds of the world's surface is
covered by water but only 2.5 percent of all water is not salty.
Of these 2.5 percent water which is not salty, two thirds is
locked in icecaps and glaciers. Of the remaining one thirds, 20
percent is found in areas too remote for human access and another
60 percent come at the wrong place and at the wrong time, in
monsoons and floods. After factoring in other hydrological
considerations, there is only 0.08 percent of the world's total
water resources is accessible for the mankind.

<HEADLINE> Former Rwandan PM Says Forced to Plead Guilty to Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Rwandan Prime
Minister Jean Kambanda has told the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) that he felt forced to sign his plea
of guilty agreement with the prosecution, Tanzanian local
newspapers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying on Tuesday in the tribunal based in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha that he did not reject the
statements he had made, but denied that his plea of guilty about
two years ago before the trial chamber was voluntary.
</P>
<P>
In early statements he made to the investigators and
prosecution soon after his arrest in July 1997, the former premier
stated that during the period genocide took place in Rwanda
between April and July 1994, he, as the then Prime Minister, had
the responsibility to stop it.
</P>
<P>
"I found out that I have no alternative of leaving the place
other than agreeing to a statement prepared by the prosecutor,"
Kambanda said, in response to cross-questioning by the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"I felt that I was all alone, with no recourse," he said. "I
was forced to sign."
</P>
<P>
Kambanda repeated his earlier complaints that he had been
denied the lawyer of his choice, and that his lawyer was "not a
real lawyer" but a friend of the deputy prosecutor, and that all
his avenues of recourse had been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda pleaded guilty to genocide, conspiracy to commit
genocide, direct and public incitement to genocide, complicity in
genocide and crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR sentenced him to life imprisonment on September 4,
1998. He is now asking the Appeals Court to revoke his guilty plea
and order a full trial.

<HEADLINE> Ailing Slovak President to Undergo Treatment in Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Ailing Slovak President Rudolf
Schuster will be transferred Wednesday to Austria, where he will
receive an emergency treatment, the Czech News Agency quoted a
Slovak presidential spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to latest reports, Schuster's lungs, kidneys and
liver are failing. Chief anesthetist Milan Majek said that brain
damage cannot be ruled out either.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told reporters that the president's family
accepted an offer from Austrian President Thomas Klestil to treat
Schuster at a highly specialized intensive care clinic in
Innsbruck, Austria.
</P>
<P>
Walter Hasibeder, an Austrian doctor who took part in the
salvage of Czech President Vaclav Havel two years ago, arrived in
Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, early this morning at the request
of Schuster's family. After examination, he confirmed that the
president's condition was critical.
</P>
<P>
Schuster was hospitalized on June 14 with a high fever. Doctors
found a puncture in his colon. Then Schuster underwent two "life-
saving" emergency operations, one for his gut and another for a
massive abdominal infection.
</P>
<P>
Schuster's condition temporarily improved on Sunday but then
deteriorated again. He has developed pneumonia. Doctors therefore
performed tracheotomy on him to relieve the difficulty in
breathing. Since then, Schuster has been in a serious state and
has been put on a respirator.
</P>
<P>
Schuster, 66, was elected president last year.

<HEADLINE> China made Regulations for JV Hospitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out provisional
regulations for the launch, operation and administration of Sino-
overseas joint-venture (JV) or cooperative hospitals, which will
become effective on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation have jointly issued a circular on the
implementation of the regulations, today's "Health News" said.
</P>
<P>
All JV hospitals and clinics which have been established
without permission from the two ministries should undergo a re-
examination of their qualification. Those that fail to meet the
standards set by the regulations would be closed down, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulations, overseas hospitals and firms can
launch joint ventures in China after they get permission from the
two ministries.
</P>
<P>
Solely overseas-funded hospitals are still not allowed in China.
</P>
<P>
A JV hospital should be internationally advanced in equipment,
technology and management, and should be able to provide service
that local hospitals can not give.
</P>
<P>
Investment in a JV hospital should not be less than 20 million
yuan (about 2.4 million U.S. dollars) with shares of the Chinese
side no less than 30 percent, and the term of JV hospitals should
not exceed 20 years.
</P>
<P>
However, exceptions may be made for hospitals opening in China'
s central and western regions, as well as remote and poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan will have to obey
this rule when launching JV hospitals on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that there are about 200 JV hospitals and
clinics in 19 Chinese provinces. But only 18 hospitals and some 60
clinics have official permits.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus' Troops to be Equipped with Milan Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' National Guard will be
equipped with the new Milan 3 anti-tank missile system reportedly
in response to the increase in the number of armoured vehicles
deployed by the Turkish army in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the purchase of the system was signed between
Cypru's government and the manufacturer Euromissile, a Franco-
German consortium earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the expenditure was only approved last Thursday after
Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos returned from a meeting in Paris
with his French counterpart Alain Richard, local media unveiled
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The purchase of the system will be the biggest defense deal that
Cyprus' government has struck since it failed to deploy a Russian-
made S-300 anti-aircraft missile system on the island in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Milan system, which is the world's leading anti-tank missile
and has been used by the British army since the mid-1970s, will be
supplied to Cyprus by France later this year.
</P>
<P>
France has supplied Cyprus with other weapons in the past,
including the earlier Milan 1 missile system, and has signed an
agreement to train Cyprus' National Guard to use the defense
system.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Not to Adopt Currency Board System: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Coordinating Minister
for Economy, Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie said here
Wednesday that Indonesia will not adopt a currency board system
despite the continuing fall of the country's currency of rupiah.
</P>
<P>
"Technically, the currency board system is impossible to be
imposed (in Indonesia)," Kwik told reporters before attending a
cabinet meeting at the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
But economists here strongly urged the government to take
immediate measures to arrest the further falling of rupiah.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, rupiah traded at 8,575 (buying) and 8,725
(selling for one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government set the exchange rate of rupiah within the
current fiscal year at the level of 7,000 per U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo reiterated that
the continuing fall of rupiah is largely caused by non economic
factors instead of the country's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
Managing Director Horst Koehler said that the fund and the
Indonesian government have agreed not to impose a capital control
system to arrest the falling of rupiah, saying that the
introduction of capital control would hinder a sustain and a broad
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"What is needed to strengthen confidence in the rupiah, that is
quiet clear, is a steady and feasible implementation of the
economic program," Koehler added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's military said on Wednesday
it would now run the country for the next two years as a deadline

The spokesman said the military is prepared to include ethnic
Indians in the interim administration.
</P>
<P>
The fijilive.com website quoted the spokesman as saying while
the door is still open for negotiation, the rebels must understand
that the situation is not the same as it was before.
</P>
<P>
The military was now "sparing no effort in selecting the best
line-up" for the interim civilian government without the input of
the coup group, he said.
</P>
<P>
The military's ultimatum was issued Tuesday in an effort to get
supporters of coup leader George Speight to sign an accord on the
make-up of an interim civilian government and the release of

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls On Zimbabweans to Respect Poll Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Anna has called on Zimbabweans to respect
the result of the parliamentary elections last weekend, The Herald
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I think the election in Zimbabwe was very closely fought.
Both parties did their best and I noticed that the opposition is
happy with the result," Annan told a news conference Tuesday in
Warsaw, Poland, where he was attending an international conference
on democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The people have spoken. We must accept their will and I
rejoice with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the fifth Parliamentary election on June 24 and 25,
President Robert Mugabe's ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) won 62 of the 120 seats contested
against 57 for the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change
(MDC).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Head of the South African observer team Tony Yengeni
on Tuesday scoffed at reports saying that the weekend elections
were not free and fair.
</P>
<P>
"We thought the EU was supposed to be humble and allow Africans
to express themselves...They jumped the gun," Yengeni told
reporters after meeting Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in
Harare.
</P>
<P>
EU observer team leader Pierre Schori at the weekend refused to
declare the election free and fair because of pre-election
violence.
</P>
<P>
Yengeni said his team was confident that the will of
Zimbabweans had been strongly expressed. He declared the polls
free and fair.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook reacted to the poll,
saying Zanu-pf and MDC should work together for the people of this
country.
</P>
<P>
"I admire the dignity and courage of the people of Zimbabwe for
turning out to exercise their democratic rights in the face of
intimidation. The strong vote for the opposition shows a very
real wish on the part of the people for change, despite the
violence and gerrymandering," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Urges People to Accept Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has urged both winners and losers to respect the outcome of the
parliamentary elections last weekend, saying that democracy
dictates that those who seek to rule do so by the consent of the
majority.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast address to the nation Tuesday night, Mugabe said
the election results should "bind us all, loser and winner alike".
</P>
<P>
The elections gave people the right to participate in the
governance of their country. That democratic right, he said, was
a result of long and arduous years of liberation struggle.
</P>
<P>
"That right gave and still gives you a sense of involvement in
governance, indeed a sense of power over your governors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said that like most Zimbabweans, he had also
stayed awake to hear the results.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after his ruling Zimbabwe African National
Union- Patriotic Front (Zanu-pf) won 62 of the 120 seats contested
against 57 for the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe will personally nominates another 30 members of the
150-seat parliament under the current constitution, enabling
Zanu-pf to remain control over the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe commended the electorate for voting peacefully during
the two days of polling, saying that was lesson to the world that
should be upheld.
</P>
<P>
"The peace that prevailed on the two voting days is the peace
you made and cherished," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the new parliament must tackle challenges such as the
land issue,
</P>
<P>
economic problems and other localized problems affecting people
in various constituencies.

<HEADLINE> 50 Thai Opposition Party Lawmakers Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Fifty lawmakers of the opposition
New Aspiration Party (NAP) resigned en masse from the House of the
Representatives, the low house of the Thai parliament here,
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Wan Muhammad Nor Matha, former parliament speaker and current
NAP secretary-general, presented a letter of the massive
resignation to Sophon Phetsawang, first deputy speaker of the
House.
</P>
<P>
"This move is aimed to urge the nation to reform according to
the new constitution, and help to form a new parliament and a new
government," Wan told reporters after he handed the resignation
letter.
</P>
<P>
"The current government is not capable in handling national
affairs, " he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "the effect of this resignation is judged by
the people."
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that 41 members of the Wang Nam Yen faction,
a group of defected NAP lawmakers, will also announce resignation
from the House in the afternoon when the House resumes its session.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the NAP resignation has already been announced
in a communique released by the NAP executive committee on June 24.
</P>
<P>
Describing the government's administration as "inefficient and
maladroit," the communique criticized the government "for pushing
the nation plunging into serious crisis."
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, "The New Aspiration Party has concluded
that its members in the House can not perform the duties to the
general public, so we decided to resign en masse," it said.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that NAP, which originally holds 116 posts
in the 385-member House, intends to use a massive resignation
strategy to force a dissolution of the parliament and thus call
for an earlier general election.
</P>
<P>
Yet Some of the NAP lawmakers decided to stay in the House, and
the Social Action Party, the second opposition party in the House,
said it will not follow NAP's resignation.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey in Bangkok residents, most
responders said they do not support the resignation, calling the
move as "irresponsible."

</P>
<P>
Samuels vigorously denied he broke the law, but admitted having
a sexual relationship with the teenager, who later had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
Clark's announcement came hard on the heels of a marathon
series of meetings in the Beehive (the building where the
government is located) late Tuesday night, where it is understood
Clark unsuccessfully asked Samuels to tender his resignation.
</P>
<P>
"The minister cannot be effective in his job in a flagship
government program while allegations, controversy, and public
debate swirl around him," Clark said in her statement.
</P>
<P>
"Samuels has had every opportunity to assess the situation for
himself and offer his resignation. He has not done that. I
understand why he has not, but in my view that is not an
acceptable position,"she added.

<HEADLINE> Newly-Discovered New Zealand Gas Deliveries to Begin by 2004 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's Fletcher
Challenge Energy has said the development of its large Pohokura
gas field should begin within two years and gas deliveries are
likely by 2004, the New Zealand Press Association reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Recently impressive gas and oil blows were recorded during
testing at the Pohokura-2 exploration well, off the Taranaki coast
of New Zealand's North Island.
</P>
<P>
While confirming the size, the petroleum producer and explorer
said mean recoverable gas reserves are estimated at 750 billion
cubic feet, plus 40 million barrels of condensate, which would
cost 350 million NZ dollars (164.5 million U.S. dollars) to
extract. That translates into 165 million barrels of oil
equivalent.
</P>
<P>
"Those numbers are double what was anticipated before drilling
the Pohokura-2 appraisal well," the company's Chief Executive Greg
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
Chief Operating Officer Lloyd Taylor said Pohokura has all the
elements of a major petroleum development.
</P>
<P>
"It will extend gas supply beyond Maui field life and generate
significant foreign earnings from condesate export," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Maui offshore field, which dominates the country's
estimated remaining crude oil and condensate reserves, accounts
for about two-thirds of the company's worldwide oil and gas
production. It is expected to be depleted within 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure, Tech Dearth Hinders Export Growth in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Lack of adequate infrastructure
facilities, absence of technology infusion and management
weaknesses have severely constrained the performance of Bangladesh
's export sector and its move toward diversification, according to
a study paper quoted by the Daily Star newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country needs new measures to develop infrastructure and
stimulate investment although there are attempts in the budget to
address some of these weaknesses, Mustafizur Rahman, research
director of the Center for Policy Dialogue (CPD) said in a study
paper titled "Performance of The External Sector in FY 2000:
Growth Dynamics and Emergent Concerns."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's external sector is reeling under considerable
strain due to a decelerated export growth in the 1998-1999 fiscal
year and the country needs a dynamic export strategy since foreign
aid disbursement has been sliding, Rahman said.
</P>
<P>
The graduation from an essentially aid-receiving nation to a
trading one has led to a more pronounced emphasis on external
trade-related issues in Bangladesh's policies.
</P>
<P>
Foreign aid commitment for the first eight months of the fiscal
1999-2000 was equivalent to 954.2 million U.S. dollars, which is
significantly lower than the corresponding pledges for the same
period of the fiscal 1998-1999 with a 43.6 percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
Thus competitiveness of the export sector, market access and
global trade regime-related issues are increasingly becoming more
important factors in terms of Bangladesh's future development, the
research director stated.

<HEADLINE> OIC's Committee Agrees on Int'l Financial Architecture Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Economic and Social
Affairs Committee of the Islamic Conference of Foreign Ministers
ICFM) Wednesday agreed to a resolution on the international
financial architecture reforms.
</P>
<P>
The committee at a meeting here Wednesday adopted Malaysia's
draft proposals to push for a revamp of the international
financial architecture, Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid
Albar told a press conference during a break on the second day of
the four-day ICFM meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's recommendations for strengthening of the
multilateral trading system were also adopted, Syed Hamid,
chairman of the 27th session of the ICFM meeting, said.
</P>
<P>
The committee also approved a proposal by Bahrain for the
enhancement of economic ties among OIC-member states based on
Mahathir's keynote address when opening the ICFM meeting Tuesday,
Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed that Islamic countries need to acquire
knowledge to be able to advance in science and technology and to
enhance trade linkages in order to uplift the socio-economic
conditions of the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
The committee also agreed to the need to resolve economic
problems of Islamic countries, poverty eradication in least
developed OIC member states.
</P>
<P>
On plans to set up the Islamic Common Market (ICM), Syed Hamid
said although the proposal was made sometime back, it was during
the current ICFM meeting that a statement of intention for its
formation was made.
</P>
<P>
On when the ICM would be set up, he said " we must first
develop it as a concept."
</P>
<P>
Under the ICM which would not exclude other markets, OIC
countries would carry out activities that would enhance trade and
economic activities among member states, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said the establishment of such a market
would take a long time when involving multilateral organizations
like the 56-member OIC,
</P>
<P>
He said the first step towards realizing the objective is to
strengthen bilateral ties among OIC members.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid said the committee's resolutions would be forwarded
to the foreign ministers at a plenary session for adoption,
believing the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) is set to
formally agree to reforms in the international financial
architecture and the creation of an Islamic common market.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Ground Water at Risk of Contamination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Dhaka city runs the risk of having
highly contaminated ground water due to massive industrial
pollution on the surface, The Daily Star Wednesday quoted experts
as saying.
</P>
<P>
An expert at Institute of Flood Control and Drainage Research (
IFCDR) warned that contamination of ground water due to tannery
waste and other industrial pollutants would be one of the biggest
problems the city would face in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"As the lower areas and rivers around the city are being
polluted, ground water could become toxic and unsuitable for human
consumption," said Professor Mozammel Hoque of the IFCDR.
</P>
<P>
Hoque said their research showed that the level of ground water
in some areas of the city was falling at a rate of up to 1.5
meters a year. In central Dhaka, even during the 1998 floods, the
ground water did not get recharged at all.
</P>
<P>
The rapid fall of ground water level due to over-extraction can
cause land subsidence, but the risk of contamination of ground
water is much higher because of the soil condition, said the
research report.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate conducted by the Department of
Environment, more than 16,000 cubic meters of highly toxic waste
from tanneries first flow to lower areas then to rivers every day,
and another 3,500 cubic meters of toxic waste from industrial area
pollute the land before falling in the rivers.
</P>
<P>
Another expert of the city's water supply sector said that it
might be possible that within the next five years, most of the
city's 300 water pumps would have to be sealed off due to
contamination.
</P>
<P>
Since it is not easy to find an alternative to ground water in
the city, better management of ground water is urgently needed,
the expert said.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the ground water at a healthy level, artificial
recharge of ground water may be emphasized as an option, Professor
Hoque suggested.

<HEADLINE> Three More Deaths Under E. Coli Investigation in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The E. coli toll in Canada may have
reached 21, with another three deaths reported Tuesday under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
Health officials in the country's southern province of Ontario
are investigating the deaths of three women, all in their 80s, to
decide if they died of the killer E. coli disease.
</P>
<P>
Authorities have confirmed at least seven E. coli-linked deaths
since the disease hit Walkerton in Ontario last month.
</P>
<P>
Although local chief coroner Dr. James Young has said not all
the deaths are necessarily related to the E. coli outbreak,
continued reports of E. coli cases arouses fear that the rest of
the toll could also result from the disease.
</P>
<P>
In another development Tuesday, doctors at the George Dumont
Hospital in New Brunswick confirmed four cases of E. coli
contamination.
</P>
<P>
None of the victims, including a 12-year-old boy, died from the
infection. Local health officials have identified the bacteria
found in the contamination as the same E. coli O-157 that has
sickened up to 2,000 citizens in Walkerton, a small farm town of 5,
000.
</P>
<P>
New Brunswick is a third Canadian province to report E. coli
cases after more than 30 people were stricken by the disease last
week in Montreal, Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Canada has launched a nation-wide recall of the ground beef
from a Alberta-based meat packer after the same strain of bacteria
was discovered a few days ago in beef samples.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Experts Call for Laws Against Suicide Perpetrators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Nepali social scientists and
lawyers called for strict laws to punish inflictors of mental
torture and domestic violence that lead to suicides, the Kathmandu
Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held Tuesday in Nepalgunj, about 600 km South of
here, social experts argued that due to lack of specific clauses
in laws to punish inflictors of mental torture and domestic
violence, more and more people are falling prey to their "subtle
psychological design of murder," the English daily said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people in Nepal, mostly women, commit suicide
every year due to physical and mental torture inflicted upon them,
usually by their family members.
</P>
<P>
However, no perpetrators of this subtle but pervasive kind of
violence in Nepal have been tried and punished because of lax laws.
</P>
<P>
"There is no law to try the culprits who force their victims to
commit suicide," said Karna Thapa, a law lecturer, at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
According to the records of the Department of Crime
Investigation, Police Headquarters of Nepal, 2,141 people
committed suicide in 1999, while the figure stands at almost 2,000
till date this year.
</P>
<P>
About 30 participants of the seminar agreed that it is
imperative to include provisions in laws to punish people found
guilty in pushing their victims to commit suicide.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Meeting with South African and Russian Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao,
head of the Chinese delegation attending the Special Session of
the U.N. General Assembly, met with South African Deputy President
Jacob Zuma and Russian Deputy Premier Valentina Matvienko here
Tuesday on bilateral ties and issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the role the new government of South Africa is
playing in maintaining regional peace and stability and promoting
local economic growth," Wen told Deputy Presidnt Zuma.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Pretoria Declaration on the Partnership between
the two countries signed during Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
April visit will play an important role in promoting friendly
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Wen added that both China and South Africa are developing
countries that share similar views on many major international
affairs and have a wide range of mutual interest. "For the time
being, it is more important for our two countries to enhance
coordination and support in the international affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing his two visits to China in 1996 and 1998 in
retrospect, Zuma said the South African government and people have
a deep affection toward China. "We will never forget the firm
support and assistance the Chinese government and the people
offered to South Africa during the days of its fight against
apartheid," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is an influential country in the world," Zuma said. "
South Africa is willing to further develop bilateral relations
between our two countries and intensify the two-way cooperation in
international affairs."
</P>
<P>
When holding a friendly talk with Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Matvienko, Wen said, "Russia is China's largest neighbor and an
important country that has great influences on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
"China pays great attention to developing good and cordial
relations with Russia," Wen said. In recent years, bilateral
relations between the two countries have been developing smoothly.
"As permanent members of the U.N. Security Council," Wen said, "
both China and Russia should take a special responsibility for
maintaining world peace and security."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister Matvienko said, "The strategic partnership
between Russia and China initiated in 1996 is beneficial not only
to the fundamental interests of the peoples of our two countries,
but also to the promotion and development of regional and world
peace."
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Chandra Paudel, vice president of Nepal, and
Noureddine Boukrouh, special envoy of President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika of Algeria, Wen discussed with them separately on

<HEADLINE> China Protects Endangered Reindeers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out an emergency
plan to save the reindeer from extinction.
</P>
<P>
Genhe city in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
bought 30 reindeers from Russia with 600,000 yuan (72,290 U.S.
dollars). The city will invest three million yuan this year to
support the reindeer raising.
</P>
<P>
An investigation by a rare animal survey team shows that wild
reindeers have nearly disappeared in China and the animal will
become extinct if protection efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
There are only about 700 reindeers left in captivity, and their
numbers are dropping, according to the team's survey report.
</P>
<P>
The reindeer is an auspicious animal in Chinese culture. Its
pictures and sculptures can be found in many temples and ancient
sites. Chinese ancient philosopher and educator Confucius referred
to the animal as a "benevolent beast" in his famous history book "
The Spring and Autumn Annals" written in 481 BC.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Laid-offs to Find Jobs in Employment Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
New laid-off workers will not register at re-employment centers
sponsored by the government but directly enter the employment
market, said Kong Changqi, vice director of the Labor and Social
Security Bureau of the Municipality. They will also receive
unemployment benefits before they find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is trying to establish a job market-oriented re-
employment system in three years by encouraging laid-off workers
to find new job opportunities in the labor market by themselves.
</P>
<P>
In fact, more and more laid-off workers have found jobs
themselves without support from the government.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, the largest industrial city in the north, has 300,000
laid-off workers. But they have the confidence that they can be
employed or become self-employed through their own initiative,
Kong said.
</P>
<P>
There are over 200 employment agencies in the city. They have
held more than 100 new job Fairs for job-seekers. Some 20 percent
of the 130,000 job-seekers have signed employment contracts.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin has also set up an on-line job market. More than 150,
000 people visited the website last year.

<HEADLINE> Violence Continues in Indonesia's Maluku Despite Emergency Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Gunfire and explosions continued
to echo through the violence-torn city of Ambon, capital of
Indonesia's Maluku, on Tuesday, hours after an emergency status
was proclaimed aimed at ending the 18-month violence.
</P>
<P>
The military was quoted by national newspapers Wednesday as
saying that at least three persons were killed on Tuesday,
bringing the death toll in a week of violence to 69.
</P>
<P>
The government has imposed a state of civil emergency in Maluku
and North Maluku, taking effect at 00:00 a.m. on Tuesday. The
declaration, which stops short of full martial law, allows the
military to impose curfews, set up blockades and detain suspects
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
The new Pattimura Military Commander overseeing Maluku Col. I
Made Yasa said he called on all military personnel to report to
their respective units.
</P>
<P>
"I order all personnel who have been separated (from their
units) to regroup immediately or at least report to the nearest
security station," he said, adding that he gave troops at large
until June 30 to report their whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
According to military spokesman, around 1,400 of the 10,200
soldiers in the region would be replaced soon.
</P>
<P>
"There are some rogue elements from within the security forces
that are not acting professionally. They are taking sides and we
are going to replace them," the spokesman was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both warring camps in Maluku have accused individuals in the
military and police of taking sides and being involved in the
communal conflict between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that thousands of residents started to leave
Maluku on Tuesday. People in Ambon also seen thronging the markets
and shops to stock up on food supplies, while the town also saw
kerosene and gasoline shortages.
</P>
<P>
Several security posts were abandoned by troops and roadblocks
were set up in almost every corner of the town.
</P>
<P>
The province's new police chief Brigadier General Firman Gani
said that a curfew had been imposed and searches for weapons were
under way.
</P>
<P>
"We have issued a public announcement ordering an end to the
fighting and have imposed a curfew. People are being told to hand
in their firearms," he said, adding that the curfew was effective
from 22:00 p.m. to 06:00 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
Firman, who was former commander of the elite Police Mobile
Brigade, said that security forces would closely monitor the
movements of intruders on the islands.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the massive sweeping operation in
coordination with existing military units," he added.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence in Maluku and North Maluku is the
continuation of a strife that has troubled the two provinces for
one-and-a-half years in which more than 3,000 people have died.

<HEADLINE> Millions of U.S. Dollars Lost Due to Graft in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Millions of U.S. dollars have been
wasted through corruption at major state-owned enterprises and
state institutions in the 1999/2000 fiscal year ending March 31
this year, according to the state audit agency, the Badan
Pemeriksa Keuangan (BPK).
</P>
<P>
In a report to parliament, BPK said 1.05 trillion rupiah (about
120 million U.S. dollars) had been lost through corruption at
state oil company Pertamina over the year, while 631 billion
rupiah (74 million dollars) had gone astray at the ministry of
investment and state enterprises, and 213 billion rupiah (25
million dollars) at the National Logistics Agency (Bulog).
</P>
<P>
The National Family Planning Board lost 70 billion rupiah (8.2
million dollars) through corruption, and the central bank 56
billion rupiah (6.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Among the results of the 1999/2000 audit are findings that

non-departmental bodies," the audit agency was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
BPK said forms of graft and corruption included fictitious

MANILA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen persons, including an Army

<P>
BUCHAREST, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok
paid an official visit to Romania Monday and Tuesday to discuss
with Romanian leaders issues including bilateral political and
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Romanian Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu, the two
sides pledged efforts to build an integrated Europe.
</P>
<P>
Isarescu said that the project to resume navigation on the
Danube River, one among the 56 projects of cooperation between the
two countries, is of particular importance.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the river was paralyzed after NATO bombing destroyed
several bridges during their attack on Yugoslavia, causing heavy
economic losses to countries along the river including Romania and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu told Kok he was grateful
to the Netherlands for supporting Romania's participation in NATO
and the EU.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is Romania's important economic and trade
partner. In 1999, their trade amounted to 560 million U.S. dollars.
The Netherlands opened 1,200 companies in Romania during the 90s,
with investments totaling 600 million dollars.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday met with his Armenian counterpart Robert Kocharian,
discussing peace and economic reform in the Caucasus country.
</P>
<P>
During the 35-minute meeting in the Oval Office in White House,
Clinton pledged support for peace in the Nagorno-Karabakh region,
a disputed enclave which is controlled by Armenia but located
within Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
After five years of cease-fire in the region, Armenia and
Azerbaijan have so far failed to resolve their disputes over
Nagorno-Karabakh which has cost several thousand lives and
paralyzed the economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to President Kocharian was that the United States
will do its part along with the international community to support
and implement a durable settlement,'' White House spokesman P.J.
Crowley told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have an interest in seeing the region develop in terms of
building prosperity but part of that comes with preventing or
ending conflict," Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is one of the three parties of the Minsk
Group along with Russia and France, which was formed by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to urge a
peaceful resolution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier, Norway PM Confident of Good Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Vice Premier Wen
Jiabao and Norway's Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg met here on
Tuesday and both expressed confidence in a promising future of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier is here to attend a week-long special
meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on social
development issues such as poverty, employment and workers' rights.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Wen first congratulated Stoltenberg on
winning the premiership. Stoltenberg, 41, a Labor Party politician,
formed a new government in March as his predecessor lost a
parliament vote.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier said ties between China and Norway
have been greatly developed in recent years and elevated to a new
level since Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Norwegian King
Harald exchanged visits.
</P>
<P>
China attaches importance to and shares confidence in long-term,
stable cooperation and friendship with Norway, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Stoltenberg said that Norway and China do differ
on many issues, but this will not prevent the two nations from
learning from each other.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have expanded cooperation in all fields and
established a multi-tiered and close consultation mechanism on
many issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Norway regards China as an important country with great
influence in the international area, Stoltenberg added.
</P>
<P>
As the role of the United Nations is concerned, the two
premiers agreed that the U.N. should act not only in peace-keeping,
but also in promoting world economy and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier said that nothing could replace the U.
N. in settling global issues and building a new international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
A more democratic system for international relations must be
established if the U.N. is to adapt itself to the requirements of
the time, which means that all nations, big or small, rich or poor,
are members of the international community with equal rights in
world affairs, he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and Vietnamese trade
negotiators are expected to resume talks next week to finalize a
market-opening pact, U.S. officials disclosed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Talks at the expert level are likely to begin in Washington on
July 3. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and her
assistant Richard Fisher would join the negotiations later in the
week with Vietnamese Trade Minister Vu Khoan, probably on July 6

</P>
<P>
Barshefsky invited Khoan in May to visit Washington for
resuming talks on the long-stalled pact. Khoan accepted the
invitation last week, raising investor hopes that an agreement was
finally within reach.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed trade pact, Vietnam would lower its tariffs
and undertake a broad range of measures to open its markets to U.S.
goods, services and investment.
</P>
<P>
In return, Hanoi would get access to the U.S. market under the
same system of low tariffs given to most nations.

SHANGHAI, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Sinopec has announced that it
will invest 24 billion (about 2.9 billion US dollars) in the
coming decade to speed up the exploitation and utilization of oil
and gas resources in East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Sinopec, or China Petroleum Chemical Industry Group, will drill
five wells in the East China Sea this year, and 18 to 20 before
2002, said officials at the Shanghai Offshore Oil Administration
affiliated with Sinopec.
</P>
<P>
By 2003, Sinopec will try to explore another 150 billion to 200
billion cubic meters of natural gas in proven reserves.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project will focus on "Chunxiao"
structure which is expected to drill three billion cubic meters of
oil and 200,000 tons of condensate oil annually.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, Sinopec plans to drill more than 90 wells in Xihu oil
and gas pool in East China Sea by 2010 so as to discover 400
billion to 420 billion cubic meters of natural gas with a
production capacity of eight billion to 10 billion cubic meters
annually.
</P>
<P>
The project will meet the increasing demands on energy and
economic development in Shanghai, Zhejiang and other coastal areas
in east China.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Offshore Oil Administration began to survey the
geological situation of the East China Sea in 1974. Geologists
have located the geological structure of basins in the continental
shelf of the East China Sea and ascertained that the basins are
rich in oil and natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
Geologists have done effective jobs in the Pinghu, Chunxiao and
Xiling blocks.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nationational Basketball
Association will make its 2000 draft on Wednesday with many early
entrants, yet future stardom is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
A total of 37 players have made themselves eligible with 29
undergraduates and eight international players this year. The
2000 draft lacks big names but not talents.
</P>
<P>
Those born outside the United States include Iakovos Tsakalidis
of Georgia, Jerome Moiso of France, Olumide Oyedeji of Nigeria,
Hidayet Turkoglu of Turkey, Primoz Brezec of Slovenia, and Mamadou
N'diaye of Senegal.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until 1994 that the list reached 20 for the first
time and the number peaked at 40 in 1997, the year after the
phenomenal class that included Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Ray Allen,
Kobe Bryant, Marcus Camby, Allen Iverson, Stephon Marbury and
Antonio Walker.
</P>
<P>
Either Kenyon Martin or Stromile Swift, both powerful forwards,
is likely to be the Number 1 pick in Wednesday's draft in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
Of last season's 13 lottery picks, only four appeared in the
playoffs, seven of them ended the season as starters. And Elton
Brand of Duke, top pick of last season by Chicago Bulls, and Wally
Szczerbiak of Minnesota became the lone players who ended the
season ranked in the top 10 in any of the major statistical
categories.

<HEADLINE> China's Sugar Production Down, Price UP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 28 (Xinhua) -- China's over surplus sugar
industry began to walk out of the red this season with 280 million
yuan (33.7 million US dollars) worth of net profits.
</P>
<P>
The industry had made losses for four years in a row. In
southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the sugar
production amounted to 3 million tons, or 40 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
Severe frosts that hit some sugar growing area in south China
last winter caused a loss of 2 million tons of sugar output.
</P>
<P>
However, production loss has helped boost sugar prices in major
sugar trading markets around the country, which soared from 2,000
yuan (240 US dollars) per ton last year to over 3,000 yuan (361 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Feng Zuhua, director of the Guangxi Economic and Trade
Commission, said that losses caused by frosts has had a positive
influence on the industry. Profits were gained from the
restructure of inefficient sugar plants with measures taken to
reduce production cost. The production cost was 100 yuan per ton
more than usual.
</P>
<P>
China will start to drastically reduce sugar production this
year. Most reductions will be done by eliminating outdated
production facilities.
</P>
<P>
Analysts from the China Sugar Association suggested that some
areas that are unsuitable for sugar production should be forced to
leave the market, while the remaining ones ought to speed up
technical upgrading and improve efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Albright End First Meeting on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ended their first
meeting here in the small hours of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting lasted about three hours, but no official words came
about the content of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the meeting said that Barak and Albright
focused their attention on the Middle East peace process,
particularly issues concerning the Israeli-Palestinian final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
The two also discussed the possibility of convening a three-way
summit in Washington in the near future between Barak, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
As the two began their talks inside Barak's office late Tuesday
night, thousands of Jewish settlers gathered outside the hotel
where Albright is staying to protest against U.S. interference in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators from various settlements of the West Bank
shouted anti-U.S. slogans and asked Albright to "go home."
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators held up signs warning, "Clinton, God will
punish you."
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Albright's current visit to the region is to
arrange a U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking summit in Washington
which is opposed by Arafat, who fears the U.S. would side with
Israel on many issues and he would be pressured into concessions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side also said the time is not ripe for a summit
because gaps still remain between the two sides in the final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
But Barak wants this top-level gathering, saying the
negotiations with the Palestinians have reached a stage in which
the leaders have to make decisions on all key issues of the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak also brought U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis
Ross to meet his coalition partners on Tuesday to persuade them to
back him to strike a peace deal with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to hold talks Wednesday with Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and Arafat before holding another
meeting with Barak later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in the region Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Inclines to Sign Bill to Ease Cuba Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday he would be inclined to sign a bill to end food and
medicine embargoes on Cuba if he can be convinced it would work.
</P>
<P>
"If I believe that the legislation essentially allows for the
sales of American food and medicine to Cuba, or to other countries,
but has some protection for us for extraordinary circumstances
that foreign policy might require, ......then I would be inclined
to sign the bill, to support it," Clinton said at a White House
news conference.
</P>
<P>
"I've always wanted to sell more food and medicine not only to
Cuba, but to other countries as well," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed some reservations over the proposed bill,
which includes new restrictions on travel by American citizens to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
He said the restrictions "might undermine our people-to-people
contacts, which have been more and more extensive over the last
several months, and which I believe to be very important."
</P>
<P>
When asked if it was time for normalization of relations
between the United States and Cuba, Clinton said: "I don't believe
that we can change the law until there is a bipartisan majority
which believes there has been some effort by the Cuban government
to reach out to us as well."
</P>
<P>
The Republican leaders of the U.S. House of Representatives
brokered a compromised deal on Tuesday to allow direct sales of U.
S. food and medicine to Cuba for the first time in nearly four
decades.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuban boy Elian Gonzalez and
his family left here for Cuba Wednesday afternoon after the
injunction to keep the Cuban boy in the United States expired.
</P>
<P>
The chartered plane carrying Elian and his family left the
Dulles International Airport near Washington at 04:40 p.m. local
time (2040 GMT).
</P>
<P>
"I would like to thank North American people for their support.
I'm grateful for the support I've received," said Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, Elian's father, before the departure.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely happy to be going back to my homeland and I don'
t have words to express how happy I feel," he said in Spanish at
the Dulles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court Wednesday rejected a last-ditch appeal
by the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez and allowed the six-year-
old Cuban boy to return home, ending a seven-month custody battle
between Elian's father and his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court rejected an emergency request by Elian's
relatives to postpone Elian's departure for Cuba and also turned
down their appeal seeking a political asylum hearing for him.
</P>
<P>
"The legal battle is over," said Gregory Craig, attorney for
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. "The family will now make
immediate arrangements to return to their home."
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by Craig, Gonzalez said his family was
gratified by the Supreme Court's announcement that the family was
free to go home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who was accompanied by his family and his schoolmates,
are expected to fly to Havana on a chartered plane from Washington
Dulles International Airport later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno said she was pleased the Supreme
Court had declined to review the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
"This little boy now knows that he can remain with his father,
" Reno said in a statement. "I hope that everyone will accept the
Supreme Court's decision and join me in wishing this family, and
this special little boy, well."
</P>
<P>
Elian, who survived a migrant boat disaster last November in
which his mother and 10 others died, has been in the United States
after he was picked up by a fisherman off the coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Elian's Miami relatives had cared for him until he was seized
from his relatives' home on April 22 in a government raid and
reunited in Washington with his father.
</P>
<P>
Elian's father arrived in the U.S. in April to take his son
back to Cuba, but his relatives have been trying to prevent him
from being sent back to Cuba with the help of many anti-Cuba
people in Miami, Florida.

"The truly accurate thing is that I have not yet formulated a
position which I am prepared to go to the American people with,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"But I will do so, you know, sometime over the next several
weeks..." he added. "I'm working hard on it now."
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed again that his decision would be based on
four key factors: the threat of future limited missile attack, U.S.
technology, cost and the impact on national security including
relations with European allies Russia, and China.
</P>
<P>
The international community has opposed the NMD, which would
either breach or require major changes to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty between the United States and the then Soviet Union,
a cornerstone of arms control.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. plan to set up the NMD
system runs against the trend of the times and will have a major
adverse impact on global and regional strategic balances and
stability.

<HEADLINE> Russian Cabinet Passes Socioeconomic Program for Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government Wednesday
approved the key lines of a long-expected program on the country's
socioeconomic development in the coming ten years, including
priority tasks for 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
The program has been approved for the most part and all that
remains "is discussion with scientific circles." "In the fall, the
document may be corrected to take comments and notes into
consideration," Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told
reporters after Today's special cabinet meeting in the White House,
where the program was debated.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) will
grow 150 percent in U.S. dollar terms by 2010.
</P>
<P>
From 2004, the inflation should be kept not more than 10
percent, according to the document's long-term perspective, and
the GDP growth must be maintained at a minimum five-percent level
annually over a decade period to guarantee a 150-percent GDP
increase by 2010 in comparison with current index.
</P>
<P>
If GDP in 2000 rises to 205 billion U.S. dollars, then in 2001
it should amount to 227 billion dollars, in 2004 -- 284 billion
dollars and in 2010 -- 457 billion dollars, predicts the program.
</P>
<P>
It expects Russian exports to reach 84.6 billion dollars this
year and 88.7 billion dollars in 2004, 104.2 billion dollars in
2010. At the same time, imports are forecasted to amount to 45.9
billion dollars in 2000, 70.7 billion dollars in 2004 and 95.3
billion dollars in 2010.
</P>
<P>
The program sets a significant increase for the nation's
currency reserves. The reserves ought to add up to about 19.1
billion dollars at the end of 2000, 24.2 billion in 2001, 39.1
billion in 2004 and 52.4 billion in 2010.
</P>
<P>
It also includes an over-30-percent increase in internal
investment and plans to halve the flow of capital out of Russia by
setting up more liberal economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
The transfer to a system of targeted social aid may iron-out
current discrepancies in this area. If in 1999 about 40 percent of
the poorer layers of society accounted for some 36.2 percent of
benefits and social aid, this share should jump to 85 percent in
2005.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the share of social benefits and aid will
surpass 10 percent of the cash income of the poorest 20 percent of
the population, compared to around seven percent at present.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, the gap between revenues of poor and rich citizens
should be reduced 90 percent. This goal will be realized because
the incomes of the poorer 40 percent of the citizens are to be
doubled by then.
</P>
<P>
Another main task of the government economic policy is to join
the World Trade Organization and to create the best conditions for
Russian goods and services to gain access to the world markets.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov pledged that the Russian government doesn't intend to
revise property ownership after the past privatization in the
state.
</P>
<P>
Privatization in Russia was conducted in compliance with the
laws and legislative acts in force at the time, "even though they
were not absolutely perfect from today's points of view, revision
of the results of privatization is out of the question," he said.
</P>
<P>
The program was originally worked out by the Russia's Center of
Strategic Development headed by German Gref, Minister of Economic
Development and Trade, and was presented to the cabinet also by
him.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech on the long-term program and the economic
plan for 2000-2001 at the session, he stressed that in order to
implement the program, it is necessary to concentrate the efforts
of all power branches, both executive and legislative.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan for the next one and a half years, a component
of the long-term program, the state will witness the first phase
of tax reforms, lower spending and the barriers that hamper the
development of businesses, and begin to provide social assistance
to the poorer population, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian State Duma (lower house of the parliament)
Audit Committee chairman Sergei Stepashin told reporters after the
session that the program has not been okayed by government
resolution, but basically approved by the decision of the premier.
It will be adjusted every year if the situation requires.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Abrogates One Senator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's Senate's Plenary
abrogated Wednesday Senator Luiz Estevao's term of office due to
lack of parliamentary decorum, in a decision without precedent.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in the country's history that a senator
loses his position.
</P>
<P>
The annulment, that already had been approved by Commission of
the Constitution, Justice and Citizenship and by Congress Ethical
Council, was confirmed by 52 votes in favor, 18 against and 10
abstentions of the 81 senators.
</P>
<P>
Estevao was accused, besides deflecting resources during the
building of Sao Paulo Workers Forum, of trying to halt
investigations of Parliamentary Commission of Investigation (CPI)
that was inquiring into the case.
</P>
<P>
Two groups of attorneys from Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro and Sao
Paulo will present to Justice proofs against Estevao in order to
later start against him a judicial process for what he is accused.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise Moderately After Rates Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 28 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street investors showed
cautious optimism Wednesday after the Federal Reserve decided to
leave interest rates unchanged but warned that more hike in rates
was possible in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23.33 at 10,527.79
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 81.38 at 3,
940.34.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 4.27 at 1,454.82.
</P>
<P>
The decision on rates came after the Federal Reserve ended a
two-day meeting on the monetary policy. The Federal Reserve said
in a statement that recent data "suggest that the expansion of
aggregate demand may be moderating toward a pace closer to the
rate of growth of the economy's potential to produce" but
inflation dangers may be lurking.
</P>
<P>
All three major indexes lost some momentum in the final hour of
trading after the announcement because the warning against
inflation dangers indicated that more rates hike is possible. The
Dow index rose as much as 106 points before the rates decision was
announced.
</P>
<P>
Analysts had mostly expected the central bankers to leave rates
steady at the June 27-28 meeting. But a few did not rule out the
possibility of an one more quarter-percentage point increase in
rates possible at the August 22 meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times in the past year
in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and keep inflation under
control. Recent data showed the signs of slowdown in the economy.
</P>
<P>
But the Commerce Department reported today that orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods shot up 6 percent in May, indicating
that the Manufacturing sector has not cooled off enough.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 0.50 at 644.21 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.35 at 937.62. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 12.91 at 520.99.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,803 up, 1,117 down and 476
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 1.05 billion shares from 1.02 billion
in the previous session.
