OTHER GUYS SET THE TABLE FO COWBOYS VICTORY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Sunday's on-going struggle for the Dallas
Cowboys came down to a game of who-do-you-trust?
</P>
<P>
   It was not the offense. Definitely not. Those people were
repeatedly handed choice plots of real estate and couldn't seal the
touchdown deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the defense. Definitely not. Those people only
survived because of a combo of one stupid play call by the New York
Giants and one Darren Woodson savior sack. Otherwise, Gary Brown
ran like Jimmy Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Without a doubt, the Cowboys eventually scurried out of Texas
Stadium with a 16-6 win because the special-team forces provided 60
minutes of outrageous field position. New York's offense seemed to
start every possession from the shoulder of Airport Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday after Sunday in the NFL, the one great scorer does
not care how a team played the game _ he writes down only a W or an
L. In a league full of homely offense, winning ugly has become a
beauty contest.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the only sunshine on a gloomy and cloudy North Texas
day came from the postgame mouth of one Chan Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a good football team, we've got to go out, take over a
tight game, and win it,'' the Cowboys' coach said. ``Today showed
we might be getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Cowboys are going anywhere come January, it will
obviously require much more offensive scoreboard production than
was displayed Sunday. Strangely enough, however, one of the most
positive moments of the season also came in this otherwise
offensive-wasteland of a game.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly unable to profit from prime field position, suddenly
Troy Aikman and Co. had none. They were backed up to the 16-yard
line in the waning seconds of the third quarter. A 9-6 Dallas lead
was as uncertain as Aikman's injured throwing-hand index finger.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman's mere presence had already paid a dividend, although the
passing game was making little contribution. New York backed out of
the eight-man fronts it had used against Jason Garrett the last
time the teams met in September, which turned loose Emmitt Smith
for a very large day.
</P>
<P>
   And although backed up to the 16, what happened next was the
launching of a game-busting touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   In this 84-yard march, Aikman threw to six receivers, none of
them named Michael Irvin or Randy Moss. Think about that _ in one
critical and long drive, two theories died. One, that Aikman has to
have Michael Irvin to make the passing game work. Two, that the
Cowboys should have drafted Moss and his rap sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The two biggest catches, not to mention sensational catches, of
the drive came from Billy Davis and Ernie Mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made the second receiver a nonconversation around
here,'' said Davis, also speaking for Mills. Billy, of course, only
told the truth, because that hot issue of the summer is no longer
even mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Like the special teams' commando he is, Davis ran a post over
the middle, and never flinched as he saw the ball and Giants'
safety Percy Ellsworth about to arrive one second apart. The
body-jarring hit from Ellsworth was heard in Duncanville. Davis,
however, immediately jumped up, ball in hand, and gave the
first-down signal. A sold-out Texas Stadium loved it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew (Ellsworth) was coming, but in a split-second, you make
the decision, do I or don't I?'' Davis said. ``To me, it's all
about thinking I will make that catch and thinking I will hang on
to the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Two plays after Davis' 21-yard gain, Aikman went for it all on
another post route to Mills. A circus broke out with this catch. At
the 5-yard line, Ernie got one outstretched hand on the bullet,
then both hands, then somehow held the thing as he scooted along
the ground, untouched into the end zone. But the refs blew it,
marking him down at the 1. Two plays later, Aikman threw to a
wide-open Eric Bjornson for the game-is-over TD.
</P>
<P>
   As has been proved all season, the Cowboys don't have a second
receiver to offset the double-covered Irvin; they actually have two
in Mills and Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, by the way, had another great, clutch catch in the third
quarter that set up the go-ahead field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy came up to me (after the second one) and said, `Is Ernie
unbelievable or what?' '' Bjornson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have stressed from the start,'' Gailey said, ``is the
offense has to take advantage of what the defense is willing to
give us. If we aren't good enough to go to other spots on the
field, we aren't going to win games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Michael after the game I've never seen one guy given so
much respect (by the defense). They double-covered him the whole
way. Certainly, Troy loves to throw to Michael, but he sees what is
happening and has confidence in the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it came time to win Sunday, it was the ``other guys''
who made a touchdown happen, and also answered that
who-do-you-trust question.

`THE WATERBOY' SCORES RECORD-SETTING RESULT AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Adam Sandler's ``The Waterboy'' scored a
record-setting victory at the nation's multiplexes with an
astounding $39.1 million at 2,664 theaters to dominate the nation's
weekend box office during Friday-Sunday, studio sources said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat the mark for a November weekend opening,
topping the $37.8 million debut of Jim Carrey's hit ``Ace Ventura:
When Nature Calls'' in 1995. Disney's comedy, with Sandler as a
football team's gofer-turned-star, came in far above industry
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured `The Waterboy' would do $17 million to $19 million,
but no one thought Adam Sandler would be the next Jim Carrey,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting
service. ``The studio really pushed hard to draw teens and people
in Middle America.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said the studio took advantage of Sandler's drawing
power from ``The Wedding Singer,'' which grossed $80 million
domestically, and the popularity of comedies such as ``Rush Hour''
and ``There's Something About Mary.'' ``It seems as if everyone is
in the mood for comedies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Disney distribution chief Phil Barlow noted that Saturday's
$16.1 million total was the highest single-day gross ever for a
Disney movie. He also noted that the comedy drew well among women,
who constituted 40 percent of the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public was just salivating for this film, but it still
beat our internal estimates,'' Barlow said. ``Adam Sandler is the
motion picture comedy star of the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' cost a modest $19 million to make and should
top $100 million domestically, making it massively profitable for
Disney. The entertainment giant had seen its last two releases --
``Beloved'' and ``Holy Man'' -- perform poorly, and it recently
placed part of the blame on those projects for its 24 percent
decline in quarterly earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' took in more than double its nearest rival,
``The Siege,'' with $15 million at 2,541 theaters. The performance
was in line with expectations for 20th Century Fox's $70 million
thriller, which depicts the U.S. military taking over New York City
to thwart terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Arab-American and Muslim groups have protested the project,
which stars Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, over concerns about
negative ethnic stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   The top two movies accounted for half of all grosses with
overall box office at $108 million, or 25 percent ahead of the same
weekend last year, as the industry keeps up its impressive 1998
performance. Year-to-date business has topped $5.5 billion for a 10
percent gain over the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The domestic box office continues to astound,'' said analyst
Arthur Rockwell of Drake &AMP; Co., noting the heavier focus on what
had traditionally been slow periods for moviegoing such as the
fall. ``It's as if summer doesn't end anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   New Line's third weekend of ``Pleasantville'' finished a distant
but respectable third with $6 million at 1,761 sites as it dropped
just 13 percent from Halloween weekend. DreamWorks' sixth weekend
of ``Antz'' made an impressive comeback, rising 20 percent to $5.4
million at 2,604 screens and has now grossed nearly $75 million
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. posted moderate results from its opening of its
restored version of the 1939 MGM classic ``The Wizard of Oz'' with
$4.9 million at 1,879 theaters to finish fifth. The studio spent a
reported $2 million on restoration plus $4 million for promotion
for ``Oz,'' which has been shown 38 times on TV since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   New Line's widened release of comedy-drama ``Living Out Loud''
came in sixth with $4.5 million at 1,086 screens, followed by
Warner's fourth weekend of ``Practical Magic'' with $4.1 million at
2,052 sites and Sony's second weekend of ``John Carpenter's
Vampires'' with $4 million at 1,793 screens. ``Vampires'' lost 56
percent of its audience from the Halloween weekend opening, when it
led the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were New Line's eighth weekend of ``Rush
Hour'' with $3.5 million at 2,043 theaters and Artisan's solid
opening of ``Belly,'' an action-drama starring rappers DMX and Nas,
with $3.3 million at 600 sites. ``Rush Hour'' has grossed $127.3
million and is now the 95th highest domestic grosser, behind
``Rocky IV.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramercy's much-praised ``Elizabeth'' performed well in limited
release with $275,000 at nine theaters, but Miramax's glam-rock
drama ``Velvet Goldmine'' was only lukewarm with $315,000 at 85
locations. Sony's rerelease of ``The Big Chill'' failed to
duplicate its 1983 success, with a near-invisible $62,000 at 50
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Sony will mine the popular teen-horror field again when it opens
``I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'' on the coming Friday the
13th. The original topped $72 million last year, and the sequel
should lead next weekend, Bucksbaum predicted, although it will be
a close race with ``The Waterboy'' and Universal's opening of its
much-anticipated ``Meet Joe Black,'' with Brad Pitt. Disney is also
rolling out ``I'll Be Home for Christmas,'' a family comedy
starring Jonathan Taylor Thomas, as studios prepare an onslaught of
high-profile releases for the upcoming holiday season.

GIDDY ERICKSON SHOWS OFF HIS MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a veteran of Winter Olympics coverage, I can say
without fear of contradiction that for a few glorious moments
Sunday in the Kingdome, Dennis Erickson was just a triple toe loop
and a Playboy layout away from becoming the Katarina Witt of the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning, leaping, soaring, even offering a winsome smile, the
Seahawks coach fairly floated along the sideline after linebacker
Darrin Smith returned an interception for a touchdown and a 23-6
Seahawk lead.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson's performance wouldn't rate a gold medal, but since the
guy already had an anvil hanging from his neck, it nevertheless
bordered on the magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   During the run-up to the game, he was a career 0-7 against
Kansas City, as well as a fading 4-4 this disappointing season.
Erickson also was straining like hell to keep his team and his job
from flying apart.
</P>
<P>
   So when it dawned on him that he not only was winning the game,
but actually kicking the back pockets of his haughty rival, the
Chiefs' Marty Schottenheimer, Erickson acted like the kid who had
just vanquished the neighborhood bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it, I love it, I love it,'' said linebacker Chad Brown
of his coach's gyrations. ``I watched the replay. He just let it
go. He was happy and enjoying it, which was good to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In his tenure, Erickson has displayed an awkward edginess to his
demeanor, sometimes seeming indecisive, sometimes too deferential
toward his players. It was as if he were still afflicted by
college-coach syndrome _ never quite sure he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   Schottenheimer, a forceful personality long on the details of
coaching, was exactly the kind of rival to feed that insecurity.
Ever since he reportedly said a few years ago after beating the
Seahawks that they were the most poorly prepared team he'd seen,
Erickson has wanted a piece of the guy, whether or not he admits
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To beat them like we did, having not beaten them since I've
been here . . .,'' Erickson said, smiling, voice trailing. ``It's
our eighth try, and we did it convincingly at home.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-12 win not only brought the Seahawks back from the brink,
it provided the opportunity to kick a guy while he was down. The
Chiefs have lost four in a row, are 4-5 and Sunday outdumbed a unit
never revered for its mental acuity. The Chiefs' 17 penalties for
152 yards might have been the most damning single-game indictment
ever made against a Schottenheimer-coached team.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events presented such a role reversal that it seemed
almost Halloweenish _ the Chiefs showing up in Erickson masks and
Seahawk colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did to them,'' said Brown, ``the things they usually do to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Like scoring on the first possession. Like eating clock with
more runs than passes. Like capitalizing on mistakes. Like duping
the other guy into screwing up.
</P>
<P>
   On one offensive play in the second quarter, the Chiefs were
flagged for three fouls. Since there wasn't enough yardage in the
building to pay all the penalties _ and since the county
prosecutor's office is closed on Sundays _ the Seahawks accepted a
plea bargain of a 15-yarder for a chop block, as well as home
detention.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks were not eligible for sainthood this day either _
they had 13 penalties, not to mention two turnovers and only 89
yards of offense in the second half. As spectator entertainment,
the dreadfulness flirted with the monumental, dragging on so
insufferably that the time-elapsed clock switched from A.D. to B.C.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a win, one so bewilderingly easy that the Seahawk
offense took their 24-6 halftime lead into the locker room and left
it there with their brains.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we lost our focus and played not to lose,'' said
wide receiver Mike Pritchard. ``We went back out there just trying
not to make mistakes that would put the defense in a bad position.
You can't play that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks haven't been in that position since the
season-opening, three-game sweep of the NFC Least, which now seems
a childhood memory.
</P>
<P>
   The last six weeks have been mostly a desperate grind of
failures by high-caliber people. Even the win in San Diego was a
tightrope walk over the shark pool.
</P>
<P>
   So to find themselves comfortably ahead of their most successful
rival was disorienting, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Chiefs have decayed so dramatically, it's hard to get a
read on the significance of the outcome. You might recall that the
first match between the clubs in Kansas City was conducted on King
Neptune's patio. All that was proven in that 17-6 mess was that the
Chiefs' gill-players were better than the Seahawks' gill-players.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs established that they are one of the poorer dry-track
teams in NFL history. If indeed the season proves the Seahawks have
been the better team all along, and still miss the playoffs by a
game, the fact that a Seattle team lost a contest because of
inability to handle rain will be an irony too great to bear.
</P>
<P>
   That's looking too far ahead. The here and now of the matter is
that the Seahawks won a game, they won in the AFC West and they
beat the bullies and their boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should ease those storm clouds over Kirkland,'' said Pete
Kendall, guard and part-time Harry Wappler. ``To be honest, things
were very tense last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The best part of all for those dressed in blue is everybody gets
to unpucker. I suspect the concussion has shaken windows up and
down Puget Sound.

CSUN UNLEASHES FRUSTRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That wasn't a basketball game that took place at
the Matadome on Sunday, it was a two-hour group counseling session.
The Portland State players should have demanded the going rate for
shrinks for simply showing up for their exhibition game against the
CSUN women's team.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the Matadors' 103-72 shellacking of the Saints was
terrific therapy. For 10 days the Matadors had kept bottled up a
viperous mixture of emotions: abandonment, confusion, disbelief,
embarrassment, melancholy, resentment. Shaken by the arrest on
campus of their head coach, Michael Abraham, on drug-trafficking
charges and the forced resignations a few days later of two senior
athletic department officials, the Matadors insulated themselves
from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   They ate together, laughed together, cried together and, most of
all, protected one another from the public's prying eyes. By
Sunday, the CSUN players were ready to unburden themselves to an
outsider.
</P>
<P>
   My, oh my, were they ever. The Matadors swallowed up the
sacrificial Saints like a tsunami. They led by 18 points after 11
minutes and by 27 at intermission. In the second half, they
continued to run so many circles around the Portland State players,
they nearly reached the record.
</P>
<P>
   Five more baskets, 10 more free throws or any combination
thereof and they would have tied the school mark set against UC
Irvine on Feb. 3, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   To put the record in perspective, it's older than all but two of
the CSUN players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took out a lot of aggression on (the Saints),'' said a
smiling interim head coach Frozena Jerro, who tried her level best
to keep the game in its proper context in the four days between her
promotion and Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling myself, `It's just an exhibition game, it
doesn't count in the standings, it doesn't matter,' '' Jerro said.
</P>
<P>
   Like heck, it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game counted for so much more than wins and losses,''
Jerro was able to admit after all was said and won. ``It's a relief
to get a win under our belts. Just for team morale it was
important, after all the stuff that has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerro, the only one of Abraham's assistants who was with the
team in 1997-98, was named to take his place in a vote of the
players that carried the blessing of CSUN president Blenda Wilson.
She got the promotion on Wednesday and hadn't slept much since.
</P>
<P>
   Try as she might to count sheep, she kept seeing wolves. In her
darkest moments, she saw her own face at the door, baring fangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone through the whole gamut of emotions,'' Jerro said.
``I feel weird getting this promotion. So many people have been
hurt by what has happened, I can't feel good about benefiting from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is begrudging Jerro her break. In fact, many of her
fellow head coaches on campus could be found in the crowd of 462.
They came as a show of support for her, proving that the CSUN
family isn't nearly as dysfunctional as it has looked the past
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the basketball team has never been more united. This
squad, with players from four different countries, didn't become a
true melting pot until it was thrown in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took what's been going on and we turned that negative into
a positive,'' said redshirt sophomore Tina Greer, who made her CSUN
debut a memorable one by coming within two steals of a triple
double. ``Before (Abraham's arrest), everybody was going through
the motions. But since then we've really pulled together. The
silver lining in the cloud is that we've all grown a lot closer.
We've got each other's backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer transferred in last year from Xavier because she desired
an up-tempo pace. Sure enough, she provided a positively pulsating
beat, assiduously pushing the ball upcourt on her way to a
10-assist, 14-point, eight-steal afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Edniesha Curry, whose pregame routine last season
included giving Abraham a hug, was herself mobbed by her teammates
after leading all scorers with 30 points in 29 minutes. She also
collected seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Curry and Greer were the standouts, but everybody got into the
act. Twelve players logged at least seven minutes and 11 of them
scored at least four points.
</P>
<P>
   The result was breathtaking. Unless, of course, you were the
Saints, in which case it was asphyxiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad it didn't count,'' Jerro said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she laughed for the first time in a week and added, ``Oh,
but it did.''

SNAP JUDGMENTS: SHOWDOWN FOOD FOR THOUGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our Flutie Flakes are dying in the bowl. As the ultimate snack
of crunch time, they wilted Sunday. But we're starving for a hero,
so we rush to the cupboard for a box of Testaverde Toasties. Part
of a complete breakfast _ cereal, Big Tuna and a side order of
crow.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny might not be the toast of Broadway yet, but he certainly
ranks as the main man of the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Off-Broadway Vinny and the Jersey Jets sideswiped the
Doug Flutie bandwagon that's been carrying the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   This possibly pivotal AFC East matchup was promoted as a reunion
of Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks. Testaverde-Flutie were only
the second Heisman pair to meet in an NFL game. In 1977, Roger
Staubach and Jim Plunkett met in a Heisman battle that captured the
imagination of the nation. Yeah.
</P>
<P>
   But Testaverde and Flutie belong to another fraternity, the
Brotherhood of Doomed Quarterbacks (BDQs). BDQs include
quarterbacks who supposedly can't read a defense if it had been
written by Dr. Seuss (Testaverde) and those who might not qualify
for all of Disneyland's rides (Flutie).
</P>
<P>
   In short, quarterbacks who, according to the watchdogs of great
quarterbacking, couldn't thrive in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   When this season's midterms were graded, Flutie and Testaverde
were ranked 1-2 among AFC quarterbacks, and their teams were among
four tied for the AFC East lead. Their success had come at the
expense of younger quarterbacks who fit the league profile.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, considered the duct tape of NFL passers, won
Sunday's round. He completed 22 of 31 passes for 258 yards and
three touchdowns. Flutie was 12 of 30 for 154. Two of his
screwballs were intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   But his bandwagon will be back on the road. How far it travels
depends on his ability to coax victory from his teammates. Ditto
Testaverde. We are happy to have been there for their first-half
run, an uprising from unexpected sources in the midst of an
otherwise dull NFL campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As stars, they've had more than a cup of coffee. They've had
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   __ Geography question:
</P>
<P>
   In the NFL, East is east and west is East and even Scorsese
would be a long shot to establish any sense of direction.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has forgotten the three keys to good pro football are
talent, talent and location.
</P>
<P>
   In the crosshairs of this week's examination are geographic
cousins referred to as the ``AFC East'' and the ``NFC East.''
</P>
<P>
   We have no logistical problem in reconciling the NFL's concept
of the AFC East; its member cities all experience high noon at the
same time. And the teams are relatively decent with two completing
Week 10 at 6-3 and two others at 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The division is as competitive as a room full of enterprising
mothers and one free-agent Beanie Baby.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFC East is misdirected on many levels. The combined
record is 17-28. Its prevailing bullies, the Dallas Cowboys, are
5-0 against divisional foes but 1-3 when playing real teams. Three
of the division's participating cities are in the Eastern time
zone, but citizens of two others _ Dallas and Tempe, Ariz. _ think
``EST'' is a form of yuppie voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals of Arizona are so off the beaten path their
defense could be known as the Gila Monsters of the Midway.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC West is worse.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical flight to a divisional matchup in San Francisco,
the Carolina Panthers, New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons
absorb more jet lag than New York suffered during the halcyon daze
of Rich Kotite.
</P>
<P>
   We have a solution: Abolish divisions with directional names.
Through extensive research, we conclude the best adjustment could
be switching to divisions based on team nicknames. For example, the
Eagles, Ravens, Falcons, Cardinals and Seahawks would play in the
Audubon Division. The Jaguars, Panthers, Bengals and Lions would
make up the Garfield Division. The Redskins, Cowboys and Chiefs
would occupy the Politically Incorrect John Wayne Movie Division.
The Oilers, Bills, Chargers and 49ers are naturals for the Go For
Broke Division.
</P>
<P>
   But the toughest-to-define group would include the Raiders,
Buccaneers, Steelers and Packers and be known as the Pillage-Manual
Labor Division.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we might be stuck with our current nonsense of direction.
But wouldn't it make sense to cultivate more geographic rivalries?
The NFL should consider it. If not, the future might offer another
directional alternative:
</P>
<P>
   South.

DUCKS STRUGGLE AGAINST RED WINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The law of averages came into play against the
Mighty Ducks as they headed into Sunday night's game with the
Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending Stanley Cup champions had lost four
straight games for the first time since 1993 and Anaheim hadn't
defeated Detroit since March of 1997, going 0-7-1 in that stretch,
including four losses in the 1997 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could have really prepared the Ducks for the events
that took place in a frustrating 3-2 loss before 17,174 at the
Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim (3-5-4) outshot Detroit 39-34, and for the most part
outplayed the Red Wings, only to lose red-hot Tomas Sandstrom with
a broken left wrist, followed by losing the game when a harmless
shot from the blue line by Igor Larionov bounced in off Brendan
Shanahan at 14:11 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan, who snapped out of a six-game goal-scoring drought
with two, was on his rear end in the crease after being knocked
down by Kevin Haller.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was reviewed, but referees Dave Jackson and Mark
Faucette ruled that since the Anaheim defenseman was going to be
penalized on the play, Shanahan didn't have to attempt to get out
of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan's game-winner came less than two minutes after Marty
McInnis scored his first goal as a Duck, converting Teemu Selanne's
centering pass for Anaheim's second power play of the game and
fifth in three games.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time, Sandstrom, who scored the Ducks' other goal,
at 11:55 of the first period, was having a splint applied thanks to
a hard, clean hit by Detroit's Kirk Maltby midway through the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the game, said Sandstrom, who had six points in
his last seven games. ``It was just a bad accident, just the way I
went into the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Hartsburg admitted Sandstrom will be missed. But the
Anaheim coach said the Ducks can't get frustrated by Sandstrom's
absence or the fact that they have only one point to show for their
last two games, in which they outshot San Jose and Detroit by a
combined total of 86-64.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for the guys who paid the price and worked their
butts off, but tomorrow's a new day, he said. ``Anybody who has
been in the building the last two games knows the intensity is
there... but we have to get better, learn things from tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   A goal by Steve Yzerman tied the game 1-1, at 3:03 of the second
period. Detroit then took a 2-1 lead at 9:43 of the third, when
Shanahan cut off a clearing pass along the boards, cut to the slot
and converted Larionov's centering pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played them hard, but not perfect,'' said Paul Kariya, who
finished with 12 shots on goal, including a team-record nine in the
first period. ``We are a long way from (being) a Stanley Cup
contender, but the effort is there. Our style of play is coming
along. We just have to keep taking steps.''

REIGN HOME OPENER USHERS IN A NEW ATTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Scalpers were out on Mercer Street Sunday night. A
beautiful night in Seattle. No rain, only the Reign. And for the
home opener of this city's very own women's professional basketball
team, the Reign was a hot ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody selling?'' was the call on the sidewalk outside Mercer
Arena just before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was no.
</P>
<P>
   It was the right call, because inside the Reign players were not
only re-igniting the special lovefests that break out during home
games, they were creating a new image for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Call them winners.
</P>
<P>
   If this was the same team that did not win a single game in the
entire month of December last season, if this was the same team
that finished 15-29 and fifth in the Western Conference, then
Sunday night's near-sellout crowd had to be pinched to remember
those leaner, bleaker times.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening tip, it was clear that this is the best Reign
team in the American Basketball League's three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Alabama guard Niesa Johnson has all but turned
around this once confused and moribund team. The Reign finally has
a point guard who can run and penetrate and create, and Johnson put
it all on display Sunday, leading to a 106-86 victory over the San
Jose Lasers.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Reign never broke the century mark. This
season, it could become a habit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great core group,'' Johnson said. ``There are some
great shooters, and they can reverse the ball well. The one thing
they were missing last year was a penetrator.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of last year's ABL rookie of the year, Shalonda Enis,
has ensured the Reign has an inside game to finish what Johnson
starts. And while Kate Starbird may not have added any real girth
to her bird-boned figure, she is confident again _ something that
should make the natural introvert smile and be happy with herself a
little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is we had so much fun out there. I remember
coming out in the second quarter and I had this big smile on my
face and thought this is the most fun I've had in a long time of
playing basketball,'' Starbird said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important in this new chemistry, the Reign has a coach
who seems to understand the difference between college hoops and
the women's pro game.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Holder, who replaced Jacquie Hullah halfway through last
season, has shown her charges a way to play an up-tempo game,
making them opportunists who can create and score in transition.
</P>
<P>
   It is a huge difference from the start of last season, when
Reign players looked like they were victims of too many film and
study sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Starbird and her cohorts weren't the only ones having fun. Mayor
Paul Schell was in the house. Sonics assistant coach Nate McMillan
and his family had front row seats. So did Sonic star Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   The Glove was on the cell phone, eating popcorn, chatting with
his pals. But he was there, spending his NBA-less nights supporting
the other home pro hoops' team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to play, but I'm sticking with the other players.
We're just looking to make sure we get a good deal,'' Payton said
of the NBA's hard-line lockout against the players.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his paycheck-less November, Payton was spending his
cash Sunday night _ all in support of a good cause. During a
halftime auction for an autographed Reign basketball, Payton got
into some serious nodding as he entered a bidding battle with
another, unidentified high-roller spectator.
</P>
<P>
   Payton barely flinched as the ball's price escalated in $50
chunks. He just kept nodding, all the way up to $700. And when it
came time to pay up, Payton just directed the Reign marketing
director to his agent, Eric Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll take care of it,'' Payton said, later telling the P-I
that despite his support, there is no truth the rumors that he
might be in the market to buy the Reign's operating rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gary's Girls? ``Not me,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, sometime, all these big-picture issues will have to
be addressed. What the ABL needs is a better TV deal, which it
can't survive long-term without, especially when the WNBA is a
juggernaut with NBA money behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a miracle we're still here,'' ABL chief operating
officer Jim Weyermann said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held off the greatest army in the world, the NBA, on just
bread and water. I think it's unbelievable. One day, everyone will
be able to look back at this as a real inspiration. The ABL
survived against all odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Time will tell about all that. For now, the Reign is off and
running. Basketball fans might just want to pack the house every
night.
</P>

REIGN SETS SCORING RECORD IN HOME-OPENING ROMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Kate Starbird hasn't seen the movie ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Reign's second-year guard, who came into the American
Basketball League from Stanford with considerable hype, put on a
scoring show at Mercer Arena Sunday night that resembled some of
those mythical ``Pleasantville'' players who made just about every
shot they attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Starbird had the feeling Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   She played the lead role in the Reign's home opener, matching
her career best with 25 points as the Reign made 34 of its 70 shots
in a record-breaking 106-86 victory over the San Jose Lasers before
a near-sellout crowd of 4,306.
</P>
<P>
   The Reign set a single-game franchise scoring record.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is that we had so much fun out there,'' Starbird
said. ``The most fun in a long time. The most fun game since I've
been here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reign, the league's worst team last season, won its second
straight, and it was a dominating performance.
</P>
<P>
   With four starters scoring in double figures, the Reign built a
17-point halftime lead, 50-33. Then its only ragged stretch of the
game cost the Reign more than half of its lead in the third
quarter. But Kate Paye's 3-pointer pushed an eight-point lead back
to 11 near the end of the quarter, and San Jose (1-1) never got
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seattle played with a lot of energy and adrenaline,'' Lasers
coach Angela Beck said. ``The big crowd and opening night really
helped them and we didn't answer the call. They controlled the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Starbird, who scored all nine of her points against the Colorado
Xplosion in the third quarter Friday night in Denver, had 11 in the
third quarter Sunday to help repel the Lasers' effort to catchup.
</P>
<P>
   But the Reign produced too much firepower from the inside and
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Starbird's torrid 9-for-13 shooting, center Val Whiting
scored 21 points and guard Niesa Johnson contributed 22 points, six
assists and four steals.
</P>
<P>
   A double-digit lead most of the way enabled Reign coach Tammy
Holder to play her entire roster. All 10 Reign players saw action
and nine scored.
</P>
<P>
   Starbird was in a comfort zone most of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way I like to play, an up-tempo game,'' she said.
``Up and down the court. That is more my game.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of game that made her the college player of the
year at Stanford two years ago, when she averaged 20.9 points a
game. And the year before that, leading the Cardinal with a 20.9
average.
</P>
<P>
   An offense last season that stressed a half-court system
resulted in Starbird scoring 12.9 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a 25-point game at Long Beach, Calif., last November,
Starbird struggled while trying to fit into a controlled offensive
attack.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't adjust well. So the Reign did something to help.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a quick and clever point guard, was signed after the
Long Beach team folded and already is making the Reign a better
team. She penetrates, draws a crowd and dishes to a open teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a player like her last season,'' Starbird said.
``When she drives, they have to collapse and she kicks the ball
out. I was getting some wide open shots (Sunday).''
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson didn't pass, she was getting hammered.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said after the Colorado game that either she had to slow
down and not surprise teammates with passes or wait until the front
line became more accustomed to her style.
</P>
<P>
   Although Johnson made just three of her eight shots, she
converted 15 of 18 free throws and reduced her turnovers from eight
in the regular-season opener to just three on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She utilizes what the team does well and adjusts quickly,''
said Holder of the third-year guard. ``We talked about having
better distribution and more scoring opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise for the Reign this season is that it hasn't
had to rely on the scoring of all-star forward Shalonda Enis, who
scored 11 points Sunday after a career-low 4 against the Xplosion.
</P>
<P>
   Holder isn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we depended on (Enis) to do everything,'' Holder
said. ``This year, we have a more balanced attack.''

HONDURAN ECONOMY SWAMPED AFTER MITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    LA CEIBA, Honduras _ Across the broad, fertile valleys of
northern Honduras, the banana republic has been given a wet,
violent burial.
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the Ulua to the Aguan rivers, the vast Chiquita and Dole
plantations have been almost totally destroyed by Hurricane Mitch,
which swept through the region more than a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The waters unleashed by Mitch finally receded over the weekend,
leaving mud, destruction and the stench of decaying banana plants
for miles and miles.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras' huge banana industry _ which exports about $200
million worth of fruit annually, most of it destined for breakfast
tables throughout the eastern and central United States _ is
unlikely to resume production until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For a nation that depends on agriculture for nearly 30 percent
of its gross domestic product, it is a severe blow.
</P>
<P>
   The destruction has been replicated throughout Honduras, ranging
from prosperous shrimp farms on the Pacific Coast to the small
patches of stony mountain land on which hundreds of thousands of
peasants eke out a bare subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 70 percent of the nation's crops washed away
or killed just before the annual harvest, analysts are asking how
Honduras will feed its people _ generous international food aid
will be required until next year's harvest _ and whether the
hurricane will leave the country any wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch showed our vulnerability and poor management of our
natural resources,'' said Efrain Diaz, an agricultural expert with
the United Nations in Tegucigalpa, the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will force us to rethink the whole way the country's
agriculture and settlement patterns are structured. . . . It should
be the turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz and other experts say that although the hurricane was of
unprecedented ferocity, the damage was exacerbated by
deforestation, the absence of soil-conservation techniques and the
concentration of intensive, mechanized export farming in fertile
floodplains.
</P>
<P>
   But the experts and agribusiness leaders have reached no
consensus on how to reform the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we learn from this disaster, but I'm not sure we
will,'' said Jose Herrero, one of Honduras' top environmentalists
and president of the La Ceiba-based Cuero y Salado Foundation,
which works to protect rivers and estuaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must pay more attention to the delicate balance of
agriculture and a fragile ecosystem, rather than simply expecting
that modern, mechanized agriculture can combine with desperately
poor farmers in a way that won't make Mother Nature strike back.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-owned Chiquita and Dole say flood damage to their
plantations may be as much as $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   Because the roots of banana plants die if they remain under
water for more than 48 hours, about three-quarters of the firms'
production has been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras, which gave birth to the term ``banana republic,'' has
now been left without bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Similar damage is reported for the banana industries in
neighboring Guatemala and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the worst damage to our operations since we
started in Honduras 100 years ago,'' said Francisco Romero, deputy
director at the headquarters of Standard Fruit Co., the parent
company of Dole, in La Ceiba, on the Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita announced Friday that it would lay off 7,782 workers _
nearly its entire field workforce _ and Romero said Sunday that
Standard Fruit will lay off most of its 8,000 field workers for at
least several months.
</P>
<P>
   Although Honduras has diversified its economy in recent years,
becoming less dependent on bananas, the losses are both devastating
and symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Since Chiquita and Dole established huge banana plantations in
Honduras a century ago, the two companies have wielded a big stick
in the country's politics. They have made and unmade governments,
installed and deposed dictators, and frequently called in the army
to repress strikes by banana workers.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, it was said that the country's generals
alternated between favoring Chiquita and Dole, choosing presidents
loyal to one firm or the other depending on which one gave the
bigger ``donations'' that year.
</P>
<P>
   As democracy has taken root in recent years, the two
agribusiness giants have worked to soften their image. Their wages
now start at $170 per month, plus benefits, far above the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Since the hurricane, both firms have carried out aggressive
relief operations, using their fleets of helicopters and boats in
search-and-rescue operations across the flooded plains, and sending
bulldozers, trucks and hundreds of employees to repair roads,
rebuild levees and distribute millions of dollars' worth of food.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Honduras, private agribusiness firms have carried
out what amounts to a sudden switch to charity work _ highly
unusual in Latin America, where corporations and the wealthy
generally shun philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   In the flooded plains by the Gulf of Fonseca, on Honduras'
Pacific coast, large shrimp and melon growers have flown in tons of
food aid to stranded rural dwellers.
</P>
<P>
   Company owners admit the relief work is mainly a
public-relations strategy at the beginning of what is sure to be a
long period of economic crisis and public discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is for people to gain hope from
seeing planes carrying aid in the sky,'' said Hector Corrales,
president of the Association of Shrimp Farmers in the southern city
of Choluteca.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our help won't be enough and may not reach them, but hope is
the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of Honduras' downtrodden workers and peasants, however,
the new corporate philanthropy means little.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, we're just out of luck,'' said Juan
Carlos Molina, a banana union leader in La Ceiba. ``The workers
wind up carrying all of the burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're screwed by the government, then we get blindsided by the
hurricane, then the company lays us all off. We're always the
losers.''

   Jerusalem Bombing Threatens Peace Accord
</P>
<P>
   A car bomb outside a busy marketplace in Jerusalem killed its
two bombers and wounded at least 24 other people. The Israeli
Cabinet suspended deliberations on the Wye peace memorandum,
calling on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to crack down on
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat condemned the attack and promised to pursue the
terrorists. His aides said the attack might give Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu an excuse to renege on his commitment
to the peace memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The military brigade of Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist group,
claimed responsibility for the bombing.

   As States Took On Tobacco, Cities May Go After Guns
</P>
<P>
   The battle over gun control entered a major new phase as New
Orleans became the first American city to sue firearms
manufacturers, seeking millions of dollars for the cost of gun
violence. Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles are expected to
follow. This novel way to combat crime may put the gun industry
under the kind of pressure tobacco companies have been facing from
states.

   Cultivated Cells
</P>
<P>
   Each of the body's 210 types of tissue is derived from a few
all-purpose, primordial cells created in the early embryo. These
embryonic stem cells were isolated for the first time by two groups
of university scientists. The Geron Corporation, which paid for the
research, hopes to grow tissue for transplants and introduce genes
internally to remedy inherited disease.

   Moving Fast on Terror
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government has charged the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden
in the bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa and with conspiring
to commit other terrorist acts against Americans abroad. The
government is offering $5 million each for information leading to
the arrest and conviction of bin Laden and his associate, Muhammad
Atef. But it is uncertain whether either man will ever stand trial
here.

   In Search of Identity
</P>
<P>
   A prize-winning memoir of Holocaust survival has ignited an
international debate about the legal identity of the author,
Binjamin Wilkomirksi. His book, ``Fragments,'' recalls a childhood
in concentration camps, but his adoption records say he is Swiss
born, and not a Latvian Jew. He has declined DNA testing, saying it

   Russia in Deep Debt
</P>
<P>
   After months of hedging, Russia acknowledged that it will
default on its foreign debt next year and seek to renegotiate the
loans. Its coalition government put the blame on a collapsing
currency. But the looming default also reflects Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's failure to put together an economic plan that
would advance market reforms _ and win funds from the International
Monetary Fund. Russia will also get 1.5 million tons of wheat and
$600 million from the United States to buy more American-grown food
next month, the U.S. Agriculture Department said. Russia's food
stocks, its government says, have fallen sixfold, to two or three
weeks' reserve.

   Few Get Fewer

<P>
   A quarter century after the draft ended, the armed services are
getting too few good men and women. In the fiscal year just ended,
the Army and Navy fell short of recruitment goals. With the economy
producing opportunities and more youngsters than ever going to
college, the Pentagon plans to spend more on recruiters, bonuses
and ads.

   Surprise Announcement
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said he would retire when
his fourth term is over at the end of 2000. He is 71. The
announcement is more good news for New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, a possible successor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his sometime foe, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (a fellow
Republican whom Giuliani supported this time) was defeated by Rep.
Charles Schumer, which means New York will have two Democratic
senators for the first time in 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible successors to Moynihan: state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall and Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing and urban
development, both Democrats.

   Parenting Help Is Just a Click Away
</P>
<P>
   The moment comes to every parent. The baby won't sleep. The
toddler won't toddle. The middle-schooler can't get herself out the
door to school on time. The high-schooler demands to be taken to
the mall _  &UR; again. &LR;  And the parent, heaving a sigh and searching
the ceiling for answers, wails, ``What do I do now?''
</P>
<P>
   Time was, those beaten-down parents would seek out some
homegrown wisdom, either by calling Mom or leaning over the
neighbor's fence. But Mom might well be busy at the office, and the
neighbor's fence _ oh, need it even be said? _ has been replaced by
a glowing screen with a keyboard in front of it. Now it's the
Internet that offers to be the ultimate dispenser of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The National Parent Information Network is just a click away,
its site (www.npin.org) financed by the Education Department. It
gives advice on everything from the impact of television violence
to helping children make friends at school, has links to other
useful sites and even allows you to send e-mail questions detailing
your parental woes.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a second. What if the woe in question is that you can't
get your children off the computer? If so, you'll never even get to
the computer, much less be able to emit your electronic wail.
</P>
<P>
   Never fear: you can also call the network at (800) 583-4135.

   A New Pill for Staying Awake
</P>
<P>
   Sleep may be, as Samuel Coleridge once observed, ``a gentle
thing,'' but Americans don't get nearly enough of it. And in a
perpetually sleep-deprived country, staying awake is big business,
lining drugstore shelves with wake-up pills and sleeping potions,
and filling the cash registers at Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to boost alertness through chemical means have proved
frustrating: Caffeine isn't very strong. More powerful stimulants,
like amphetamines and ritalin, are riddled with side effects and
prone to abuse. But a novel compound awaiting approval by the Food
and Drug Administration may usher in a new generation of
wakefulness drugs that tap into the human body's own mechanisms for
staying awake.
</P>
<P>
   Modafinil, called Provigil by Cephalon Inc., the
Pennsylvania-based company that wants to market it, is already
available in Europe and has been shown in American clinical trials
to increase daytime alertness in people with narcolepsy, a severe
sleep disorder. The drug may also prove helpful for other sleep
disorders, says Dr. Dale Edgar, a Stanford University School of
Medicine researcher who has done animal studies of modafinil
financed by Cephalon and the Air Force Office of Research.
</P>
<P>
   The drug does not seem to be addictive, appears to have few side
effects and in studies did not trigger the ``rebound'' sleepiness
typical of amphetamines. Scientists don't know how the compound
works, but they suspect it acts on the brain's biological clock,
causing it to fight back built-up sleep pressure beyond the point
when it would normally shut off, allowing sleep to descend.
</P>
<P>
   No wakefulness drug is a substitute for getting sleep, Edgar
cautions. And serious side effects can emerge once a new drug
enters the market and is widely prescribed; the same could happen
with modafinil, which so far has only been taken by a limited
number of patients. But eventually, says Dr. David Dinges, a
University of Pennsylvania scientist, a drug will emerge that will
allow people to forego sleep. When it does, it will raise thorny
ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we know what sleep is for,'' Dinges says, ``we're not
going to be able to say it's OK to find a substitute for it.''

   &UR; The Djinn in the Nightingale's Eye: Five Fairy Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By A.S. Byatt. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These fairy tales may be full of magic and quests, but they're
also spun from contemporary cloth as they explore the lives of
characters who feel imprisoned by their prescribed fate. ``Byatt is
a storyteller who could keep a sultan on the edge of his throne for
a thousand and one nights,'' Nancy Willard wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hunting Mister Heartbreak: A Discovery of America &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jonathan Raban. Vintage Departures, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This English author displays a quirky eye and restless energy in
his account of a two-year odyssey to American locales as varied as
Alabama, Seattle and New York, where he indulges in a full-scale
cultural deconstruction of Macy's department store. ``In an era of
jet tourism, he remains a traveler-adventurer in the tradition of
... Robert Louis Stevenson,'' Justin Kaplan wrote in these pages in
1991. ``He has a gift for vivid observation, description, anecdote
and personal encounter.''  &UR; Soft City &LR;  (Harvill, $12), an earlier
book by Raban that has just been restored to print, is both a sharp
portrait of London and its comfortable middle-class young in the
1970's and a spirited defense of urban life. ```Soft City' shows
how, in the midst of physical decay, a city can flourish by
fulfilling an elemental human need, the need to play out fantasies
of self,'' Richard Sennett said here in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Iliad &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Homer. Translated by Robert Fagles. Penguin, $15.95.
</P>
<P>
   This translation of Homer's tale of the Trojan War is marked by
free, cadenced lines and simple, direct language that resembles
real speech. ``His narrative has real pace, it presses onward,
leading the reader forward with an irresistible flow,'' Oliver
Taplin wrote here of Fagles in 1990. ``His version is imbued with
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Impeachment: A Handbook &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles L. Black Jr. Yale University, $6.95.
</P>
<P>
   In a guide written during the Watergate era but reissued in the
lengthening shadow of the Clinton impeachment hearings, a
constitutional scholar stresses the need for caution and common
sense as he outlines the process for removing a president from
office. In 1974 our reviewer, Mary Ellen Gale, called this an
``elegantly written, lucid, intelligent and comprehensive
handbook.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Springs of Affection: Stories of Dublin &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Maeve Brennan. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $13.
</P>
<P>
   These 21 tales by a former writer for The New Yorker who died in
1993 dwell on the small joys, hurts and unrealized dreams tucked
away in the red-brick houses of a single Dublin neighborhood.
``Brennan's book is full of small miracles presented in elegant but
simple prose,'' Jay Parini wrote in the Book Review last year. The
narrator of  &UR; An Irish Eye &LR; , by John Hawkes (Penguin, $11.95), is a
13-year-old orphan whose bizarre adventures include a romance with
an aging World War I veteran and enslavement by the mistress of a
manor house. In 1997 our reviewer, Liam Callanan, called this novel
``an engaging blend of genres and literary traditions ... that
ultimately becomes a kind of post-modern picaresque.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; My Brother &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jamaica Kincaid. Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $10.
</P>
<P>
   In reconstructing her brother's life and his death from AIDS in
their native Antigua, Kincaid refuses to romanticize her story,
choosing instead to follow the circular flow of her memory to
portray death as it really is, not as we might prefer it to be. The
result is ``a sustained meditation on the grinding wheel of family,
with mother always at the hub; on the countries of our past, both
real and emotional, which we have fled and in which we have felt
like strangers,'' Anna Quindlen wrote here in 1997. In  &UR; Daughter of
the Queen of Sheba &LR; , by Jacki Lyden (Penguin, $12.95), a National
Public Radio correspondent recalls growing up in the Midwest as the
daughter of a manic-depressive woman whose delusional behavior was
dazzlingly bold and exotic. Last year in these pages, Caroline
Knapp said Lyden succeeds in ``vividly capturing both the horror of
her mother's illness and the seductive, transporting power of her
insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dreams of My Russian Summers &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Andre Makine. Translated by Geoffrey Strachan. Scribner,
$7.99.
</P>
<P>
   This French novel by a Russian emigree tells of how a remarkable
woman with a dual allegiance to her French past and her Russian
destiny endows her grandson with a sensibility that enables him to
endure life in the Soviet Union. ``Makine employs a highly poetic
voice to blend memory and imagination,'' Victor Brombert wrote here
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Planet Quest: The Epic Discovery of Alien Solar Systems &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ken Croswell. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The history of extrasolar planetary astronomy is one of
frustration and false promises, but advances in the 1990s have
turned the field into an exciting growth industry. ```Planet Quest'
is of no practical use whatever ... but it is fascinating and
worthwhile nonetheless,'' John Durant wrote in these pages in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Leave It to Me &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bharati Mukherjee. Fawcett Columbine, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   The heroine of this raucous road novel is a misfit adoptee who
sets off from Schenectady, N.Y., to California on a vengeful (and
ultimately lethal) quest for her true parents. She is ``a brilliant
creation -- hilarious, horribly knowing and even more horribly
oblivious,'' Lorna Sage wrote here last year.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Post-election picture of U.S. is (as usual) out of
focus
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elections are family reunions after a fashion, and the
obligatory snapshot from last week's catches the clan in its usual
disarray, complete with a scowling uncle or two, some perky moms
and a couple of kids blurry because they couldn't sit still. (Isn't
that Newty running off?)
</P>
<P>
   What the picture doesn't show is the family forming up to go
marching off on some great political toot, eternally the hope in
some of our more lurid ideological precincts. Rather, it finds us,
as usual, having things a bit of both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Movement conservatives can take at least small heart from a few
outcomes. Alaskans and Hawaiians voted to forbid gay marriage.
Whether that's constitutional is iffy as a matter of extruded legal
theory, but the political message is blunt enough. Gay rights
groups might do well to settle, for now, for trying to put full
legal parity into place for unmarried couples who apply for it. At
least potentially, that's saleable by an appeal to the electorate's
innate sense of fair play, without exciting the psychosocial alarms
the word ``marriage `` sets off.
</P>
<P>
   And Washington state, alas, killed affirmative action, voting to
put ``those people'' back in their place. If whites are to be kept
from misusing their majoritarian muscle to spike minority progress
state by state, affirmative action supporters will have to make
their case anew. Forgetful white folks need to be reminded why it
is in their own interests to keep affirmative action going until
black and Hispanic middle classes have had time to put a little
sustaining capital under themselves and don't depend only on
fragile incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The election displayed a nation with a surprising number of
progressive impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in two states enacted firm campaign-funding reforms, and
the two senators most associated with that effort nationally _ John
McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold, D-Wisc. _ were re-elected,
Feingold against a well-heeled opponent while himself shunning the
special-interest money he has been fighting to take out of play.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional pooh-bahs who dismiss funding reform as the
preoccupation of a meddlesome fringe will have a hard time
pretending next year that the issue died for all time when they
buried it this year. The mummy walks.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in three more states approved the medicinal _ it sez here
_ use of marijuana, legally dubious but interesting. Are policies
that refuse to make major legal and social distinctions between pot
and more dangerous drugs breaking down under the weight of a
generation that knows better?
</P>
<P>
   Resort to hackneyed right-wing wedge issues _ the gun-grabbers
are coming, gays are gonna get you, baby-killer abortionists are
after your daughter _ repelled voters in most races that featured
them. Has the religious right run its course? Ralph Reed, late of
the Christian Coalition, flopped like an out-of-tune diva in his
debut as a candidate consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's 1998 portrait shows that every second candidate was
not, as their opponents' commercials shrieked, ``too liberal for
(fill in the name of your state).'' And pictures, unlike political
ads, don't lie.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: In a French town, the meaning of Veterans Day
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 11, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today is Veterans Day, which means for most Americans that the
courts are closed and there is no mail delivery. In many areas,
schools are closed as well.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a youngster, the day was called Armistice Day. On the
11th of November at precisely 11 a.m., everything stopped for a
minute or two in remembrance of the horror that was World War I.
That was the day and time the armistice was signed ending what they
erroneously called the War to End All Wars.
</P>
<P>
   Then came World War II and the Korean War, and there were
millions more veterans to remember. In 1954, Congress changed the
name of the day to Veterans Day.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where we are.
</P>
<P>
   When I stress that the principal message today is that courts
and schools are closed and there is no mail, I say it with
considerable rancor. The observances of the real meaning of the day
that honors the men and women who served this country are too few.
I often wonder how many of those who benefit from the free day
observe its significance.
</P>
<P>
   It is a day of solemnity because even those who returned intact
from those wars gave what likely were the best years of their lives
in service to our country.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I think of Veterans Day, I cannot help but recall the
lady just above the beaches of Normandy, where the great invasion
took place in 1944. We like to say that the French never
appreciated our sacrifices in the two wars on their soil, but I am
one who does not accept that.
</P>
<P>
   And that's because of the lady.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the Seventies, I made what was, for me, a pilgrimage
to Omaha Beach. While I am not a veteran of World War II _ I served
during the Korean War _ I felt, and still do, that what happened in
Normandy on June 6, 1944 was the turning point of world history.
Those beaches, and the American cemetery above it, are consecrated
land. (If you saw ``Saving Private Ryan,'' you'll better
understand.)
</P>
<P>
   I stood on the same beach where those thousands of American dead
and wounded piled up years earlier and stared out to the sea. There
was a heavy fog that early morning and the mournful sound of an
unseen ship's horn completed a most melancholy, tearful moment
</P>
<P>
   Finally at grips with myself, I trudged, with my wife, above the
dunes and onto the streets of the little town of St. Laurent. To my
surprise, there were crossed French and American flags hanging from
all the lampposts _ and this was not on a day of particular
remembrance. It was just an ordinary summer day in a small French
seaside town where no longer were heard the ghastly sounds of
gunfire and human despair.
</P>
<P>
   The first person my wife and I encountered was a middle-aged
woman selling fruits and vegetables from a basket beneath one of
the lampposts. Thirsty, but not speaking much French, I pointed to
an orange in her basket. She offered it to me and I reached into my
pocket and offered, in turn, a selection of the French coins I had.
</P>
<P>
   She looked to my hand, then to my eyes. ``Americain?'' she
asked. ``Oui,'' I responded, not expecting what was to come next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Non!'' she reacted, clasping my other hand around the orange,
then closing my hand with the coins. She would not take my money
but I could have her orange.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell me the French don't remember us fondly. Not when I
can still recall that lady and those crossed flags.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was a Veterans Day in itself, far more meaningful
than a day off work, or no school. While I wasn't one of those who
fought their way off the beach and into St. Laurent, I was, in her
eyes, their representative at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   And I appreciated it. And I will never forget _ not her, not the
moment, not the meaning.

WITH THE ELECTION OVER, IT'S BACK TO EXPANDING THE UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the last election analyst finally spoken? I hope so, because
you and I have much bigger fish to fry. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The non-election news is that the universe seems to be not
simply expanding but doing so at an ever-growing rate. And what
Albert Einstein once called the worst blunder of his career _ his
proposal that there's a repulsive force that acts against gravity _
may turn out to be true after all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, I know that when I say a ``repulsive force,'' many of you
immediately think of Saddam Hussein or Jesse Helms and others. But
that's not it at all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I'm talking about some kind of bizarre source of energy
in the cosmos that seems to want to expand the vacuum between
planets and other celestial bodies, thus pushing them farther
apart. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest news about all this strangeness comes from two teams
of astronomers who announced their findings at a recent workshop on
supernovas (which, like members of several old rock bands, are
dying stars) at the University of Chicago's Enrico Fermi Institute.
(No, Fermi was a scientist, not the old second baseman for the
Cubs. You're thinking, instead, of Emil Verban.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These scientists wrote up their findings in a recent issue of
``Science News,'' which you'll usually find at your grocery store
checkout counter between ``Bladder News'' and ``Skin Diseases
Gazette.'' Unless, instead, I'm thinking of ``Road Kill Gourmet
Digest.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, these astronomy teams (Do they have second basemen? I
don't know.) have been studying the brightness of distant, exploded
stars as a way of determining whether the universe is expanding,
contracting or static. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. That's not quite right. Everyone pretty much already
knows the universe is expanding. The question is whether there's
enough mass (and, therefore, gravity) in it to make it eventually
quit expanding and remain static or, eons from now, start to
collapse back in on itself the way old rock stars often do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The debate about which way the universe finally will go has been
going on for years, and some days the expansion proponents seem to
be winning while on others the contraction advocates seem to gain
the upper hand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have a personal policy against rooting for either side on the
theory that they're both wrong (along with the static folks). I
know it seems to be a logical impossibility that all of them could
be wrong, but amateur astronomers like me are allowed a fair amount
of latitude. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the most recent study of the brightness of supernovas
indicates that we have what these two astronomy teams call ``an
accelerating universe.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, a forever-accelerating universe isn't exactly what
scientists have been expecting, so the astronomy teams who are
proposing this have been checking their work, looking for ways they
might be misreading the data. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found no systematic errors that could explain why it
is that it looks like we have an accelerating universe,'' says team
member Saul Perlmutter of the Lawrence Berkeley National
Laboratory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can bet the critics _ including the folks who don't
believe a word about the alleged Big Bang that supposedly
kick-started the universe some 13 billion years ago _ will be all
over this data, trying to figure out why it's wrong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I sort of hope the universe really is accelerating and that it's
at least partly due to Einstein's repulsive force. I know it's just
a personal bias, but I tend to think that guys with wacky-looking
hair are right more often than they're wrong. Well, except for Don
King and Ted Koppel. &QL;

   1. TALES OF THE URBAN LEGEND The housewife who microwaved her
cat is just one of a host of urban legends. These stories have been
spread for decades by word-of-mouth (and now on the Internet,) and
rely on the use of what anthropologists call FOAF (friend of a
friend.) This article examines the sources of urban legends and
explains why they persist. By Katherine Lee. 1,000 words + photo.

SHINTARO ISHIHARA INTERVIEW The Japanese politician Shintaro
Ishihara, 66, is one of the most prominent advocates of so-called
Asian values, along with Prime Minister Mohamad Mahathir of
Malaysia. Like Mahathir, he sees a Western (read U.S.) conspiracy
behind much of Asia's recent financial woes. Ishihara, a
nationalist and former LDP member of parliament, says in a
best-selling book, ``Declaration of War,'' that Americans used
their financial institutions to seek Japan's economic enslavement
after they were unable to compete with its manufacturers : tough
charges from a hard-nosed politician. From Der Spiegel. 700 words.

 &HT;    Make sure special feast doesn't lay a big egg
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For folks who don't often cook or are more used to
zapping the night's dinner in the microwave, Thanksgiving dinner
for kinfolks can be a traumatic experience. After all, those who
know you best are in the audience, and you are pretty sure a major
flop or success will be the topic of conversation in your family
for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the traditional Thanksgiving meal is an easy one to
cook. And the Internet's World Wide Web offers plenty of help with
recipes and suggestions, even with ideas about what to do with all
the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the obvious _ that Thanksgiving turkey. You
needn't search the many Web sites that offer tips for preparing
what has become the main entree for most families on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   All you need to do is point your browser to http://www
</P>
<P>
   .butterball.com and you'll find more information than any human
needs to know about turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is to click the link for the 10 Steps to a Picture
Perfect Turkey (or go directly to http://www.butterball.com/fall
</P>
<P>
   /10steps.html). We are talking detailed step-by-step directions
here, the kind of information that would let a man from Mars do a
terrific job roasting a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a lot more to Thanksgiving than the turkey. In
fact, some of the side dishes are more likely to give you trouble
than the relatively foolproof turkey that you buy.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll need more than cooking directions. You may need some
ideas on specific dishes to prepare. That's where the next page
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Go to Jgourmet'sThanksgiving Recipe Index at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .jgourmet.com/featured
</P>
<P>
   /thanksgiving/index.html and you'll find a feast of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a Thanksgiving turkey without a good stuffing
isn't really fitting holiday table fare. But most of us make
stuffings only a couple of times a year, so a little outside help
can come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive stuffing
</P>
<P>
   Your guests are almost certain to be impressed with the trendy
Corn Bread Stuffing with Sage, Sun-dried Tomatoes and Sausage that
you can prepare from a recipe on this page.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for a classy side dish, try the Carrots with Ginger and
Honey recipe. It's easy and quick to prepare _ and yet is something
a bit different for your holiday table.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us consider Thanksgiving to be the start of the holiday
party season. So it's likely you'll have guests dropping in during
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   While most of them won't be there for the family dinner, you
will want something festive to serve. That's the value of the
Thanksgiving cookie recipes that you'll find at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .cookierecipe.com/cat
</P>
<P>
   /thanksgiving.asp.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you prepare a big batch, because these cookies also
make nice gifts to leave behind when you visit others.
</P>
<P>
   There is no use tap-dancing around the next issue. We are all
mature people, and it's time to discuss the problem rationally.
Leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us end up with more turkey than we can eat. And after a
day or so of turkey sandwiches, the turkey problem becomes
pressing.
</P>
<P>
   There's a page that offers help: Wen's Thanksgiving 1997
Leftover Recipe Page at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.ultranet.com/(tilde)kaleidos
</P>
<P>
   /leftover.shtml. Don't get thrown by the 1997 in the title.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these are leftovers. And the art of making something
enticing using leftover turkey has not changed greatly over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recipes you'll want to try is the one for Turkey, Corn
and Sweet Potato Soup. It adds a touch of Southwestern cuisine to
your leftovers.

 &HT;    New Apple OS introduces Sherlock
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ OS 8.5, the latest version of the Apple Computer
operating system, represents another incremental step forward for
the Mac. By and large, OS 8.5 is a collection of small but
important tweaks.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception is a potentially important new technology
called Sherlock. It's a search engine that replaces the Mac's aging
Find application. But more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   While receiving good reviews overall, OS 8.5 has generated some
disturbing complaints. A few users have reported severe damage to
the data and programs on their hard drives. Others have complained
that, over time, the icons on their Macs have slowly disappeared
with OS 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these complaints have been linked to Mac clones or Macs
using drivers other than Apple's. Apple Computer has launched a
major investigation to identify and correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for a new version of the operating system to
cause problems. Most are corrected within a few months. So it
wouldn't be unwise to wait a bit before buying OS 8.5, which
retails for $99.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've been playing with OS 8.5 for about three weeks
and have experienced no problems. It has worked fine on both a G3
PowerBook and G3 desktop.
</P>
<P>
   By far OS 8.5's biggest innovation is Sherlock. It lets you
search for files through hard drives, networks and the Internet.
With the old Find application, you could only search through file
names and characteristics. In addition, Sherlock lets you search
the content of a file.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I launched a search for the word Michelangelo,
which was buried within one of the hundreds of files on my hard
drive. Sherlock found this file in a split second.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock ranks its findings by relevance, a presentation that
mimics a style now common on the Net. Indeed, Sherlock looks and
acts more like a Web search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock also incorporates some long-awaited file management
improvements. Click on a listed file and you jump right to it. You
can also move files _ to another folder, the desktop or the trash _
by simply dragging them.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock is only one of many new features in OS 8.5. I will
examine others, including small but helpful ones, in the weeks
ahead.

 &HT;    Several sites trying to make sense of Microsoft trial
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The real trouble with the Microsoft trial is there is
no smoking gun, bloody glove, ransom note or tape recording to help
onlookers come down firmly on one side or the other of the Justice
Department's suit against the software monolith.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has always been the man computer
geeks love to hate, but the trial is filled with ``he said, she
said'' charges and countercharges. For the totally confused and the
merely curious, many Web sites are keeping an eye on the suit and
trying to make some sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no entity is following the trial closer than Microsoft
itself. The Microsoft Web site (http://www.microsoft.com) has a
special section titled ``Microsoft and the DOJ: What's Your
Opinion?'' Here, Microsoft makes clever use of media coverage of
the trial. Instead of attempting to defend itself via its public
relations department, the company shrewdly turns to pro-Microsoft
articles that have appeared in major newspapers such as The
Washington Post, The New York Times and The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The most ironic section of the Microsoft site is titled
``Microsoft and the Freedom to Innovate.'' This section asks people
who won't earn in a lifetime what Gates made in the last half-hour
to write their elected officials about Microsoft's plight. It's
another interesting turn in a trial filled with ironies,
contradictions and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   There is also day-by-day trial coverage, but reader beware: The
trial coverage is unsigned, and therefore it's unclear if Microsoft
or a news organization is the author. The place for unabridged,
direct testimony is the Department of Justice Web site at
http://www.usdoj.gov
</P>
<P>
   /atr/cases/msindex.htm.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ site also has a list of exhibits and Gates' testimony.
The forms are all in PDF format and must be downloaded to be read.
The Justice Department also invites users to e-mail comments on the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion for the DOJ might be to publish some of the trial
documents so visitors can read them without downloading anything.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dry court documents and Microsoft's own defense
page, a number of journalists are working to make sense of the
trial. Michael Lewis provides color commentary for
subscription-only Slate, but his daily dispatches are also
available free of charge from the MSNBC site
(http://www.msnbc.com). MSNBC is also chock-full of all kinds of
information relating to the case, from daily reports to video, and
even a quick check of Microsoft stock prices. MSNBC Editor in Chief
Merrill Brown firmly states that the Web site, a joint venture
between Microsoft and MSNBC, is completely impartial in its
coverage of the trial. ``It's not an issue,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Business Week Online (http://www.businessweek.com) has partnered
with Court TV, an excellent way to attack the legal and business
sides of this complicated case. Susan Garland, Business Week's
Justice Department correspondent, reports on the trial in a clean,
uncomplicated style you don't need an MBA or a law degree to
understand. Garland and fellow Business Week columnist Mike France
also champion opposing sides in the commentary section. It's a
clever way to deconstruct the courtroom action, but also
illustrates the Microsoft glass at the moment is either half-empty
or half-full, depending on how you look at it.

 &HT;    Titantic CD-ROM offers unreleased film footage
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're one of the millions who didn't see
``Titanic,'' the movie and didn't buy the video, the soundtrack or
the book, there's still at least one more chance to give money to
James Cameron this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Interactive is releasing James Cameron's Titanic Explorer, a
CD-ROM, at a suggested $35. It is billed as the only Titanic
multimedia product that blends a historical database with
previously unreleased film footage. Users will be able to tour the
ship and see what it looked like on its maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The three-disc CD-ROM set uses original blueprints and
underwater footage from Cameron's own dive, and includes more than
800 historical photos. The CD-ROM lets you conduct keyword searches
on facts related to the Titanic, its crew, its passengers and
historical data.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM set works on Macintosh or PCs. For PCs, it requires
at least a 166 megahertz processor, Windows 95 and 16 megabytes of
installed RAM, and 30 megabytes freed up on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   A PowerMac with at least a 7.6.1 operating system is required.

<P>
   If your budget has yet to wane from last year's holiday waxing
and you are worried about this year's impending shopping season,
there might be help online.
</P>
<P>
   Debt Relief is a single-user version of Debt Analyzer, a
software program available from Insight Software Solutions, at
http://www.debtanalyzer.com.
</P>
<P>
   The software does what a financial adviser does: It looks at
what you owe and figures out how you can pay it back as painlessly
and inexpensively as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Debt Analyzer lets the debtor choose the amount of monthly
payment. The software also lets you view your payments and balances
in graphic and statistic form.
</P>
<P>
   The software comes in three versions: ad-supported, which is
free; a standard version, which has no advertising and costs $10;
and the private label, which can be customized with a company logo.
</P>
<P>
   Debt Relief is a 32-bit program and is suited for Windows 95,
Windows 98 and Windows NT.

   If you prefer the control and convenience of buying your airline
tickets online, there's a Web site that will let you do the same
thing with the insurance buying process.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.quotesmith.com has been up for two years. President
Bob Bland ran an online quote service for insurance agents and
brokers before that.
</P>
<P>
   The site is similar to an online travel agency, in that you can
take the information it provides to your broker or you can buy the
insurance online. The price is the same either way.
</P>
<P>
   Bland said he sells 1,800 policies on the site each month.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers individual family and medical insurance,
individual term life insurance, automobile insurance, final expense
whole life insurance, fixed annuities and Medicare supplement
insurance quotes from 375 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bland recently added an auto insurance link with Progressive,
the fifth-largest auto insurer.

</P>
<P>
   The online store will be located at the KidFlix.com Web site and
will open in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The bookstore will be called barnesandnoble at KidFlix.com. The

 &HT;    Ham radio brings out the adolescent squeal in me
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time in nearly two years, I hooked my
ham radio station up to an antenna and _ in just seconds _ I was 13
years old again.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a licensed ham radio operator _ KQ4YA _ but because I lived
in apartments for the last three years, putting up an antenna
capable of transmitting wasn't practical. I recently bought a home
and moved in last week. Long before the pictures were hung, I had a
temporary antenna in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio has been a hobby, off and on, since I was 13 years
old. And each time I throw the switch and listen to the voices from
far away fade in and out of the static, I remember how my hands
used to tremble as I tuned my original radio station _ an old
Hallicrafters SX-99 receiver and a Healthkit transmitter. Both
companies are gone now and my ham radio now is a transceiver,
combining the functions of a transmitter and receiver, all in a
black box that isn't much bigger than a breadbox (if you're old
enough to remember what that is).
</P>
<P>
   But the thrill of ham radio doesn't depend on the type of radio
you use. The airwaves are one of the few parts of my world that
don't seem changed in modern and confusing ways. It's still very
much _ as I tune the bands _ like walking through a tropical forest
filled with birds. There are birdlike squeaks and squawks as I tune
past stations. And there are voices from around the world, other
amateur radio operators having conversations using an old
technology that hasn't changed markedly since the days of Marconi.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a particularly shy man, but it took me nearly half an
hour before I tried actually answering another station. But there
was a radio operator in Kentucky and, as I listened, he talked
about his job as a newspaper publisher. So I hit the transmit
button and called him _ sending my voice out over the air using
about the same amount of power it would take to illuminate a single
light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   I know it probably sounds crazy if you _ like me _ casually send
e-mail to acquaintances all over the world using the Internet, but
when that ham just a few states away answered my call it seemed
like magic that all of that was possible. And I was a tongue-tied
13-year-old again, babbling about the new house and the fact that I
hadn't been on the air in years.
</P>
<P>
   Each time I write a column about ham radio I wonder if I'm
whistling in the wind. A lot of people don't even know what we are,
confusing ham radio operators with CB radio enthusiasts of the
``good buddy'' variety. After all, there are only 600,000 licensed
amateur radio operators in the entire nation, so it's not strange
there's so much confusion about what we do and what the hobby is
about.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur radio surely isn't trendy. You're unlikely to impress
anyone at a party when you tell them about your new Yaseu FT-990
transceiver. Nor will crowds gather when you pull out a card
confirming a radio contact with a station in Bosnia. The way the
Internet bridges distances at the push of a button has taken away
some of the drama of talking to people in foreign lands. And the
ease of making a cellular phone call makes wireless communication
seem mundane.
</P>
<P>
   But we are not dealing with logic or even with something
practical now. Instead, I am talking about the magic of walking
into your spare bedroom and fishing out the voices of strangers
from the static. I am talking about the pure drama of hearing a
station in some distant country come back to you. And unlike on the
Net, you'll hear their voices and even _ in some cases _ literally
hear the background sound of the family dog barking in a parlor in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio isn't for everyone. But I am surprised, each time I
write about it, to find there is still a heart tug for many that
hasn't been lost in the static.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to learn more about the hobby, point that
newfangled Web browser of yours to the home page of the American
Radio Relay League at http://www.arrl.org. That's the best-known
organization for U.S. ham operators. You'll find complete
information about licensing and the hobby itself.

 &HT;    Computer ghost defies readers' explanations
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All Hallow's Eve has come and gone, I'm gorged with
candy scarfed up before those annoying little trick-or-treaters
could get it, and the ghost still resides in my computer, turning
it on at midnight every night.
</P>
<P>
   Since I reported this phenomenon, I've received several kindly
suggestions from readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your article suggests that you may have Norton Utilities
installed since you considered whether to call Norton or
Ghostbusters,'' one reader began. ``Norton may be the better
choice. These utilities have the ability to do things for you all
by themselves at a preset time _ which, of course, would include
turning on the computer if it is so capable. See whether that's
your problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not, because I'm waiting for the latest version of Norton
to install. Additionally, some guy named Peter Norton sent me a
message suggesting Ghostbusters would be the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is your computer is not shutting down but going into
a sleep, suspend or standby mode and wakes up at midnight because
of Microsoft task scheduler,'' wrote another reader. ``It comes
with Internet Explorer 4.0 and also with Windows 98. It does
periodic tasks such as defrag and scandisk when the computer is
idle for a period of time or on a regular schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   No luck. The computer's not sleeping, and I have neither
Explorer nor Windows 98 installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I too noticed my computer coming on at odd hours even though I
had put it in rest mode,'' reports a third reader. ``I began
noticing that the computer only came on after my using the
telephone (the modem is connected to the same line). Perhaps, your
son's use of your wife's computer triggered yours to come on after
he went online _ that is if both computers use the same telephone
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Two computers are indeed using the same line, but mine is turned
off, not suspended or rested, and I can see no connection between
online activity and the machine coming on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two possibilities to your problem. ... You may have
a problem with power management. Both the BIOS and Win 95 have
settings for this and sometimes they conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second takes an explanation. It might have something to do
with a new standard called Desktop Management Interface or DMI. DMI
is a tool for administrators of a network to get more productivity
out of a workstation. DMI allows a PC to be turned on a few minutes
before an employee arrives at work, thus saving valuable time lost
while booting the PC. DMI also monitors whether the cover has been
removed from the system and is used to track network activity.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't detect any conflicts in power management, and if I have
something called DMI on my computer I cannot find any trace of it.
If I did, I would swiftly expunge it. What kind of sweatshop wants
a computer to come on automatically a few minutes before John Q.
Public comes to work so he doesn't waste the company's valuable
time booting it up? Talk about Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   The best, however, came in last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with great surprise that I read your article on Sunday,
10/25/98, and learned that I am not the only person with a computer
that cuts on at midnight! If you should ever find the reason, I
would be most interested. Shutting off the power seems to be the
only solution. Thanks!''
</P>
<P>
   You see? They're all around us. But the truth is in there
somewhere.

 &HT;    Americans have food prices to be grateful for
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This month, teachers will decorate their classrooms
with pictures of apples, pumpkins, nuts and other foods that
represent the end of the harvest. The cardboard cornucopia on the
bulletin board will remind young children to be grateful for this
country's abundant food supply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these annual Thanksgiving rituals, we Americans remain
remarkably unappreciative of our highly efficient food growers, who
have drastically lowered the cost of eating. Waiting in the
checkout line, you'll hear a lot more griping about grocery bills
than expressions of appreciation for the low prices.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the truth? Are groceries getting cheaper, or are
consumers getting hit harder at the cash register?
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, both ``facts'' are true: Food has never been
cheaper, and Americans are spending more. The reason is that while
basic foods have gotten less expensive, our tastes have gotten more
extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   Beef provides a good example of falling food prices. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture says the average retail price for beef,
including all cuts, averaged $2.54 a pound in the first six months
of this year, down from $2.71 during the same period of 1997. The
National Cattlemen's Beef Association estimates that today, for
$10, a consumer could buy a pound of ground chuck, 1 1/4 pounds of
boneless top sirloin steak and 1 1/2 pounds of boneless chuck
shoulder steak, which would be enough meat to make dinner for a
family of four for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider what it takes to bring home that beef. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics says the average U.S. worker earns just under
$13 an hour. So even after taxes, it takes the average family man
just an hour of work to put meat on the table for three nights.
That is a fraction of the hours his grandfather had to toil to feed
beef to his children. During the Depression, families felt rich if
they could afford a small chicken for Sunday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Think how much we will have to be grateful for at Thanksgiving
this year. Grocery stores in metro Atlanta already are running ads
offering name-brand turkeys for just 76 cents a pound. In other
words, the average Atlantan will work one hour to earn enough money
for a big, plucked turkey. Compare that with the hours one might
have spent a century ago to hunt, kill and clean a turkey for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even though the price of beef, poultry, eggs, flour and
other simple foods has never been lower relative to work hours,
spending really is up. The Commerce Department reported last week
that consumer spending in September rose faster than incomes. That
meant shoppers had to reach into their savings or borrow money to
maintain their buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   So why are we spending so much? Because we aren't buying basics.
We are seeking out convenient foods that can be popped into the
microwave, as well as other products that make life easier or
better. But by choosing fancier foods and products, we are driving
up our shopping bills and encouraging manufacturers to give us
more.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this trend, Gillette Co. is introducing a toothbrush
with a rubberized handle and multicolored bristles. The price:
$4.99. Now when a shopper is rolling her cart down the dental care
aisle, she might grab four toothbrushes for her family. And that
will add $20 to her bill.
</P>
<P>
   Then she will complain about how ``groceries'' are getting more
expensive because of inflation. In reality, the only thing that has
been inflating is our desire for more convenience, style and
variety.

 &HT;    Make sure special feast doesn't lay a big egg
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For folks who don't often cook or are more used to
zapping the night's dinner in the microwave, Thanksgiving dinner
for kinfolks can be a traumatic experience. After all, those who
know you best are in the audience, and you are pretty sure a major
flop or success will be the topic of conversation in your family
for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, the traditional Thanksgiving meal is an easy one to
cook. And the Internet's World Wide Web offers plenty of help with
recipes and suggestions, even with ideas about what to do with all
the leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the obvious _ that Thanksgiving turkey. You
needn't search the many Web sites that offer tips for preparing
what has become the main entree for most families on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   All you need to do is point your browser to http://www
</P>
<P>
   .butterball.com and you'll find more information than any human
needs to know about turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is to click the link for the 10 Steps to a Picture
Perfect Turkey (or go directly to http://www.butterball.com/fall
</P>
<P>
   /10steps.html). We are talking detailed step-by-step directions
here, the kind of information that would let a man from Mars do a
terrific job roasting a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a lot more to Thanksgiving than the turkey. In
fact, some of the side dishes are more likely to give you trouble
than the relatively foolproof turkey that you buy.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll need more than cooking directions. You may need some
ideas on specific dishes to prepare. That's where the next page
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Go to Jgourmet'sThanksgiving Recipe Index at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .jgourmet.com/featured
</P>
<P>
   /thanksgiving/index.html and you'll find a feast of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a Thanksgiving turkey without a good stuffing
isn't really fitting holiday table fare. But most of us make
stuffings only a couple of times a year, so a little outside help
can come in handy.
</P>
<P>
   Impressive stuffing
</P>
<P>
   Your guests are almost certain to be impressed with the trendy
Corn Bread Stuffing with Sage, Sun-dried Tomatoes and Sausage that
you can prepare from a recipe on this page.
</P>
<P>
   Then, for a classy side dish, try the Carrots with Ginger and
Honey recipe. It's easy and quick to prepare _ and yet is something
a bit different for your holiday table.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us consider Thanksgiving to be the start of the holiday
party season. So it's likely you'll have guests dropping in during
the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   While most of them won't be there for the family dinner, you
will want something festive to serve. That's the value of the
Thanksgiving cookie recipes that you'll find at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .cookierecipe.com/cat
</P>
<P>
   /thanksgiving.asp.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you prepare a big batch, because these cookies also
make nice gifts to leave behind when you visit others.
</P>
<P>
   There is no use tap-dancing around the next issue. We are all
mature people, and it's time to discuss the problem rationally.
Leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us end up with more turkey than we can eat. And after a
day or so of turkey sandwiches, the turkey problem becomes
pressing.
</P>
<P>
   There's a page that offers help: Wen's Thanksgiving 1997
Leftover Recipe Page at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.ultranet.com/(tilde)kaleidos
</P>
<P>
   /leftover.shtml. Don't get thrown by the 1997 in the title.
</P>
<P>
   After all, these are leftovers. And the art of making something
enticing using leftover turkey has not changed greatly over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recipes you'll want to try is the one for Turkey, Corn
and Sweet Potato Soup. It adds a touch of Southwestern cuisine to
your leftovers.

 &HT;    New Apple OS introduces Sherlock
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ OS 8.5, the latest version of the Apple Computer
operating system, represents another incremental step forward for
the Mac. By and large, OS 8.5 is a collection of small but
important tweaks.
</P>
<P>
   The one exception is a potentially important new technology
called Sherlock. It's a search engine that replaces the Mac's aging
Find application. But more on that later.
</P>
<P>
   While receiving good reviews overall, OS 8.5 has generated some
disturbing complaints. A few users have reported severe damage to
the data and programs on their hard drives. Others have complained
that, over time, the icons on their Macs have slowly disappeared
with OS 8.5.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these complaints have been linked to Mac clones or Macs
using drivers other than Apple's. Apple Computer has launched a
major investigation to identify and correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for a new version of the operating system to
cause problems. Most are corrected within a few months. So it
wouldn't be unwise to wait a bit before buying OS 8.5, which
retails for $99.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I've been playing with OS 8.5 for about three weeks
and have experienced no problems. It has worked fine on both a G3
PowerBook and G3 desktop.
</P>
<P>
   By far OS 8.5's biggest innovation is Sherlock. It lets you
search for files through hard drives, networks and the Internet.
With the old Find application, you could only search through file
names and characteristics. In addition, Sherlock lets you search
the content of a file.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I launched a search for the word Michelangelo,
which was buried within one of the hundreds of files on my hard
drive. Sherlock found this file in a split second.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock ranks its findings by relevance, a presentation that
mimics a style now common on the Net. Indeed, Sherlock looks and
acts more like a Web search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock also incorporates some long-awaited file management
improvements. Click on a listed file and you jump right to it. You
can also move files _ to another folder, the desktop or the trash _
by simply dragging them.
</P>
<P>
   Sherlock is only one of many new features in OS 8.5. I will
examine others, including small but helpful ones, in the weeks
ahead.

 &HT;    Several sites trying to make sense of Microsoft trial
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The real trouble with the Microsoft trial is there is
no smoking gun, bloody glove, ransom note or tape recording to help
onlookers come down firmly on one side or the other of the Justice
Department's suit against the software monolith.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates has always been the man computer
geeks love to hate, but the trial is filled with ``he said, she
said'' charges and countercharges. For the totally confused and the
merely curious, many Web sites are keeping an eye on the suit and
trying to make some sense of it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no entity is following the trial closer than Microsoft
itself. The Microsoft Web site (http://www.microsoft.com) has a
special section titled ``Microsoft and the DOJ: What's Your
Opinion?'' Here, Microsoft makes clever use of media coverage of
the trial. Instead of attempting to defend itself via its public
relations department, the company shrewdly turns to pro-Microsoft
articles that have appeared in major newspapers such as The
Washington Post, The New York Times and The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The most ironic section of the Microsoft site is titled
``Microsoft and the Freedom to Innovate.'' This section asks people
who won't earn in a lifetime what Gates made in the last half-hour
to write their elected officials about Microsoft's plight. It's
another interesting turn in a trial filled with ironies,
contradictions and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   There is also day-by-day trial coverage, but reader beware: The
trial coverage is unsigned, and therefore it's unclear if Microsoft
or a news organization is the author. The place for unabridged,
direct testimony is the Department of Justice Web site at
http://www.usdoj.gov
</P>
<P>
   /atr/cases/msindex.htm.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ site also has a list of exhibits and Gates' testimony.
The forms are all in PDF format and must be downloaded to be read.
The Justice Department also invites users to e-mail comments on the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion for the DOJ might be to publish some of the trial
documents so visitors can read them without downloading anything.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to dry court documents and Microsoft's own defense
page, a number of journalists are working to make sense of the
trial. Michael Lewis provides color commentary for
subscription-only Slate, but his daily dispatches are also
available free of charge from the MSNBC site
(http://www.msnbc.com). MSNBC is also chock-full of all kinds of
information relating to the case, from daily reports to video, and
even a quick check of Microsoft stock prices. MSNBC Editor in Chief
Merrill Brown firmly states that the Web site, a joint venture
between Microsoft and MSNBC, is completely impartial in its
coverage of the trial. ``It's not an issue,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Business Week Online (http://www.businessweek.com) has partnered
with Court TV, an excellent way to attack the legal and business
sides of this complicated case. Susan Garland, Business Week's
Justice Department correspondent, reports on the trial in a clean,
uncomplicated style you don't need an MBA or a law degree to
understand. Garland and fellow Business Week columnist Mike France
also champion opposing sides in the commentary section. It's a
clever way to deconstruct the courtroom action, but also
illustrates the Microsoft glass at the moment is either half-empty
or half-full, depending on how you look at it.

 &HT;    New crop of station wagons offers versatility, style, space
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Station wagons reached their glory days in the 1950s,
but decades earlier, they were conceived to fetch the elite from
the train station to a hotel or spa and provide adequate space in
the rear to carry everything from overnight case to steamer trunk.
</P>
<P>
   This was when those grand vehicles were clad in real wood. Even
today when an auto enthusiasts gets the chance to inspect a well
restored ``woody,'' it is a pure pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late '60s and early '70s, the station wagon had
become an icon of suburbia, and not always a flattering one. The
ugly image was parodied in the Chevy Chase movie ``Vacation,''
where the family car was a bizarre conglomeration of vehicles
painted a ghastly army green. The color fit; the station wagon had
become almost military.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there's a new crop of wagons. The niche was
nearing extinction _ except for the popular Volvo wagon _ until
European manufacturers opted to give the concept an injection of
youth and vitality.
</P>
<P>
   European drivers love station wagons. Just like Americans, they
have lots to carry. But they don't have lots of road space. The
natural solution is a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   There is a buffet of wagons in the marketplace. Looking for
elegance, luxury and style? Check out the Mercedes E320.
Resplendent with every option, including all-wheel drive, it can
take on the tasks of any highway sport-utility vehicle and still
fit under the portico at the country club.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a bit more of a traditionalist, Volvo offers wagons
in a variety of configurations from turbo-charged to all-wheel
drive, leather to sunroofs.
</P>
<P>
   If you need the space, but deep down you want a sports car, Audi
has a new Avant. If the Audi A4 is a sports car with a back seat,
then the Avant is a sports car with a back seat and a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a $34,000 sticker price, but its corporate cousin,
the Volkswagen Passat GLS, offers most all of the same amenities
and performance in an almost nearly as attractive package at about
$23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do these wagons offer great performance, handling and
style, they give superior fuel economy to sport-utilities and
better insurance rates as well. And it doesn't hurt a bit that they
are really cool cars.

 &HT;    Computer ghost defies readers' explanations
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All Hallow's Eve has come and gone, I'm gorged with
candy scarfed up before those annoying little trick-or-treaters
could get it, and the ghost still resides in my computer, turning
it on at midnight every night.
</P>
<P>
   Since I reported this phenomenon, I've received several kindly
suggestions from readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your article suggests that you may have Norton Utilities
installed since you considered whether to call Norton or
Ghostbusters,'' one reader began. ``Norton may be the better
choice. These utilities have the ability to do things for you all
by themselves at a preset time _ which, of course, would include
turning on the computer if it is so capable. See whether that's
your problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not, because I'm waiting for the latest version of Norton
to install. Additionally, some guy named Peter Norton sent me a
message suggesting Ghostbusters would be the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is your computer is not shutting down but going into
a sleep, suspend or standby mode and wakes up at midnight because
of Microsoft task scheduler,'' wrote another reader. ``It comes
with Internet Explorer 4.0 and also with Windows 98. It does
periodic tasks such as defrag and scandisk when the computer is
idle for a period of time or on a regular schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   No luck. The computer's not sleeping, and I have neither
Explorer nor Windows 98 installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I too noticed my computer coming on at odd hours even though I
had put it in rest mode,'' reports a third reader. ``I began
noticing that the computer only came on after my using the
telephone (the modem is connected to the same line). Perhaps, your
son's use of your wife's computer triggered yours to come on after
he went online _ that is if both computers use the same telephone
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Two computers are indeed using the same line, but mine is turned
off, not suspended or rested, and I can see no connection between
online activity and the machine coming on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two possibilities to your problem. ... You may have
a problem with power management. Both the BIOS and Win 95 have
settings for this and sometimes they conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second takes an explanation. It might have something to do
with a new standard called Desktop Management Interface or DMI. DMI
is a tool for administrators of a network to get more productivity
out of a workstation. DMI allows a PC to be turned on a few minutes
before an employee arrives at work, thus saving valuable time lost
while booting the PC. DMI also monitors whether the cover has been
removed from the system and is used to track network activity.''
</P>
<P>
   I can't detect any conflicts in power management, and if I have
something called DMI on my computer I cannot find any trace of it.
If I did, I would swiftly expunge it. What kind of sweatshop wants
a computer to come on automatically a few minutes before John Q.
Public comes to work so he doesn't waste the company's valuable
time booting it up? Talk about Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   The best, however, came in last.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with great surprise that I read your article on Sunday,
10/25/98, and learned that I am not the only person with a computer
that cuts on at midnight! If you should ever find the reason, I
would be most interested. Shutting off the power seems to be the
only solution. Thanks!''
</P>
<P>
   You see? They're all around us. But the truth is in there
somewhere.

 &HT;    Titantic CD-ROM offers unreleased film footage
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you're one of the millions who didn't see
``Titanic,'' the movie and didn't buy the video, the soundtrack or
the book, there's still at least one more chance to give money to
James Cameron this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Interactive is releasing James Cameron's Titanic Explorer, a
CD-ROM, at a suggested $35. It is billed as the only Titanic
multimedia product that blends a historical database with
previously unreleased film footage. Users will be able to tour the
ship and see what it looked like on its maiden voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The three-disc CD-ROM set uses original blueprints and
underwater footage from Cameron's own dive, and includes more than
800 historical photos. The CD-ROM lets you conduct keyword searches
on facts related to the Titanic, its crew, its passengers and
historical data.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM set works on Macintosh or PCs. For PCs, it requires
at least a 166 megahertz processor, Windows 95 and 16 megabytes of
installed RAM, and 30 megabytes freed up on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   A PowerMac with at least a 7.6.1 operating system is required.

<P>
   Get debt relief
</P>
<P>
   If your budget has yet to wane from last year's holiday waxing
and you are worried about this year's impending shopping season,
there might be help online.
</P>
<P>
   Debt Relief is a single-user version of Debt Analyzer, a
software program available from Insight Software Solutions, at
http://www.debtanalyzer.com.
</P>
<P>
   The software does what a financial adviser does: It looks at
what you owe and figures out how you can pay it back as painlessly
and inexpensively as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Debt Analyzer lets the debtor choose the amount of monthly
payment. The software also lets you view your payments and balances
in graphic and statistic form.
</P>
<P>
   The software comes in three versions: ad-supported, which is
free; a standard version, which has no advertising and costs $10;
and the private label, which can be customized with a company logo.
</P>
<P>
   Debt Relief is a 32-bit program and is suited for Windows 95,
Windows 98 and Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   The way to fly
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer the control and convenience of buying your airline
tickets online, there's a Web site that will let you do the same
thing with the insurance buying process.
</P>
<P>
   http://www.quotesmith.com has been up for two years. President
Bob Bland ran an online quote service for insurance agents and
brokers before that.
</P>
<P>
   The site is similar to an online travel agency, in that you can
take the information it provides to your broker or you can buy the
insurance online. The price is the same either way.
</P>
<P>
   Bland said he sells 1,800 policies on the site each month.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers individual family and medical insurance,
individual term life insurance, automobile insurance, final expense
whole life insurance, fixed annuities and Medicare supplement
insurance quotes from 375 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bland recently added an auto insurance link with Progressive,
the fifth-largest auto insurer.
</P>
<P>
   Online bookstore
</P>
<P>
   MovieStreet, the company that runs KidFlix.com, an online family
video store, announced recently it is creating an online children's
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The online store will be located at the KidFlix.com Web site and
will open in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   The bookstore will be called barnesandnoble at KidFlix.com. The

 &HT;    Ham radio brings out the adolescent squeal in me
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time in nearly two years, I hooked my
ham radio station up to an antenna and _ in just seconds _ I was 13
years old again.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a licensed ham radio operator _ KQ4YA _ but because I lived
in apartments for the last three years, putting up an antenna
capable of transmitting wasn't practical. I recently bought a home
and moved in last week. Long before the pictures were hung, I had a
temporary antenna in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio has been a hobby, off and on, since I was 13 years
old. And each time I throw the switch and listen to the voices from
far away fade in and out of the static, I remember how my hands
used to tremble as I tuned my original radio station _ an old
Hallicrafters SX-99 receiver and a Healthkit transmitter. Both
companies are gone now and my ham radio now is a transceiver,
combining the functions of a transmitter and receiver, all in a
black box that isn't much bigger than a breadbox (if you're old
enough to remember what that is).
</P>
<P>
   But the thrill of ham radio doesn't depend on the type of radio
you use. The airwaves are one of the few parts of my world that
don't seem changed in modern and confusing ways. It's still very
much _ as I tune the bands _ like walking through a tropical forest
filled with birds. There are birdlike squeaks and squawks as I tune
past stations. And there are voices from around the world, other
amateur radio operators having conversations using an old
technology that hasn't changed markedly since the days of Marconi.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not a particularly shy man, but it took me nearly half an
hour before I tried actually answering another station. But there
was a radio operator in Kentucky and, as I listened, he talked
about his job as a newspaper publisher. So I hit the transmit
button and called him _ sending my voice out over the air using
about the same amount of power it would take to illuminate a single
light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   I know it probably sounds crazy if you _ like me _ casually send
e-mail to acquaintances all over the world using the Internet, but
when that ham just a few states away answered my call it seemed
like magic that all of that was possible. And I was a tongue-tied
13-year-old again, babbling about the new house and the fact that I
hadn't been on the air in years.
</P>
<P>
   Each time I write a column about ham radio I wonder if I'm
whistling in the wind. A lot of people don't even know what we are,
confusing ham radio operators with CB radio enthusiasts of the
``good buddy'' variety. After all, there are only 600,000 licensed
amateur radio operators in the entire nation, so it's not strange
there's so much confusion about what we do and what the hobby is
about.
</P>
<P>
   Amateur radio surely isn't trendy. You're unlikely to impress
anyone at a party when you tell them about your new Yaseu FT-990
transceiver. Nor will crowds gather when you pull out a card
confirming a radio contact with a station in Bosnia. The way the
Internet bridges distances at the push of a button has taken away
some of the drama of talking to people in foreign lands. And the
ease of making a cellular phone call makes wireless communication
seem mundane.
</P>
<P>
   But we are not dealing with logic or even with something
practical now. Instead, I am talking about the magic of walking
into your spare bedroom and fishing out the voices of strangers
from the static. I am talking about the pure drama of hearing a
station in some distant country come back to you. And unlike on the
Net, you'll hear their voices and even _ in some cases _ literally
hear the background sound of the family dog barking in a parlor in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio isn't for everyone. But I am surprised, each time I
write about it, to find there is still a heart tug for many that
hasn't been lost in the static.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to learn more about the hobby, point that
newfangled Web browser of yours to the home page of the American
Radio Relay League at http://www.arrl.org. That's the best-known
organization for U.S. ham operators. You'll find complete
information about licensing and the hobby itself.

 &HT;    Passing NOx test often can be complex
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The term ``I/M'' test, commonly referred to as the
emissions test, really stands for ``inspection of maintenance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailpipe gases measured during the test are just the end result
and verification of the maintenance a vehicle has received. You
should have found this to be true in the past two years when it
came your turn to test.
</P>
<P>
   If your vehicle received regularly scheduled maintenance
recommended by the manufacturer, it passed with flying colors. Even
the older or high-mileage well-maintained vehicles fared well.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, vehicles that had been neglected in upkeep
were rewarded with failed inspection of maintenance results. Their
owners were given the opportunity to spend all of their ``saved''
maintenance money and more on repairs necessary to get their cars
to pass, or at least waivered. It all boiled down to: ``If you want
to pass the test, you have to do the homework.''
</P>
<P>
   While the new I/M test being performed on older vehicles still
monitors maintenance, it also exposes problems in systems that have
no set maintenance schedules. The test for oxides of nitrogen _ or
NOx, the prime contributor to ground-level ozone _ has little to do
with how often you change your oil or your spark plugs. In fact,
your engine could be purring like a kitten and still fail the test
for NOx.
</P>
<P>
   NOx repair is a whole new ballgame for most mechanics. Although
the vehicle's emission control systems designed to control NOx have
been around since the mid-'70s, the old ``stationary vehicle''
testing techniques couldn't measure it.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the output of NOx is rarely related to
driveability. In fact, many older vehicles actually ran better when
the systems weren't working. Therefore, many systems long ago quit
working or have been disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors can contribute to NOx production, not all as
simple as repairing one system. There is a delicate balance
involved when correcting one problem but not creating another.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I talked about the $200 repair/waiver limit that many
people think is the maximum they need to spend to get their cars
patched up to get new tags. It's not, but many drivers whose cars
fail the test seem to think it is.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, NOx failure is not cheap. Verifying that a car's
emissions problems have been solved involves sophisticated _ and
expensive _ equipment.
</P>
<P>
   I know of several shops where the driveability/emission repair
mechanics are some of the best in the business. Their credentials
and training records are impeccable, and the shop has an admirable
repair track record. Most of the vehicles coming into the shop are
older, but the shop is not doing NOx-related emission failure
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   They could repair the cause of the failure with relative
certainty, but they do not have the equipment to verify the vehicle
will pass the emissions test when retested. For them, it doesn't
make sense to commit to an equipment investment of several thousand
dollars, when most of their customers expect to pay no more than
$200 for the repair.
</P>
<P>
   Those drivers, however, will find a way to get around the system
at minimal expense but without solving their car's problem or
helping to solve the ultimate problem, reducing pollution in metro
Atlanta. Less reputable shops can make repairs just good enough to
pass the test, and they will charge not much more than $200 for the
service.
</P>
<P>
   But finding anyone to fix cars _ and fix them right _ is getting
harder every day. It won't be long before the law of supply and
demand supersedes the law of the $200 waiver limit.

 &HT;    PBS offers story of Frank Lloyd Wright
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed until Nov. 10
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Frank Lloyd Wright'' Today and Wednesday at 9
p.m. PBS
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary designs and a tumultuous life make Frank Lloyd
Wright one of the most intriguing figures of our time.
</P>
<P>
   A genius of towering intellect and towering ego, Wright designed
more than 800 buildings, including such breathtaking structures as
the Guggenheim Museum in New York and the legendary residence
Fallingwater in Pennsylvania. But his private life was marked by
scandal and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this overweening ego and soap opera of a private life
necessary in order to create great art?'' filmmaker Ken Burns mused
before TV critics when presenting his latest PBS offering, ``Frank
Lloyd Wright.'' ``It's something that always comes up when we study
the lives of great individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' two-night, three-hour film lives up to the brilliance
we've come to expect of the man who gave us ``The Civil War,''
``Baseball'' and ``The Brooklyn Bridge,'' just to name a few. An
appropriate mix of life and architecture, the story is well told by
Burns and his long-time collaborator Lynn Novick, who shares
directing credit with him this time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the brilliant works by Wright that are highlighted in the
film are the architect's home and studio in Oak Park, Ill.; his
estate (Taliesin) and the Johnson Wax Building in Wisconson;
several of the trademark ``prairie houses'' and ``Usonian houses'';
the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo; and Taliesin West in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   When the camera flows through these buildings, lingering on
their exquisite lines and simplicity, the scenes are backed by the
music of Beethoven, Wright's favorite composer. The touch is subtle
and highly effective.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's influence on architecture at home and abroad was
profound, and Burns has taken great pains to point out the pros and
cons of this controversial artist. In the end, however, it is a
favorable but hardly fawning portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1867, Wright grew up with unhappily married parents. At
his mother's insistence, he studied architecture at the University
of Wisconsin until he dropped out to study with the great Chicago
architect Louis Sullivan. Claiming some of Sullivan's buildings on
his resume, Wright struck out on his own and, by 1900, had
established a successful practice, designing everything from homes
to synagogues to gas stations. A stickler for detail and control,
Wright insisted on designing everything in some of his houses,
including the dishes and napkin rings.
</P>
<P>
   As Burns points out, Wright lived beyond his means and rarely
met deadlines. But most of his clients loved him anyway. It was a
different story at home. In 1909 he left his wife and six children
for the wife of a married client. The scandal nearly ruined his
career, and he married twice more after similarly scandalous
affairs. Considered a has-been in his 50s, Wright founded a school
that, critics say, did little but exploit the young people who paid
for the privilege of working for him.
</P>
<P>
   The last two decades of Wright's life were his most prolific and
distinguished. He died in 1959 at the age of 91.
</P>
<P>
   Among those interviewed for the program are two of Wright's
sons, David and Eric Lloyd Wright, and Wright himself in audio and
video interviews. Especially telling is a self-absorbed, sometimes
haughty interview with Mike Wallace that aired on CBS. Compelling
commentary is supplied by architects and artists Philip Johnson,
Robert A.M. Stern and Maya Lin; writers Paul Goldberger and Brendan
Gill; biographer Meryle Secrest; and historian William Cronon.

 &HT;    Americans have food prices to be grateful for
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This month, teachers will decorate their classrooms
with pictures of apples, pumpkins, nuts and other foods that
represent the end of the harvest. The cardboard cornucopia on the
bulletin board will remind young children to be grateful for this
country's abundant food supply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these annual Thanksgiving rituals, we Americans remain
remarkably unappreciative of our highly efficient food growers, who
have drastically lowered the cost of eating. Waiting in the
checkout line, you'll hear a lot more griping about grocery bills
than expressions of appreciation for the low prices.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the truth? Are groceries getting cheaper, or are
consumers getting hit harder at the cash register?
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, both ``facts'' are true: Food has never been
cheaper, and Americans are spending more. The reason is that while
basic foods have gotten less expensive, our tastes have gotten more
extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   Beef provides a good example of falling food prices. The U.S.
Department of Agriculture says the average retail price for beef,
including all cuts, averaged $2.54 a pound in the first six months
of this year, down from $2.71 during the same period of 1997. The
National Cattlemen's Beef Association estimates that today, for
$10, a consumer could buy a pound of ground chuck, 1 1/4 pounds of
boneless top sirloin steak and 1 1/2 pounds of boneless chuck
shoulder steak, which would be enough meat to make dinner for a
family of four for three nights.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider what it takes to bring home that beef. The Bureau
of Labor Statistics says the average U.S. worker earns just under
$13 an hour. So even after taxes, it takes the average family man
just an hour of work to put meat on the table for three nights.
That is a fraction of the hours his grandfather had to toil to feed
beef to his children. During the Depression, families felt rich if
they could afford a small chicken for Sunday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Think how much we will have to be grateful for at Thanksgiving
this year. Grocery stores in metro Atlanta already are running ads
offering name-brand turkeys for just 76 cents a pound. In other
words, the average Atlantan will work one hour to earn enough money
for a big, plucked turkey. Compare that with the hours one might
have spent a century ago to hunt, kill and clean a turkey for
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even though the price of beef, poultry, eggs, flour and
other simple foods has never been lower relative to work hours,
spending really is up. The Commerce Department reported last week
that consumer spending in September rose faster than incomes. That
meant shoppers had to reach into their savings or borrow money to
maintain their buying habits.
</P>
<P>
   So why are we spending so much? Because we aren't buying basics.
We are seeking out convenient foods that can be popped into the
microwave, as well as other products that make life easier or
better. But by choosing fancier foods and products, we are driving
up our shopping bills and encouraging manufacturers to give us
more.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this trend, Gillette Co. is introducing a toothbrush
with a rubberized handle and multicolored bristles. The price:
$4.99. Now when a shopper is rolling her cart down the dental care
aisle, she might grab four toothbrushes for her family. And that
will add $20 to her bill.
</P>
<P>
   Then she will complain about how ``groceries'' are getting more
expensive because of inflation. In reality, the only thing that has
been inflating is our desire for more convenience, style and
variety.

 &HT;    Riding the bus to prom? Don't make Cage puke
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Nicolas Cage had a traumatic high school
prom experience. Red-faced before they were famous Think you had it
tough as a kid? Consider the childhoods of these celebrities:
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage _ A not-so-rich kid attending the wealthy Beverly
Hills High School, Cage couldn't get girls to date him because it
meant riding the bus. When a beautiful girl agreed to go to the
prom, Cage cashed in a savings bond to rent a limosine. He was so
nervous though, that when he went to kiss her, he threw up. The
limo driver wouldn't let him back into the car because of the vomit
on his shoes and he had to walk home.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly Parton _ Parton grew up poor in Tennessee. When Dolly was
in grade school, her mother made a patchwork coat for her, tailored
from bright-colored scraps of material. Proud of the work of art,
Dolly couldn't wait to show off her coat at school. The kids
instead mocked her, saying it was nothing more than a bunch of
rags. She got the last laugh. Years later she turned the experience
into a song. Coat of Many Colors became her signature tune.
</P>
<P>
   J. Robert Oppenheimer _ A shy, sickly, intellectual kid, ``the
father of the atomic bomb'' was kidnapped at summer camp by fellow
campers and dragged to an icehouse, where he was stripped, beaten
and had his backside painted green.
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne _ Kids ridiculed Marion Morrison (his real name)
after he moved to California from Iowa because he was shy, skinny,
taller than the other boys and had a ``sissy name.'' They
repeatedly beat him up and called him ``little girl'' until he
filled out and began to play football.

 &HT;    Book offers look at celebrities as kids
 &HT;    WITH KIDS-SIDE
 &HT;    By Jeff Houck
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The book ``When They Were Kids''
features hundreds of childhood anecdotes about celebrities such as
Dennis Rodman, Dolly Parton, Oprah Winfrey and Elvis Presley. Race
made difference for Burt YOUNG. One day, Reynolds was challenged by
the jocks to run a foot race against the best sprinter at Central
Junior High in West Palm Beach. Burt, running barefoot in front of
a crowd gathered at the football field, beat his opponent in the
last 5 yards. The result: He became a football player, lettered in
several sports. And everyone called him Buddy. The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said in the book that while he'd like to think his success
was the result of luck and talent, he said it all might have worked
out differently for him if he hadn't won that foot race,'' Madigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as deep as the book strays into Freudian analysis.
(Yes, Sigmund Freud is here. He was the golden child of seven
offspring whose mother doted on him.) But Madigan said there are
some obvious personality traits that each notable displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us are medically trained, but if I was playing
armchair psychologist, I'd say that all of the people in the book
had a lot of drive and ambition and success and a need to overcome
adversity,'' she said.

 &HT;    A guide to the holiday season's hot toys
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS, LEGOROBOT
 &HT;    By Norma Martin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ 'Tis the season of Santa's elves: Kids are
making their wishes known. Parents are preparing to make their
purchases. Toy sellers are viewing their stock and checking it
twice, hoping to look in their retail crystal balls and learn the
answer to one of life's great mysteries:
</P>
<P>
   What will America's children beg for this year? What will be the
next Cabbage Patch doll or Power Rangers action figure or Tickle Me
Elmo sensation?
</P>
<P>
   For a hint at the frenzy that lies ahead, we turned to the
fun-masters who stock the toys.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the hottest toys will be _ surprise _ associated
with children's TV shows, such as Teletubbies or Blue's Clues. Of
course, there are the holiday sure-things: Barbie and Hot Wheels.
This year's Barbie wears a full-skirted, black velvety gown in her
annual holiday garb ($32.99), but for Barbie lovers who want a less
glamorous look, Harley-Davidson Barbie ($79.99) is out, complete
with faux leather attire and motorcycle helmet. This year's Hot
Wheels come with new race sets and a new, bigger vehicle that can
be taken apart and rebuilt into a monster-size vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest buzz is for a new fellow called Furby, a
winking, talking, giggling furry toy that costs $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   These toys are already selling, which is a good indication of
holiday heat. But for a hit toy to become a hot toy, it has to have
the buzz that turns into word of mouth that turns into sales, said
Jack Trout, a toy analyst with Trout and Partners, a marketing
strategy firm in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``People buy what other people are buying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, just because something is the fad toy of the season
doesn't mean anybody will want it next year. Just ask the makers of
the Cabbage Patch doll; the company eventually went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great ride up, just don't forget to get off at the
top,'' Trout said.
</P>
<P>
   However, some toys get a second chance. In Austin one of the
hottest items mentioned by merchants is retro: the yo-yo. But it's
a yo-yo for the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't your mother and daddy's yo-yo,'' said Jeff Hunt,
owner of KidGenius Toy Store in West Lake Hills.
</P>
<P>
   These are high-tech yo-yos, with ball bearings and clutches like
the Yomega X-Brain Yo-Yo ($9.25 and up) or the Pro Play 2000 Space
Yo-Yo ($4.95). These new high-tech yo-yos have viewable mechanical
parts and do everything but spin from the string by themselves.
Some yo-yos even cost $100.
</P>
<P>
   At Toy Joy in Central Austin, store manager Andi Miller
demonstrates a yo-yo that makes noises when it spins. It sounds
like a car crash. Then it sounds like lasers. It even sounds like
sirens. ``Yo-yos are going to be big this year,'' Miller said. ``I
think they'll be good stocking stuffers.''
</P>
<P>
   How are these early-shopping parents picking their holiday
surprises? Merchants say some are bringing their children in and
watching what they play with.
</P>
<P>
   At Over the Rainbow in West Austin, store manager Tish Martinez
said dolls will be big. The collectible Madame Alexander dolls
($69.95 and up) should do as well as the Corolle line that features
dolls ranging from lifelike infants to toddlers with all the
accessories. The newest is the Corolle Laughing Baby ($59.99), with
a soundtrack that sounds like a real infant.
</P>
<P>
   While baby dolls may appeal to younger children, parents of
young teens still can find something at the toy store. There are
robot-building kits, such as those by Robotix for $100, which
promises would-be engineers they can create a motorized dinosaur.
Or perhaps your teen would prefer the Rad Board, a skateboard with
a hinged front and back that transforms into a scooter ($69.99).
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, there's just too much high-tech under the
tree, and a parent has to opt for the tried and true.
</P>
<P>
   Trains are still a holiday favorite, Hunt said.
Remote-controlled train sets can start at $200. Younger children
can develop their love of trains with ones that run on wooden
tracks, such as those by Brio, which offers an eight-piece set for
$40.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something for everybody,'' Hunt said.

 &HT;    1939 movie still whisks its fans `somewhere over the rainbow'
 &HT;    By Julie Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the young Judy Garland played Dorothy in ``The
Wizard of Oz,'' she couldn't have known she was making cinema
history _ that her movie would enchant generations to come, inspire
family traditions and evoke the strongest of memories.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-nine years after the original release, the digitally
spiffed-up film reopened in theaters across the country Friday, and
it's clear that Americans never tire of Dorothy's journey from
black-and-white to Technicolor.
</P>
<P>
   Take Wanda Vaughn, 37, of Riverdale. She figures she's seen the
film ``at least 150 times.'' Vaughn and her kids often sing ``We're
off to See the Wizard'' when they leave on a trip. And if a family
member does something dopey, he or she sings a few lines of ``If I
Only Had a Brain.''
</P>
<P>
   When the AJC asked readers for their memories of the movie, we
received about 200 calls _ many from folks who sang into the phone,
recited lines from the film, invited us to come see their ``Oz''
collections or told us the annual television broadcast of ``The
Wizard of Oz'' was among their most cherished childhood memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The annual Sunday night viewing on TV was every bit as
important to me as Christmas,'' said Mike Thompson, 39, of
Gainesville. ``The anticipation was unbelievable. We only had a
black-and-white TV, but my grandparents had a large color console.
So my parents would load me in the car, and we'd go over there.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us ate on TV trays while we watched. And you just
couldn't miss a minute, because it's all just one great scene after
another.''
</P>
<P>
   How to account for this movie's timeless appeal? Metro Atlantans
will tell you they love ``Oz'' because, because, because, because,
because ...
</P>
<P>
   The big screen
</P>
<P>
   BILLY JONES, 77, ATLANTA
</P>
<P>
   I was at the Loew's Grand Theater for the very first showing of
``The Wizard of Oz,'' and I sat through it twice. I've been on the
Yellow Brick Road chasing down movie memorabilia ever since. I have
a fabulous collection of movie posters, plates, the original sheet
music, songbooks and much more.
</P>
<P>
   I've met Judy Garland, the Tin Man (Jack Haley) and Billie Burke
(Glinda the Good Witch) when she came to Rich's to sign books. I
met the Wicked Witch (Margaret Hamilton) when she was in Chastain
Park, and I fussed at her for being so mean and ugly to Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   I flew to Las Vegas, where Debbie Reynolds showed me the Dorothy
dress she bought from MGM.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite part of the movie is when Judy sings ``Over the
Rainbow.'' When I go to the land of Oz, they're going to play that
at my funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A dime short
</P>
<P>
   FRANKIE DAVIDSON, 66, DECATUR
</P>
<P>
   I was in the first grade in Virginia when it first came out, and
it cost a dime to get in. I lost my dime at school, and so I
couldn't go see it and I cried all the way home.
</P>
<P>
   I did always feel sort of cheated, because I never did see it
until it came on TV. Now I can take my daughter and granddaughter
to see it on the big screen!
</P>
<P>
   Ham &AMP; cheese
</P>
<P>
   JANE GOODWIN, 45, LILBURN
</P>
<P>
   I had two sisters and one brother, and throughout the '60s we
had this one special night.
</P>
<P>
   My mother made ham and cheese sandwiches, wrapped in foil and
heated in the oven. It's the only time I ever remember having those
sandwiches. What a big treat to eat that supper on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Now we all live in different states, but when ``The Wizard of
Oz'' comes on, we call each other and say, ``Are the sandwiches in
the oven?''
</P>
<P>
   Flying monkeys
</P>
<P>
   DEBBIE AUTRY, 36, CALHOUN
</P>
<P>
   As a child growing up in Calhoun, I'd watch it with my younger
sister, Donna. She'd crawl in my lap and beg me to keep the flying
monkeys from getting her.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we are grown, she'll call me when the flying monkeys
appear, and we still talk each other through it, every time. I tell
her, ``Donna, those monkeys are not going to hurt you, and I would
never let anything hurt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Parallel lives
</P>
<P>
   JANIE C. WILLIAMS, 46, DECATUR
</P>
<P>
   I grew up in Atlanta and watched it every year on TV, always in
black and white.
</P>
<P>
   When I first saw it I was 5, and I thought that in some way
Dorothy's story paralleled my life. We had just got a little puppy.
And I was just going to kindergarten, out in the big world where I
would meet all sorts of different people, even some wicked people.
</P>
<P>
   But like Dorothy, I have to say it all ended up good.
</P>
<P>
   Lollipop Kids
</P>
<P>
   VIOLA JOHNSON, 39, SMYRNA
</P>
<P>
   I watched it every year as a kid in Baltimore. When Judy Garland
sang ``Over the Rainbow,'' I just wanted to be there with her.
</P>
<P>
   My niece and I always did the Lollipop Kids. She's moved around
over the years, but no matter where we both live, we still call
each other when it's on TV and imitate the Lollipop Kids over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Stormy night
</P>
<P>
   PAM JOHNSON, 46, RIVERDALE
</P>
<P>
   I was 8 in 1960, and to my memory, this was the first time I saw
it. It was a stormy night, and we were watching it on our
black-and-white TV.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the Wizard screamed at them to ``Go!'' and the Lion
ran down that long shiny hall and crashed through the glass, a
small living room window flew open and we all screamed and ran out
of the room. I'll never forget it.
</P>
<P>
   First snow
</P>
<P>
   MARIA PICO, 42, SANDY SPRINGS
</P>
<P>
   It's my fondest memory as a child in the early '60s. I grew up
on Long Island (N.Y.), and the first snow of the year came on the
night we watched it _ that happened about three years.
</P>
<P>
   I believed in the magic. I believed you watched ``The Wizard of
Oz'' and down came the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Answered prayers
</P>
<P>
   MARTHA SCHMIDT, 44, WOODSTOCK
</P>
<P>
   Being a preacher's kid in eastern Virginia, we always went to
church on Sunday nights, and the movie always came on on Sunday
night. Well, one year our prayers were answered because it snowed,
and church was canceled and we were able to finally watch ``The
Wizard of Oz.''
</P>
<P>
   Purple Monkeys
</P>
<P>
   BILLY MURPHY, 40, PEACHTREE CITY
</P>
<P>
   We only had a black-and-white TV, but my older brother Bobby
went up the street to watch it on a friend's color set. During the
show he came running down the street to tell us the monkeys were
purple!
</P>
<P>
   I've probably watched it more than anyone else. I watched it so
much with my young daughter that the tape finally broke.
</P>
<P>
   Role model
</P>
<P>
   JERRY HAGERTY, 45, COBB COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'60s there were no gay role models. I was around 11
or 12, and I just knew the Lion was my role model.
</P>
<P>
   He sings that he was born to be a sissy, he says he's just a
``dandy-lion'' and he uses a limp wrist.
</P>
<P>
   The movie told me it was OK to be gay. The Wizard told him he
didn't need to change because inside he was just as good as
everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs, too. There's the song, ``Come out, come
out, wherever you are,'' and the rainbow is a symbol of the gay
movement.
</P>
<P>
   The movie made me feel warm and fuzzy inside and helped me know
it was OK to be me. It's my all-time favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Real tears
</P>
<P>
   JOEY HUCKEBA, 44, CARROLLTON
</P>
<P>
   I always got really choked up when Dorothy said goodbye to the
Scarecrow. I would hide my tears or choke them back.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, I got to play the Scarecrow in a community
theater production. I drew on that real-life experience to play the
role, and I mustered up tears for every performance. Everybody told
me I was just as good as Ray Bolger.
</P>
<P>
   Oui, a misfit
</P>
<P>
   KNOX DEMMOND, 42, DEKALB COUNTY
</P>
<P>
   At Sandy Springs High School, I was in this group of theatrical
misfits. When I took French as an elective, the one thing I enjoyed
doing the most was translating the lines of the Wicked Witch of the
West: ``Je vous aurai, ma jolie, et votre petit chien, aussi!'''
</P>
<P>
   The Scarecrow's song has sort of been a theme of mine. I've
played it on the saxophone, and I've sung it under women's windows
to serenade them. It really works _ I've had the whole neighborhood
entranced.
</P>
<P>
   Ding, dong the witch is dead
</P>
<P>
   SHIRLEY BERRYHILL, 63, STONE MOUNTAIN
</P>
<P>
   My son Robert is a 36-year-old retarded young man. We watch it
every weekend, all weekend. He watched it five times last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   When the witch melts, he dances around and cheers. It's Bobby's
favorite movie in the world. He's been watching it for 30 years,
and it's brought a lot of joy to his life that has been somewhat
limited.
</P>
<P>
   Their song
</P>
<P>
   LOUISE PRUITT, 75, LILBURN
</P>
<P>
   I was in my late teens in the Macon area and dating a very
special boy named Bill. On this one special night the song ``Over
the Rainbow'' came on his car radio _ and back then, a boy with a
car radio was really something.
</P>
<P>
   It became our song.
</P>
<P>
   To make a long story short, things didn't work out between us _
he went off to war and I married someone else. But I've always had
a special place in my heart for ``The Wizard of Oz'' because of
that memory and my connection with him.
</P>
<P>
   He never married. I visited his grave a couple weeks ago and I
stood there and hummed ``Over the Rainbow.''
</P>
<P>
   From the official Warner Brothers website:
</P>
<P>
   The Wizard of Oz made history by being the first movie to be
shown on commercial television annually. It first appeared on CBS
on Saturday, November 3, 1956, and last aired on Friday, May 8,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The film will still be shown on the Turner cable channels of
either Turner Classic Movies or Turner Broadcasting System.

 &HT;    Living, learning about diversity makes all the difference
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. _ Diversity is to be celebrated, I teach my
8th-graders. Differences make us interesting people to know.
Intellectually, they buy into it, but once in a while they ask some
tough questions. Questions for which I
</P>
<P>
   have no easy answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do people kill each other over religion?'' is always the
first one because they're learning about it in social studies. All
I can do is shrug and remind them of the comfort humans find in
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   How can I explain that all over the world people are being
murdered because they're a different race, or hail from the wrong
side of a border. Why do we kill for real estate? I've lived almost
65 years and I still can't figure that
</P>
<P>
   one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life isn't cheap,'' I remind them. ``This may well be the only
one we've got, so let's not blow it.'' Trite rhetoric for such a
serious question. I'm always ashamed because I have no answer. They
have the right to expect more from a teacher. Kids need examples -
so I try to explain diversity that way.
</P>
<P>
   I tell them about my old neighborhood and how I learned about
differences. I tell them about the Bruggemeyer family across the
street - a mother, father, two sons, and a dog named Skippy. And
how on gray winter Tuesday afternoons
</P>
<P>
   I'd watch Mrs. B. do the ironing on a padded board she'd prop on
two kitchen chair backs.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday mornings she'd scrub the kitchen floor and lay out
newspapers until it dried. Every evening at five she'd peel the
potatoes and put them in a pot of water on the back burner of her
Robertshaw gas stove. Then she'd make a
</P>
<P>
   cream sauce for the vegetables. Dinner was at six sharp. The
family always sat down with the first chime of the church bells at
Our Lady of Good Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when my mom was out of town, I spent the night there and
in the early morning I heard Mr. B. in the bathroom, coughing. I'd
never heard anyone cough like that so I asked what was wrong.
That's how I learned about World War I and
</P>
<P>
   gas warfare. Mr. B. lived just long enough to see both of his
sons make it home from the next ``Great War.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sullivan lived next door to the Bruggemeyers. Whenever I'd
climb the stairs for a visit, she'd let me hold her life-size
Charley McCarthy dummy on my lap while I had cookies and juice.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to her lived the Sneiders - a young couple with a baby
named Tommy. Sometimes I got to hold Tommy on my lap. He was cute,
I remember, but I liked Mrs. Sullivan's dummy better - it didn't
wiggle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Collister lived next to the Sneiders. Mr. Collister was a
streetcar motorman. They had beautiful flowers and the softest
grass I'd ever felt. They had a granddaughter named Kate who had
stopped growing when she was seven. That's how I learned about
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Next door to them lived my best friend Carol. Her mom had a
wonderful smile. I hardly knew her dad. He was an eye doctor, and
early one morning he killed himself. That's how I learned about
funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Dickie Bartel lived on the corner. He was younger than I. His
mom was an artist. She died one winter. That's how I learned about
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Tootie Wojahn, her mom and dad and two sisters lived around the
corner from the Bartels. Tootie's mom baked bread and sweet rolls
every Saturday morning. On school days I'd stop by for Tootie. I'd
get there early so I could watch Mrs. W. curl Tootie's silver-blond
hair with an iron that she heated on the stove. Just before the end
of the war, Tootie's oldest sister got married. There weren't
enough coupons to get special shoes for the wedding so she wore
</P>
<P>
   white bedroom slippers under her gown. My first wedding - and
somebody's dad asked me to dance.
</P>
<P>
   Two doors down lived the Donahue clan. Dr. Donahue, his wife,
and a slew of kids. That's how I learned about Catholics,
confession, and fish on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kellys lived two houses down, the other way. ``Second-gear
Kelly,'' my mother called him because that was the only gear he
ever used on his '41 Ford. They had a mean little curly-haired dog
named Dandy that chased me the two
</P>
<P>
   blocks to school every morning, biting at my ankles. Mrs. Kelly
let me pick cherries from their back yard tree.
</P>
<P>
   In my old neighborhood I learned about birth defects - a lady
with a terrible limp and a deformed arm that she used to carry her
shopping basket on as she made her way to the corner market, and
another lady who was so clean her family
</P>
<P>
   had to use the toilet in the basement so they wouldn't dirty the
one upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With understanding and knowledge we overcome our fears,'' I
tell my kids, ``so get out there and introduce yourself to someone
you've labeled `different' or
</P>
<P>
   `weird'. You'll learn something.'
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, some wiseguy stops by my desk after class and says,
``Hi, Ms. Schuett. I'm Tom.''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 9. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody leads with the jockeying in the House of
Representatives for the speaker's gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana as the
presumptive victor.
</P>
<P>
   But USA Today, the Washington Post and the New York Times treat
the alternative effort of Rep. Christopher Cox as, albeit fading,
still on the table, while the Los Angeles Times snags a late Sunday
night interview with Cox in which he says he can't match
Livingston's vote count. The leads also note that several other top
House Republican slots are likely to be contested in the party vote
on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT makes the point that Livingston, Cox and other members
of the Republican House leadership used the Sunday chat shows to
politick for their jobs, an unprecedented exercise. And an odd one,
since the offices at stake are completely controlled by GOP caucus
and House votes. The Post notes this trend too and quotes some
other members of Congress who don't much like it.
</P>
<P>
   The WP and USAT emphasize the main reason most House Republicans
wanted the tongue of Newt: they say he was a lousy manager. (Now
they tell us.) ``There was really no clear agenda for the year. And
when there's no agenda and there's no real direction, what happens
is you can't, you really can't have a message,'' Rep. John Boehner
is quoted in the Post. And then he drives the point home with a
little too much information about himself: ``You can put lipstick
on a pig all day long, but it's still a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that this story leads all around. The papers
also try to portray it as exciting. The NYT speaks of members
having ``scurried'' back to Washington to participate in ``party
brawls,'' and the LAT calls the episode ``dramatic'' and ``a
fast-moving tale.'' That speakermania grips the papers this way
shows they're a bit out of touch with what seems to be the point of
last week's election results: the public doesn't care about what
Washington cares about.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT redeems itself though, by making the only valuable
policy point lurking in all this. Livingston, the paper notes in a
sidebar to its lead, isn't locking up the nomination because of his
ideology, policy or personal style. It's his money--the $2 million
he's given to Republican candidates and party organizations from
his own campaign PAC. The paper points out that such personal
``leadership'' PACs allow members to take in and disburse more and
bigger donations than are allowed by the limits on contributions to
individual members.
</P>
<P>
   USAT's front reports that the Supreme Court, irked about last
spring's tell-all book by an ex-clerk about the court's inner
workings, has told this term's clerks that the supremes' secrets
are to be kept ``forever.'' The paper points out that this
stricture is not legally binding. USAT goes on to note that a
federal judge in California, Alex Kozinski, thinks the author, now
an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, broke the law and hence,
the prosecutor is ``no longer welcome'' to appear before him. The
story does not explain how a judge can control which government
attorneys try cases in his court.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reports that just a few months after
announcing economic sanctions against India and Pakistan in
response to the two nations' atomic bomb tests, the Clinton White
House has dropped many of them--those that were holding up deals
involving U.S. firms such as Boeing and GE. Sanctions preventing
lending by international financial institutions remain in force.
(The U.S. has decided to waive even these in the case of Pakistan,
but no such loan has actually been consummated yet.)
</P>
<P>
   USAT, which has always been sensitive to aviation safety
stories, follows up Sunday's WP report on the FAA's decision to
change the way electrical wiring insulation on airliners is tested
for flammability with a Money section package of stories covering
various aspects of the problem. It's sobering to learn that about
half the world's passenger jets contain wire insulation that could
be a fire hazard. One expert quoted calls wiring the most serious
issue in aviation today.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT reports on the activities of a women's group dedicated
to fighting negative images of Jewish women in the media. The story
says that what they're fighting is the depiction of Jewish women as
``pushy, controlling, selfish, unattractive, materialistic,
high-maintenance, shallow, domineering....'' A fine goal, but the
group has its work cut out for it--the most prominent Jewish woman
this year pretty much fits those pejoratives to a T and the media
didn't make her up: Monica Lewinsky.

   PETE-WILSON (Sacramento, Calif.) _ For many California voters,
the election was about repudiating a Republican who wasn't on the
ballot: Gov. Pete Wilson. Wilson energized some wealthy and
well-organized opponents _ trade unions, Indian tribes and
teachers. By ROBERT SALLADAY.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-CONTRIBUTIONS (San Francisco) _ It's enough to pay the
annual salaries of 10,000 teachers, fuel the entire economy of
Micronesia for two years or build Bill Gates' pricey Seattle
mansion nine times over. Instead, the roughly half a billion
dollars raised for this year's California elections paid for nasty
TV ads, piles of glossy campaign mailers and an army of political
consultants _ at a spending rate that broke state records. By ERIN
McCORMICK.
</P>

   ARMY-VETERAN (San Antonio) _ Roy Benavidez, 63, a retired master
sergeant in the Army's Special Forces, is in a San Antonio hospital

   GRANDMOTHER-AUTHOR (Undated) _ Not long ago, while leaving a
store, Suzette Haden Elgin passed a group of boys. As she was
getting into her car, Elgin heard one of the teens say to his pals,
``Now that is what a grandmother is supposed to look like.'' Elgin,
author of ``The Grandmother Principles,'' remembers smiling to
herself. The teens were close, she said, but not quite right. Yes,
she had the requisite white hair and wrinkles, but she was wearing
slacks. By BARBARA KARKABI.

   LENOTRE-CHEF (Houston) _ At half-past five, Alain LeNotre is
taking a visitor through his family's 6-week-old culinary institute
when Patrick, his cousin, interrupts. Patrick, a celebrated chef,
speaks only French. ``He wants us to hear the bread sing,'' Alain
explains. Patrick cradles a baking sheet of baguettes so hot and
fresh that they do seem to sing their charms. Alain nods approval.
Patrick smiles and whisks them away. He has much to do before the
students descend. By CECILE HOLMES.

<P>
   TRAVEL-COLUMN (Undated) _ Now that advance boarding passes are a
relic, it's more important than ever for airline passengers to know
a good seat from a bad seat. There are differences _ even in the
same service class on the same plane. By HARRY SHATTUCK.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-CARIBBEAN (Undated) _ Mention the Caribbean to some
travelers, and the connotation is one enormous entity of similar
sun-drenched islands. But each island has a distinct personality.
Distinct appeal. Distinct topography. Even languages vary. Here are
island-by-island capsules detailing what makes each special. By

Most people are born honest, you know, but by the time they go
fishing, they usually get over it. By TOM STIENSTRA.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ ``By the year 2000, housewives
... will probably have a robot maid,'' an article in the New York
Times predicted in 1966. Little did they know there wouldn't be
housewives. This is an example of failed millennial predictions
collected in a little book called ``Uncle John's Indispensable
Guide to the Year 2000.'' By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   MATTHEWS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The bloody demise of House
Speaker Newt Gingrich marks a wild reversal in the Capitol food

 &HT;    EXILING GINGRICH DOESN'T LESSEN GOP'S REAL PROBLEM
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ancient Israel, Hebrew priests would place their hands on the
head of a goat and pile all of the tribe's sins and transgressions
on the animal. Then they would banish the scapegoat to the
wilderness, carrying all of their problems with it.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to be that easy for the Republicans. Last week
they piled all of their problems on the head of Newt Gingrich, and
on Friday they banished him to the political wilderness. But his
exile does not lessen or diminish the Republicans' underlying
predicament.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, the presence of Gingrich is all that had saved
the party from a bitter civil war over its identity. His success in
bringing the Republicans into the majority in 1994 earned him the
loyalty of all factions of the party. No other figure now can
command that broad support. He also has been such a dominating
figure within the party that moderates and conservatives alike
directed their anger at him, rather than each other. Without
Gingrich to absorb that anger, they're going to be at each other's
throats.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the election of 1994 looks more and more now like a
blip on the political screen, a historical accident in danger of
reversal as early as the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that fate, Republicans would have to agree on a
platform more compelling than hating Bill Clinton, hating
government, distrusting minorities and opposing abortion. And it's
hard to see how that's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The social conservatives who control the party structure believe
fervently in their message, because it works so well back in their
home districts and within groups such as the Christian Coalition.
But as we've seen in the last two presidential elections, that
message is rejected when it's taken before a larger audience. In
1992, George Bush got 38 percent of the vote; in 1996, Bob Dole got
41 percent. No major party has performed so poorly in back-to-back
presidential elections since the '30s, when Republican candidates
Herbert Hoover and Alf Landon were swamped by FDR.
</P>
<P>
   That trend was confirmed in last week's mid-term election. The
best news for Republicans was the strong performance of GOP
candidates for governor in important swing states. The sons of
President Bush, Jeb and George W., easily won races for governor in
Florida and Texas. Republicans also won races in Massachusetts and
New York, states where Republican members of Congress are having a
hard time holding their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Those candidates won because they rejected the hard-right
emphasis on social issues and instead stressed their ability as
good managers. They came across as moderate, competent people who
see government as a legitimate tool for improving the lives of
Americans, and as a result they got elected.
</P>
<P>
   It's also instructive to note the states where the Republicans
were defeated. In the House, they lost seats in Kansas, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Washington, all areas well outside the
South, where family values play best. It is hard to argue that
those races could have been won by a more conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   More surprisingly, the Republicans also lost hard-fought races
for governor in Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia, the very heart
of Dixie. Even here in the South, the pure hard-core conservative
message doesn't always translate well when it is taken statewide.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it isn't credible or fair to blame the lack of a
Republican agenda on Gingrich, the most agenda-driven politician of
his generation. He simply worked with what the Republican caucus
could agree upon, and that wasn't enough to define a major party.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans seem to have settled on Rep. Robert
Livingston of Louisiana to replace Gingrich as speaker, but no
politician, no matter how talented, will be able to hold the GOP
caucus together for the next two years. The intraparty conflict
will intensify when candidates begin to campaign for the Republican
presidential nomination. In his victory speech Tuesday night, Gov.
Bush of Texas was already trying out his theme of ``compassionate
conservatism,'' while Steve Forbes and others were renewing their
allegiance to the social issues right.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gingrich, his future as a politician does not look
bright. He long has thought of himself _ and spoken of himself _ in
outrageously grandiose terms. He was, he said, ``a definer of
Western civilization'' and ``all that stands between us and
Auschwitz,'' as well as a pivotal historical figure on the order of
a Roosevelt, Napoleon or Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich probably has noted _ to himself if not to others _ the
parallel between his own fate and that of his hero Churchill. Less
than three months after Churchill led Great Britain through its
darkest hours to victory over Adolf Hitler, he was ousted from
office by ungrateful British voters. The parallel becomes even more
comforting to Gingrich when you remember that a few years later,
those same voters returned Churchill to honor and power.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who has watched Gingrich's career ever would rule out a
Churchillian resurrection. But such a miracle is hard to imagine.
National exit polls on Tuesday gave Gingrich a favorable rating of
only 36 percent, with 58 percent of voters holding an unfavorable
view.
</P>
<P>
   That is not some temporary decline. His numbers have lingered in
that range for several years, long enough for the concrete to set.
As a result, a successful comeback as an elected official _ at
least at any level that will satisfy the Gingrich ego _ seems
farfetched.

STORM SWEEPS AWAY GAINS OF A DECADE IN CENTRAL AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS AND RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ After enduring repressive civil wars,
military regimes, and corrupt governments, the little countries of
Central America finally started to savor the good life in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They tamed inflation and created jobs. They learned not to
rely on just one or two crops and the elixir of foreign aid. They
reined in armies and gave people a taste of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Then Hurricane Mitch barreled in, leveling houses, destroying
farms, and setting development back by years, if not decades.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This week, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras are
going about the task of rebuilding houses and roads, water mains,
and phone lines. But just as important, they are figuring out how
to tend to shattered families and mend fragile democracies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Nowhere are the problems more daunting than in Honduras, an
Ohio-sized country that has been sliced into independent
city-states separated by churning rivers the color of chocolate
milk.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One out of every 1,000 Hondurans is dead or missing. One-fifth
of the population is displaced. Entire neighborhoods washed away,
and, as President Carlos Flores likes to say, ``it's easier to
count the number of bridges still standing than the ones that are
wrecked.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the wreckage has nothing to do with bricks and mortar.
In the capital, the energetic, well-liked mayor, Cesar Castellanos,
died in a helicopter crash Nov. 1 Castellanos, who called himself
``Fatty,'' was considered the likely next president.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Carlos Rivera, a businessman, stood amid the
whitewashed walls and red-tiled roofs of Tegucigalpa's historic
center. An earth-mover scooped up rocks and twisted metal that had
slammed into his mother-in-law's house as the Choluteca River rose
beyond its banks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Crystal chandeliers swung above his in-laws' mud-caked living
room. One wall had a hole wide enough for a powerboat. ``How does a
country start recovering from a mess like this?'' said Rivera,
whose family also lost a sporting-goods store.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Rivera graduated from Emerson College in Boston in the late
1980s, just as the Cold War was winding down and Honduras was
slipping away from Washington's powerful grip. Sensing the start of
an economic renaissance, Rivera opened three cigar shops in
Tegucigalpa. Throughout the city, other young Hondurans opened
restaurants, furniture stores, and boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With money tight last week, Rivera had 5 percent of his usual
number of customers. It hardly mattered because there weren't many
cigars to sell; manufacturers didn't have gas for deliveries and
roads were impassable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In downtown Tegucigalpa, a gun-toting thief took advantage of
the turbulence and robbed Rivera's stepfather's delicatessen of
$2,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And yet Rivera's family is lucky: None of their relatives were
injured as the hurricane stalled over Honduras for five days,
dumping as much rain as the country gets in a year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For decades, foreign corporations and the US government bought
and discarded Central American leaders like so many toy soldiers.
Until 1990, Honduras received $190 million in US aid per year _ a
straggering amount for a country that had fertile fields, good
ports, and fewer than 6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; None of that mattered. Honduras was a staging ground for the
``contra'' war against Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The aid
has dropped steadily in the 1990s, to $30 million last year.
Honduras, which had relied on bananas and coffee, aggressively
started exporting melons, pineapples, and shrimp as well as
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In Nicaragua, meanwhile, many money-losing cotton fields were
plowed under and the country diversified to bananas, watermelons
and onions for export. From 1987 to 1997, agriculture in Nicaragua
has grown at an annual rate of 3.2 percent, according to the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In the northwest Nicaraguan town of Leon, Herman Pasillos had
been nurturing his sugar cane field, even whispering messages of
love and encouragement to the stalks. ``It's something I learned
from my grandfather, who was also a farmer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In less than one week _ the time it took Hurricane Mitch to
deluge the area with rain and start a mudslide from the Casita
volcano _ about half of Pasillo's 17-acre field was ruined.
Pasillo, 54, has to figure out how to feed his six children and
five grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Pasillo's problem will be the country's dilemma: How do you
start over when you have almost nothing?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In a leisurely conversation in Tegucigalpa on Thursday
afternoon, President Flores told Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston
about the complexities of rebuilding a country.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One of the most pressing problems is the lack of fuel to power
construction vehicles, buses, and water pumps, the president
explained. In order to bring in the fuel tankers, roads and bridges
must be repaired. But doing those repairs means using heavy
machinery, which requires fuel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It's a vicious circle,'' Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Dr. Michael Collins, president of Caritas Christi in Boston,
saw the same phenomenon at a public hospital last week. The trauma
ward was filled with people with severe burns and head wounds. Two
children were bleeding profusely from hemorrhagic dengue fever _
something Collins had never seen outside of a medical textbook.
There was no medicine for a teenager doubled over with a kidney
stone; Collins gave the boy's mother $2 to buy painkillers at a
pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The hospital had a basic problem: no water for washing
doctor's hands, cleaning instruments, or laundering gowns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mitch left something less palpable than damaged buildings and
mass graveyards: the peril of political instability in a region
that was just recovering from the damage caused by years of civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The danger is probably greatest in Nicaragua, which was ripped
apart by civil conflict from 1976 to 1990. Already, opponents
compare the government of President Arnoldo Aleman to the
dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza, which stole millions of dollars
in aid money after an earthquake hit Managua in 1972. So much money
vanished that Managua still has not been rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Relief workers say relations with the government are tense.
They have demanded assurances that donated food, clothes, and
medicines won't end up on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``We don't want to appear to exploit this situation,'' said an
opposition leader, former president Daniel Ortega, at his home.
``But I think the people are tired of this government's attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Catholic Church, not the government, will oversee efforts
to provide emergency shelter, clothing, and food, Flores said.

<P>
   And it was an issue Justice Stephen Breyer worried about when he
was an appelate judge in Boston. ``What happens if we keep
increasing mandatory prison terms through the legislature?'' he
warned. ``We will have tens of thousands of men 20 years from now
in their 50s, 60s, and 70s, and the expense of warehousing these
old men will be enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   It is already staggering. In Massachusetts, the cost is an
average of $30,000 per prisoner per year. In the federal system,
that cost is $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of inmates serving time on drug charges keeps
growing. Consider that in 1983, one in 10 federal inmates was in
prison for a drug offense. Today it is one out of two.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the prison population in 1980 was 3,066. This
year, it is over 10,000, with more than 18 percent of those
detained for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, about 645 of every 100,000 Americans is behind
bars, and African-American men have a nearly 1-in-3 chance of being
jailed at some point in their lives. The United States' rate of
incarceration is higher than any other country's but Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it? A 1997 Rand Corp. report found there are more
cost-effective ways to reduce crime and drug use. Using
mathematical models, the study found that, dollar for taxpayer
dollar, mandatory minimum sentences were less effective in reducing
cocaine consumption than previous sentencing structures. And
neither was as effective as putting heavy users through treatment
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found mandatory minimums are less cost-effective
for reducing cocaine-related crime than either of those other
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   US District Senior Judge A. David Mazzone, a member of the US
Sentencing Commission, which sets sentencing guidelines and
monitors the federal court system, said that mandatory minimum
sentences conflict with guidelines passed under the Sentencing
Reform Act of 1984, which made sentencing more uniform, but still
left judges some discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the federal system, 50 to 60 percent of inmates are
drug-related and a great deal of them are first-time offenders and
most were sentenced under mandatory sentences,'' Mazzone says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Sentencing Commission recommended closing the gap
in sentencing for crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Congress
virtually ignored the recommendation, and those sentenced for crack
_ nearly 90 percent of them African-Americans _ still face
sentences 100 times longer than those guilty of powder cocaine
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot that can be done to the system,'' Mazzone says,
``but without the political will you can't do it, and there is no
political will.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little desire in the White House or on Capitol Hill to
tinker with mandatory sentencing, and, as a result, be tagged as
``soft on crime.'' But at least one powerful politician in
Massachusetts is making mandatory sentencing overhaul a centerpiece
of next year's legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are political currents and themes that this is
left-wing, soft-on-crime squishy, but I don't view it that way at
all,'' said Thomas M. Finneran, the Massachusetts House speaker,
not a man to coddle criminals. ``To the extent that we can
eliminate rigidity and defer to the judgment of hopefully wisely
chosen jurists, we are better off. One-size-fits-all solutions
designed by a legislative body that sits far away from the instance
of a specific case does not make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran is motivated by an interest in the bottom line. ``I am
not convinced we are getting the full mileage for taxpayers
dollars,'' he says. ``Some of the people sentenced could remain
productive members of society and pay back communities for whatever
crime they committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Predicted the speaker, ``This is a battleground that will
develop in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SIDEBAR &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the summer of 1986. Len Bias had died of an overdose _
erroneously attributed to crack cocaine _ the print and electronic
media were pumping up hysteria about crack as a national epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sterling, then a lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee
recalls the three days in August that the committee spent coming up
with the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike every other piece of legislation I was involved in,
there was no hearing for this. An appropriate hearing would have
sought the views of the Justice Department, the Bureau of Prisons,
the US Attorneys, as well as the Drug Enforcement Administration on
what the effects of the legislastion might be, how it could be
improved. We would have sought the testimony of judges, federal
probation offers, criminologists...That would have been typical of
a major policy initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years earlier the Sentencing Reform Act came into being
after years of debate and reflection and sentencing guidelines
stemming from that act were still being promulgated when Congress
acted so swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee not only reflected a lack of confidence in that
1984 law...it was moving very quickly and we received erroneous
information from a DEA advisor who was not an agent on the question
of whether there should be a purity factor, meaning would five
grams of crack cocaine have to be pure crack, recognizing almost
every drug at the retail level is highly adulterated. This guy said
it was an administrative impossiblity to test for purity. But their
lab does it all the time.'' As a result, there is no purity
requirements in the law.
</P>
<P>
   The end result, says Sterling, was ``a complete failure of both
the legislative process and a failure of vision by policy makers of
what was going to happen. The effort was completely successul in
meeting political objectives as possing as tough, crusaders
fighting drugs, but it was complelety ineffective in meeting legal
and policy objectives.''

<P>
   Late in 1990, Bill Weld acknowledged that he hadn't really
beaten John Silber in that year's race for governor. ``I didn't win
that campaign,'' Weld told me. ``Silber lost it.'' It was true. The
political advantages were with Silber in 1990, but he blundered and
wound up snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cellucci, it has often been remarked, is no Bill Weld, and
he proved it again in his graceless press conference last
Wednesday. One day earlier, he'd bested Scott Harshbarger with
roughly the same bare majority as Weld's in 1990 _ 51 percent _ and
for roughly the same reason: The Democrat ran a poor campaign and
blew what could have been a winning hand. For his squeaker of a
win, Cellucci should have expressed self-deprecating gratitude.
Instead he complained that he was robbed of a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't his fault that he barely held on to the Corner Office,
Cellucci believes, or that virtually every other Republican on the
ballot lost. It was the fault of the Republican leadership in
Congress. ``There seems to be a backlash against Republicans around
the country that I think hurt us here in Massachusetts,'' he said.
``They are going to have to do some soul searching down in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the national GOP squandered what should have been
a triumphant political season _ not by overstressing the scandalous
behavior of the president (exit polls showed that for most voters
Clinton simply wasn't an issue), but by understressing the
conservative agenda of shrinking government and cutting taxes. It's
also true that Republican candidates were massacred in
Massachusetts on Nov. 3. But the one has no connection to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   What took place nationwide on Election Day was not a backlash
against Republicans, it was the absence of a backlash against
Democrats. But even when there is an anti-Democrat tide _ as in
1994, when Democrats were swept away in Congress and the
statehouses and Republican power surged to levels not seen in
generations _ what happens in Massachusetts? Answer: nothing. In
1994, the state GOP made no gains. It couldn't beat Ted Kennedy or
a single Democratic congressman, couldn't win any statewide office
it didn't already hold, and couldn't achieve even a modest pickup
in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   If Bay State Republicans fail to advance even in a year of
massive GOP victories, why would anyone expect them to do well in a
year that is merely so-so?
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts voters did not punish Republicans last week
because of the inept leadership of Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott.
They punished them because of the inept leadership of Cellucci and
Weld.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the two Republican governors have made it their
business to efface every difference between the two major parties.
Big government? Under Weld-Cellucci, the state's tentacles reach
deeper into the lives of private citizens than ever before. High
spending? Under Weld-Cellucci, the budget has grown by nearly $1
billion a year. Social liberalism? From gun control to gay
``awareness,'' Weld-Cellucci have pushed state government even
further to the cultural left than it was under Michael Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Why bother to vote Republican if what you end up with walks,
talks, and quacks like a Democrat?
</P>
<P>
   Even on the issues that Weld-Cellucci cited as proof of their
conservative bona fides, they took pains not to seem too
principled.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed to be tax-cutters, but Weld-Cellucci actually
raised income taxes by $800 million: They twice expanded the
so-called ``stabilization fund,'' siphoning off money that would
otherwise have been returned to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed to be ardent privatizers, but privatization was
abandoned in favor of buying off state employees. At the MBTA, the
Turnpike Authority, and Logan Airport, Cellucci bribed the transit
unions with contracts hiking salaries by as much as 20 percent over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed to favor capital punishment, but they appointed two
capital-punishment opponents to the Supreme Judicial Court.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of how Republicans can win elections, there are
two schools of thought. One holds that Republicans are most likely
to succeed when they sharply distinguish themselves from Democrats
and battle hard for their principles. The other holds that
Republicans should mute their ideological distinctions and craft a
``moderate'' image.
</P>
<P>
   Weld and Cellucci are disciples of the second school. For the
past eight years, they bent over backward to placate the State
House powers that be. They flattered, schmoozed, and deferred to
the Legislature's Democrats. They backed away from fights. They
kept the Republican State Committee ineffectual. They gave
patronage jobs to Democrats, and recruited few Republicans to
challenge incumbents. They looked for ways to needle their own
party (e.g., Weld vs. the prolifers) and to befriend high-ranking
Democrats (e.g., Cellucci hailing Hillary Clinton in Lowell).
</P>
<P>
   The result is a shattered and demoralized Republican Party. Weld
and Cellucci conveyed the message that the GOP had nothing much to
offer, and the electorate voted accordingly. Republicans were
trounced. The Legislature will have its largest Democratic majority
in memory.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci eked out a win, but GOP candidates who made their name
as Weld-Cellucci appointees _ Jeffrey Locke, Jack Flood, Michael
Duffy, Brad Bailey, Dale Jenkins _ were blown away.
</P>
<P>
   Like Weld, Cellucci has stood for very little. Very little is
what he ended up with: a governorship with no real power. There's a
lesson in this. But judging from his remarks last week, Cellucci
hasn't learned it.

GOODBYE, COLUMBUS _ FROM THE FIESTA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone thought that Ohio State would have trouble winning the
national championship because of a team from Michigan. But who
would have thought that it would be Michigan State causing the
problems for the Buckeyes? Make that unranked Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   By posting a 28-24 victory over the Buckeyes in Columbus
Saturday, the Spartans caused several tremors in college football:
</P>
<P>
   _They knocked Ohio State from the No. 1 slot. It was the fourth
time since 1988 that an unranked team has upset a No. 1 team, and
the first time since Oct. 30, 1990, when Michigan State, again
unranked, upset No. 1 Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   _They all but eliminated the Buckeyes from consideration for the
national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _They probably knocked Notre Dame out of the Rose Bowl mix.
</P>
<P>
   _They ended any speculation about Ohio State quarterback Joe
Germaine possibly getting Heisman Trophy consideration.
</P>
<P>
   _They increased the national championship hopes for at least
five teams, all of which needed help and now have received it.
</P>
<P>
   _They put Ohio State in jeoprardy of getting shut out of the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in here with the attitude that we were the squirts in
the neighborhood who had to pick a fight with a bully,'' said
Michigan State coach Nick Saban, who now has the satisfaction of
spoiling not only Ohio State's season but Notre Dame's as well,
since the Spartans are the only team thus far to beat the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   The focus of national attention now is on Kansas State and
Tennessee, No. 1 in this week's polls (the Vols top the Associated
Press rankings, the Wildcats and Vols are tied in the coaches'
poll). There's also UCLA, and the looming presences of Florida and
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Already the second-guessing has started in Columbus about Ohio
State coach John Cooper, whose record against Michigan _ one win in
10 years _ has haunted him.
</P>
<P>
   In the immediate aftermath of the loss, Cooper was asked why, on
their next-to-last offensive series of the game and trailing by 12
points, the Buckeyes ran 12 consecutive plays on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's some really good second-guessing,'' said Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Tyson Walter had this response: ``I don't get
paid to think like that. I get paid to do what they tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   Paid? Hmmmm. We know what he meant. At least we hope we do.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for all of this is that unless there are some
major upsets in the next few weeks, Ohio State fans are going to
munch on roast Cooper as much as roast turkey over Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Safe and sorry
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The buzz from around the country over Boston College's near
upset of Notre Dame centered around the play selection in the final
series.  &UR; Mike Cloud &LR; . Mike Cloud. Mike Cloud. Just as the Eagles
did in their failed drive against Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Tom O'Brien  &LR; justifiably went with his best back. But it
could be argued that when a team is 3-5 and not expected to win,
one might take chances by throwing the ball, rolling out, or using
play-action, which would at least make the defense react.
</P>
<P>
   BC played it safe and lost, 31-26, which for the Eagles is
unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Big problems
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a shock: Syracuse lost a big game. When are the Orangemen
going to win a game when something is on the line? Saturday's loss
to West Virginia was almost predictable, not because West Virginia
was better but because West Virginia played better in a game it had
to win ... Say what you want about the softness of Wisconsin's
schedule, but the Badgers are taking care of business with a great
defense, which makes them dangerous. Saturday's 26-7 win over
Minnesota gives Wisconsin its best start in 97 years and basically
makes the winner of this week's game against Michigan the Big Ten's
Rose Bowl front-runner ... There's little question as to which the
best service academy team is this season. Air Force, the only team
in Division 1-A to score more than 30 points in every game, has
beaten Army and Navy, outscoring them by an 84-14 margin ... The
Southeastern Conference West is a mess. Arkansas and Mississippi
State are the only teams with fewer than three league losses ...
Pass defense has become an oxymoron at Washington. After Oregon
quarterback  &UR; Akili Smith  &LR; blitzed the Huskies for 442 yards in
Saturday's 27-22 victory, the total passing yards given up by the
Huskies in the last three games was a staggering 1,292 ... With
only UCLA and Washington State remaining, Washington is in danger
of its first losing season since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Hookup 'Horns

</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State showed that you can stop Texas running back
 &UR; Ricky Williams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; limiting him to 90 yards rushing, 114 below his
average. But the Longhorns, who are a solid 7-2, showed they can
beat you in another way, as quarterback  &UR; Major Applewhite  &LR; threw
for 408 yards and three touchdowns, one to Williams, in Texas's
37-34 win ... The bowl game we would love to see is UCLA vs. Notre
Dame. Considering the less-than-dazzling method with which both
teams have won games this year, such a meeting could go on forever.
Lowly Oregon State, which is now saddled with its 28th consecutive
losing season, had the Bruins all but beat half a dozen times
Saturday before UCLA came up with a wild 41-34 victory in the last
30 seconds ... Congratulations to Curry College and coach  &UR; Steve
Nelson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who has taken a team coming off a winless season and
turned it into a six-win team.

IMPEACHMENT PRECEDENT TO CONSULT: NIXON IN 1974 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the sixth day of the House Judiciary Committee's
impeachment debate during the summer of 1974, the weight of the
committee's task seemed to have sunk into its members' bones like
the fetid Washington humidity.
</P>
<P>
   They had already voted out three articles of impeachment against
President Richard M. Nixon. This extra exercise, assessing whether
Nixon should be removed from office for deliberately backdating a
huge and dubious tax deduction, seemed gratuitous to some,
including a peevish Trent Lott, who snapped, ``You may not like it,
but do you impeach a president for mere negligence in filing
personal income taxes?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this debate, more punchy and angry than the solemn ones that
preceded it, could light a path that will lift the veil of
impeachment from another president, Bill Clinton. It turned on two
key legal issues facing the current Judiciary Committee: whether
the president must be impeached for breaking the law _ in Nixon's
case, the tax code _ and whether such a violation must bear on his
official, rather than personal, conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hear Monday from
constitutional specialists and to consider legal memos from its
members on what standards should be applied to Clinton. Many are
expected to draw on the one true precedent to this year's
impeachment effort: the '74 hearings.
</P>
<P>
   A Globe review of the transcripts and staff documents from the
Nixon impeachment battle reveals substantial evidence from both the
then-majority Democrats and the then-minority Republicans that
Clinton's most frequently cited offense, perjury, would not merit
impeachment under the '74 standards.
</P>
<P>
   The constitutional standard of impeachment _ ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' _ is subject to multiple interpretations, and
critics of Clinton have long contended that a criminal violation by
a president merits removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1974, when a committee dominated by political opponents
of the president was called upon to set specific standards, it
pointedly rejected the notion that a violation of the law
automatically triggered impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The principal purpose of impeachment, the '74 committee decided,
was to remedy ``grave misconduct that so injures our constitutional
institutions and form of government as to justify impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The general applicability of the criminal law also makes it
inappropriate as a standard for a process applicable to a highly
specific situation such as removal of a president,'' asserted the
committee's majority report on standards of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the committee voted, impeachment should be limited to
a president's abuse of his official powers: ``In an impeachment
proceeding a president is called to account for abusing powers that
only a president possesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The minority report, prepared by the Republican staff for
members sympathetic to Nixon and reluctant to remove him from
office, suggested not only that Congress is not obliged to vote for
impeachment over an apparent criminal violation, but must exercise
``prosecutorial discretion'' and pursue only those offenses that
jeopardize the government. Even then, the Republicans contended,
Congress retains the power to ``waive or pardon'' the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports set the stage for the '74 committee's bruising
debate over the articles of impeachment, conducted at first behind
closed doors and later in the full glare of television. Three
articles eventually emerged: one charging that Nixon personally
engineered the Watergate coverup, including the payment of hush
money; a second accusing the president of ordering the FBI and CIA
to investigate his political enemies; and a third citing his
refusal to respond to congressional subpoenas. A proposed article
dealing with the secret bombing of Cambodia was rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the last proposed article, tied to Nixon's taxes,
that is most analogous to Clinton's alleged perjury. Just as
today's members must debate whether an offense arising from a
private lawsuit justifies impeachment, the '74 committee sifted the
arguments for removing Nixon over a serious tax violation.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Nixon's taxes had raised political hackles earlier
in the year: Nixon, seeking to reduce his tax burden almost to
nothing, tried to deduct hundreds of thousands of dollars for
donating a cache of official papers to a university. It was a
questionable tactic, but one that had allegedly been recommended to
him by his predecessor, Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Additional questions arose, however, when it was alleged that
the papers had not actually been given away before the tax
deadline, and that Nixon had knowingly fudged the date. It was one
of a string of questionable deductions claimed by Nixon, including
trying to write off the upkeep of his private vacation homes. In
all, Congress determined that Nixon underpaid his taxes by $432,000
plus interest.
</P>
<P>
   To partisan Democrats, like the populist Jack Brooks of Texas,
this seemed like an offense that struck home to millions of
Americans laboring under their own tax burdens.
</P>
<P>
   ``No man in America can be above the law,'' declared Brooks, a
personal friend of LBJ. ``It is our duty to establish now that
evidence of specific statutory crimes and constitutional violations
by the president of the United States will subject all presidents
now and in the future to impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet committee members quickly jumped on Brooks _ and the
critics, for the first time, included substantial numbers of the
heretofore unified Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Hogan of Maryland, a lawyerly Republican who had broken
with Nixon earlier, declared that the tax offense was improper
grist for the committee because it related to Nixon's private
affairs. Hogan quoted from the committee's report: ``As a technical
term, high crime signified a crime against the system of
government, not merely a serious crime. This element of injury to
the commonwealth, that is, to the state itself and to the
Constitution, was historically the criteria for distinguishing a
high crime or misdemeanor from an ordinary one.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiley Mayne, a Republican from Iowa, whose narrow margin of
victory left him vulnerable to the anti-Nixon backlash, nonetheless
stood by the president: ``Even if criminal fraud had been proved,
and I think it clearly is not, then we would still have the
question of whether it is a high crime or misdemeanor sufficient to
impeach under the Constitution ... I certainly do not believe that
Madison and the framers of the Constitution had in mind any such
recital as we are hearing tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, many Democrats agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In a line that might have been scripted by one of Clinton's
defenders, Jerome R. Waldie of California _ a staunch Nixon
opponent _ nonetheless declared that impeachment must be reserved
for ``cases where there has been an enormous abuse'' of purely
presidential powers _ and the tax matter did not fit.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Owens of Utah, a former aide to the Kennedy brothers, also
decided that Nixon's alleged tax crimes were too minor: ``You don't
impeach for every offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Ray Thornton of Arkansas declared that an impeachment
inquiry ``is not a tax court or a criminal court nor should it
endeavor to become one.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee voted 26-12 against approving an article of
impeachment based on Nixon's alleged tax offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the '74 Judiciary Committee remain in Congress.
Lott is Senate majority leader. And one, William Cohen of Maine,
even serves in Clinton's Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Most, including Hogan, Thornton, Waldie, and Owens, are long
forgotten in political circles, but this week, at least, their
words will ring forth like those of Madison, Hamilton, and
Jefferson _ in the mouths of Clinton's defenders.

GUNS PROVE TO BE A LOADED ISSUE DURING ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Like abortion and gay rights, guns are fast
becoming a wedge issue in electoral politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 campaigns, particularly on the East and West Coasts,
opposition to gun control was used in TV attack ads and even became
a litmus test for character in some of the most hotly contested
statewide races across the nation, political observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the fate of the ``Dangerous Dozen,'' a group identified
at the start of the campaign season by Sarah and Jim Brady as
hard-core gun-rights supporters. All were subject to attacks for
opposing measures such as the Brady bill and the assault-weapons
ban, and all but one lost his or her race.
</P>
<P>
   The group included Republican Senators Lauch Faircloth of North
Carolina and Alfonse D'Amato of New York, and gubernatorial
candidates Democratic Representative Glenn Poshard of Illinois,
California Republican Dan Lungren and Maryland Republican Ellen
Sauerbrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that guns are the number one issue in any race, but
that guns have become a baseline issue for winning candidates,''
said Robert Spitzer, author of ``The Politics of Gun Control.''
``What we're seeing is part of a long-term shift, where the
demographic base of support for guns is slowly disappearing, except
in the rural South and Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates read these losses as a sign that the tide
may be turning in their favor, particularly in statewide elections
where urban and suburban voters often outweigh rural voters. In
contrast, a wave of politicians friendly to the National Rifle
Association swept into Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA, however, disputes the notion that support for gun
control is growing at the expense of gun rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pretty much where we were before. ... But at the state
level, I can find a lot of pluses,'' said NRA Executive Vice
President Wayne LaPierre. He pointed to two such victories _ one on
a referendum in Wisconsin on the right to bear and keep arms, the
other in gubernatorial races in a half-dozen states where winning
candidates ran on the issue of the right to carry a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer, however, said that support for the right to carry a
weapon or bear arms is not about gun control, but rather a matter
of freedom, choice, or crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right-to-carry laws, for instance, are pitched to citizens who
feel vulnerable to crime and want a gun as a deterrent, but they do
not necessarily contradict the general desire for stronger gun
laws,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although the House and the Senate are still controlled by
gun-rights forces, gun-control advocates say the results of
Tuesday's elections have given them a huge boost, particularly with
the election to the Senate of the nation's most outspoken advocate,
Representative Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a trend that will prevent the NRA
from going into certain states,'' said Kristin Rand, director of
federal issues for the Violence Policy Center, a Washington group
fighting for stricter gun laws. ``Psychologically, the way the
election played out was helpful to us, particularly because
everyone considers California a bellwether state.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates in both parties used guns as never before to stake
out a moderate posture, by painting their opponents as extremists
for failing to support gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Guns were prominent in so many races that Handgun Control, the
group headed by Sarah Brady, decided there was no need to fund ads
in tight races involving gun-rights opponents, unlike 1996, when
the group spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In race after race, in key battlegrounds, people took to the
airwaves to talk about gun control,'' said Bob Walker of Handgun
Control's Voter Education Fund.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democratic Governor-elect Gray Davis and Senator
Barbara Boxer pounded their opponents for not supporting
gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Schumer criticized D'Amato for opposing the
assault-weapons ban, just as Maryland's Democratic Governor Parris
Glendening did against Sauerbrey.
</P>
<P>
   And in Illinois, gun control played big in the gubernatorial and
Senate races and illustrated that this is a bipartisan issue.
Republican Governor-elect George Ryan launched a relentless attack
on Poshard's pro-gun position, said Tom Smith of the National
Opinion Research Center, a polling group at the University of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Using the same tactic, although without winning, Illinois
Senator Carol Moseley-Braun played her opponent's opposition to gun
control and abortion rights to help her close the gap in a race
that observers say otherwise would have been a resounding defeat
for her.

IT'S NOT EASY BEING LEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is for The Skinny People. You know who you are, you
toothpick-slender types who are perfectly healthy but who often are
greeted by the question, ``Lost weight?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Feeling OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Been sick?''
</P>
<P>
   It's for anyone who might have been a pudgy baby but who has
competed in the paperweight class since first grade, has endured
the wisecracks (``. . . vanishes when he turns sideways''), has
heard all the nicknames (``Spindleshanks,'' ``Pipe Cleaner'') and
has experienced the cruel rejections (like when the Bloodmobile
people assumed someone so thin couldn't possibly spare a pint).
</P>
<P>
   Some friends have recently said: ``You're the TV guy. Why not
pursue the Calista Flockhart-is-wasting-away story?''
</P>
<P>
   The easy answer is that Flockhart's waist is nobody's business.
She's a thin person who seems to have gotten thinner. It happens.
</P>
<P>
   To recap: Flockhart, the star of Fox's Monday night hit, ``Ally
McBeal,'' was photographed at the Emmy Awards in September wearing
a sleeveless, backless gown that had some observers saying ``wow,''
but not for the usual reasons. Hardly the fleshy, curvaceous sort
who could have sat for Rubens, the spindly Flockhart looked instead
as if she should have sat down to a platter of Reubens. And a side
of fries. And a shake.
</P>
<P>
   So do I, for that matter. But not being one who regularly
ventures out in sleeveless, backless evening wear (I get cold
easily), I so far have escaped the concern of those who might treat
me for an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart wasn't so lucky. The buzz in Hollywood began
immediately after the Emmys, mainly because Flockhart looked leaner
than she did at the Golden Globes several months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   What on earth was the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the problem was lousy journalism. Not because someone
snapped Flockhart's picture. No problem there. She was fair game
and certainly wasn't trying to hide from the media.
</P>
<P>
   But, in short order, the ugly rumors began to fly, first on the
Internet and then in the so-called ``mainstream'' media.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, you can be too thin. You can also be too nosy. A TV
station in New York eventually reported breathlessly _ and
erroneously _ that production of ``Ally McBeal'' was shutting down
because Flockhart had checked into a clinic.
</P>
<P>
   It was _ and is _ the sort of gossip we all love to spread. Was
she ill? Was she nuts? Was Hollywood forcing her to have
unrealistic expectations of how she should look? Traditionally
speaking, it was perfect fodder for the ``tabloids,'' which revel
in fantastic scenarios that play fast and loose with the truth. And
it was stuff that ``serious'' journalists would pay no attention
to, because speculation simply isn't journalism.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. Some serious journals jumped on the story because,
with the advent of Internet-generated ``news,'' there now seems to
be a dearth of editors with the courage to say, ``Wait a minute.
This isn't news. It's gossip, and we don't report gossip.''
</P>
<P>
   Flockhart, a stage actress well-regarded in New York but largely
unknown to TV audiences until last year, is only the latest victim
of this rush to bad (or no) judgment in newsrooms across the
country. Newspapers and, to some extent, TV stations used to call
the tune when it came to deciding what's news. Now they're often at
the tail end of the dance line, following ``stories'' that got
their start in someone's fertile (febrile?) mind and grew bigger
with each visit to an Internet chat room.
</P>
<P>
   With millions of people already chatting, some editors at
``respected'' institutions figure they'd better board the bus so as
not to seem too out of touch.
</P>
<P>
   I like to call it institutional insecurity, and it's
particularly virulent at TV stations whose newscasts are run by
people from the ``Entertainment Tonight'' school of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers are guilty, too. I'm proud that this one has seen fit
not to enter the Guess Calista's Weight sweepstakes, but there are
plenty of others that have decided her lack of heft is somehow
newsworthy.
</P>
<P>
   So, anyone looking for the full-meal McBeal deal should look
elsewhere today. This is nothing more than a defense of Flockhart's
privacy and a declaration that, for some people, it's perfectly OK
to be thin.
</P>
<P>
   It's sad that Flockhart felt compelled to divulge her daily diet
to People magazine last week, but she probably decided she had
little choice. After radio stations began spreading the report that
she had checked into a clinic, the bad journalism was on a flaky
roll. It was Flockhart's turn to respond to the classic
when-did-you-stop-beating-your-dog type of question. Keep mum, and
she's presumed to be hiding something; deny the rumor, and she's
presumed to be hiding something.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, we skinny people don't have a lot of wiggle room when
it comes to weight loss. Still, our thinness may imply nothing more
sinister than a spunky metabolism and a genetic predisposition to
burn fat. And even when it does indicate something serious, such as
a digestive problem or an eating disorder, is it really a matter
for public speculation?
</P>
<P>
   We're a people obsessed with appearance, but, trust me on this:
Not everyone is trying to look like Calvin Klein's waif of the
moment. Some of us just happen to be skinny, no matter how many
slices of double-cheese pepperoni pizza we're inclined to wolf. We
have stiletto elbows that can cut diamonds, knobby knees that enter
a room several seconds before the rest of us. Our double-A heels
don't do well in loafers. Our bony wrists never met a watch that
didn't flop around.
</P>
<P>
   What's dumb _ and unhealthy _ is that some people who aren't
naturally thin are trying to be thin. That's lunacy. But blaming
Calista Flockhart for it, or suggesting that she has some global
responsibility to fatten up so others won't be inclined to emulate
her, is lunacy a la mode.
</P>
<P>
   This probably betrays my journalistic credentials, but I'm very
pleased when public people manage to keep their private lives
private. If they want to share their home lives with us, fine, but
I don't need to know who they're dating, hating or skating out on.
If they don't want us to know, I'm cool with it. Likewise, I'm not
interested in whether they're adhering to the precepts of the Food
Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, anorexia is serious. But where is it written that people in
the spotlight have an obligation to discuss their problems with the
masses? If Flockhart has a problem, I hope she gets help. But as a
string bean whose eating habits have been formed by 30 years of
deadlines that seem to fall right around lunchtime, I'm aware what
long hours and an irregular dietary regimen can do. Flockhart also
works in a business where good nutrition can fall prey to an
unforgiving schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible people are able to make the necessary adjustments.
Sensible people also know it's silly to get caught up in the lives
of TV stars. Those who don't are the ones with a problem.

THE NEW FACE OF REPUBLICANISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What a difference a day makes. On Monday, House Speaker Newt
Gingrich was telling associates that the GOP might gain as many as
15 seats in the House. Wednesday, Gingrich was scrambling to hold
onto his job, as angry Republican congressmen and party activists
schemed to throw him over.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott woke up Wednesday morning to
find many Republicans blaming him, by name, for the GOP's pathetic
performance on Election Day. Lott had killed any kind of tax cut
during the legislative session, fearing the president would recast
it as an assault on the Social Security system. His conversion was
immediate. ``The idea of an across-the-board tax rate cut could be
not only the fair thing to do for working Americans,'' Lott told
reporters Wednesday, ``it could be necessary to boost the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A day late and about $1,000 short,''said one midwestern
governor in disgust. Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska
told The Washington Post: ``You can't win elections if you have
nothing to say. We are the majority party, we need an agenda to
work from and that is tied to leadership _ whether it requires a
change in the leadership remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which the GOP insurrection broke out was
symptomatic of the deep disquiet among the rank and file about the
Washington faces of Republicanism. Lott, Gingrich, Armey, and Delay
stare out from the television set without a trace of empathy.
Starr, Tripp, and Goldberg have become almost ghoulish; stuck in
some political version of the movie ``Groundhog Day.'' Every night
is scandal night. Voters were as sick of them as they are about it.
</P>
<P>
   It was an article of faith within the Republican congressional
leadership that the combination of the Lewinsky scandal, possible
impeachment, historical precedent, and the new demographics of
prosperity would compel a Republican sweep in this year's mid-term
elections. If all that didn't work, it was believed, the GOP money
machine would simply buy victory in states like Wisconsin, North
Carolina, and New York.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, every distinction was blurred, every substantive
issue evaded for imagined political advantage. Don't build it, the
GOP argued, and they will come anyway. Standing for nothing except
the enhancement of their privileged circumstances, Republicans
regarded the electorate as supplicants instead of constituents and
were rightly slapped for the arrogance of their pose.
</P>
<P>
   At roughly 9 o'clock Eastern time on election night, the locus
of power in the Republican Party shifted to Austin, Texas. Governor
George W. Bush had by that time been thoroughly briefed on the
breadth of his electoral triumph. Not only had he defeated his
Democratic opponent by more than 1.5 million votes (the largest
margin in the history of Texas politics), he had captured half the
Hispanic vote and one-sixth of the African-American vote as well.
The scope of Bush's victory left seasoned professionals in awe.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just that. It was that almost all of his allies
had won as well. Brother Jeb was now the governor of Florida.
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge was reelected in a landslide. New
York Governor George Pataki, who through channels has said that he
would only run for president if Bush didn't, triumphed as the rest
of his ticket perished. Michigan Governor John Engler slaughtered
his opponent and let it be known that his next campaign would be
Bush's presidential run. Everywhere you turned Tuesday night, the
cards kept turning up with George W. Bush's face on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is the face that GOP activists, reeling from Tuesday's
disaster, now demand become the face of their party. It's not just
that he has solid conservative credentials and the inclination to
include. It's not just that he carries forward the brand name his
father did so much to burnish and inherits the network of his
family?s national connections. It's not just that has, on file,
18,000 names of $1,000 contributors (and from his brother Jeb, the
names of 5,000 more) who can bank $23 million with a single mailing
and a few thousand follow-up phone calls. And it's not just that he
has his father's iron discipline and his mother's easy charm.
</P>
<P>
   Buried deep within the national Election Day Voter Poll
conducted by the Voter News Service was a question about the year
2000 presidential election. It asked a sample of voters virtually
identical to the 1996 electorate which presidential candidate they
would support, Bush or Gore. Fifty-one percent said Bush, 39
percent said Gore. Those numbers, more than anything else, tell the
story of the next 18 months of GOP politics.
</P>
<P>
   It might be argued that I take this view because, by a happy
accident of birth, the brothers Bush are my first cousins. I don't
think so. Roger Ailes, the legendary GOP political consultant who
now runs the Fox News Channel, surveyed the situation late Tuesday
night: ``Big night for the family,'' he said. ``The old man's back
on top.'' What he meant was that the eldest son is rising.

CELLUCCI, UNFAZED, SETS OUT ON A SEA OF DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Now for the hard part.
</P>
<P>
   After a tough campaign, Paul Cellucci has won the corner office
in his own right. But as the new governor formulates his agenda, he
looks down the corridor on some daunting odds.
</P>
<P>
   In the 160-member House, the ragtag Republican band numbers only
28.
</P>
<P>
   In the 40-member Senate, the GOP counts a scant seven senators,
nine fewer than William F. Weld had upon taking office in 1991, and
half the number needed to uphold a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's no longer an accidental governor, Cellucci hopes
to cut taxes further, follow through on education reform, reinstate
the death penalty _ and rebuild his tattered party.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his lack of legislative support _ or coattails _ he
thinks his 50.8 to 47.4 percent win gives him a mandate, even on
controversial issues such as capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a bigger percentage win than Bill Weld and I got in
1990,'' Cellucci said in an interview with the Globe last week.
``We had a mandate then and I believe I have a mandate now.''
</P>
<P>
   But the legislative leadership clearly sees things differently.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Friday how he thought Cellucci would fare as governor,
Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham replied: ``I think the
question is the same as it is with the Patriots this Sunday: Which
one shows up?''
</P>
<P>
   In Birmingham's view, candidate Cellucci embraced goals that may
well prove mutually exclusive. ``On the one hand, he seemed to be
the world champion tax-cutter; on the other hand, he wants to be
the greatest friend in the country to the kids in our public
schools,'' the Senate president said. ``I am not sure both of those
priorities are going to be sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of doubt doesn't seem to faze Cellucci, who noted
several times last week that the legislative leadership was
skeptical last year as well, when he first called for a tax cut of
about $1.5 billion. In the end, though the details were
significantly different from his plan, the tax cuts the Legislature
passed were worth about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran has made it clear he's
skeptical the state can afford another large tax cut. Further,
Finneran has indicated he won't go any further toward helping the
Patriots with a stadium, another Cellucci priority, and has
signaled he's prepared to do battle to keep the death penalty off
the books.
</P>
<P>
   That means the new governor will have to practice some serious
persuasion to move his priorities forward.
</P>
<P>
   And given the GOP's slim numbers in the Legislature, Brian Lees
of East Longmeadow, Senate Republican leader, says that for
Cellucci to succeed, he'll have to be ready to compromise with the
Democratic Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, you have to reach out and you can't
alienate the leadership,'' said Lees.
</P>
<P>
   That's all the more true since Cellucci lacks an enforceable
veto, a key weapon for Weld in his first two years.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Cellucci is that this is not 1991, when
Governor Weld started off on rocky footing with legislative leaders
he had disparaged on the campaign trail. It wasn't until late
spring, after several bruising battles and months of heated
rhetoric, that Weld finally started to develop a decent working
relationship with top Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Despite issue differences, Cellucci is on cordial terms with
both Finneran and Birmingham. In his 15 months as acting governor,
he worked patiently as an insider, with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly brokered an agreement to reduce the unemployment
insurance levy businesses pay, pushed for and got an electricity
deregulation bill, signed an assault weapons ban and a brownfield
bill to expedite the redevelopment of polluted urban areas, and won
$1 billion in tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those were issues in which the Democratic
legislative leadership shared Cellucci's priorities. On issues
where there was more strenuous disagreement, the acting governor
saw some of his priorities stall.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's election results were hardly counted before Finneran
had poured cold water on Cellucci's hopes for further tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an economy that is less than robust, something has to
give,'' Finneran said. ``You either slow the pace of reform or you
stabilize your tax base or cut taxes less aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham, too, makes it clear his priorities lie apart from
further tax-cutting, saying that even after the $1.7 billion
increase in education spending is fully phased in next year, yearly
increases of $100 million will still be required to assure adequate
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my first priority, and I will do everything, with
every fiber of my body, to see that that is achieved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others think Cellucci's penchant for playing the State House
insider could hurt his hopes to rebuild the Republican Party into a
viable force. They say the best way to elect Republicans is to have
a high-profile fight with Democrats on issues, and to take those
differences to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   That, essentially, is the path to power Newt Gingrich and the
congressional Republicans successfully pursued in 1994. It's the
course that Treasurer Joseph D. Malone advocated for the state GOP
in his own gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's a course Cellucci has little interest in pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I focus on results,'' he said. ``Once the election is over, it
is my job to work with whoever has been elected by the people of
this state to get some things done to benefit the people of
Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he and Weld had made essentially the same decision
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others were advising us to kind of have a scorched-earth
policy, beat up on the Democrats, and that would help us at the
polls in two years, and maybe it would have,'' he said. ``But I
believe our first obligation is to get things done for the people
of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   By any account, Weld and Cellucci had a successful first two
years. Still, in 1992, with Democratic presidential nominee Bill
Clinton running strong, the GOP took a drubbing in the state
Senate, losing seven seats _ and with those seats, the ability to
uphold a gubernatorial veto.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the reason for the Republican misfortunes in the
1990s may have been Weld's decision not to invest much energy in
the Republican State Committee. Lees thinks Cellucci will take a
much more active role.
</P>
<P>
   One other prominent Republican also predicts Cellucci will do
better than Weld at improving GOP fortunes: Weld himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the recruiting and grass-roots growth effort is
something Paul simply takes to much more naturally than I did,''
Weld said. ``Having started his political life as a member of the
Hudson Charter Commission and then a selectman and then a state
representative and then a senator, Paul is familiar with every rung
of the ladder. Having started as governor, I just wasn't as close
to the process.''

SCIENTIST'S HEAD IN THE CLOUDS _ TO RESEARCH THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a troubled youth on the streets of postwar London,
Peter Hobbs was taken aside by a member of the British weather
service and introduced to the wonders of clouds in the hope that it
might help curb his delinquent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It did. And Hobbs has kept his head in the clouds since.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Peter Hobbs, University of Washington atmospheric
scientist and director of the UW's world-renowned Cloud and Aerosol
Research Group, celebrated his team's latest achievement with the
dedication of a ``new'' research airplane at Paine Field in
Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The UW's latest airborne laboratory is a refurbished 40-year-old
Convair 580 turboprop, obtained through government surplus, fixed
up and outfitted with sophisticated equipment to intensively study
clouds, airborne particulates and many other important players in
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new to us anyway,'' Hobbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Husky One'' is the third plane for Hobbs' group, replacing a
Convair-131A. The first airplane obtained in 1970 was a World War
II Douglas B-23 formerly owned by Howard Hughes and now on display
at McChord Air Force Base in Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs' group of about 20 scientists is one of the world's
largest research crews focused on clouds and aerosols, tiny
particles that can remain suspended in air for long periods.
Aerosols come from sources such as fires, pollution, dust storms
and volcanos.
</P>
<P>
   Among the UW group's accomplishments was the first demonstration
of the effectiveness of color Doppler radar for tracking rainfall _
something weather forecasters now routinely use. The B-23 also flew
over the eruption of Mount Baker and, later, Mount St. Helens to
provide some of the first airborne studies of how volcanoes affect
the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The UW group has performed studies worldwide, including a flight
over the burning oil fields of Kuwait after the Gulf War in 1991
and a study of the global effect of smoke from the huge fires in
the Amazon Basin in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Western Washington might want to know why more rain
falls in some places. Hobbs' team has studied precipitation
patterns and the behavior of water in clouds _ from the microscopic
level to mega-storms _ to try to answer this deceptively simple
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter's work demonstrates the importance of making
observations and measurements in science,'' said Dr. Robert
Serafin, director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research
(NCAR) in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the difficulty and complexity of atmospheric science,
Serafin said, many researchers emphasize the use of computer models
and theoretical work. Hobbs, he said, stubbornly adheres to a more
direct method of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The UW is one of a few universities nowadays that operates its
own atmospheric research airplane. Most scientists who need
airborne research rent planes from NCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbs believes this situation, combined with the focus on models
and theories, bode ill for atmospheric science. ``For an increasing
number of students, as well as research and operational
meteorologists, `reality' has become a numerical model output,'' he
said in a journal article.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of the most interesting characteristics of the
atmosphere _ such as the ozone hole and lightning _ are not best
predicted or understood by models.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds still most interest Hobbs, of course. His ambitious
efforts to grow and maintain the UW's airborne lab all stem from
his teenage fascination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be on Earth if weren't for clouds,'' he said. Most
people recognize that life depends on water, but it is the cycle of
water driven by clouds and the atmosphere that really fuels life.

   Hobbs, who joined the UW in 1963 intending to stay two years,
ended up staying put to develop his own cloud physics program. As a
teenager in London, he attended university lectures to find
scientists who could tell him what he wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled attending one lecture, ``Clouds, Rain and
Rainmaking.'' Hobbs approached the speaker and asked to join the
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to go away and get a degree in physics first,''
Hobbs said. So he did, spending years with his head in books until
earning a doctorate in cloud physics from the University of London.
He went back to the scientist and asked for a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't remember me, but he gave me a fellowship anyway,''
Hobbs said.
</P>
<P>
   Given his love of clouds, Seattle was a logical place to move
for postgraduate work. At the time, many universities and
government labs launched aircraft for atmospheric research. Hobbs
was offered a chance to start such a program at the UW.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the culmination of a long-held dream by Peter,'' said
Dr. Alvin Kwiram, UW vice provost for research, speaking at last
week's dedication. But Hobbs' lofty goal has been realized and
sustained not so much by dreaming as by his tenacity and successful
efforts to show the scientific value of conducting extensive
airborne atmospheric research, Kwiram said. He credited Hobbs for
his ``entrepreneurial'' talent at securing the funds and expertise
to fix up and equip an older plane for cutting-edge research.
</P>
<P>
   About $1.5 million was spent on the Convair 580, with money from
NASA, the National Science Foundation and the UW. B.F. Goodrich
donated paint for the plane, with a twin stripe in Husky colors.
The Boeing Co. also provided equipment and expertise.

DEMOCRATS COULDN'T DELIVER LOYALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts and California had two things in common for last
week's election: a strong, active organized labor force and a
viable Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But California had one thing that Massachusetts did not: a
unified Democratic Party that strongly supported its candidate.
That, apparently, made the difference. Lieutenant Governor Gray
Davis was elected governor in California, and Attorney General
Scott Harshbarger lost in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor in California can be credited for much of
Davis's election-night strength, just as organized labor here,
especially the AFL-CIO, was largely responsible for giving
Harshbarger the surge that made the final count so close. Even
members of the media were impressed with the way labor's massive
phone banks delivered the message on behalf of Harshbarger to
hundreds of thousands of households across the state.
</P>
<P>
   But while some key Democrats, such as US Senators Edward M.
Kennedy and John F. Kerry, actively campaigned for Harshbarger, too
many others decided to look away.
</P>
<P>
   Take the reluctant manner in which House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran and Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino endorsed Harshbarger.
Finneran barely lifted a finger on his behalf. Menino, according to
some Harshbarger supporters, did not have any of his troops out
actively campaigning for the Democratic candidate. In fact, one
Harshbarger strategist saw two of Menino's workers carrying
Cellucci signs in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Although Harshbarger won Boston by 25,000 votes and also won
cities such as Worcester, Fall River, and New Bedford, his margins
were very small for a Democrat. With a little more help from local
Democrats, including Menino, he could have won Boston by the same
margin that Kerry did two years ago _ 65,000 votes. Harshbarger
lost the election by 65,000 votes. If he had carried just those
three other overwhelmingly Democratic communities by the same
margin Kerry did, Harshbarger would have won the election.
</P>
<P>
   Add to his problems the hollow endorsements of US Representative
Joseph P. Kennedy II, who dropped out of the gubernatorial race
earlier in the year, and US Representative Martin Meehan, who also
considered a run for governor this year. Although verbally
expressing their support for Harshbarger, Kennedy and Meehan were
virtually invisible when it came time to to actively campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, Secretary of State William Galvin should be
added to the list of non-helpers. While Galvin, by virtue of his
office, can say his role was limited to being an objective election
observer, others note that he is, after all, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of support for the Democratic nominee can be traced to
a problem within the state party that apparently is not as
pervasive among California Democrats _ jealously.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, pundits wrote and voters read reports
of how Democratic insiders did not like Harshbarger because he was
not one of them. Moreover, he was disliked because he had
prosecuted some Democrats that were among, or friends of, these
insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Usually when a large political prize such as the governor's seat
is at issue, most party loyalists can put aside their small
differences and unite for the greater good of victory. But that did
not happen this year for reasons that had nothing to do with
Harshbarger's lack of charisma or the first debate performance.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason was that too many key Democrats simply did not
want Harshbarger to win. And their motivation may be simply that
they, themselves, appear to have aspirations to be governor.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, although he dropped out of the sweepstakes this year,
still is expected to consider another run in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan, who considered a bid this year but apparently decided
that the time was not right, probably will again consider running
in four years.
</P>
<P>
   For Finneran, the governor's office appears to be a logical next
step after being House speaker.
</P>
<P>
   And Menino has to be at least contemplating it as a logical next
move _ as have many mayors before him _ especially after being the
first Boston mayor in recent history to run for reelection
unopposed.
</P>
<P>
   If these men are thinking ``governor'' in four years,
conventional wisdom suggests, they would prefer to challenge a
Republican in the final than a Democrat in the primary. In other
words, if Harshbarger had won last week, it is unlikely that any of
the current Democratic hopefuls would have taken him on four years
hence.
</P>
<P>
   While they may have had a common goal in helping to keep
Harshbarger out of the governor's office, none of these men have
anything else in common _ except, perhaps, their single ambition.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats can plan to compete against each other for the
nomination in 2002. The winner, ironically, will be looking for the
kind of party support that was withheld from Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Democrats here can be each other's own worst enemy.
They would rather give in to petty self-interest than unite to
elect a governor.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another price that may be paid for failing to unite
behind a winning Democratic nominee: the loss of Massachusetts as
the site for the next Democratic National Convention. The site
selection committee is less likely to pick a state with a
Republican governor _ despite Menino's sales pitch on Boston's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   If Los Angeles is chosen as the site of the 2000 convention,
Governor Davis can thank his state's Democratic Party for making it
possible. He can also thank a few key Democrats in Massachusetts
for making that choice a lot easier.

BLACK LAWYER MAKES A CASE FOR DEFENDING A KLANSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va._ David Baugh is a black lawyer with a
cross-burning Klansman for a client.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Black is an Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan with a
black man for a laywer.
</P>
<P>
   The Klansman won't allow the lawyer in his house, and the lawyer
doubts he'd ever shake hands with his client.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to hear them tell it, their working relationship is
unremarkable. They call it a triumph of a Klansman's colorblind
pragmatism _ no one doubts Baugh's legal skills _ and a lawyer's
colorblind passion for constitutional freedoms, including racist
speech by a client he calls evil.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Richmond, where Confederate president Jefferson
Davis lies buried just blocks from Baugh's office, and where old
wounds are passed down like heirlooms, not everyone sees it with
such cool detachment.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Virginia NAACP calls it an abomination, and a
black newspaper columnist has urged Baugh to quit the case.
Weighing in from Texas, a black lawyer who defended a Klansman
several years ago predicts ominously that Baugh will suffer for his
decision to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   The uproar began with Black's Aug. 15 arrest in rural
Hillsville, Va., under a rarely enforced 1960 state law. The US
Supreme Court struck down a similar St. Paul, Minn., ordinance in
1992 _ affirming First Amendment protections for not only speech
but also ``expressive conduct'' such as cross-burning. The Virginia
statute has remained untested.
</P>
<P>
   Black said the Klan rally was a private gathering of about 45
people. It ended with ``a cross-lighting ritual, like we do at
every meeting,'' to symbolically purify all those in attendance.
Had he known he faced arrest, Black said, he would have plugged in
a neon cross he uses when fire is impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Black faces up to five years in prison on the felony charge,
which next goes to court Friday for a preliminary hearing. That
date should mark the first meeting of Baugh and Black, who have
been dealing only by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh, a board member of the Virginia chapter of the American
Civil Liberties Union, volunteered to take the case, at no charge,
when no one else would represent Black. He isn't looking forward to
it, but he won't shy away.
</P>
<P>
   In a funky office in a residential Richmond neighborhood, Baugh
sits behind a desk with an explosion of papers and photos splayed
out before him. An old barber chair faces him (he sits there to
mellow out and listen to music), and a signed poster touting Hunter
Thompson for sheriff is propped in a corner. On the wall is a
framed greeting card from his wife, Joslyn, showing a hippo on a
diving board, looking down to a tiny bucket of water. The message:
``No guts, no glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Between swigs of Diet Coke, Baugh said his biggest concern is
that Black's case seems so winnable on constitutional grounds that
he is preparing doubly hard to make sure he isn't missing
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-burning is speech. This case is about the First
Amendment,'' said Baugh, 51, who resembles actor James Earl Jones,
down to the precise diction, the booming laugh, and the generous
girth. ``The Klan is a hate organization, and those people are
evil, evil people. But I don't have the right to gag them, and
neither does anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Baugh's estimation of who is evil does not stop
with Klansmen. ``The KKK hasn't had one-hundredth the negative
impact on constitutional rights, particularly rights of minorities,
as the existing members of the federal bench,'' he said, singling
out Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist for scorn.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh said the case gives him an opportunity to change
misperceptions about defense lawyers. ``When I defend a pedophile,
it doesn't mean I put on a raincoat afterward and run to the
playground,'' Baugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh came to Black's defense after a long record of challenging
authority, championing the Bill of Rights, and defending minority
rights. He was thrown out of college for a year for his role in a
civil rights protest. He later lost his job as a federal prosecutor
after questioning a judge over harsher sentences being given to
minority defendants. In his private practice, he has been jailed
for contempt after sharing some of his stronger opinions with
judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong advocate, and he takes his advocacy to the
wall,'' said his friend Jerry Zerkin, a fellow Richmond lawyer who
bails out Baugh whenever a contempt citation is issued.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh's hero is his father, Howard, now 78, a retired Air Force
colonel who flew 135 combat missions during World War II with the
storied, segregated Tuskegee Airmen. Baugh called his father, his
wife, and two daughters before taking Black's case. All gave their
assent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not defending this individual's ideology. He's not
helping the Klan so much as defending the Constitution,'' Howard
Baugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh said he had second thoughts only after hearing Black
explain his beliefs in an interview. ``It's easy for me to sit back
and say I defend the First Amendment. But when it breathes, when it
sweats, sometimes you think twice. There was some questioning on my
part,'' Baugh said.
</P>
<P>
   But that feeling passed, in part because Baugh believes he is
the best person to take the case. Baugh knows it would have been
more difficult for a white lawyer, out of concern that some would
wonder about the lawyer's hidden sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Black is thrilled to have this particular black
man representing him, though it has done nothing to change his
views, which are laced with racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got Mr. David Baugh as my attorney because he is a
professional, because he is a constitutional lawyer, and because he
is the most qualified,'' said Black, 50, a bounty hunter and
elected constable in Johnstown, Pa. In almost the next breath, he
added: ``I am not going to invite him to my home to break bread
with me because my Bible tells me that mixing leads to the
destruction of my race.''
</P>
<P>
   Black said he has suffered no backlash from fellow Klansmen:
``I'm the Imperial Wizard, and pretty much what I say goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Insisting he is a separatist, not a supremacist, Black then gave
a discourse on the Holocaust as fiction, how ``filthy Jews'' are to
blame for slavery, and how Africa remains home to naked cannibals
who, when sick, ``are going to some witch doctor with a bone in
their nose.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of statement that makes Salim Khalfani angry
that Baugh is Black's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks. It's really an abomination for someone like David
Baugh to represent someone in the KKK,'' said Khalfani, executive
director of the Virginia NAACP. ``Mr. Black should get someone of
his own ilk.''
</P>
<P>
   He was seconded by Michael Paul Williams, a black columnist for
the Richmond Times-Dispatch, who opposed Baugh's involvement under
a headline that called it an ``affront to ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh is not the first unlikely lawyer for a Klansman. Nearly 10
years ago, a Jewish lawyer in northern Virginia defended a KKK
member charged with violating a law forbidding adults from wearing
masks _ or hoods _ in public. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1993, Anthony Griffin, a black lawyer from Texas, was
fired as legal counsel to that state's NAACP when he defended a
Klansman for refusing to turn over his membership list. ``I know
this is going to hurt this man emotionally, financially,
professionally,'' Griffin said last week. ``But if you believe in
the Constitution, you have to stand in the breach and take that
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Baugh dismisses the warnings and the criticism. He is confident
that his reputation will protect him, and that criminals will still
seek him out. ``What, murderers are going to cop an attitude about
me defending a Klansman?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Baugh has no illusions about changing Black. ``We're never going
to be buddies,'' he said. ``He's not going to have any great
revelation and neither am I.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people want to get us on the Montel Williams show and
have a `Kumbaya' moment. That is not going to happen.''

IRONIC PAIRING: GINGRICH-SLAYERS AND GOP'S LEADERS-IN-WAITING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Maybe now, especially now, Newt Gingrich ought to
get in touch with Hillary Rodham Clinton and acknowledge to her
that there is indeed a right-wing conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that it would do Newt in instead of Mrs. Clinton's
husband is perhaps a touch anomalous, but that doesn't make the
conspiracy any less real.
</P>
<P>
   The exquisite irony is that the leading forces to replace
Gingrich in the comically dysfunctional House of Representatives
are directly in conflict with the forces on his right that made
Gingrich's continued tenure (at least to him) impossible.
</P>
<P>
   This point has been mostly lost in the tumult following
Gingrich's toss of the white towel on Friday, just hours after
threatening with some success to slice the legs off opponents he
bitterly assailed as cannibals and blackmailers. It could use some
elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of last week's Wake-up Call Election in the House
had been traditional grumbling for the first 48 hours. What changed
it was a move by a group of '94 freshmen on the far right that
Gingrich was absolutely correct in calling blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   The move _ the key players were movement conservatives Matt
Salmon of Arizona, Tom Coburn and Steve Largent (more about him
later) of Oklahoma, and David McIntosh of Indiana _ was a refusal
to vote for Gingrich as speaker next January.
</P>
<P>
   This group (at most fewer than twenty) did not have a prayer of
blocking Gingrich's renomination. The speakership, however, is a
constitutional office, requiring election by the entire House
membership; by vowing to vote ``present,'' the anti-Gingrich forces
could have blocked his election.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, by using all the powers of his office and party
position (and he had centralized most of them), Gingrich could have
bludgeoned the gang into submission. Ironically, by choosing to
quit, Gingrich may have blunted the true purpose of their
conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence begins with the front-runner by far for next
speaker, Appropriations Committee chairman Bob Livingston of
suburban New Orleans, an architect of two measures the true-blues
love to hate _ the gigantic highway construction bill and the
catchall $520 billion spending bill that provided the bookends for
this year's astonishingly poor performance.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that, pork and all, both bills were on balance worth
enacting. The highway bill will more than pay for itself from the
proceeds of a stronger economy, and the spending bill was the worst
legislation imaginable except for all the gridlocking alternatives
to it. But merits are less important than the fact that
conservatives were deeply disillusioned by these acts of
governance.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the irony. Bob Livingston is not only a good and
affable guy, as well as a tough one, but he also believes deeply in
the coalition politics that produces legislation. Livingston has
truly odd ideas, including notions that this is not a monolithic
society and that 30-second advertising messages, no matter how many
zillions of dollars are behind them, are no substitute for the
actual legislation and policies to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is very conservative, but with a difference, one
dramatically symbolized by his upcoming proposal to get Social
Security out of the federal budget so its current surpluses do not
mask the fact that the government continues to run an operating
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from being the right thing to do, the proposal is smart
conservative politics because it focuses attention on more
expenditures to cut, even if it lacks specifics.
</P>
<P>
   To put it mildly, the gang that got Gingrich will not quietly
settle for just that. Their ideological agenda has two points that
Livingston's probable ascendancy has not addressed _ massive tax
cuts and accompanying government-gutting, and renewed vigor on
social issue.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, their energies are directed toward Steve
Largent's campaign to unseat Gingrich holdover Dick Armey of Texas
as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   On a superficial level, Largent's candidacy should be rejected
because his post-election analogy was as side-splitting as it was
absurd. To liken the Republican Party in Congress to the Titanic
that has hit the iceberg, and then to demand a change in crew is,
to put it mildly, to miss the point.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Largent is Gingrich without political sense.
He was one of the 17 House members who voted against permitting the
government to reopen after the disastrous, planned train wreck of
late 1995. He is a total privatizer on Social Security, and he is
down-the-line Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   That is why this contest is far from settled and why it remains
possible for another entry, like Representative Jennifer Dunn of
Washington, to emerge. And any notion of a Livingston-Largent
``team'' is laughable.
</P>
<P>
   That is also why two other Gingrich holdovers _ majority whip
Tom Delay of Texas and John Boehner of Ohio _ are trying to keep
their jobs in exchange for support of Livingston, and under the
thrilling banner of ``Enough Change.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader point, though, is that Gingrich's departure and
Livingston's emergence mask a deep, unsettled turmoil that will
continue for weeks.

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A prime weapon in the war on drugs since the mid-1980s has been
mandatory minimum sentences that give judges no leeway in
determining how many years an offender should spend behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians love the mandatory minimum law because it conveys a
``tough on crime'' aura. Prosecutors love it because it gives them
more power, since they are the ones who decide whether to push for
the mandatory sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody loves the law. Its critics have always
asserted that the mandatory minimums, designed for big-time drug
dealers, are being unfairly applied to users having their first
run-in with the law. But in Massachusetts, no one knew exactly how
often _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   Figures obtained by the Globe show more than 84 percent of those
serving mandatory sentences on drug charges in Massachusetts are
first-time offenders in the state. For the most part, these are
drug users who are at the bottom of the supply chain. They are also
overwhelmingly Hispanic and black.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the big-time dealers are avoiding the lengthy
sentences that come with mandatory minimums because they have
information to trade with prosecutors, or money that is forfeited
upon their arrest _ which makes law enforcement look upon them more
kindly.
</P>
<P>
   The federal system _ which operates under its own mandatory
mimimum sentence law that took effect 12 years ago _ is similarly
filled with small-time offenders. A 1992 analysis, the most recent
available, found that 55 percent of all drug offenders were
classified as ``low level'' either street dealers or mules, and
only 11 percent were high-level dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sterling, a former congressional lawyer who wrote the
federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws in 1986, says he made a
big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the things I was involved in during my nine years on
the House Judiciary Committee, my role in the creation of mandatory
minimums was absolutely the worst, the most counterproductive, the
most unjust,'' says Sterling, now president of the Criminal Justice
Policy Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank financed in part by
Boston businessman Robert Lindell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of men and women are serving many years in prisons
unjustly as a consequence of these laws.''
</P>
<P>
   One such woman is Sylvia Foster, a former corrections officer in
Gainesville, Fla., now doing time at the federal prison in Danbury,
Conn. Foster, 34, and mother of two children, was sentenced 13
months ago to 24 years in prison for one count of conspiring to
distribute crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Foster had no prior record, a good
work history, and was a caring mother. Her boyfriend used her home
to cook and store crack cocaine. Foster testified that she did not
know about his manufacturing or dealing until she found some crack
in her house, confronted her boyfriend, told him to get it out of
her house, and broke up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Even the government prosecutor, Jerome Sanford, said at her
sentencing hearing, ``This is probably one of those ... sentencing
situations where I have the sense that the defense, the
prosecution, and the court wish that there might be greater
latitude in discretion for sentencing.''
</P>
<P>
   But under the guidelines and mandatory minimums, Foster had to
receive a sentence of 24 to 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the law point to the fact that overall crime rates
are dropping, and suggest that the threat of a long mandatory
minimum sentence is one of the reasons. But that drop may well have
more to do with community policing and demographics than with
locking up drug users and dealers. After all, drugs are still
plentiful and cheap despite a massive prison building boom here
(some 2,250 beds added since 1991) and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   A cottage industry of advocacy groups and think-tanks has sprung
up to fight mandatory minimums, including Families Against
Mandatory Minimums, which was founded in 1991. FAMM does not
advocate releasing people from jail, but rather wants to return to
judges the ability to look at a person's background and consider
extenuating circumstances before sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Judges want that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sat (before a) criminal (court) for 20 years and I have
never had a really top dealer before me,'' says Judge Robert Barton
of Massachusetts Superior Court. ``Invariably, they are street
dealers or mules.'' Barton _ who describes himself as being ``left
of the ayatollah, but that's about it'' _ says those convicted in
drug cases, ``end up taking up jail space, and most do more time
than those who commit crimes of violence against another person.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton adds: ``You get someone with a 15-year mandatory sentence
for drugs, and a second-degree murderer is eligible for parole in
15 years. There is a certain person convicted of manslaughter, who
happens to be in England'' _ a reference to Louise Woodward,
convicted in the death of a Newton infant she was caring for _
``who was sentenced to time served.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Chief Justice William Rehnquist has said mandatory minimums
are ``a good example of the law of unintended consequences''
because they ``impose unduly harsh punishment for first-time
offenders, particularly for mules who played only a minor role in a
drug distribution scheme.''

GROWING NEW HEART VESSELS SPURS BIG TRIALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The he human heart always strives to survive. When gunk and
scars clog its arteries due to a too-rich diet, insufficient
exercise, or unlucky genes, it responds valiantly by sprouting new
vessels that bring in blood from nearby unclogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually these new ``collateral'' vessels can no longer
compensate for atherosclerosis. That's when oxygen-starved heart
muscle sends the ominous pain signals called angina that often
foretell a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to Phillip Fletcher, a 48-year-old Kansas
businessman. ``I was a runner, and back in 1990 I was having
trouble completing 10-kilometer races,'' Fletcher says. Despite
coronary bypass surgery, his angina progressed to the point that
his wife has to schlepp his luggage through airports.
</P>
<P>
   For patients like Fletcher, specialists have long thought it
would be great if they could stimulate and amplify the growth of
new coronary blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   It's beginning to appear they can. Fletcher last week became the
17th patient to undergo experimental vessel-growing therapy in a
high-visibility trial at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston.
Encouraging results from this and other early experiments in the
United States and Europe are spurring a rash of large-scale,
controlled trials that will enroll hundreds of cardiac patients
over the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers discussed the latest evidence at a Dallas symposium
on Saturday sponsored by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and in
interviews last week. More findings will be forthcoming this week
at the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say skepticism is lessening,'' says Dr. Stephen G.
Ellis of Ohio State University. ``There are a lot of thoroughly
positive-looking results, although no one study is definitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis estimates that 75,000 to 300,000 US patients could benefit
from a therapy to grow new coronary vessels because they have
clogged arteries that cannot be bypassed surgically or opened with
angioplasty. Eventually it could be used in conjunction with bypass
or angioplasty, or even replace these procedures for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recent trials, like the one Fletcher is in, involve
injecting genes into heart muscle or coronary arteries in the hope
this will induce heart cells to secrete a blood vessel growth
factor. Others involve injecting the protein growth factors
themselves, rather than genes for them.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial strategy first tried in the 1980s _ using
lasers to drill channels through the heart wall _ is enjoying a
modest resurgence because of evidence that it may not work by
directly bringing blood to starved muscle but by inducing the
growth of new vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next wave of studies'' on the laser procedure, called
transmyocardial revascularization, ``is to use these channels as
repositories of blood vessel growth factors or genes,'' says Dr.
Steven N. Oesterle of Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A wide variety of large-scale human experiments in
``angiogenesis,'' as this blood vessel growth is called, are just
getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole area is moving very fast,'' says Dr. Michael Simons,
director of angiogenesis research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center in Boston. ``I think it's not an issue of whether these
things will work, but whom to give them to and how, what is the
best agent _ there will probably be more than one _ and what side
effects there are.''
</P>
<P>
   Simons and his colleagues have just finished two preliminary
trials involving a total of 90 patients. Two dozen patients got
infusions of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) protein during coronary
bypass surgery, to stimulate new vessel growth in areas where
bypasses couldn't help. Another 66 had FGF protein injected into
their coronary arteries with no other treatment.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Simons said, patients had improved exercise
capacity, reduced angina pain, and evidence of improved cardiac
blood flow. Since researchers did not compare patients who received
FGF with those who got a placebo, or inert substance, ``we have to
be careful with our interpretations,'' Simons said, ``but the data
look very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the Simons group expects to announce a more rigorous
placebo-controlled trial of FGF alone (without bypass surgery) in
300 patients at 20 medical centers.
</P>
<P>
   At New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Dr. Ronald G.
Crystal is trying a different approach: Injecting the gene for a
blood vessel growth promoter called VEGF (for vascular endothelial
growth factor) hooked to a disabled adenovirus, or cold virus. So
far he has performed the experiment on 15 patients who were also
getting coronary bypass surgery and another half-dozen who got gene
injections into the heart through a small chest incision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this works _ and it's still a big `if' _ I think it will
emerge as a major part of our armamentarium for treating coronary
artery disease,'' says Crystal, who will present results tonight in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey M. Isner of St. Elizabeth's runs the human
experiments that have received the most attention so far. This is
partly due to a widely reported study Isner unveiled a year ago
showing success in growing new blood vessels in patients with
painfully clogged leg arteries. It also has something to do with
the fact that Isner is not shy about his belief that angiogenesis
works.
</P>
<P>
   Of approximately 70 patients with leg arteries so obstructed
that they couldn't walk, had severe pain at rest, or had persistent
leg ulcers that often lead to amputation, Isner claims 75 percent
had ``total relief of rest pain or healing of ulcers'' following
injections of the VEGF gene. ``If patients present with rest pain,
100 percent have had relief,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning last February, Isner and his colleagues have injected
the VEGF gene into the heart muscle of 17 patients with disabling
angina pain who were beyond help from conventional bypass surgery
or angioplasty. Surgeons make a small incision in the chest of
patients to make four injections of fluid containing ``naked'' DNA
(without an attached virus) that directs cells to make the VEGF
growth factor protein.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 cardiac patients Isner has followed for at least three
months, six ``are now free of angina,'' he says. Only one of the 11
did not have significant lessening of angina.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas this past weekend, Isner showed results of
radionuclide scans _ pictures illustrating cardiac blood flow _
that he considers the most objective evidence that VEGF gene
therapy actually grows new coronary blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is still indirect, because the new vessels are too
tiny to show up on standard studies called angiograms, in which
cardiologists inject dye into coronary arteries to trace blood
flow. A main coronary artery is 2 to 3.5 millimeters in diameter,
about the size of a piece of spaghetti. Angiograms show vessels
down to 0.2 millimeters. But the new vessels produced by growth
factors are less than 0.18 millimeters _ smaller than the width of
a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Isner believes they are big enough, and plentiful
enough, to rescue oxygen-starved tissue and banish, or
significantly lessen, angina pain.
</P>
<P>
   He cites patients such as John Barlow, a 70-year-old Cape Cod
veteran of bypass operations dating back to 1982. Before VEGF genes
were injected into his ailing heart on March 17, Barlow couldn't
make it from his car to the shopping mall without popping a
nitroglycerin pill for chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a nitro in a couple of months or more,'' Barlow
says now. He spends 20 minutes at a time walking a 3 mile-an-hour
pace on a treadmill three or four times a week. ``I'm convinced
this has got to be the gene therapy,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Isner says that kind of before-and-after improvement is not
unusual among his cardiac gene therapy patients. ``When you see
that magnitude of improvement, it's very difficult to imagine this
could be a placebo effect,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others, even those who are enthusiastic about the prospects for
angiogenic therapy, disagree. ``As a cardiologist I know all too
well the kinds of influence psychological factors have on patients
who believe they're getting a therapy that works,'' says Dr. H.
Kirk Hammond of the University of California at San Diego, who is
running a controlled trial of FGF gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I acknowledge until we can do controlled trials, the critics
are entitled to their day,'' Isner counters. Those studies are
beginning, and soon researchers expect to use new catheters to
inject genes or growth factors, eliminating the need for surgery.
Most experts expect more definitive answers about coronary
angiogenesis within the next year or so.

TEACH ME! 
Kids Will Learn When Oppression Is the Lesson 
By Murray Levin 
Monthly Review Press, 152 pp., $23 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For 45 years, Murray Levin taught political theory at
Boston University, Stonehill College, and Harvard Extension School.
But in 1993, at age 70, he decided to explore a very different
educational terrain. He spent three years teaching history at the
Greater Egleston Community High School, an alternative school in
the city's Jamaica Plain neighborhood with a student body mostly
African American and Latino, students who had failed to learn at
mainstream schools.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Teach Me! Kids Will Learn When Oppression is
the Lesson,'' Levin chronicles his experience at the school he
refers to as ``a venue of last resort'' for the students whose
living environments present daily threats to learning.
</P>
<P>
   After months of frustration, Levin abandoned the textbook he had
thought his students would respond to: ``A People's History of the
United States,'' by fellow academic Howard Zinn. Students
considered it boring and refused to read it. Instead, he decided to
teach logic to students whose thinking was fragmented and
unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of textbooks, he used the study of the Cuban missile
crisis to discuss power struggles, uncertainty, and drawing wrong
conclusions that seem right. He dissected advertising and political
campaigns to show how they manipulate minds. He had students
role-play. He ate lunch with them and talked to them.
</P>
<P>
   The results were mixed. Students dropped in and out of his
class, sometimes showed up high or drunk, were unable to grasp the
significance of education in their lives, or were distracted by
abusive relationships or friends murdered in street violence.
</P>
<P>
   Levin says he intends the book to be ``an intellectual history,
an analysis of how black and Latino adolescents see the world ...
an account of their political and social theory, their perception,
their cognition, their despair and their attraction to
conspiratorial thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing this, he hopes to lay out a successful, unconventional
approach to teaching that will reach difficult students where they
live _ one that takes into account the conditions of poverty,
violence, drugs, and abuse that prevents them from learning by
traditional methods. It is a noble desire, and Levin explains
effectively why such an approach is needed. Unfortunately, his book
fails on many levels.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has taken a snapshot of a small group of black and Latino
students and used it to project a global image. These students so
hopelessly lost in despair and paralyzed by what they think the
white world is doing to them wrongly become representative of all
minority students living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book consists of verbatim accounts of students
talking about how they view politics, history, poverty, violence,
and the causes of despair in their lives. Often that cause is white
oppression. Often the quotations are rambling, profanity-filled,
laced with broken English.
</P>
<P>
   Levin does this no doubt to show the fragmented thinking process
of the students he dealt with over a three-year period and to
illustrate the challenge he faced as a teacher. But the result is a
book that's an unpleasant struggle to read. It is not always clear
which student is speaking; none of the voices is distinctive or
individual.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, Levin's insistence on interpreting what a
student has just said comes across as insulting. He wants to allow
the students to speak for themselves, but he assumes they cannot be
understood. And though he praises the students' writing ability and
even includes some of their poetry, he continually points out that
their comments in class are ridiculous, even paranoid _ they
believe white people are trying to destroy minorities; they
theorize that the government created the AIDS virus to kill blacks
and Latinos and is involved in the drug trade for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, given the years he devoted to the school, Levin cared
about the frustrating mission of trying to make education work for
urban kids so often left behind. But that caring doesn't translate.
Instead, he projects the cold detachment of a scientist viewing
specimens through a microscope. &UR;  &LR; ``Teach Me!'' has a Professor
'enry 'iggins in the 'hood feel. His time at the Egleston school
may have been an interesting experiment, for him and for his
students. But his report on the experiment is not a plan for
change.

WAITING FOR THE FUTURE TO PASS BY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``By the year 2000, housewives ... will probably
have a robot maid,'' an article in the New York Times predicted in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   Little did they know there wouldn't be housewives.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2000 ... rayon underwear will be bought by chemical
factories and converted into candy,'' Science Digest predicted in
1967.
</P>
<P>
   Little did they know we wouldn't wear rayon undies and we'd eat
Skittles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident that (in 2000) the Republican Party will pick a
nominee that will beat Bill Clinton,'' Dan Quayle said in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Little did we know that Dan Quayle is still trying to walk with
one foot in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   All these failed millennial predictions are in a little book
called ``Uncle John's Indispensable Guide to the Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was created by John Javna, a former dollhouse maker,
one-time street musician and home-publisher with his Bathroom
Reader's Press. Javna hit the big time and the top of the New York
Times best-seller list in 1989 with ``50 Simple Things You Can Do
To Save The Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Javna's millennium book took five years to compile. He started
before it was practical to do such research on the Internet. Hey,
that's the future for you.
</P>
<P>
   His little book includes every tidbit you need to know about the
millennium. It should do pretty well, but I hate to predict
anything. A week ago no one would have predicted apocalypse for the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People couldn't even predict the home computer, even in the
late '60s,'' Javna said when I called him at his home in Ashland,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I loved the best,'' Javna said, ``was this guy in
1950 who wrote an article in Popular Science about how all the
furniture in living rooms would be made of plastic, with a drain in
the middle of the room so you could hose it all down.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds good to me, especially since I never got a robot maid.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to mock failed predictions. Javna likes the ones that
came true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into this because 100 years ago there were
science-fiction writers who were predicting the future, and it
showed how far we've come. John Elsbeth Watkins predicted hot and
cold air spigots. They do exist, and now we have the joy of simply
turning on heat or air-conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Watkins wrote his millennium predictions in Ladies Home Journal
in 1900. He foresaw ready-cooked meals and ``cameras connected
electrically with screens at opposite ends of circuits, thousands
of miles at a span.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1888 best-seller ``Looking Backward,'' set in a Utopian
2000, Edward Bellamy not only predicted television, he predicted
golf on television. So it wasn't a perfect society. But he also
predicted no unemployment, no wars and no lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Bellamy missed almost as badly as Dan Quayle, but the last
century was a more hopeful time than the present, despite all the
advances we've made.
</P>
<P>
   As author Gail Collins wrote (as quoted in Javna's little book):
``Looking backward from Bellamy's future, the saddest thing is not
that we have failed to create the utopia he imagined, but that we
have stopped dreaming up utopias of our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, we dream up disasters. We have the year 2000 computer
problem, and UFO panics on the eve of the millennium. ``People are
approaching this with fear instead of thinking how cool it is to be
alive at this time when we've progressed by all these great
inventions,'' Javna says.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred years ago there were no antibiotics or electricity.
Maybe that's why people loved the future so much.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem? Forget it. ``We've been Y2Ked into submission
at this point,'' Javna says.
</P>
<P>
   Will the millennium bring apocalypse? Naah. Julius Caesar made
Jan. 1 the start of the year for no good reason. And our 2000 will
be 4698 in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much of what we regard as our foundations is arbitrary,''
Javna says. ``The reality is that there is no foundation holding us
up. We hold ourselves up.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't hit the millennium like Wile E. Coyote running off a
cliff and suddenly looking down. Instead, Javna says the turn of
the millennium offers us a unique observation point for looking
backward and forward.
</P>
<P>
   Most seers only predicted the future as far as 2000, so we'll be
out there having to make one up.
</P>
<P>
   Javna's book is a trivia book, but it's not trivial. Consider
the story of the most important influence on Americans' vision of
the future, the animated TV show ``The Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   The big question is: How come we don't zip around in little
Jetson flying cars? The answer is, we could have.
</P>
<P>
   The creators of ``The Jetsons,'' William Hanna and Joseph
Barbera, got the idea for the Jetsons' car from a magazine article
about inventor Paul Moller, who had invented a thing called the
Skycar. It flew, but never really flew because of the Federal
Aviation Administration and an $800,000 price tag.
</P>
<P>
   So you see, the present in 1962 influenced how we saw our
future. And the future also held weird nostalgia for ``The
Jetsons'' and a bad movie version.
</P>
<P>
   These are the things you can learn from a little book. You can
sit there in the bathroom thumbing through it and get a sense that
time is an arbitrary idea _ except, perhaps, for anyone who is
waiting to use the bathroom.

ARE MAINE'S GREAT WOODS ON THE CHOPPING BLOCK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For about what it cost to buy the Prudential Center in downtown
Boston, three companies purchased 10 percent of the state of Maine
over the last month, powerfully demonstrating the new fragility of
one of America's most enduring and famous forests, the North Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike more urban states that routinely turn to government to
protect prized natural resources, Maine has relied on private land
owners for generations to keep people from making permanent homes
in the forests that cover two-thirds of the state. But now, as
distant corporations buy and sell the woods like trading cards,
many worry that the old `timber baron' system is breaking down.
</P>
<P>
   In four head-spinning weeks, 2.5 million acres of the Maine
woods _ from the unspoiled shores of Moosehead Lake to the banks of
rivers where Henry David Thoreau once canoed to forests below
mile-high Mt. Katahdin _ were sold to private firms for $555
million. That's a bargain, considering the Prudential complex alone
sold for $546 million last summer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Along the way, one seller largely rebuffed an ambitious state
bid to protect thousands of acres that were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The new owners, Plum Creek Timber Co. of Seattle, J.D. Irving of
New Brunswick, and McDonald Investment Co. of Alabama, quickly
pledged to preserve the woods for loggers and outdoor enthusiasts
alike. But few believe this is business as usual: Plum Creek
markets remote lands for exclusive homes, and some believe that
this is the beginning, not the end, of the sale of the Maine woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has been caught unawares,'' said public policy
professor Richard Barringer of the University of Southern Maine,
noting that the state had only $3 million in its primary
land-purchasing fund when the forest sales started. ``And the
message has not been lost on the other (major land) owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining a growing chorus of environmentalists, editorial
writers, and Gov. Angus King, Barringer said the state needs a
large fund for land protection or it risks being left on the
sidelines as private land owners decide the fate of the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myth of the Maine woods is a very important part of the
consciousness of this state. Were it to get broken up, people would
be quite upset,'' said Barringer, who as state planning director in
the 1980s was instrumental in past land purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But ``public lands'' are fighting words in parts of Maine,
especially in rural areas where people make their living from the
woods. To many of them, public land is a place where logging is off
limits and park rangers limit their hunting, snowmobiling, and
other outdoor recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to really press strongly for no bond issue (for land
acquisition) because this is totally out of hand,'' said Mary Adams
of Garland, the state's leading property rights activist. ``The
environmentalists want (development limits) or outright ownership
of land, because, once it's in state hands, it's in
environmentalist hands. They control state policy.''
</P>
<P>
   While support for bonds to protect open space is almost like
kissing babies for Massachusetts politicians, sentiment is divided
in Maine. A statewide survey in early October found that 44 percent
of residents would vote for a $50 million bond to protect public
land, but 34 percent would oppose it. But, with Adams's history of
come-from-behind victories, public land supporters know they will
have a fight on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The massive land sales in Maine tap a deep fear among
environmentalists dating to the real estate boom of the 1980s, when
developers carved up tracts of forest across northern New England
to make way for condos, private estates or just to make a quick
buck. The 26 million acres of forest from Maine to eastern New York
is the largest tract of undeveloped land east of the Mississippi
River, and they worried that the so-called Northern Forest would
become a second-home market for affluent city dwellers just a few
hours' drive away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous man in the woods is not a man with a
chainsaw, but a man with a lawnmower,'' warned an editorial in the
Maine Times in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with a few exceptions, fears of development remain
unrealized. Maine economist Lloyd Irland estimates that only about
one to two percent of the Northern Forest will be subdivided for
development by the time the 1990s end, most of that on land held by
small-scale owners rather than by the big industrial land owners
who own most of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things the environmental community is talking about just
isn't happening. It's all hype,'' said Dan Corcoran, a forester at
Bowater Inc. paper company in Millinocket. ``You don't have miles
of shoreline development going on. If anything, we've established
conservation easements (that restrict development). We have better
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Northern Forest is in some ways more vulnerable today
than it was when the debate began. Despite much talk about
protecting the woods, government and private conservationists have
purchased or otherwise protected less than 1 percent of the forest
since 1990, leaving the vast majority of acreage unprotected and in
private hands.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, state officials have done little to acquire or buy
development rights on the 14.2 million acres of Northern Forest in
private hands, protecting just 898 acres through the Land for
Maine's Future program.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Northern Forest itself is a far less stable place
than it was just 15 years ago, as local land owners have been
replaced by multi-national corporations that have few ties to the
region.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Great Northern Paper was one of the most powerful
companies in the state in 1983, with 4,200 employees at its paper
mills in the Millinocket area and 9 percent of the state's land
area to its name. In those days, the chief executive lived in
Millinocket among his employees and boasted that the company's land
was its security for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Great Northern has been bought out twice, its
workforce has dropped to 1,700, and the current owner, South
Carolina-based Bowater, plans to close its antiquated Millinocket
mill if it can't find a buyer soon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bowater is using its once-sacred land to raise cash
after spending more than $800 million to buy Canadian and Korean
paper companies this year. First, the company sold a million acres
to Irving for $220 million, then, last week, it sold another
656,000 acres to McDonald for $155 million. In two weeks, Bowater
had dismembered Maine's biggest land empire.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup of these large tracts is precisely what
environmentalists fear, since it may open the door for developers
to break off hilltop, waterfront and other valuable parcels for
development, turning property purchased for $200 an acre into home
lots worth tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Irving and McDonald officials express little
interest in real estate. Irving, now the state's largest land
owner, has been more controversial for its logging practices, while
McDonald has hired highly regarded Wagner Forest Management of
Lyme, N &UR; . &LR; H &UR; . &LR; , to take care of its new land.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wagner chief executive Hank Swan said he wanted to work
out a plan with the state to sell development rights on key land
such as the West Branch of the Penobscot River, made famous by
Thoreau's writings on the Maine woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to invite a couple of conservation organizations to
provide us not only with technical expertise but also some ideas on
how we can develop a unified conservation protection plan,'' Swan
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Though conservationists were relieved at Swan's approach, many
Mainers were still shocked at the lightning speed with which the
Maine woods had been sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been used to having the ownership of these lands be
pretty static for long periods of time,'' explained Mark DesMueles,
director of the Land for Maine's Future program. ``This has been
sort of a healthy wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists were most alarmed at the October sale of a
million acres in the Moosehead Lake region belonging to South
Africa Pulp and Paper, or SAPPI, to pay off the debt the company
incurred buying a European paper company.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. King had proposed to preserve tens of thousands of acres,
getting upfront money from private groups, but SAPPI rejected most
of the offer, only agreeing to sell development rights on 1,908
acres along Moosehead Lake and other places.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, even though buyer Plum Creek has a resume that
includes substantial conservation work on its western lands,
conservationists were disturbed that the company does develop some
of its property. The company's web page, for instance, offers
lakefront land in Montana for development.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long will it be before Maine's special places are listed
on Plum Creek's website?'' asked Julie Wormser of the Wilderness
Society in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   King, a longtime public land supporter who was overwhelmingly
re-elected last week, is now making land protection a priority of
his second term, suggesting he might support a $45 million bond for
land, though others want $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to renew our ability to acquire, from willing sellers,
important conservation and recreational lands that may otherwise be
lost forever,'' he said in late October.
</P>
<P>
   But the debate is likely to be polarizing. Conservative
activists such as Adams oppose any land bond at all, while a
Massachusetts-based environmental group, RESTORE: The North Woods,
is pushing for a 3.2-million acre national park that would include
much of the former SAPPI and Bowater lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those situations (when) history moves in a
quantum leap ...like the Berlin Wall coming down,'' said Jym St.
Pierre of RESTORE, calling for the state to take bold action to
protect the forest.
</P>
<P>
   King administration officials acknowledge that the governor has
his work cut out for him, but they say the events of the fall may
have shocked Mainers into taking action, especially if King makes
it clear he doesn't want to create a big park.
</P>
<P>
   Senior King adviser Sue Bell said he will try to strike a
balance, preventing development while encouraging forest
industries. That won't please Adams or RESTORE, Bell concedes, but
``Maine's history has been an accommodation to various values in
the forest...It's been a place where people recreate as well as
work,'' and King wants that to continue.

THE GIANT KILLER BECOMES A GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRISTOPHER MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bloody demise of House Speaker Newt Gingrich
marks a wild reversal in the Capitol food chain.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich decapitated the Democratic leadership in the House
of Representatives in 1989, a freshly resigned Speaker Jim Wright
charged his executioner with ``mindless cannibalism.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the same man accused of devouring his way to power in
1995 accused party rebels of those very eating habits. ``They're
hateful,'' Gingrich said of the half-dozen young Republican
red-hots who threatened to deny him their votes for re-election as
speaker. ``They're cannibals!''
</P>
<P>
   With that word, the speaker of the House carved an epitaph for a
brand of flesh-eating politics that he _ more than anyone else _
created. No one who has watched his rise and fall would question
his or his defeated predecessor's choice of words: ``cannibalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich won and held the nation's highest legislative office
chewing on the bones of his rivals, championing the raw appetites
of his allies. In the end, he lost it the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine and a half years ago, Jim Wright, in his second term as
speaker, stood in the well (of the House) and decried what he
called the `mindless cannibalism' that had forced him to resign,''
recalled Mark Johnson, who was Wright's spokesman in 1989. ``He was
referring to the partisanship that had taken over the House that
had made everything a zero-sum game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Newt Gingrich say (Friday) in his conference call? He
referred to the `cannibals,''' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had caught and destroyed Wright for a book deal that
violated House ethics rules. Now he has been consumed by a long
series of embarrassments that climaxed last year with a formal
reprimand for his own ethics infractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The similarities between their tenures is unbelievable,''
Johnson noted with ironic satisfaction. ``They were both very
strong-willed, top-down leaders. They both had book deals that got
them in ethical trouble. And they both lost the support of their
caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Former California Rep. Tony Coelho, who as House Democratic whip
fought Gingrich in the 1980s, called Gingrich a victim of his own
take-no-prisoners brand of politics. While past leaderscould rely
on strong personal ties to other lawmakers to stay in power once
they got there, Gingrich depended entirely on his own ferociousness
rather than the comradeship of his political allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt had tremendous respect among his colleagues for his
intellectual skill and his strategic skill. He didn't have the
personal depth of relationship. When he got nicked, there was no
depth to go to,'' Coehlo said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrasting Gingrich with former Democratic House Speaker Thomas
``Tip'' O'Neill, who was a ``man of the House'' rather than an
ideologue, Coehlo noted, ``Tip didn't get respect for his strategic
ability. A lot of people really didn't like him. But a lot of
people would go through a fire for him. When he got in trouble, you
had people who went out and smelled it out and never permitted a
real fire to build.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gingrich's problem is that he brought this on himself,''
Johnson said. ``He created all this partisanship. He created the
cannibalism. In the end, his party decided that he got them the
majority, but there have been two elections in a row where they've
lost seats. He was never the best messenger, but he was a
visionary. That kept the Republicans together. He proved in this
last year that he lost that. So he had no redeeming quality. There
was no reason to keep him.''

Speaker Thomas O'Neill's from 1981 to 1987, is the Washington

WHY DO SOME SOUNDS MAKE DOGS HOWL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why does my dog howl and moan at the sound of a harmonica?
</P>
<P>
   J.T., Walpole, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Time to take those harmonica lessons you've been putting off,
J.T.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it has nothing to do with how well or poorly the
harmonica is being played. Dogs don't howl, as some think, because
a sound is hurting their ears. Those howls are the ancient cry of
the wolf still embedded in your dog's genes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nicholas Dodman, director of the Animal Behavior Clinic at
the Tufts Veterinary School, explains that dogs howl in response to
sounds that trigger vestigial biological responses that were part
of their ancestors 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, when most scientists
think our human ancestors tamed wild animals into the dogs we know
today.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the wild canid predecessors of today's dogs probably
used howling ``like smoke signals, a kind of long-distance relay to
carry messages farther than just one voice could,'' Dodman says.
``The message probably wasn't very complicated. It was likely, `I'm
here. Pass it along.' Or something simple like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, our human ancestors bred our dogs' ancestors to do the
things humans wanted them to do, like protect them and their
livestock, and stop doing things they didn't want them to do, like
eating humans. Barking around the campfire for protection at night
when something stirred in the darkness was a good trait. Howling
all night keeping the humans awake, and calling in their
human-eating relatives, was not. So those traits were bred out as
wolves were domesticated.
</P>
<P>
   The breeds that still howl the most, like the Siberian husky and
the American Eskimo, weren't bred as much to become docile, quiet
domestic pets, but rather to keep some of their useful wild animal
traits.
</P>
<P>
   Domesticating dogs also bred a lot of the intelligence out of
them. Juvenile wolves are playful and friendly but not nearly as
smart as the adults. An adult wolf, on the other hand, is a
veritable animal Ph.D. compared to most dogs. But we bred dogs to
be like juvenile wolves: safer to be around but not as smart.
</P>
<P>
   But though we bred most of the howling out of them, we didn't
eliminate it entirely. So when dogs hear a sound that triggers that
ages-old response, they howl back, ``I'm here.'' Lots of sounds set
them off, including a harmonica, another dog's howl, or even a
human howling at the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman says you can take a pretty accurate census of the dog
population in his hometown when the fire department siren goes off.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What makes the crackling noise in the ocean that divers hear?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
UNSIGNED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The supposedly silent world of the sea is anything but. All
sorts of things make noise. Whales, dolphins, fish (they didn't
name them grunt fish and croaker fish for no reason), wind at the
surface, rain, earthquakes, ships, even supersonic planes breaking
the sound barrier create sound waves below the waves.
</P>
<P>
   But that crackling noise may be the most interesting of all.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Frankel of Cornell's Bioacoustics Lab says it's made by
shrimp. Snapping shrimp, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny things, much smaller than the ones we eat, they have a
single claw that moves so fast in the water as it snaps shut that
it does the same thing ship propellers do. It causes cavitation,
the churning of dissolved gasses in the water into tiny bubbles
that then collapse under the water's pressure. The crackling noise
comes from the sound waves given off by those collapsing bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   In areas with coral reefs, you can also hear snapping noises
created when parrot fish munch away at stony coral, snapping off
bits and pieces as they feed.
</P>
<P>
   We can hear these tiny sounds so clearly because water is a
great medium for maximizing the energy in sound waves. The speed of
sound is five times greater in water than in less-dense air. So for
a given amount of energy, you get much more sound.
</P>
<P>
   That is why something as tiny as snapping shrimp can make warm
water areas of the ocean sound like a bowl of Rice Krispies.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Fifty years after the national pollsters messed
up in a big way, they are making the same kinds of errors that gave
polling a bad name in the Truman-Dewey race in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   To explain why they missed calling key races in 1998, they
trotted out alibis withered with age. In a number of contests, they
simply failed to poll right up to election time, thus missing
changes in voter opinions. In others, they made assumptions that
were false.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion surveying, comprehensively and conscientiously
done, is a valuable tool providing information that would not be
otherwise available. Exit polls are especially useful for revealing
the motives of people who actually voted.
</P>
<P>
   Polling deserves better from its practitioners than it got in
this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The news media that push these polls on the public are far from
guiltless. Their readers and viewers are entitled to accurate
information, which is the reason for publishing these polls in the
first place. Given the poor performances by many pollsters this
election, the media ought to demand their money back and apologize
to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate stood conventional predictions and past practices
on the head, permitting the party that holds the White House to
retain or expand its congressional representation. By doing so, the
people also set up sign posts pointing to resolution of the effort
to impeach President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   What the public confirmed by their votes, and their explanations
of them, is that impeachment is not the fitting punishment for
Clinton's offenses. They also expressed views that he should be
rebuked in some manner.
</P>
<P>
   However, the congressional censure that the American public
appears to favor is running into some scholarly concerns. Seems
that there is no constitutional authority for the Congress to
censure the president, unless he waives his rights.
</P>
<P>
   That puts the ball back into the court of the House Judiciary
Committee, which is considering impeachment. The partisan nature of
the Republican handling of this issue backfired on the party in
last week's election. The partisanship was reinforced two days
later by the actions of Rep. Henry J. Hyde, who heads the Judiciary
Committee. Hyde, R-Ill., is routinely ballyhooed in news accounts
as the epitome of fairness and non-partisanship. To prove just how
wrong news accounts can be, he unleashed 81 questions on the
president. To these questions, the chairman of a congressional
committee demands from the president of the United States yes or no
answers, never mind that many don't lend themselves to such a
response. In his supposed effort to be non-political, Hyde also
apparently overlooked consulting the Democrats on his committee.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's the way to run an impartial investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of asking the president leading questions, the Judiciary
Committee's first order of business would seem to be to find out
just how good an investigation independent counsel Kenneth Starr
carried out for the $40 million he has spent.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is piling up that he may have broken several laws
several times over, and a federal judge has ordered a special
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A nonpartisan effort, which an impeachment process warrants,
would first seek to establish the validity of the laundry list of
charges that the Starr investigation has patched together.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the very case that provides the foundation for
Starr's charges is coming apart. Paula Corbin Jones, in her
relentless pursuit of as much money as she can lay her hands on,
has now alienated her second set of lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Having ostensibly begun all this in an attempt to recover what
she said was her good name, which she jeopardized in the first
place by going public with an old complaint, Jones has abandoned
seeking an apology from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Her ideological soulmates in turn have cut her loose, because
they find her appetite for money too strong.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should forego any further attempts to reach an
out-of-court settlement. This case, already dismissed once as a
happening that did not constitute an offense in law, should go the
distance in the courts. Jones' case is no more viable in the
appeals court than it was the first time a judge heard her
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Can there be any doubt remaining that the Jones case from the
first was about money, notoriety and political theater? Is it not
clear that the charges against Clinton emanate from this failed
case? For all its intrinsic weaknesses, the Jones case has served
the independent counsel as his only mechanism to snare the
president. If he has any other goods on the president, he has
failed to produce them. Consequently, the Judiciary Committee's
task would not appear to be too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   With the Jones case imploding, and Starr's dubious investigative
tactics, there is every reason to wrap up the impeachment hearings
speedily. Everyone on the Judiciary Committee should be concerned
how history will remember what they do.

WENDY WASSERSTEIN ILLUMINATES WOMEN'S DILEMMAS, COMPLEXITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SARAH V. SNYDER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Playwright Wendy Wasserstein was in Boston recently for one of
the final performances of her latest play, ``An American
Daughter.'' Its star _ a doctor, public health expert, and mother _
is nominated for surgeon general, but scandal follows when it's
revealed that she once skipped jury duty because her life was so
busy.
</P>
<P>
   Globe editor Sarah V. Snyder recently talked with Wasserstein
about women, politics, and motherhood. Following are excerpts from
their conversation:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In ``An American Daughter,'' the nominee for surgeon general,
a mother, is asked questions by a TV interviewer zanily different
from anything a man would be asked. Do you think we are close to
the time, or far from it, when a mother and father running for
public office would be treated identically?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think women are always asked personal questions. I don't
know if they always will be. It must be human interest. ... I'm
always asked about, `Is your mother upset you're not married?' `Are
you going to adopt a child?' I truly don't think that Edward Albee
gets asked (such questions) ... of course he's older, but I doubt
whether my colleagues get asked these questions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. ``An American Daughter'' features a successful, beautiful
20-something feminist author, Quincy Quince, who strikes the older
women as clueless about the complexities of mixing family and
professional life. Who does she represent to you?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No one in the specific, not a certain person. But I also
think there's a certain arrogance, it comes to me later in life,
that some people ... they think that there's an ability to organize
life, some sort of key. You just have that key, and you'll sail
along and make none of the mistakes everyone else made. We said to
our mothers, `You just lived at home in the suburbs; you don't
know.' The Quincy Quinces can look at us, and say, `Boy, you guys
didn't know. You guys are earnest and sentimental. Forget it, babe!
You don't know how to take of yourself while I, Miss Quincy Quince,
do.'
</P>
<P>
   She has no wisdom. What she has is, she knows how to operate.
What's scary about the world ... how you operate, how you position
yourself, is that Miss Quincy Quince is going to do great. That's
the point of view of the author anyway.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. This same character announces that she intends to `write two
more books, start her family, then enter public life.' But her
mattter-of-factness makes it a laugh line. Do you think a talented
young woman even in this day and age is still foolish to think she
can have it all?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With some wisdom, you think about what your child's like;
it's possible you'll have an ill child. Or you get ill. Or your
husband loses his job, or The Boston Globe merges. Who knows? You
don't know at all. It's very nice for her, but life doesn't work
that way. She's totally clueless. `Her plan is the right plan.' Who
the hell knows?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some professional women cringed at older feminist characters
in ``The Heidi Chronicles'' and ``An American Daughter'' who
discover they are unfulfilled because they don't have children.
Isn't this an old-fashioned view of women?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You know, I think what's hard is, whether things are
old-fashined, or politically correct, or unpolitically correct, you
have to go to who's the character there. If Judith wants a child,
it's hard to say that's not legitimate, to want a child. Some do,
some don't. I don't believe it's not an issue. You have to decide,
or consciously decide not to decide. ... It is of issue in life,
for men, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has any professional woman said to you, ``I have been able to
accomplish exactly what I hoped, both as a parent and a
professional''?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My sister died at age 60. You know ... who knows? I certainly
know older women who look back at their lives and say it's been
good. I also know a lot of people who have regrets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But you would say, of combining high professional
accomplishment and children, one doesn't obviate the other?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One doesn't obviate the other, but I think it's really hard.
It's just hard. One, because it's a hell of a lot of amount of
work, and people should be alowed to sit around a little bit. I
like to sit around. I think it's really nice. And people should
have friendships and things not necessarily ... not toward
something. Every minute not raising children or working shouldn't
have to be spent lifting weights to escape osteoporosis. It's all
oriented toward something. The numbers would show it's hard for
women, or there would be more women CEOs and in politics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Obviously women in their 40s today grew up with much
different attitudes than their mothers. Do you think girls in their
teens today will be as different from us as we were from our
mothers?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Probably. I know girls in their 20s ... I have many nieces, I
have one, a junior at Harvard, Pamela. I have three other nieces,
who got married in their 20s. They wanted to be sure they were
married. So, you know, that's great; they're in love, and married
lovely guys, and that's great. But it has to do with character as
well. I meet a 9-year-old girl I can tell is a creative child, and
whatever road she goes on will be somewhat similar to mine, not
mainstream, even if it's a totally different world. I think, `I
know you.' And there are little Quincy Quinces being born out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you ever get the feeling that an incredible amount of
potentially creative, artistic, or professional-accomplishment
energy among women gets permanently diverted by children?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No. I think about that. I wrote ``The Heidi Chronicles'' when
I was 36, which would have been the time I might have had children.
The great thing about women is, they do things at different times
in their lives. One of my favorite women in politics is Nita
Loweyfrom Westchester ... a congresswoman, raised three children.
First she lived in that great world of volunteers; they run the PTA
and this and that. And then at 48 or 50, she ran for Congress.
She's a great congressperson. She knows about children and
education and breast cancer and is extremely effective. And I think
what's good about women is, if you have children, then in a sense
it broadens your life so what you bring to your work, or columns,
is a larger sense of the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It can be hard when you're with very young children, though,
minding them on the stoop for instance, to think you'll ever
achieve professionally what you would have otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it may be that that person doesn't write their play
when they're sitting on the stoop, but four or five years later.
I'm in the process of possibly adopting a child. But I'm old. I
think, can I do this? I did this other thing, and that was great,
and I'll never have to look back and say, I didn't get to do it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Would ``The Heidi Chronicles'' have been written if you'd
been busy with children?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't know. It depends on the personality. Maybe as an
artistic endeavor, it just had to get written.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. And maybe a different play would have been written.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. Maybe a different play.

AMERICA'S NEWTMARE IS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By THOMAS TASCHINGER  
 c.1998 Beaumont Enterprise  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUMONT, Texas _ Our long national Newtmare is over.
</P>
<P>
   Just two elections after leading the Revolution of '94, the most
dramatic takeover in modern American political history, Newt
Gingrich's career as speaker of the House of Representatives has
fizzled out like a meteorite plunging to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what meteorites do. They blaze brilliantly for a
time, but after their fuel is used up and their force is spent,
they quickly fade to black.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was such an entity. The congressman from Georgia had
the drive and imagination and guts to do something that many people
thought couldn't be done _ install a Republican majority in the
House. His ``Contract with America'' will go down in history as one
of the best package of reforms ever to scrub Congress, one that was
perfectly in tune with the public's pent-up desires.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake about it, America needed Newt's coup. Even
many Democrats will acknowledge that their party had become flabby
and arrogant after 40 years of controlling the House. They were
passing bills the people didn't need (frequently laden with pork
and red tape) and refusing to pass bills that voters did want
(balanced budget, term limits, and so forth). Like a quarterback
who'd thrown too many interceptions, they needed a sit-down and
should be better for it when they inevitably regain the House.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who had richly earned nicknames like the ``Gingrich
Who Stole Christmas'' was never able to make the transition from
bomb-throwing back-bencher to elder statesman. The same tactics
that worked when he was a little-known minority leader _
scorched-earth campaigns and ruthless fund-raising _ were
inappropriate once he had stormed the palace. The public began to
see Nasty Newt as an annoying wonk who never seemed to shut up and
never seemed to learn from his increasingly frequent mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Newt's nemesis _ another big ol' gray-haired Baby
Boomer from the South _ had his own laundry list of personal flaws.
But Bill Clinton was smarter and slicker than Gingrich. His style
wasn't as harsh, and he could seamlessly reinvent himself or walk
away from earlier gaffes in a way that Gingrich never could match.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he didn't try. The speaker was a brilliant man, and
after he'd do something dumb like whine about having to leave Air
Force One by the back door, he'd listen intently to advisers who
told exactly how he'd blundered and what he needed to do to
recover. But within weeks _ or days _ another Newtron Bomb was
dropped on American politics, and the same cycle of repentance and
regeneration started over.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Newt had become exactly what he'd railed against in
the '80s. The federal budget passed (barely) last month had several
major spending bills balled into one unfathomable mess, including
$20 billion in appropriations shamelessly classified as
``emergency'' to get by the balanced budget requirements of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   What it didn't have was the things that differentiate
conservatives from liberals _ tax cuts, school vouchers, less
government. As last week's election results showed, if voters have
a choice between traditional Democrats and wishy-washy Republicans
who try to act like Democrats, they'll choose the real thing every
time.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if Republicans could hope that the
post-Gingrich era will be as successful as the first part of Newt's
rule, but that looks doubtful now. Although many Americans believe
Gingrich to be the poster boy for right-wing extremism, in truth
he's the voice of reason compared to some of the zealots who want
to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Bob Livingston, the thoroughly
undistinguished Republican congressman from Louisiana who is the
front-runner to succeed Gingrich. Livingston, who almost left
politics two years ago, has a dull, flat speaking style ... except
when he loses his temper (which he does frequently) and begins
shouting and waving his arms like a man being electrocuted. Unless
Livingston can grow into the job _ and he has nowhere to go but up
_ practice saying ``Speaker Gephardt.''
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways Gingrich's reign of terror was fun while it
lasted. He grabbed American politics by the scruff of the neck and
shook some sense into it, and that's something that puppies,
children and congressmen need from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Farewell, Newtie; we barely knew ye.

`HORSE WHISPERER' SCENIC `JAMES ELLROY' CRAZY

<P>
   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``The Horse Whisperer''  &LR; _ The big cineaste
question of the decade: Who gets more backlighting, Barbra
Streisand or Robert Redford? As if he were looking to market
postcards, Redford photographs beautifully against the magnificent
Big Sky country. But that's it. How are we supposed to care about a
spoiled rich kid and her taciturn mother, stonily played by Kristin
Scott Thomas? They didn't even get the horse stuff right. Just ask
the real horse whisperer, Monty Roberts.

<P>
   &UR; ``James Ellroy: Demon Dog of American Crime Fiction''  &LR; _ The
author of ``L.A. Confidential'' and dozens of other crime novels

convertible and wearing a flashy Hawaiian shirt, Ellroy bemoans the
changes in the Los Angeles landscape he grew up to hate and love
during the '50s. He even points out a pleasant home where he used
to peep in the window. Frankly, if ``Demon Dog'' is to be believed,
he seems as creepy and crazy as some of his characters.

<P>
   &UR; ``Music From Another Room'' &LR;  _ Brenda Blethyn, Gretchen Moll,

DEFINING `DEMOCRACY' IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HALTON ADLER MANN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Democracy produces war'' may sound like some
Orwellian doublespeak, but that is the predictable projection for
``Arab democracy,'' the oxymoronic fantasy for repressive Arab
regimes that is claimed will bring peace to the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Democracies do not declare war on each other, not proximate
democracies. Certainly, there are abundant examples proving this
maxim. But in the Mideast, maxims _ except perhaps ``the enemy of
my enemy is my friend'' _ cannot survive its history's hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Without Anwar Sadat's autocratic and dramatic foray for peace
with Israel, Egypt would never have made such momentous history.
But without democratic freedoms and parties in Egypt that would
have defeated such rapprochement, the former Nazi supporter Sadat
and the former Irgun terrorist Menachem Begin both evolved to
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Would such a stunning overture for peace have been realized in a
democratic Egypt where fundamentalist Islamic fanaticism threatens
to destabilize its presidential dictatorship, the same terrorists
who murder tourists and Coptic Christians and who assassinated
Sadat?
</P>
<P>
   Would a democratic Jordan with its Palestinian majority have
made peace with Israel without the unilateral decision of its
supreme monarch, King Hussein? Unconditionally, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy'' in such countries that have been alien to the
impulse decades longer than Israel has been an independent,
democratic nation would never have recognized its right to exist
and respected its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
   This is the paradox that has made the Mideast peace process,
torn by terrorism, stalemated by historical hatred and belligerent
beliefs, even potentially viable.
</P>
<P>
   Israel at 50 years must be celebrated for arriving there against
the odds and the enemies surrounding it and for making peace with
them, returning captured land after repulsing wartime attacks.
Jordan at 50 must be censured for not creating a Palestinian state
during the 20 years _ 1947 to 1967 _ it controlled the destiny of
Trans-Jordan, the West Bank Palestinian homeland whose agony over
protracted percentage disputes prevented the progress of peace
until the recent agreement in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Diaspora that preceded Palestine's 1947
partition and followed it for decades replicates the Jewish
antecedent. Every Arab nation reduces Palestinians to pariah
status. Egypt, intent on recovering the Sinai oil fields after the
Yom Kippur War, did not demand the return of Gaza and its
Palestinian population. Kuwait banished its Palestinians during the
Persian Gulf War. In the Arab world, Palestinians, like the
Diaspora Jews, are the lepers of the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   Those whom fortune has forsaken in lands hostile to hope were
never welcome anywhere their travails and travels took them,
suffering persecution, inquisition and ghettoization.
</P>
<P>
   If Israel had not existed for the past 50 years, would a
Palestinian state? Would Gamal Abdel Nasser, King Hussein and Hafez
Assad have permitted it? Would they have allowed the secure and
secular fantasy of ``Arab democracy'' in nations that subjugate
women to the role of chattel and suppress the rights of their
citizens? Could peace have been produced from such a tyrannical
trio without a symbiotic, democratic partner _ Israel?
</P>
<P>
   Let the land that is the Palestinians' be given to them as it
was given to the Jews of Israel. Let them revoke their evil
covenant to destroy Israel, let the terrorism be terminated and let
us have peace from this time forward, forevermore.

PART OF WINDFALL SHOULD GO TOWARD RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 46-year-old single woman and have been working for one
year as an independent contractor in real estate. I will make
$25,000 this year, and expect to earn $40,000 next year. I have a
$45,000 IRA invested in New England Value fund, Class A, $16,000 in
a money market fund, $3,500 in Nicholas II fund, and $1.400 in the
Domini Social Equity Trust. I add $50 a month to the Domini fund. I
also have an investment cooperative apartment in the North End of
Boston, where there is eight years left on a $30,000 6 percent
mortgage. I net $600 a month from the rent after paying the $378
mortgage payment and the $150 cooperative fee. I have just
inherited $125,000 and need suggestions. I don't mind risk.
</P>
<P>
   S.R., West Falmouth, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't give full details on your investment in the coop
apartment, but it certainly sounds like that move is generating a
better return for you than other investments are likely to do.
</P>
<P>
   Since your career is in real estate, and I presume you have a
good deal of expertise there, why not park half of the inheritance
in a money market fund until you can find a second investment
property which looks like it will perform as well as the first has
apparently done?
</P>
<P>
   As for the remaining $62,500, my suggestion is invest it to
buttress your retirement savings. If you haven't made your IRA
contribution for this year, I suggest you do so using a Roth IRA,
which will put a portion of your retirement savings on a tax-free
basis.
</P>
<P>
   For next year, when you anticipate higher earnings, as a
self-employed person you can switch from IRA savings to a Keogh
plan, which will allow you to put away more than the $2,000 annual
limit for traditional and Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   If you set aside the money for that, you might be left with
about $55,000 or so to invest. If you are sure that you want to put
this money aside for retirement and won't have any call on it until
you reach age 59 1/2 or later, you might want to put some or all of
it in a variable annuity account. These are basically hybrids of
mutual fund investing and insurance. In this case, the insurance
level is minimal, but it sufficient for these plans to qualify as
tax-deferred investments.
</P>
<P>
   Most major mutual fund companies offer variable annuities which
track their most popular funds, and they tend to produce annual
returns that run about 1/2 of 1 percent lower than those of the
funds they emulate _ the returns are lower because of the cost of
insurance. But many people find that surrendering a half percent of
investment return is much more attractive than facing the tax
liabilities inherent in non-deferred holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you decide to go with a variable annuity or taxable
accounts, if these are to be retirement savings, I suggest you lump
them together in your mind with the existing IRA, seeking to create
an overall portfolio with about 50 percent of its assets in a solid
large-cap fund such as the position you already have in New England
Value.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remainder, I'd suggest you divide it evenly into four
additional sectors to balance the portfolio. I'd suggest you put 12
1/2 percent each in an overseas fund, a mid-cap fund, a small-cap
fund, and a health care sector fund. If you were investing with
Vanguard, for example, you might select the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index,
the Small-Cap Index, the International Growth, and Specialized
Health Care funds. With Fidelity a similar portfolio might consist
of its Mid-Cap Stock, its Low-Priced Stock, its Overseas, and its
Select Health Care funds.
</P>
<P>
   If you view your positions in Nicholas II and Domini Social
Equity Trust as retirement savings, since Nicholas II is a mid-cap
fund and Domini a large-cap fund, you could include those amounts
when you're working out the dollar allocations.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to view all of your investments except the money
market fund as retirement savings, you would have a total of
$109,300. Thus you'd want a total of $54,650 in the core large-cap
positions (Domini and New England Value) and about $13,650 in each
of the other sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you'll want to establish these positions as carefully
you would be if you were looking for a real estate investment.
Therefore, with the exception of the IRA and Keogh investments, I
would adopt a 36-month dollar cost averaging program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you follow the suggestions above, with $55,000
earmarked for long-term investments, I'd begin by putting all but
$1,645 in a money market fund. With the $1,645, you would make your
first fund or variable annuity investment. The each month you would
target a similar amount to one of the funds; with this pace,
assuming 5 percent average returns from the money fund, you would
spread the investments out over 36 months, and in the process you
would reduce the risk you'd face in the event of a short-term
market downturn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. At age 64 and semi-retired, I am about to sell a house and
move into a condo. The proceeds of the house sale will not fully
pay for the condo, and I have the choice between seeking out a
15-year mortgage or cashing in some investments and buying it
outright. If I were to buy outright, it would have not have a
detrimental effect on the income I need to derive from my
portfolio. Which is better?
</P>
<P>
   D.M., Southborough, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In general, my point of view is that in time you will find
that now will shape up as a good time to take a mortgage and a bad
time to have too much of your money tied up in investments that are
dominated by the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But to address your specific question, I must first face
another: How is the money in question invested?
</P>
<P>
   If it's taxable stock accounts or vehicles that track the stock
market in general, I think I'd sell and buy the place outright. On
the other hand, if these are tax-deferred fixed-income investments,
it's likely that your returns from them will be very close to the
amount you would pay for a 15-year mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   When you then tally in the tax benefit of taking the mortgage _
deducting the interest expenses _ the chances are overwhelming that
you'd be better off taking the mortgage. As a variant, you could
move an amount of your tax-deferred portfolio that's equal to the
mortgage amount from stocks to a solid fixed-income investment such
as a GNMA fund and then take the mortgage; you would get the same
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In a column that ran here on Oct. 18 you discussed minimum
distributions based on the life expectancies of the owners and
beneficiaries of an IRA. I have read that another option called
``term certain'' is available. By this method, the owner and the
beneficiary establish their life expectancy. If it's 22 years, they
withdraw 1/22 the first year, 1/21 the second year, and so on until
the account is emptied in the 22d year. Is this true, and if so,
which method is better?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., La Mirada, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Briefly, the advantage of using the method I described, which
the IRS calls the recalculation method, is that the required
minimum distributions are smaller, and the owner will never be
required to empty out the account entirely. The term certain method
is indeed an allowed option (as is a third approach called the
``hybrid'' method).
</P>
<P>
   The disadvantage of the recalculation method, as described in
J.K. Lasser's ``Your Income Tax'' guide, is that if your spouse is
your beneficiary and dies first, you must then recalculate the
mandatory withdrawal amount based on your single life expectancy,
resulting in higher withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when you die, the secondary beneficiary will have to
receive the entire balance by the end of the year following your
death and pay taxes on the entire amount.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when an IRA that has been established with a term
certain sequence of withdrawals and the beneficiary is not a
spouse, the person who inherits the account will be required only
to maintain the sequence of withdrawals that was initially
established under the term certain plan.
</P>
<P>
   So which is better? If all depends on your individual needs and
tax situation.

A MAN IN FULL 
By Tom Wolfe. 742 pp. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. $28.95. 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; With his hyperactive reportorial gifts, his Old Richmond
sensibility, and his Ivy League imprint (don't forget that PhD from
Yale), Tom Wolfe never seemed content with merely having blown open
the backwaters of American journalism. No, he insisted on taking
that big-mouthed brilliance into the realm of fiction, where lurked
even wilder swamplands. If he'd already pontificated on real-life
subjects from modern art to the space race, think what
possibilities lay in the motherlode of invention! So Wolfe, at
midlife, decided to go after the Zeitgeist via urban realism.
Unlike a lot of his characters, he emerged from the '80s intact,
his ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' a flawed but wildly ambitious
ride through the mannered minefields of New York. What the novel
lacked in emotional dimension, it made up for in unmitigated
chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Thackeray and part ... well, Tom Wolfe: the hilariously But if
Tom Wolfe always longed to be our Zola, what he got instead was
part Thackeray and part ... well, Tom Wolfe: the hilariously
astute, high-octane chronicler of social mores in the modern age.
And what he's given us with ``A Man in Full'' is a Big Ol' American
Novel _ a rollicking collision of the New South, old money,
politics, race, and ``bidness,'' in a fin de siecle climate of
excess and absurdity. It's as smooth and fast-talking as a room
full of cattle ranchers (and with just as much potential for bull).
Some of it is brilliant. Some of it is farcical, and suffers from
Wolfe's reality-obsessed neglect of his characters' inner lives.
But the man's finest powers of description are in full supply in
this novel, which is, more than anything else, geographically
dazzling. He slams you through the high-gloss buffoonery of Atlanta
banking and real estate, takes you inside the cruelties of a
northern California prison, then deposits you within the
anachronistic confines of a Georgia quail-shooting plantation.
Whatever its more intricate failings, ``A Man in Full'' is blessed
with full-throttle momentum; there is scarcely a moment in the
novel that isn't _ wicked Wolfe _ damnably absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   The advance hype on ``A Man in Full'' has been considerable
(and, some might say, ingenious); what other novel in recent
history has sold a gazillion copies even before it hit the stores?
Along with the publicity, of course, has come the ensuing media
overkill, so that the deluge of plot summations in print almost
short-circuits the act of reading. But this is actually a book most
enjoyed scene by scene, without any preconceived expectations. It's
a series of gorgeous set pieces, the overall design being a moral
suspense tale that only resolves in the novel's final pages. With
Wolfe (a literary pointillist if ever there was one), it's always
about the cumulative effort: Just as in ``The Right Stuff'' all
those incredible details were supposed to lead to liftoff, the
layering of moments and nuance here creates a vastly realized map
where all the dots connect.
</P>
<P>
   The master of this particular universe is an old Southern boy
named Charlie Croker, a poor kid who made good on the football
field at Georgia Tech, then went on to become one of the overnight
barons of the Atlanta real estate boom. His bluster and
testosterone bumping up against age (60) and frailty (a bum knee, a
waning sex drive), Charlie has built an empire he hoped would
protect him forever. He has an air-brushed second wife not even
half his age, a 29,000-acre recreational ranch that would stagger
the likes of Donald Trump, a set of invincibly reactionary politics
that screens out everything but other rich white men. He's headed
for a major fall, in other words, that old-Georgia hubris ensuring
a plunge toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie's arrogance as a developer now has him facing
bankruptcy, and one of the minions affected by his troubles is a
young man named Conrad Hensley, who works in the freezer warehouses
of Croker Global Foods on the outskirts of Oakland, Calif. When
Charlie's belt-tightening forces layoffs at the company, Conrad _
23 and the father of two _ is on the streets. What follows is a
stunningly depicted Dantean journey through the decidedly un-chic
hinterlands of the Bay Area, where generosity and decency are no
match for meanness and bad luck.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the inimitable Charlie, Conrad is probably the best
character Wolfe has ever given breath. (Tellingly, he's also
conceived with the most tenderness and the least irony.) The
rebelliously upright son of two aging hippies, Conrad only wanted a
piece of the old-fashioned American dream _ and finds himself
instead in the Santa Rita Rehabilitation Center, the victim of what
life can hand you when you're on the losing end of a Charlie Croker
mishap. With Conrad's brutal undoing juxtaposed against Charlie's
fall from gracious society in Georgia, it's only a matter of time
before these two star-crossed souls will converge. But first there
are the requisite stratospheric subplots, enabling Wolfe to create
a few collision courses among modern art, inner-city race
relations, the back alleys of the banking industry, and the decline
of Southern decadence.
</P>
<P>
   At the alleged center of ``A Man in Full'' is a rich young white
woman's accusation of date rape against Fareek Fanon, a black
football star. She's the daughter of one of Charlie's cronies; he,
a surly, in-your-face athlete who made it out of Atlanta's slums,
and who now has the monied interests of Georgia Tech behind him.
It's an Old South, save-our-daughters story Wolfe must have found
irresistible, though in many ways the dilemma itself is peripheral
to the minor charactors and events it sets in motion. Considered
the embodiment of affluent, Georgia-cracker provincialism, Charlie
is handpicked by the politically brilliant black mayor of Atlanta
to speak out on behalf of Fareek; if he does so, his creditors'
threats promise to recede. By setting up this somewhat creaky plot
device, the novel pits Charlie's desperation against the flicker of
his humanity _ and also delivers an intricate racial saga involving
old-boy racism, the myriad cultures of black Atlanta, and the
Realpolitik of the New South.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention a guy (Roger White II, called Roger Too White by
his less-apologist black brethren) who, with his custom-tailored
wardrobe, gets to show off Wolfe's sartorial splendor. The king of
external detail, Wolfe revels in a kind of descriptive fecundity,
and certainly ``A Man in Full'' is brimming with it: the exquisite
architecture of old Atlanta; a quail hunt on an autumn morning; a
$1,250 sugar bowl, belonging to Charlie's ex-wife, that speaks
legions about its owner's background and insecurities. Some of the
finest moments in the novel are guided by this richness of
specificity, from a terrifying get-the-guest ``workout'' session
with Croker's bankers to a breeding between his prize stallion and
mare at the ranch (guests are invited to watch). And Conrad's stint
in prison is as powerfully rendered as anything Wolfe has written.
Still, at times such lushness threatens to eclipse the more
intimate spheres of fiction. Spending paragraphs on the dimensions
of Charlie's dressing room, for instance, Wolfe will almost forget
to mention that his protagonist has an infant daughter. That choice
of focus may be intended to suggest Charlie's parental failings,
but it has the result of accentuating Wolfe's inattention to the
emotional realm.
</P>
<P>
   The more depressed Charlie became in ``A Man in Full,'' the more
I liked him. And herein lies one of the successes of Wolfe's
efforts. He's written a sendup of the South, but he's done so as a
native Southerner who got far enough away to see the place with
hawk-eyed realism _ to see its ludicrous posturing, its poignant
humility, its sugar-coated iniquities and suicidal gentility. ``A
Man in Full'' is less showy than ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,''
but it's a better novel, partly because the world it evokes _
beyond its Atlanta high-rises and its perfectly manicured lawns _
is such a heart-and-soul fortress that Wolfe himself couldn't put
it into words. But he got it all.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his signature satire, in Wolfe's hands everybody's
guilty of something: of parsimony, solipsism, failures of the
heart, the usual idiotic blunders called human error. But ``A Man
in Full'' has a tenderness about it, even an idealism, that's new
to Wolfe. The ending of the novel has problems; as with the
too-neat epilogue of ``Bonfire,'' Wolfe doesn't know how to let his
characters go without inventing forced solutions for their ongoing
dramas. But even if you can't bear the introduction of a Greek
philosopher (Epictetus) to tie things together (there goes that
closet scholar again), you have to admire the hope such a ploy
represents. If any quality emerged alongside Wolfe's
take-no-prisoners intelligence in his previous work, it was a
too-cool heart that bordered on cynicism. That's nowhere in sight
in ``A Man in Full,'' which is as wide as the Mississippi,
firecracker smart, and _ dare we say it? _ sometimes even kind.

US SUCCEEDS IN PAINTING MICROSOFT AS A BULLY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the landmark antitrust case against Microsoft
Corp. in its fourth week, the government has offered abundant
details to show that the world's best-known software company is
also a marketplace bully. But the government still has significant
work to do to prove that Microsoft broke any laws.
</P>
<P>
   Three senior officials from well-known companies have testified
so far, all relating &UR;  &LR; stories of how Microsoft tried to strong-arm
their firms by offering special access to Microsoft's nearly
ubiquitous &UR;  &LR; Windows software _ or by denying them access.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape Communications Corp.'s chief executive said that
Microsoft proposed that the two companies split the market for
Internet browsing software, and implied it would deny Netscape
important Windows technical information if it did not agree. Had it
taken place, such a market division would have hampered Netscape's
growth. It would also likely have constituted illegal collusion
between competitors.
</P>
<P>
   An Apple Computer Inc. executive said Microsoft wanted Apple to
promote its browser and not Netscape's. Microsoft's alleged threat:
it would end production of office software for Apple computers,
which would make them far harder to sell.
</P>
<P>
   And a senior official of America Online Inc. said that his
company agreed to use and promote Microsoft's browser, and to
downplay Netscape's. Microsoft's inducement: it would give AOL a
prominent place on the opening screen that Windows users see when
they turn on their computers.
</P>
<P>
   If borne out through the rest of the trial, these tales could
help convince US District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson that
Microsoft uses Windows illegally to crush its competitors.
Ultimately, the Department of Justice and the 20 states joining the
lawsuit want Jackson to limit Microsoft's power to use Windows to
manipulate its competitors, though they have not yet spelled out
exactly how that should be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Under antitrust laws, owning a monopoly is legal. But it is
illegal to use a monopoly to injure companies trying to create new
competition, or to use monopoly power to push into new markets.
</P>
<P>
   The range of evidence offered so far has surprised some
antitrust specialists following the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has put in a pretty strong case so far. Over
the summer, as this came to a head, I wouldn't have predicted it
would be this strong,'' said Lisa Wood of the Boston firm Nutter,
McClennen &AMP; Fish.
</P>
<P>
   Windows is the leading operating system for personal computers.
It controls a computer's basic operations and helps it runs games,
spreadsheets, word processors and other applications programs.
Companies that sell computers need a license from Microsoft to sell
Windows with their machines, and companies that make applications
programs want Microsoft to share technical details of the latest
upgrades of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Given its large market share, Microsoft's tactics with Apple,
AOL, and Netscape are evidence that the Redmond, Wash., software
company is using its power to muscle competitors, said Robert
Doyle, a former Federal Trade Commission lawyer now with the firm
Arent, Fox in Washington. ``If they had a 30 percent market
position in operating systems, you could conclude that Microsoft's
threats weren't very viable ... But they've got 90 percent or 80
percent, and that gives Microsoft some leverage in getting what
they want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trial, in which the judge has limited each side to 12
witnesses, has a long way to go. Only three of the government's
witnesses have been called so far, and less than two hours of the
20-hour deposition by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates have been
aired. Ultimately, the court might see as many as eight hours of
that deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has not called any of its witnesses. And one strong
argument that it has made is that Netscape's software is still
popular and easy to find, despite Microsoft's alleged efforts to
crush the company.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the government has not begun to argue several required
aspects of its case. Generally, antitrust specialists said, the
government needs to prove three elements to win:
</P>
<P>
   _That Microsoft has monopoly control of the market for operating
system software used on personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   _That Microsoft used its monopoly power to defend that monopoly
or to push into new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   _And that Microsoft's actions prompted higher prices, slower
innovation, or less competition in the software market, or that
they otherwise hurt consumers.
</P>
<P>
   With the Apple, AOL, and Netscape testimony, the government has
mostly addressed the second element. But it has barely begun to
offer evidence on the first and third elements. For those portions
of the trial, the government will lean heavily on the work of
economists.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Falk, a legal adviser to Microsoft rival Oracle Corp. and
to a trade alliance that favors the antitrust action, said that it
may not be difficult to show that Microsoft's actions harmed
consumers. If the government can prove that Microsoft intentionally
warded off competitors to maintain its monopoly, then the law
presumes consumers were injured.

 &HT;    
 By CELIA DUGGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If Bombay is India's New York City, then New Delhi is its
Washington, a capital city with a staid provincial air that boasts
broad, stately boulevards, grand vistas of awe-inspiring monuments,
and an abundance of bureaucrats and politicians.
 &HT;    It is a place where the history of India _ from the time of the
Mughal emperors, through the British Raj, and into the
post-independence era _ is visible everywhere, like the layers of
an archaeological dig.
 &HT;    The best way to get a feel for the city, particularly the
buildings that were designed and laid out by the architect Edwin
Lutyens during the Raj, is to hire a taxi (you'll have to ask for
one with seat belts, since most have none).
 &HT;    Be sure to take the majestic drive up to India Gate, the giant
archway that is Delhi's Arc de Triomphe, a memorial to the 90,000
soldiers of the Indian Army who died in World War I. One of the
spokes of the wheel of streets that spin out from India Gate,
Rajpath, leads to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the official residence of the
President of India, once the British Viceroy's house.
 &HT;    Also worth a look is the sculpture by Devi Prasad Roy Chaudhary
that depicts the march led by Mohandas K. Gandhi in 1931 against
British salt taxes.
 &HT;    To step back in time, visit Shah jahanabad, the city established
by Emperor Shahjahan 350 years ago. Known today as Old Delhi, it is
still a thriving, vital place.
 &HT;    Walk through the vast interior of the Red Fort and its ill-kempt
gardens or rent a bicycle rickshaw to take you through the narrow,
clogged alleyways. The weather should be pleasant, with warm days
and cool evenings, although a cold snap is possible as the calendar
moves into December.
 &HT;    Anywhere you go, be prepared for the city's poor to jostle up
against you. In the middle of busy streets, urchins, mothers
holding naked babies and men with misshapen bodies knock on car
windows, begging for a few rupees. Once out of official New Delhi,
the jhuggis, or slums, sprawl outward from the highways.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    In November, the Crafts Museum, opposite the Purana Qila on
Mathura Road, (91-11) 337-1641, will have dozens of dhurrie
weavers, potters and other artisans working in a plaza where
visitors can talk to them and watch them.
 &HT;    The museum itself, a series of galleries in village huts, is a
wondrous collection of the folk and tribal arts and crafts of
India, which still provide a livelihood to more than 20 million
people. Admission is free.
 &HT;    The sound and light shows at the Red Fort, which run nightly for
50 cents a person, is schmaltzy but enjoyable entertainment. From
molded plastic chairs, the audience watches as the mosques and
minarets around the courtyard are illuminated by lurid lights.
 &HT;    A disembodied, mellifluous voice tells the story of the fort,
first in Hindi, then half an hour later, at 7:30, in English,
punctuated by the screams of women and the thunder of horses'
hooves. Tickets can be bought at the entry to the Fort and at the
Ashok, Janpath and Lodhi hotels.
 &HT;    On Nov. 15, Birju Maharaj will perform the classical Indian
dance of Kathak at Siri Fort Cultural Complex, Khel Gaon Marg. Time
and ticket prices have not yet been set. Call (91-11) 462-2033 for
information.
 &HT;    The story of Lord Shiva, one of the incarnations of the Hindu
god Vishnu, will be told in a regional dance of the state of
Orissa, Odissi, performed by Reela Hota. Call (91-11) 371-4307 to
get an invitation for free admission to the dance, Nov. 30 at 6:45
p.m. at the Sri Ram Center of Art and Culture, 4 Safdar Hashmi
Marg.
 &HT;    Sonal Mansingh will perform the classical Bharatnatyam dance at
the India International Center auditorium, 40 Lodi Estates, on Nov.
30 and Dec. 1 at 6:30 p.m. A call to (91-11) 461-9431 will produce
a free invitation.

weekly Delhi Diary at any newsstand.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Raj Ghat, the memorial to Mohandas K. Gandhi, father of the
nation, is moving, not because of the simple petal-strewn marble
platform but because of the pilgrims who touch it with reverence
and emotion.
 &HT;    With luggage balanced on their heads, they circle the memorial
in a kind of mourning dance that has never ended since his
assassination 50 years ago. It is set in a well-kept park east of
the Red Fort, between the Ring Road and the Yamuna River.
 &HT;    Chandni Chowk, a shopping area from the Mughal era and still a
thriving marketplace, has been spruced up. Here Delhiites buy
everything from electrical appliances to deep-fried sweets at
Jalebi Wala, an open-air shop where men squirt the pretzel shaped
treats called jalebis into vats of boiling oil.
 &HT;    Lodi Garden, next to the India International Center, is a lovely
spot for a picnic or a stroll. Its tranquil, beautifully landscaped
grounds are laid out around th e tombs of the Lodi and Sayyid
sultans who ruled north India in the 15th and 16th centuries.
 &HT;    The National Gallery of Modern Art, (91-11) 338-2835, near India
Gate on Rajpath, was once the Delhi residence of the Maharajah of
Jaipur. Its bright, spacious galleries now house Indian and
colonial art. Except for Mondays and holidays, the museum is open
daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is 12 cents.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The Ambassador Hotel, Sujan Singh Park, (91-11) 463-2600, fax
463-8219, has pleasant, sunny rooms with window air-conditioning
units. Near Khan market, a shopping center with everything from
aspirin to books to handicrafts, the 88-room hotel has a cheerful
coffee shop where people crowd the hand-painted yellow and blue
tables. Double rooms cost $140 plus 20 percent tax.
 &HT;    Nirula's Hotel, L-Block, Connaught Circus, (91-11) 332-2419, fax
335-3957, is a popular place near one of New Delhi's main shopping
areas at Connaught Circle. The 28-room hotel has a lounge where
light streams through large windows and a bustling coffee shop, and
is next door to an ice cream parlor. The rooms are standard issue,
with central air-conditioning and showers. A double costs $68 plus
10 percent tax.
 &HT;    Budget: The Maharani Guest House, 3 Sunder Nagar, (91-11)
469-3129, is in one of the city's residential neighborhoods, close
to the main Sunder Nagar market. This modest hotel is neatly kept,
with its front lawn clipped like a spit and polish mustache. The 24
rooms are spacious and air-conditioned. Mattresses on the wooden
platform beds are on the thin side. A double room is $52, plus 10
percent tax.
 &HT;    Hotel Fifty Five, H-55 Connaught Circus, (91-11) 332-1244, fax
332-0769, is a spare, air-conditioned hotel with a small terrace
looking over the horn-tooting traffic that rushes past. Its 15
smallish rooms come with bathrooms and telephones, but no
television. A double room costs $35, plus 10 percent tax.
 &HT;    Luxury: Delhi has a number of plush hotels, but perhaps the most
elegant is the 290-room Oberoi New Delhi, (91-11) 436-3030, fax
436-0484, with a gorgeous swimming pool, sybaritic health club,
fancy Thai, Chinese and French restaurants, a 24-hour coffee shop
that serves delectable Indian lunch buffets and beautifully
decorated rooms. Doubles begin at $320 plus 20 percent tax.
 &HT;    The vaulted marble lobby of the 518-room Hyatt Regency Delhi,
Bhikaji Cama Place, Ring Road, (91-11) 618-1234, fax 618-6833, is
brightened with lavish displays of fresh flowers. The hotel has a
big pool and a children's pool, tennis courts, a fitness center and
the city's best Italian restaurant, La Piazza. It's fun to sip a
Kingfisher beer and eat chips and salsa, Indian style, at the Polo
Lounge, a wood-paneled bar. Doubles start at $275, plus 20 percent
tax.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Bukhara, at the Maurya Sheraton Hotel, Diplomatic Enclave,
(91-11) 611-2233, is one of the most festive places to eat in
Delhi. It is deservedly famous for its tandoori specialties from
the Northwest Frontier provinces of India.
 &HT;    The stone-clad walls are draped with carpets. Copper pots hang
from wooden rafters. And guests, eating at wooden trestle tables
with their fingers, consume platters of lamb, chicken and fish
pomfret that have been marinated and roasted in the tandoor oven.
Dinner for two, with wine, costs about $100.
 &HT;    Many Indian restaurants not based in the big hotels are very
inexpensive by American standards. Moti Mahal, the famous old
Indian restaurant on Netaji Subhash Marg, (91-11) 327-3011, serves
tasty tandoori chicken, spicy lamb stews and buttery dal.
 &HT;    Diners can eat outside and listen to live quawwali singing.
Dinner for two, with beer (no wine is served), costs about $20.
 &HT;    Getting to Karim, Gali Kababiyan, Matia Mahal, near the Jama
Masjid, (91-11) 326-9880, means wading through beggars, bicycle
rickshaws and shoppers into the narrow, jam-packed alleyways of the
old city. It is a raucous, smoky, exotic scene, a little like
something out of an Indiana Jones movie.
 &HT;    The restaurant is not air-conditioned and sells no alcohol, but
the kebabs, tandoori meats and curried dishes are delicious. Dinner
for two costs about $10.
 &HT;    The Sweets Corner, at 1 Sunder Nagar Market, (91-11) 461-9261,
is a South Indian vegetarian restaurant that sells no alcohol. At
the entrance is the Dosa Counter, where men at a griddle spread
batter for the South Indian style thin, crispy pancakes called
dosa, then fill them with delectable spicy stuffings. It would take
two people with very big appetites to spend more than $5 on dinner.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    Delhi has many wonderful places to treasure-hunt. The prettiest
is Santushti Shopping Complex in the Willingdon Air Force Camp, in
Chanakyapuri, where elegant shops in white bungalows are set on a
greensward along curving stone pathways.
 &HT;    The shops sell clothing, crafts, jewelry and household objects.
At Noorjehan a hand-painted scarf is $33. At Lotus Eaters, a silk
and Pashmina shawl is $106.
 &HT;    The Sunder Nagar market in Sunder Nagar is not much to look at,
but it has delightful shops that sell antique furniture, paintings,
jewelry, brass wares and other crafts. La Boutique, a dark, crowded
place, offers heavy tribal silver necklaces for $94 and silver
earrings set with semiprecious stones for $5 to $14.
 &HT;    Dilli Haat, Sri Aurobindo Marg, opposite the INA market, is a
large, pleasant crafts market spread over six acres. The 62 stalls
are arranged around a large, clean brick plaza. There is an
admission charge of 12 cents.
 &HT;    Here you can buy four sparkly arm bangles for $1.20 and a
hand-painted sari from Bihar for $35. At the back of the plaza are
stalls that sell snacks and meals from different regions of India
that can be eaten at stone picnic tables.
 &HT;    Khan Market, Subramaniam Bharati Marg, is a cluttered jumble of
stores that range from everyday vegetable sellers to boutiques.
Anokhi sells clothing made from pretty, subtly colored cottons that
are handblock printed. A girl's dress is $5.65, a woman's
sleeveless shift $12.
 &HT;    Mehra Brothers offers hand-painted, lacquered papier-mache
boxes, frames and other objects from Kashmir. Books in India are
generally a great value. Try Bahri Sons or Times Book Gallery,
which gives a 10 percent discount for cash. Hardbacks generally
cost $12 to $14 and paperbacks are $4.70 to $7.

 &HT;    
 By CELIA DUGGER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    If Bombay is India's New York City, then New Delhi is its
Washington, a capital city with a staid provincial air that boasts
broad, stately boulevards, grand vistas of awe-inspiring monuments,
and an abundance of bureaucrats and politicians.
 &HT;    It is a place where the history of India _ from the time of the
Mughal emperors, through the British Raj, and into the
post-independence era _ is visible everywhere, like the layers of
an archaeological dig.
 &HT;    The best way to get a feel for the city, particularly the
buildings that were designed and laid out by the architect Edwin
Lutyens during the Raj, is to hire a taxi (you'll have to ask for
one with seat belts, since most have none).
 &HT;    Be sure to take the majestic drive up to India Gate, the giant
archway that is Delhi's Arc de Triomphe, a memorial to the 90,000
soldiers of the Indian Army who died in World War I. One of the
spokes of the wheel of streets that spin out from India Gate,
Rajpath, leads to Rashtrapati Bhawan, the official residence of the
President of India, once the British Viceroy's house.
 &HT;    Also worth a look is the sculpture by Devi Prasad Roy Chaudhary
that depicts the march led by Mohandas K. Gandhi in 1931 against
British salt taxes.
 &HT;    To step back in time, visit Shah jahanabad, the city established
by Emperor Shahjahan 350 years ago. Known today as Old Delhi, it is
still a thriving, vital place.
 &HT;    Walk through the vast interior of the Red Fort and its ill-kempt
gardens or rent a bicycle rickshaw to take you through the narrow,
clogged alleyways. The weather should be pleasant, with warm days
and cool evenings, although a cold snap is possible as the calendar
moves into December.
 &HT;    Anywhere you go, be prepared for the city's poor to jostle up
against you. In the middle of busy streets, urchins, mothers
holding naked babies and men with misshapen bodies knock on car
windows, begging for a few rupees. Once out of official New Delhi,
the jhuggis, or slums, sprawl outward from the highways.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    In November, the Crafts Museum, opposite the Purana Qila on
Mathura Road, (91-11) 337-1641, will have dozens of dhurrie
weavers, potters and other artisans working in a plaza where
visitors can talk to them and watch them.
 &HT;    The museum itself, a series of galleries in village huts, is a
wondrous collection of the folk and tribal arts and crafts of
India, which still provide a livelihood to more than 20 million
people. Admission is free.
 &HT;    The sound and light shows at the Red Fort, which run nightly for
50 cents a person, is schmaltzy but enjoyable entertainment. From
molded plastic chairs, the audience watches as the mosques and
minarets around the courtyard are illuminated by lurid lights.
 &HT;    A disembodied, mellifluous voice tells the story of the fort,
first in Hindi, then half an hour later, at 7:30, in English,
punctuated by the screams of women and the thunder of horses'
hooves. Tickets can be bought at the entry to the Fort and at the
Ashok, Janpath and Lodhi hotels.
 &HT;    On Nov. 15, Birju Maharaj will perform the classical Indian
dance of Kathak at Siri Fort Cultural Complex, Khel Gaon Marg. Time
and ticket prices have not yet been set. Call (91-11) 462-2033 for
information.
 &HT;    The story of Lord Shiva, one of the incarnations of the Hindu
god Vishnu, will be told in a regional dance of the state of
Orissa, Odissi, performed by Reela Hota. Call (91-11) 371-4307 to
get an invitation for free admission to the dance, Nov. 30 at 6:45
p.m. at the Sri Ram Center of Art and Culture, 4 Safdar Hashmi
Marg.
 &HT;    Sonal Mansingh will perform the classical Bharatnatyam dance at
the India International Center auditorium, 40 Lodi Estates, on Nov.
30 and Dec. 1 at 6:30 p.m. A call to (91-11) 461-9431 will produce
a free invitation.
 &HT;    For more listings of sights and cultural events, pick up the
weekly Delhi Diary at any newsstand.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    Raj Ghat, the memorial to Mohandas K. Gandhi, father of the
nation, is moving, not because of the simple petal-strewn marble
platform but because of the pilgrims who touch it with reverence
and emotion.
 &HT;    With luggage balanced on their heads, they circle the memorial
in a kind of mourning dance that has never ended since his
assassination 50 years ago. It is set in a well-kept park east of
the Red Fort, between the Ring Road and the Yamuna River.
 &HT;    Chandni Chowk, a shopping area from the Mughal era and still a
thriving marketplace, has been spruced up. Here Delhiites buy
everything from electrical appliances to deep-fried sweets at
Jalebi Wala, an open-air shop where men squirt the pretzel shaped

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    New Year's Eve, 1998? Think of it as practice.
 &HT;    Most serious party lovers already have their eyes on the bash of
the century, Dec. 31, 1999. Many of them have already made their
plans, and plenty of hotels have been booked for ages.
 &HT;    But for travelers who haven't decided what to do, here's a
selection of travel-related parties that should make it easy to
welcome in the millennium with a bang. Prices are based on
double-occupancy unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;    The Big Apple looms large for party-goers on the ultimate New
Year's Eve, and the Rhiga Royal Hotel (151 West 54th St., New York,
N.Y. 10019; 800-937-5454) has a deal for couples from Dec. 31 to
Jan. 2, 1999.
 &HT;    Chauffeur-driven limousine transportation brings guests to one
of the hotel's Grand Royal Penthouse suites that overlook Central
Park and the Hudson River.
 &HT;    On New Year's Eve, each couple is brought by limousine to the
Rainbow Room to ring in the millennium with a dinner dance. New
Year's Day starts with breakfast en-suite and continues with a
Broadway show of the couple's choice.
 &HT;    The final day brings brunch and the bill _ just $10,000 per
couple.
 &HT;    Down in the Caribbean, the Bitter End Yacht Club (North Sound,
Virgin Gorda, BVI; 800-872-2392) has cozy hillside and beachfront
villas, a sailing school and a recipe for a party.
 &HT;    The BEYC 2000 Celebration is a 10-day package that includes a
millennium bash with 15 different bands from Virgin Gorda playing a
12-hour session on New Year's Eve. The partying will take place on
shore and on boats, with a fireworks display at midnight.
 &HT;    The package includes accommodations, transfers, all meals,
beverages, use of boats, all entertainment and theme dinners. The
cost is $10,800 per couple, based on double occupancy.
 &HT;    Perhaps the tranquility of the English countryside beckons on
this special New Year's? The Lygon Arms (High Street, Broadway,
WR12 7DU, England; 800-63-SAVOY), located in the Cotswolds, has a
three-night package that will mark the millennium as well as its
own 500 year anniversary.
 &HT;    The millennium package at this Savoy Group hotel includes a
helicopter tour of the Cotswolds, a New Year's Eve ball and the
services of both a graphologist and a psychic on New Year's Day to
help everyone peer a little bit farther into the future.
 &HT;    Accommodations and most meals are included in the price, which
is $1,411 per person.
 &HT;    The Broadmoor (Box 1439, Colorado Springs, Colo. 80901;
800-634-7711) which dates from 1918, is one of the grandest hotels
in the West.
 &HT;    This Rocky Mountain treasure will have ``A Celebration of the
Centuries,'' an all-inclusive weekend party that offers activities
ranging from a dinner dance to a New Year's Eve show with
Bernadette Peters and the Temptations.
 &HT;    New Year's Day will feature Bloody Mary ``First Aid Stations.''
Such classic Colorado pleasures as horse-drawn sleigh-and-carriage
rides will be available during the quieter moments. The cost starts
at $2,500 per person.
 &HT;    Both Royal Caribbean International (1050 Caribbean Way, Miami,
Fla. 33132; 800-327-6700) and Celebrity Cruises (1050 Caribbean
Way, Miami, Fla. 33132; 800-437-3111) have announced ambitious
millennium plans for cruisers.
 &HT;    For example, Royal Caribbean's ``Voyager of the Seas,''
``Enchantment of the Seas,'' ``Grandeur of the Seas,'' ``Sovereign
of the Seas'' and Celebrity's ``Century'' will convene at midnight
on New Year's Eve off Coco Cay in the Bahamas for a fireworks
display in the midst of individual millennium itineraries. Contact
a travel agent or cruise-only agent for prices.
 &HT;    The Ritz-Carlton (3414 Peachtree Road N.E., Suite 300, Atlanta
Ga. 30326; 800-241-3333) has the Ultimate Experience. Reserved for
just one couple at each of the Ritz-Carlton hotels, the package
includes three nights in the Ritz Carlton Suite, the premier suite
in each hotel, which includes a private dining room and butler.
 &HT;    Men receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Chronograph while ladies
receive an 18-karat gold Bulgari Quadrato.
 &HT;    The two lucky guests also receive a magnum of Taittinger
champagne, two Baccarat flutes, limousine transfers and a Jaguar at
their disposal all weekend. All meals and parties are included.
 &HT;    For example, conductor Peter Duchin will be on hand at the
Ritz-Carlton, Boston, while Lou Rawls will hold court at The
Ritz-Carlton, Naples (Fla.).
 &HT;    The price for the Ultimate Experience is $100,000 per couple.
For those who aren't prepared to part with that kind of change,
there are packages with three-night minimum stays that start at
$450 per room, per night. Contact Ritz-Carlton for a Millennium
Experience brochure.
 &HT;    Finally, for those who absolutely must be together with their
closest friends in New York City on New Year's Eve, the Fitzpatrick
Manhattan Hotel (687 Lexington Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022;
212-355-0100) is prepared.
 &HT;    This midtown New York hotel with an Irish flavor is offering one
enterprising celebrant and 181 of their closest friends the chance
to take over the entire 17-story hotel for three nights. That's 51
suites and 40 rooms, with a two- person limit per room.
 &HT;    All food, alcohol and entertainment are included, as are a New
York Harbor cruise with a Swing Band on board and a New Year's Eve
extravaganza with a Motown Band and a Medieval Banquet.
 &HT;    The cost? A cool $1 million. Well, it only happens once a
century.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While the cost of flying continues to creep up, a few airlines
are trying to lure fliers ages 62 and older to their camps by
making changes to, and improving on, their discount programs.
</P>
<P>
   Fares are available to seniors in some selected markets at half
the cost of tickets bought with the popular senior-discount
coupons. For example, mature travelers could have flown round-trip
between New York and Chicago for as little as $138 under one new
club program, compared with $270 to $298 using senior-discount
coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Senior fliers will save some nice money with these recent
changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Continental becomes the third major airline to set up a
senior-fare discount club.
</P>
<P>
   _ America West has expanded its newly restored ``Senior Saver
Pak'' coupon program to include more destinations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONTINENTAL'S CLUB &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the savings from other senior-discount clubs are based on
zone fares, Continental's new ``Freedom Flight Club'' offers fliers
ages 62 and older a savings of 15 percent to 20 percent off the
lowest published fares _ domestic or international.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Continental claims that unlike other airlines, its new
program has no capacity controls and requires no specified days or
times of travel. If any coach seat is available on the flight you
select, you get it.
</P>
<P>
   Club members get 20 percent discounts on weekdays, 15 percent on
weekends, on flights between Continental cities throughout the
United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico, Central and South America
and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Continental recently posted a limited-time,
promotional round-trip airfare between New York and Chicago of
$242. With 20 percent off, ``Freedom Flight Club'' members could
get those tickets at $196. In contrast, tickets purchased with
Continental's ``Freedom Trips'' senior-discount coupons would have
cost $270.
</P>
<P>
   A yearly Freedom Flight Club membership costs $75 for domestic
travel, an extra $50 for international travel. So far there is no
enrollment deadline. For more information, call (800) 248-8996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OTHER SENIOR CLUBS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where you live and where you fly most frequently should play a
part in your decision to join a particular senior-discount club.
</P>
<P>
   If you do not live in any cities served by American Airlines,
there would be no savings for you in its ``AActive American Travel
Club.''
</P>
<P>
   That club, like Delta's SkyWise club program, is based on a
complicated series of zone fares that, at worst, offer the same
fares as those available to senior-discount coupon holders and, at
best, offer spectacular savings.
</P>
<P>
   Round-trip flights between New York and Los Angeles cost $298
for both AActive American members and holders of American's
``Senior TrAAveler'' coupons. But a New York-Chicago round trip,
which also costs coupon holders $298, costs AActive American
members only $138 _ more than half off an already discounted
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Both Delta and American clubs require 14-day advance purchase
and overnight stays on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   There are also many blackout dates when you may not use club
discounts, and the AActive American club has additional blackouts
for some international zones. Delta's club program is not available
on international flights.
</P>
<P>
   AActive American membership costs $40 a year, and a senior
companion can enroll for an extra $30. Delta's SkyWise club
memberships also cost senior travelers $40 a year, with additional
memberships for companions of any age costing an extra $25.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their clubs, all three airlines _ Continental,
American and Delta _ still tout senior-discount programs they
offered earlier: flat-rate coupons and 10 percent discounts for all
travelers ages 62 and older. Club discounts don't apply to any
other discount plan.
</P>
<P>
   For information on AActive American Travelers Club, call
(800)421-5600; for Delta SkyWise, call (800) 325-3750. (The SkyWise
enrollment period, which was originally scheduled to close Sept.
15, has been extended.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AW EXPANDS PROGRAM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   America West Express passengers ages 62 and older and their
accompanying grandchildren may now use America West's newly
re-instated ``Senior Savers Pak'' discount coupons.
</P>
<P>
   The move opens the program to residents of 18 smaller cities in
the West. America West only recently restored the Senior Savers Pak
discount coupons after closing the program for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Coupons cost $548 for a book of four. America West Express
passengers pay an extra $5 per flight. Coupons can also be used by
grandchildren ages 2 to 11 who are flying with a coupon-holder age
62 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Buy coupons from your travel agent or America West, (800)
235-9292.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 49 AND HOLDING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through Dec. 20, the Holiday Inn Hotel &AMP; Suites Main Gate East
in Orlando, Fla., is offering travelers ages 50 and older a ``49
and Holding'' package for $49/night. You get: free continental
breakfasts, free children's activities for the grandkids in the
Camp Holiday program, a coffee mug, and a collector's Mason jar
touting the hotel's 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   If you are traveling with grandkids between the ages of 3 and
12, they stay and eat free, and Holiday Inn will outfit you with a
free pager when you go off the premises. For more information, call
(800) 366-5437.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WARBIRDS ON DISPLAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Warbirds at Tom Reilly's Flying Tigers Warbird Restoration
Museum'' (what a name!) at 231 N. Hoagland Blvd., in Kissimmee,
Fla., features a cross-section of this century's aviation history:
B-25s, Corsairs and F104 Starfighters.
</P>
<P>
   Museum guests are encouraged to look, see and touch these
aircraft, and once a month a ride is given in the B-25 Mitchell
bomber to a lucky museum visitor. Special events are matched with
dates like Pearl Harbor and Veterans' days.
</P>
<P>
   Mature travelers pay $6 admission, $2 off the regular rate.
Warbird rides are extra and start at about $140. For more
information, call (407) 933-1942.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENGLAND'S WAR MUSEUM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're heading to England, go to Duxford to see the Imperial
War Museum. Admission for mature travelers is a little over 4
pounds compared to 7 pounds for other adults. The museum has
regular air shows, so call 01223-835000 to see what's scheduled.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Travelers who've been almost everywhere can be hard to please
when Christmas rolls around. So here are a few suggestions to put
under the Christmas tree. Rates are per-person, based on double
occupancy. (Wrapping is optional.)
 &HT;    For James Bond fans, what could be better than a stay at
Goldeneye, the former home of author Ian Fleming in Oracabessa,
Jamaica.
 &HT;    This is the tropical getaway where the late Fleming wrote most
of the Bond novels, and some of his original furniture and
photographs remain.
 &HT;    The property was made available to the public in 1998 by its
current owner, Chris Blackwell, the man behind the Island Outpost
hotel group and Island Records.
 &HT;    The tab for renting the three-bedroom house that can sleep up to
six people? Just $5,000 per day, including all meals and drinks
(Island Outpost, 1330 Ocean Drive, Miami Beach, Fla. 33139;
800-OUTPOST).
 &HT;    For the hungry traveler, use a linen napkin to gift-wrap ``Great
Restaurants: Bordeaux to the Mediterranean,'' a moveable feast
through France from Sept. 12 to 18, 1999.
 &HT;    During this seven-day, six-night trip, participants manage to
eat at 11 Michelin-starred restaurants, including Les Pris
d'Euginie and Les Jardins de L'Opira.
 &HT;    Guests stay in country inns, enjoy sightseeing excursions in the
Pyrenees and taste regional wines.
 &HT;    The price for this gastronomic indulgence is $3,995 from France
in Your Glass (814 35th Ave., Seattle, Wash. 98122; 800-578-0903;
www.inyourglass.com).
 &HT;    How about a quick trip to London? Well, there's always the
Concorde. British Airways has a luxurious package for those who are
long on cash but short on time.
 &HT;    Passengers fly from New York to London on the supersonic
Concorde, stay three nights at the five-star Claridges hotel and
return in Club World business class. They get daily full English
breakfast, service charges, VAT and a chauffeur-driven private car
from Heathrow as well.
 &HT;    The tab is $5,829 and for $900, they can upgrade to the Concorde
for the return flight. (British Airways, Holiday Desk, 75-20
Astoria Blvd., Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; 800-876-2200).
 &HT;    For friends who always insist upon staying at the best places, a
more affordable gift might be a subscription to ``Andrew Harper's
Hideaway Report'' (Box 50, Sun Valley, Idaho 83353; fax only,
406-862-3486;).
 &HT;    The last word in five-star hotel and resort reviews, this is the
monthly bible for those who prefer to lay their heads only on the
best pillows. The cost of keeping up with world-wide luxury is $135
for 12 issues.
 &HT;    Few countries in the Middle East are as remote as Yemen, a
county best appreciated through its archaeological treasures. So
consider a 17-day archaeological tour of the country from Nov. 13
to 29, 1999, led by Dr. Trevor Marchand of the University of London
and offered by Archaeological Tours (271 Madison Ave., Suite 904,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-986-3054).
 &HT;    Including Sana'a and the ancient villages of Wadi Hadhramawt,
the cost is $5,075 _ including airfare from New York.
 &HT;    Far from the Middle East, polar bears roam the west coast of
Canada's Hudson Bay. The best and the safest way to view them is on
a tour with Natural Habitat Adventures (2945 Center Green Court,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-543-8917).
 &HT;    These are six- to nine-day trips that go from Winnipeg, Manitoba
to Churchill, a grain port on Hudson Bay.
 &HT;    Over a thousand bears typically stop near Churchill on their
annual fall migration, earning the town the nickname of ``Polar
Bear Capital of the World.'' By using tundra vehicles, the animals
can be viewed safely at close range.
 &HT;    The ``Polar Bear Watch'' starts at $2,195, including
accommodation, most meals and round-trip charter flights from
Winnipeg with departures in October and November, 1999.
 &HT;    Dog-lovers on anyone's list might enjoy a dog-sledding
expedition to the Brooks Range in Alaska (American Wilderness
Experience, 2820-A Wilderness Place, Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-444-0099).
 &HT;    These lodge-based trips north of the Arctic Circle promise a
proficiency in mushing by trip's end as well as front-row seats for
the Northern Lights. Prices for a four-day lodge trip start at
$1,700 plus $225 round-trip airfare from Fairbanks.
 &HT;    Speaking of ice, all but one of the six National Hockey League
arenas have closed down or been demolished. Only Maple Leaf Gardens
in Toronto remains, but this is its last season.
 &HT;    For diehard hockey fans who want to catch a last game there with
the Toronto Maple Leafs, there's Roadtrips (177 Lombard Ave., 7th
Floor, Winnipeg, MB, Canada R3B 0W5; 800-465-1765;
www.roadtrips.com).
 &HT;    They have ``Toronto Hall of Fame Getaways'' throughout the
1998-1999 hockey season, two-night packages that include
accommodations in a first-class hotel and seats for one game at
Maple Leaf Gardens. Prices start at $229 and include a pass to the
Hockey Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    Finally, an intriguing gift for the marrying kind comes from
Carnival Cruise Lines (3655 N.W. 87th Ave., Miami, Fla. 33178;
800-933-4968). The cruise line has new on-island wedding ceremonies
on Ocho Rios, Jamaica for $595, on Key West for $595 and on Nassau,
Bahamas for $995.
 &HT;    Those prices include a civil ceremony, photography, decorated
bridal aisle, pre-recorded wedding music, wedding cake, champagne,
flowers and on-island transportation. They do not include the price
of the cruise. Or the ring.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Travelers who've been almost everywhere can be hard to please
when Christmas rolls around. So here are a few suggestions to put
under the Christmas tree. Rates are per-person, based on double
occupancy. (Wrapping is optional.)
 &HT;    For James Bond fans, what could be better than a stay at
Goldeneye, the former home of author Ian Fleming in Oracabessa,
Jamaica.
 &HT;    This is the tropical getaway where the late Fleming wrote most
of the Bond novels, and some of his original furniture and
photographs remain.
 &HT;    The property was made available to the public in 1998 by its
current owner, Chris Blackwell, the man behind the Island Outpost
hotel group and Island Records.
 &HT;    The tab for renting the three-bedroom house that can sleep up to
six people? Just $5,000 per day, including all meals and drinks
(Island Outpost, 1330 Ocean Drive, Miami Beach, Fla. 33139;
800-OUTPOST).
 &HT;    For the hungry traveler, use a linen napkin to gift-wrap ``Great
Restaurants: Bordeaux to the Mediterranean,'' a moveable feast
through France from Sept. 12 to 18, 1999.
 &HT;    During this seven-day, six-night trip, participants manage to
eat at 11 Michelin-starred restaurants, including Les Pris
d'Euginie and Les Jardins de L'Opira.
 &HT;    Guests stay in country inns, enjoy sightseeing excursions in the
Pyrenees and taste regional wines.
 &HT;    The price for this gastronomic indulgence is $3,995 from France
in Your Glass (814 35th Ave., Seattle, Wash. 98122; 800-578-0903;
www.inyourglass.com).
 &HT;    How about a quick trip to London? Well, there's always the
Concorde. British Airways has a luxurious package for those who are
long on cash but short on time.
 &HT;    Passengers fly from New York to London on the supersonic
Concorde, stay three nights at the five-star Claridges hotel and
return in Club World business class. They get daily full English
breakfast, service charges, VAT and a chauffeur-driven private car
from Heathrow as well.
 &HT;    The tab is $5,829 and for $900, they can upgrade to the Concorde
for the return flight. (British Airways, Holiday Desk, 75-20
Astoria Blvd., Jackson Heights, N.Y. 11370; 800-876-2200).
 &HT;    For friends who always insist upon staying at the best places, a
more affordable gift might be a subscription to ``Andrew Harper's
Hideaway Report'' (Box 50, Sun Valley, Idaho 83353; fax only,
406-862-3486;).
 &HT;    The last word in five-star hotel and resort reviews, this is the
monthly bible for those who prefer to lay their heads only on the
best pillows. The cost of keeping up with world-wide luxury is $135
for 12 issues.
 &HT;    Few countries in the Middle East are as remote as Yemen, a
county best appreciated through its archaeological treasures. So
consider a 17-day archaeological tour of the country from Nov. 13
to 29, 1999, led by Dr. Trevor Marchand of the University of London
and offered by Archaeological Tours (271 Madison Ave., Suite 904,
New York, N.Y. 10016; 212-986-3054).
 &HT;    Including Sana'a and the ancient villages of Wadi Hadhramawt,
the cost is $5,075 _ including airfare from New York.
 &HT;    Far from the Middle East, polar bears roam the west coast of
Canada's Hudson Bay. The best and the safest way to view them is on
a tour with Natural Habitat Adventures (2945 Center Green Court,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-543-8917).
 &HT;    These are six- to nine-day trips that go from Winnipeg, Manitoba
to Churchill, a grain port on Hudson Bay.
 &HT;    Over a thousand bears typically stop near Churchill on their
annual fall migration, earning the town the nickname of ``Polar
Bear Capital of the World.'' By using tundra vehicles, the animals
can be viewed safely at close range.
 &HT;    The ``Polar Bear Watch'' starts at $2,195, including
accommodation, most meals and round-trip charter flights from
Winnipeg with departures in October and November, 1999.
 &HT;    Dog-lovers on anyone's list might enjoy a dog-sledding
expedition to the Brooks Range in Alaska (American Wilderness
Experience, 2820-A Wilderness Place, Boulder, Colo. 80301;
800-444-0099).
 &HT;    These lodge-based trips north of the Arctic Circle promise a
proficiency in mushing by trip's end as well as front-row seats for
the Northern Lights. Prices for a four-day lodge trip start at
$1,700 plus $225 round-trip airfare from Fairbanks.
 &HT;    Speaking of ice, all but one of the six National Hockey League
arenas have closed down or been demolished. Only Maple Leaf Gardens
in Toronto remains, but this is its last season.
 &HT;    For diehard hockey fans who want to catch a last game there with
the Toronto Maple Leafs, there's Roadtrips (177 Lombard Ave., 7th
Floor, Winnipeg, MB, Canada R3B 0W5; 800-465-1765;
www.roadtrips.com).
 &HT;    They have ``Toronto Hall of Fame Getaways'' throughout the
1998-1999 hockey season, two-night packages that include
accommodations in a first-class hotel and seats for one game at
Maple Leaf Gardens. Prices start at $229 and include a pass to the
Hockey Hall of Fame.
 &HT;    Finally, an intriguing gift for the marrying kind comes from
Carnival Cruise Lines (3655 N.W. 87th Ave., Miami, Fla. 33178;
800-933-4968). The cruise line has new on-island wedding ceremonies
on Ocho Rios, Jamaica for $595, on Key West for $595 and on Nassau,
Bahamas for $995.
 &HT;    Those prices include a civil ceremony, photography, decorated
bridal aisle, pre-recorded wedding music, wedding cake, champagne,
flowers and on-island transportation. They do not include the price
of the cruise. Or the ring.

 WASHINGTON: ... were injured.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Wood, the Nutter, McClennen &AMP; Fish lawyer, said that is only
true of older and more familiar markets. Because software is a
newer, less understood market, courts may be hesitant to impose
controls on Microsoft unless the government offers solid economic
evidence to show the company harmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is saying, `We are not trying to maintain a monopoly
or to stifle competition. We are trying to produce good products,
to pursue consumer good and consumer value,''' Wood said. ``The
government needs to show more of why consumers don't enjoy as much
innovation or as good prices as they could have.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the government likely cannot prove that Windows is a
monopoly merely by citing its 90 percent market share. &UR;  &LR; It will
need economic data to counter Microsoft's claims that its hold on
the market is incomplete and insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it should not be punished merely because computer
buyers have decided its product is the best available. Moreover, it
says that any smart person with a little capital can design a
product that dethrones Windows. A true monopolist would not have to
relentlessly improve Windows to hold market share, and it would be
able to charge higher prices for Windows than Microsoft does.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the government, in the ongoing antitrust
trial, has made headway in arguing that Microsoft's Internet
browser should be marketed as a separate product from Windows.
Microsoft's practice of bundling the two products _ and including
the browser for free _ severely hurt Netscape's ability to win new
customers.
</P>
<P>
   In June, an Appeals Court backed Microsoft's practice of selling
the two products as one. But Wood and Doyle said the government, in
the current antitrust case, has presented evidence suggesting that
Microsoft combined the two products to hurt Netscape, not to help
consumers. That evidence was not presented to the Appeals Court. It
could persuade Jackson, the district court judge, to rule that the
two products are improperly linked, and allow him to be upheld on
appeal. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, however, saw one significant problem with the
government's case so far. It has spent too much time attacking
Gates's credibility, he said. It has spent too much time trying to
show that Gates, in depositions, tried to mislead the government
about his knowledge of Microsoft's tactics against Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is personalizing the case too much,'' Doyle
said. ``That could prove detrimental in the long run. They should
focus on the behavior of the company rather than on the
personalities of the individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLAIMS AGAINST MICROSOFT AND ITS RESPONSES
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the Microsoft trial enters its fourth week, the following
claims have been made by witnesses and attorneys in the case:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
David Boies, lead attorney for the Justice Department &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Microsoft illegally used the monopoly power of its
Windows software to crush competitors. This strategy comes directly
from chairman Bill Gates, who lied about it in depositions.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft response: The company is not a monopoly. It competes
aggressively but legally. Demonizing Gates does not amount to proof
of anticompetitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
James Barksdale, chief executive, Netscape Communications Corp. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Microsoft illegally tried to carve up the browser market
and implied it would deny Netscape important Windows technical
information if it did not agree.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft response: Netscape account is ``fantastical.'' No
market division was offered or occurred. Netscape distributes
millions of copies of its browser, showing that Microsoft has not
crushed it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Colburn, senior vice president of business affairs,
America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Microsoft offered to build easy access to AOL's on-line
service into Windows _ if AOL would dump Netscape's browser in
favor of Microsoft's. AOL agreed because the offer was too good to
pass up.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's response: AOL chose Microsoft's browser for its
better technology. AOL and Netscape were also colluding to hurt
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Avadis Tevanian Jr., senior vice president of software
engineering, Apple Computer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Claim: Microsoft threatened to end production of crucial office
software for Apple computers if Apple did not promote Microsoft's
browser. Microsoft also tried to bully Apple to abandon an
important ``multimedia'' software product.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft response: The browser deal was part of a larger
investment in Apple to help shore up the troubled company. The
multimedia charge is false.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates (by videotaped deposition), chairman, Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Claim: He had no knowledge of attempts to bully Netscape or to
divide the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   Government response: Internal company e-mails show otherwise.

FLUTIE CAN'T PULL OUT A TROPHY WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Did somebody say, ``Vinny Flakes''?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe ``Vinny Pasta.'' Whatever. What we do know is that
Sunday's game had nothing to do with the 1984 Heisman Trophy
winner. It was all about the 1986 winner, his big plays and his
team's decisive 34-12 victory in an AFC East showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde of the Jets was so good, and his team's triumph
so complete, that he was given the ultimate tribute by coach Bill
Parcells. He got to watch the final five minutes or so standing on
the sideline wearing the obligatory baseball cap as ex-Patriot Ray
Lucas performed mopup duties. Hey, with 22-for-31, 258-yard,
three-TD numbers, he had earned the star treatment. He even had an
18-yard scramble, if you can believe that.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Bills' Doug Flutie, there was never even a hint of
mania. He was rendered boringly mortal by a Bill Belichick-inspired
Jets' defense that limited him to 12-for-30 passing, 154 yards, and
two interceptions, and which, more important, kept him out of the
end zone, sometimes despite some pretty nice field position.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, it had to be the defense, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Buffalo coach Wade Phillips. ``They didn't show
us anything we didn't expect,'' said Bum's Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie agreed _ almost. ``I can't say it was any one specific
thing,'' he said with a shrug. ``They put some pressure on me. I
had to get rid of it. They made plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about the situation a little more, Flutie did
acknowledge one thing. ``They did run a 4-4,'' he said. ``That was
a look we hadn't seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was the Jets' defense or the Bills' lack of offensive
execution, the end result was a touchdown-free game for the Bills.
And there were chances. Good chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills came up with three Jets turnovers in the first half,
out of which the visitors fashioned 3 points. This is a formula for
failure in the National Football League. No none will argue that
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we didn't take advantage of three turnovers in the first
half,'' pointed out Phillips, ``that was the difference in the ball
game. Then I thought we lost our poise a little in the second
half.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense got us some turnovers in the first half,''
confirmed Flutie, ``and we wound up with field goals instead of
touchdowns. We had our opportunities early, and we didn't take
advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie has gotten full credit for all the good Buffalo
happenings during the previous five weeks, so he must be ready to
accept a lot of the blame for this sorry offensive performance at
Giants Stadium. He was limited to little bursts of energy. He was
never able to sustain any offense for his team. He never ran away
from anybody. He never made any chicken salad out of chicken
excrement. He was an ineffective NFL quarterback, period. And he
knew it.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the ball over at the Jets 38 (following an interception
on Testaverde's first play from scrimmage), the Jets 37, and the
Jets 49, the best Flutie and the Bills could generate was one Steve
Christie field goal. In one particularly unproductive stretch
overlapping the end of the second quarter and the first five
minutes of the third, Flutie had a killer interception followed by
back-to-back three-and-outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day,'' Flutie said. ``I've gone five years
since I had one of these games.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst transgression was an interception that came with 27
seconds remaining in the half. The Jets were leading, 10-9. The
Bills had the ball at their 40. On first and 10, Flutie tried to
connect with Eric Moulds, but Otis Smith got there first. Vinny the
QB hit Dedric Ward for 25 _ one of his many big plays for the
born-again signal-caller _ and John Hall nailed a 43-yard field
goal. That was a very bad juxtaposition, and Flutie was ready to
assume full responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one ball I wish I had back,'' Flutie declared. ``I
didn't lead him enough. It would have been a big gainer if I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is used to the idea that most outsiders now regard all
Buffalo games as Flutie morality plays, which doesn't mean he has
to like it. When the mentor began to reflect on this game, he saw a
lot more problems than an unproductive quarterback. In fact, 12
points and no touchdowns notwithstanding, Phillips was more
concerned about something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was horrible,'' he said. ``It was absolutely
horrible on third down and fourth down.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that the Tuna, as he always does, went for
it on fourth down when given half a chance. There was a
fourth-and-6 at the Buffalo 35 with the Jets leading by a 20-12
score late in the third quarter. Vinny hit Keyshawn Johnson for the
needed 7 yards, and five plays later he hit Wayne Chrebet for a
12-yard TD pass to put the game completely out of Buffalo's feeble
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Both the losing coach and the losing quarterback had nothing but
good things to say about Testaverde. As for the losing QB's own
self-appraisal?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bad day,'' said Flutie, ``but I'm going to keep
swinging. Nothing's going to change. I'm going to let it fly. I'm
not going to fold up the tent. I don't accept losing very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   He is 36, and there is nothing he can take with a loss. ``You
look at the film and you correct your mistakes,'' he said. ``But
you can correct your mistakes with a win, too.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows very well who the next opponent is, but he says it's
not going to be a big deal because it's in Rich Stadium and not in
Foxborough, Mass. He knows that if he doesn't play better than he
did Sunday, the anti-Flutie bill of particulars once again will be
rehashed. It will be a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately deal as
long as he plays on this side of the border, even if he's supposed
to be the starter for the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches can change their minds, too,'' said Doug Flutie.
</P>

A PINCH OF HUMILITY IS NOW IN THE RECIPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This time, maybe just in the nick of time,
they seemed to get it. Unfortunately for them, they really had to
get it before they finally got it, but at least when the debacle
was over Sunday no one was in denial anymore in the New England
Patriots' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   No one. Not after this. And maybe that will save them from
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``From almost every opportunity we had early on, we couldn't do
anything,'' coach Pete Carroll said after he stood stunned on the
sidelines and watched ``the most talented team in the AFC East'' be
destroyed by the Atlanta Falcons, 41-10. ``There is no place to
look here where there is any bright spot. There's no silver lining
here in any manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just a horrific display of football. That's where we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   That is indeed where the Patriots are this morning. They are 5-4
and fighting to keep afloat coming off a performance so horrific
their coach used that word twice to describe it.
</P>
<P>
   They are 5-4 and back in the pack and no longer _ they can only
hope _ a team believing they are the most talented in the AFC East,
as they have been described so often by so many people that they
actually began to believe it despite having no evidence to support
that besides talking heads on TV saying it and empty heads in
newspapers writing it.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, they were a team in denial. They were slapped
around by the Denver Broncos in a game far closer to a blowout
(remember how it started off 17-0?) than a 6-point loss yet
believed they'd been competitive when in fact some of their best
players had been their own worst enemies.
</P>
<P>
   They lost to the Jets and the Dolphins and said they just needed
to make a few more plays when they had consistently made none,
denying the evidence of who they were that was in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   Then came last week's game in Indianapolis. It was a game that
Drew Bledsoe and a handful of his teammates saw for what it was. It
was not a victory. It was an escape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet most of the young men in their locker room insisted they
were all right. They said there was no reason to panic. They said
they hadn't played their best football yet. They knew they were
better than they seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Falcons came to town Sunday and destroyed the myth of
the Patriots' assumed superiority. Atlanta destroyed the lie that
they were the most talented team in the AFC East and made them face
reality, which simply is that they are a good team like a lot of
good teams in the NFL today. They are a team that can win _ or lose
_ any game, any time, depending on if they are prepared to kick and
scrap and fight on every play. Every play, not half of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we're not that talented,'' Bledsoe said in a whisper
late Sunday, long after the locker room had been all but abandoned.
``I don't know what the attitude of individual guys was after the
Colt game, but I knew then we were going to have to continue to
raise our level of play if we wanted to win. We didn't do that, so
you get what you had today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Injuries are not an excuse to play the way we played. We kind
of rolled over for them today.''
</P>
<P>
   They rolled over. They got pummeled. They took a beating. They
got mugged. They were lambasted. They ... well you get the picture,
but most of all, it was another game against another elite team
(say what you will, the Falcons are 13-4 in their last 17 games) in
which they were destroyed in a hurry, down, 28-3, by halftime in
part because of a coaching blunder when Carroll opted to go for it
on fourth and 2 at the Falcon 13 with the score already 21-3 and
his team floundering and in need of any kind of success.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of taking the chip-shot field goal just to calm the
waters, he went for the score and got one _ a 71-yard fumble return
by Atlanta defensive end Chuck Smith after Bledsoe was sacked by
Lester Archambeau and the ball popped loose. It was all over after
that with 30 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The field goal didn't look that significant at the time,''
Carroll said. ``As you look at it now, we would have loved to have
it because that play was an enormous play in the game. I just
thought we had a chance with a couple of yards there to go ahead
and make a first down. We thought we had a good call. We thought we
could make it. We went in with that thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they thought wrong, which is fitting because for too long
the Patriots have been a team that thinks wrong. Self-confidence is
a good thing. Self-indulgence is not. And these Patriots have
indulged themselves with their personal delusions all summer and
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has come to this. It has come to a moment when no one can
deny any more what their old mentor used to say. You are what you
are, and this morning they are 5-4 and a battered team.
</P>
<P>
   But, just as they were not as good as they seemed when they beat
the Kansas City Chiefs, 40-10, a month ago, they are not as bad as
the team that made a 61-point reversal of fortunes Sunday, losing
by 31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, like a drunk who has to hit skid row to know he has a
problem, the New England Patriots hit bottom and saw what they'd
become. They are a team in trouble but also one that can play
better than it has the past month if each one of them will resolve
to take care of his own business and accept responsibility for his
actions every play. Not on the big plays but on all the plays,
because you never know when the biggest play will come.
</P>
<P>
   They are a team that needed to acknowledge, as Lawyer Milloy
jokingly did last night, ``It's time to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   What he meant is not that panic was the solution. What he meant
was that it was time to stop talking about how talented they are
and show it. It is time to realize they are not good enough to win
if they make mistakes, not good enough to win if they commit
lame-brain penalties, not good enough to win if they line up in the
wrong spot or play the wrong coverage or end up with their blockers
all standing up while their running back or quarterback is lying
down, not good enough to win if they can't manage the clock or
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the Broncos or the Vikings or the Packers. Frankly,
at least for the moment, they are not even the Jets. They are who
they are, a team that needs to understand just how hard it is for
them to win every Sunday because there is not much difference
between this most talented team in the AFC East and everybody else
in the AFC.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, at last, they seemed to understand that. Nothing could
gloss over what happened this time. No one could deny the obvious
any more. Most important, no one tried this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here expected it to be this way,'' said Willie Clay.
``Sometimes, when you have some success, you assume things are
going to happen for you. They haven't, so right now we're lacking
in confidence. Our confidence is shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is embarrassing. It's shocking. We never thought we'd be
on this side of the ball. It's now or never, in my eyes. Panic has
been here already. A few more games like this and there won't be
panic. It'll be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, for the first time, the Patriots really seemed to get
it. Now we'll see what they do about it, because it's not too late
... unless it's already over. Only the real Patriots, whoever they
are, can decide that.

 COMPASSION FOR A 'LEFTOVER' CHILD 
 FOR USE FRI., OCT. 30, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.
</HEADLINE>
 
 EDITORS: Here is a repeat of a Dr. Laura column for clients needing
it to finish out the month, plus a sample of a new column from New
York Times Special Features: Dr. Joy. See advisory slugged By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: I just got married and my husband's 7-year-old
daughter hates me. Do I have to take abuse from her just because I
married her dad? _ Detroit
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Of course she hates you, and if you were in her
position you'd hate you, too. You not only dashed her childish
fantasy that her mom and dad would get back together, but in her
mind you've stolen her dad from her. Even if the two of you were
terrific friends during the courtship, now that it's for real it's
all different. If her dad was silly enough to spring your marriage
on her, both of you owe her an apology.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is she's only 7; the bad news is that ``leftover
children'' from the man's first marriage are a major cause of
breakup of the second marriage.
</P>
<P>
   If you can remember being 7, you will have a huge advantage with
this little charmer. She's hurt and afraid and confused. She needs
to know that her dad still loves her, that you're not trying to be
her mother and that you're not going to be the wicked stepmother
she's heard about in bedtime stories and from her friends and
Grandmother. Try to be an auntie or a big sister. If you can be
patient, kind, understanding when she feels you're her rival, you
probably will have a very good friend when she's old enough to
appreciate that you didn't try to become her mother at a time she
felt the world had caved in on her.
</P>
<P>
   And I bet you'll find yourself with a happy marriage and a
husband grateful that he didn't have to choose between the two of
you.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I try to be a good guy, treat women right, be
sensitive to their feelings and needs, but they always go for the
bad guys instead and think I'm a wimp. I'm ready to change, but
where can I find bad-guy lessons? _ Toronto
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: The question is more where you can find
stop-feeling-sorry-for-yourself lessons. Be who you really are in a
relationship _ your best, truest self, right from the beginning.
Don't pretend to be some half-baked macho fantasy notion of how you
think ``real'' men act. No bad-guy lessons for you _ just a clearer
sense of who you are and how you can be comfortable. A teensy bit
of gentleness and a drop of excitement thrown in can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm concerned about my 9-year-old granddaughter. Her
parents _ my son John and his ex-girlfriend Jan _ broke up 18
months ago. Since then Jan has abused drugs and been with abusive
boyfriends. She has never worked and has made a mess of her life.
Now my granddaughter has become nasty, unappreciative, irritable
and just a pain in the neck. She's become a miniature Jan! What can
I do? _ West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: If you think Jan is an unfit mom, you're obligated to
get your granddaughter out of there. If not, stay out of it. Sounds
like your granddaughter could use a hug rather than criticism. Tell
her you love her and bite your tongue when you feel like saying
``If only you weren't such a monster'' or ``You're just like your
mother!''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm 50, and my mom treats me like a 4-year-old. No
matter what the topic of conversation, when I suggest anything, she
tells me I'm wrong even before I finish. If I hold my ground, she
gets mad. Once she stopped speaking to me for six months because I
disagreed with her! When I try to ignore her, I feel like someone
stuffed a sock in my mouth. _ Seattle, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Take the sock out of your mouth and create a brand-new
relationship with your mom. You mother is belittling you _
literally trying to make you little, so she will still be the mom
and you will still be the child. It's the only relationship she
knows how to navigate with you. That's why it's up to you to
change.
</P>
<P>
   Identify new stuff she likes to do. Movies, museums, gardening _
anything as long as it's new and different. Then, do those things
with her. Together you'll find new topics of conversation and build
a friendship instead of a mother-daughter tug-of-war. Then when she
snipes at you, say to her exactly what you'd say to a friend: ``I
love you, but putting me down won't work for us as adults.'' As
soon as you refuse to play, there's no more game.

   &UR; THE PEOPLE I ENVY MOST &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (EDS.: Following is a repeat of the Dr. Laura column released March
14, 1997. It is for clients needing one more column to finish the
month.)
 &UR; By DR. LAURA SCHLESSINGER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you whom I envy _ and you'll be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   I don't envy those who are younger, better-looking, more
successful, more famous, with more apparent potential or with more
``goodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope. I've always pushed myself toward my personal and creative
limits. I don't begrudge others the fruits of their honest labor,
nor have I been motivated by competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   I envy a category of people no one of right mind wants to change
places with.
</P>
<P>
   I envy those who face incomprehensible suffering with dignity,
grace, courage and a determination to make their lives meaningful
despite the conditions or the outrageousness of the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   I envy them because l wonder if I have it in me to respond to
such devastating circumstances without dissolving into terminal
despair.
</P>
<P>
   I'm reminded of this dilemma because of a number of calls and
letters I've received recently from my listeners and readers.
</P>
<P>
   I envy a 25-year-old newlywed who woke up one morning unable to
feel her hands.
</P>
<P>
   She was diagnosed with a progressive and incurable neurological
disorder. Her family _ hurt, frightened and angry _ is outraged
that there could be a God who would cause or permit this tragedy to
happen to such a wonderful young woman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-DRJOY-COLUMN-$ADV30-1000&AMP;ADD-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; (UNDATED: young woman.)
</P>
<P>
   Her reaction is that God is with her as she faces this struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Her reaction is to deepen her relationship with her new husband
and to find a way to make her life meaningful in the context of her
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   I envy Christopher Reeve.
</P>
<P>
   From a wheelchair, barely able to turn his head by himself and
dependent upon a machine for his very breath, he is actively
campaigning for funds directed at spinal-cord-injury research,
directing movies and preparing to star in a remake of ``Rear
Window'' (1954).
</P>
<P>
   His life as he had always known it was ended in an instant by a
freak riding accident. He ``picked himself up'' and got back on
another horse, riding off into a newly designed life.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not glorifying tragedy or suffering_ it scares me as much as
it scares you.
</P>
<P>
   I'm moved by the tenacious spirit of some people to respond to
tragedy and suffering with dignity and a determination to make
something meaningful out of it.
</P>
<P>
   We normally think of heroism in the form of adrenalized,
righteous anger _ the warrior _ or adrenalized, spontaneous action
_ the rescuer.
</P>
<P>
   We don't normally think of heroism in the form of a noble
response to an ugly inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Man's Search For Meaning'' (Touchstone Books, 1984), Viktor
E. Frankl tells about an interview given by a Polish cardiologist
who, during World War II, helped organize the Warsaw Ghetto
uprising. The interviewer exclaimed at the cardiologist's heroism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' the doctor calmly replied, ``to take a gun and shoot
is no great thing, but if the SS leads you to a gas chamber or to a
mass grave to execute you on the spot, and you can't do anything
about it _ except for going your way with dignity _ you see, this
is what I would call heroism.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us seek purpose and meaning in our lives by our creative
work and hobbies, our relationships to family and other loved ones
or our spiritual search.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to see adversity and suffering as rude interruptions in
this rather direct approach to life, success and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   We are therefore stunned and insulted by adversity and too often
respond with rage or withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Our denial of the ultimate realities of life _ mortality and
suffering _ leaves us ill-prepared to incorporate those experiences
as a normal part of human existence.
</P>
<P>
   It is not circumstance that has the power to destroy us.
</P>
<P>
   It is our response to circumstance that has the power to elevate
us to a new and special level of meaning or result in our giving up
on life or taking our pain out on others.
</P>
<P>
   I envy the people who rise to the challenge _ they are my
heroes. I worry, though, that they are just ``made that way,'' and
the rest of us might be relegated to sinking.
</P>
<P>
   I pray that heroism is a choice, and that we can all make
ourselves that way.

  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about

lives.) 
 FOR USE FRI., NOV. 6, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER. 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: Here I am at age 28 with a boyfriend who says I
shouldn't get mad at him when he hollers because he grew up in a
family where everybody screamed at each other. He says his family
is more dysfunctional than mine. _ Hollywood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Jeez! Dueling dysfunctions? I don't think you want to
go there and I definitely don't. Everybody's family _ and I do mean
everybody's _ is dysfunctional. I'm not sure where this national
obsession with blame began, but it's past time to put the
family-as-doomed-destiny thing to rest. We choose how we behave. If
you're unhappy about your boyfriend's behavior, talk with him about
it. Don't let him duck the issue by invoking the Ghost of Family
Past. The dysfunctional family blues are a variation of ``Woe is
me.'' Let's all repeat together: ``I'm in charge of my own life.
I'm responsible. I can function.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I feel guilty all the time. I don't spend enough time
with my kids. My wife complains that I'm cold and indifferent. My
mother, recently widowed, needs me. I'm in the really competitive
field of sales, so my free time is limited, but I try to get in a
couple of workouts each week because my dad had a bad ticker. I
can't please anyone, and when I find some time for myself, I feel
even worse. What should I do? _ Wheeling, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: First, take a deep breath here and relax. Guilt is
feeling good about feeling bad, and it's a colossal waste of time.
You've got a lot on your plate. Feeling tired and under the gun all
the time doesn't help anyone. Adding a huge dollop of guilt will
only sap more time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Sort through your priorities and get better at scheduling. If
you block out specific time to spend with your kids and schedule
private time for you and your wife to keep the spark alive, your
loved ones won't feel they have to beg for your attention. Make
sure you budget some time for yourself _ even if that means going
grocery shopping after work without the kids.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm afraid to let anyone get close to me because I've
been hurt too often. I know the right person will be patient. But
at 44, I've sure kissed a lot of frogs while looking for that
handsome, understanding prince. I'm really a good person. Why am I
still alone? _ Fort Pierce, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Everyone over 16 feels at some point that someone's
done 'em wrong and they're probably right. But this is the time to
take some emotional risks, not wallow in self-pity. I'm not
suggesting you march down to the harbor and pick up the first
sailor you meet. I am suggesting that it's time to get out of your
own way.
</P>
<P>
   Try the ``life is a daring risk or it's nothing at all''
blueprint for a month or two. Come out of your shell a bit. This
may mean taking tango lessons or flirting at the bus stop or
knocking that chip off your shoulder. You're making all those
inattentive men the bad guys. If you're a bristly ball of anger,
everyone will stay away.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been living together for a
year, and I want to get married. I work for him because he's trying
to get his business off the ground. We're living in his house,
which I'm helping to fix up. I love him, but I'm upset because but
every time I bring up the ``m'' word, he changes the subject. _
Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: You write ``welcome'' on your forehead and then you're
surprised when he steps on your face. Your boyfriend isn't
exploiting you. YOU are exploiting you.
</P>
<P>
   If you want your boyfriend to marry you, set a deadline and tell
him about it. If he refuses, move out and get on with your life. No
tears or cajolery. And don't even think about ``accidentally''
getting pregnant. If he wants to spend the rest of his life with
you, give him the opportunity to sort it out. If not, volunteer
with Habitat for Humanity to fix up someone else's home.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My parents divorced 16 years ago when I was 3. I
always thought Dad abandoned us. I've recently gotten in touch with
him and he says Mom and her parents said they'd sic the law on him
if he didn't clear out. I don't know who's telling the truth and
who's lying. _ Salem, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: A long time ago somebody said there are three sides to
every story: my side, your side and the truth. I think this person
was overly optimistic. Most of us can figure out several
``sensible'' versions to support our perspective.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to worry if one of your folks is lying. They
could both be telling the truth -- THEIR version of the truth. If
you look for your own version and leave them to do the same, you
can save a whole lot of wear and tear on your head, heart and
internal organs.

WHEN YOUR CHILD STEALS FOR ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old son is bringing home all sorts of
goodies from school. I don't think they're his, but I don't want to
accuse him of stealing. How common is stealing with kids, and if I
ignore it, are banks next? _ Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: It's not unusual for kids to steal, but it's not
something you want to encourage as a way to garner attention. Don't
condone or ignore his stealing, but shift the emphasis from
negative to positive. Make sure he is not stealing to get
attention. You don't need your kid to be the first jailbird in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is stealing, ask yourself why he is doing this. Who
sees his booty? If no one, he probably wants it for its own sake.
If he shows his friends, he wants their approval. If he shows you,
he's most likely asking for help. He's figured out how to get your
attention, and unfortunately punishing him will only emphasize the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Does he have an older sibling who gets a lot of attention for
sports or grades? Or a new baby in the house? Then he needs
reinforcement from you, including gold stars on the forehead, pats
on the back for positive behavior and help in making purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to accuse him of stealing. Just explain you're
uncomfortable with his trading efforts and to cut it out before
other parents object. Suggest he takes no goodies to school and
brings no goodies home. If he doesn't already have an allowance or
job to pay for his own ``must-haves,'' institute a series of chores
to earn money that you will match.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I've been going with a woman 20 years my junior for a
little over a year. She's been divorced for a little under a year.
While she was married, she had numerous affairs. When I asked her
about them, she gave me sketchy details. Later I found out she'd
lied about the number and length of affairs. I want to leave her,
but I'm supporting her and her two children, ages 5 and 9, since
she doesn't work and doesn't receive sufficient alimony. What
should I do? _ Toronto
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Heavens! So many red flares shot up as I read your
letter my office is on fire. Despite your noble intentions, you've
stumbled into nearly every relationship pitfall there is.
</P>
<P>
   What she did before is none of your business. What matter is
what's going on between the two of you today. Stop supporting this
woman, so both of you can evaluate your feelings for each other.
She needs to grow up, get a job and realize that a romance is not a
rescue. Stop being ``Wally the Wallet'' and take a breather from
this troubled relationship for six months.
</P>
<P>
   After that your head should be clear enough to see who this
woman is as a person _ not a project. If at that time, you still
want to pursue a relationship, proceed with caution. You never know
when a booby trap might spring up and bop you on the shins again.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a guy trying to save money to buy a car, so I'm
living at home while I attend college. But my parents wait up for
me every night and want to know everything that goes on in my life.
Aren't I entitled to any privacy? _ Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Of course, but you may have to get it the old-fashioned
way _ earn it by moving out. Everything in this life has a price
tag. You're finding the price tag for free room and board is
expensive in terms of personal privacy and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Live under your parents' roof and I guarantee you're going to be
treated like a child whether you're 14 or 114. If you're unwilling
to change your living arrangements, compromise. Volunteer
information if they promise not to ask. Tell them you'll be home by
a certain time and say goodnight when you get in. Your parents are
always going to be interested in your life even after you move out.
It doesn't mean they're nosy, just that they're your parents and
they love you.
</P>
<P>
   Your best long-term solution is to earn more independence, which
may mean finding less luxurious housing with a friend, foregoing
the car temporarily, getting a job or finding campus housing in
exchange for some work. Not only will your parents drive you less
crazy, but you'll also feel a lot more grown up.

 &HT;    
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For nearly 60 years Lew Wasserman was one of the most powerful
men in America.
 &HT;    Wasserman and his mentor and partner in MCA/Universal Pictures,
Dr. Jules Stein, made superstars of Bette Davis, Cary Grant, Paul
Newman, Marilyn Monroe and Fred Astaire.
 &HT;    Without them Ronald Reagan might have remained a B-picture actor
past his prime, and Steven Spielberg might still be just a Long
Beach State dropout with a yen to make pictures.
 &HT;    These are some of the revelations made by Dennis McDougal in his
bombshell new book, ``The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the
Hidden History of Hollywood'' (Crown Books).
 &HT;    McDougal writes that Wasserman and Stein underwrote the
presidential aspirations of Ronald Reagan, who owed them both big
time. In the '50s, they gave him a new career on TV with General
Electric theater. In exchange, as president of the Screen Actors
Guild, Reagan sold his union members down the river by denying
their request for residuals from TV producers like Universal.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' says Dennis McDougal, ``Reagan is doing
side deals with Universal that keeps their studio working
throughout the SAG strike.''
 &HT;    With massive research and in meticulous detail, McDougal, a
former Los Angeles Times writer, charts the rise of Wasserman, the
boy from the wrong side of the Cleveland tracks, who started his
career as a cinema usher and rose to the top of the Hollywood heap.
 &HT;    Wasserman and Stein, first as agents then as heads of a movie
empire which encompassed films, music, theme parks and television,
developed a stranglehold on the entertainment industry.
 &HT;    Their methods, McDougal asserts, included every form of coercion
up to and including blackmail. And at the height of their power,
scarcely a picture could be made in America without their say-so.
 &HT;    Presiding over his kingdom from his Universal City black tower,
Wasserman was an enigma. Tall and very thin, with a thick crest of
snow white hair, thick black horn rimmed glasses and an
undertaker's costume of dark suit, white shirt and thin dark tie,
with nary a cigar in sight, he is scarcely the central casting
mogul of Hollywood mythology.
 &HT;    McDougal, whose book looks set to break over the back lots of
Hollywood like an incendiary device, blasts the enigma apart to
offer a grimy backstage reality behind the glittering Hollywood
facade.
 &HT;    Among the revelations: Wasserman, son of Russian immigrants,
loved only two things, money and movies and began his ties with
organized crime through his wife Edie whose attorney father Henry
Beckerman was a front man for the Moe Dalitz Mayfield gang of
Cleveland.
 &HT;    ``Nobody understood,'' contends McDougal, ``that the organized
crime strike force was interested (in MCA's ties to the mob) to the
point where they convened not one but two grand juries to
investigate MCA.''
 &HT;    The feds had received an anonymous letter, which McDougal prints
in the book, that alleged that Wasserman had hired a hit man to
kill his daughter's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Investigations of MCA and Wasserman however had a habit of
coming to naught. One Justice Department probe came to a grinding
halt in the '60s after the death of Marilyn Monroe who was
threatening to reveal all about her relationship with U.S. Attorney
General Robert Kennedy. McDougal implies that Kennedy may have
pulled off his attack dogs in exchange for Wasserman's assistance
with Kennedy's entanglement with Monroe.
 &HT;    The federal prosecutor who was pursuing MCA retired and moved to
a Beverly Hills law firm, where he suddenly died of a heart attack
at 47.
 &HT;    ``I've already been criticized in one prepublication review for
being strong on innuendo,'' McDougal admits. ``There are bold flat
statements about these deaths that I didn't make in the book and I
can't make them now. But I do think it's curious and worthy of
attention because both the Monroe death and the prosecutor's death
came at fortuitously convenient times. Maybe MCA just happened to
get lucky and these two thorns in their souls just happened to
expire at the same time in untimely ways.''
 &HT;    More solid is the story of the end of Tennessee Sen. Estes
Kefauver's investigation into the mob which had also drawn
perilously close to Wasserman and MCA, when the senator had the
misfortune to be found in bed in a New York hotel room with not one
but two hostesses from the nearby Chez Paree nightclub. The
incident found its way, in slightly altered form, into the Francis
Ford Coppola's Godfather epic.
 &HT;    In the year that Teamster chief Jimmy Hoffa disappeared and
gangster Sam Giancana was gunned down, Wasserman and his Hollywood
lawyer Sydney Korshak became more and more afraid, writes
McDougall. Korshak began traveling with a bodyguard and Wasserman
beefed up security at his Beverly Hills home and had his drivers
taught how to throw off a pursuit.
 &HT;    If Wasserman's business universe was suspect, his personal life
as depicted by McDougal, is a put under a harsh light. Sure to be
criticized for his revelations about the private life of Edie
Wasserman, a respected Los Angeles-based philanthropist, McDougal
says it was absolutely germane to his portrait of Wasserman the
mogul.
 &HT;    ``If you don't understand that Lew had no home life and that his
relationship with his wife at some point evolved into an almost
brother and sister relationship then you don't really understand
what made the guy run. He hated to go home. I mean to this day when
he's 85 and virtually retired, I understand he goes into the office
every day and does not relish the idea of having to go home,''
McDougal said.
 &HT;    Today MCA is owned by Seagram Co. Ltd.(who bought it from the
Japanese company Matsushita in 1995) and as depicted by McDougal,
the last mogul is a lonely figure with a poor relationship with his
only daughter, a strange marriage and no deep friendships.
 &HT;    ``He has no broad sweep of close friends that he can just sit
and shmooze with or feel close to,'' says McDougal. ``He's very
isolated , very alone. And I feel a certain compassion for him.''
 &HT;    In Hollywood where he has been a towering figure, and a large
donor to charities taking on Lew Wasserman even in the twilight of
his years, is a brave endeavor.
 &HT;    Says McDougal, ``One of his MCA vice presidents told me that the
most chilling thing you could ever hear was that Lew was
'disappointed in you.'''
 &HT;    McDougal admits there is much to admire in the man. ``I think he
has a very strong sense of what is good. But he compartmentalizes.
He is very capable of destroying a career and the next day ...
speak passionately and sincerely about helping labor get a decent
contract. He has many good sides but he's capable of being
absolutely ruthless.''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 9. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody leads with the jockeying in the House of
Representatives for the speaker's gavel.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana as the
presumptive victor.
</P>
<P>
   But USA Today, the Washington Post and the New York Times treat
the alternative effort of Rep. Christopher Cox as, albeit fading,
still on the table, while the Los Angeles Times snags a late Sunday
night interview with Cox in which he says he can't match
Livingston's vote count. The leads also note that several other top
House Republican slots are likely to be contested in the party vote
on Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT makes the point that Livingston, Cox and other members
of the Republican House leadership used the Sunday chat shows to
politick for their jobs, an unprecedented exercise. And an odd one,
since the offices at stake are completely controlled by GOP caucus
and House votes. The Post notes this trend too and quotes some
other members of Congress who don't much like it.
</P>
<P>
   The WP and USAT emphasize the main reason most House Republicans
wanted the tongue of Newt: they say he was a lousy manager. (Now
they tell us.) ``There was really no clear agenda for the year. And
when there's no agenda and there's no real direction, what happens
is you can't, you really can't have a message,'' Rep. John Boehner
is quoted in the Post. And then he drives the point home with a
little too much information about himself: ``You can put lipstick
on a pig all day long, but it's still a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough that this story leads all around. The papers
also try to portray it as exciting. The NYT speaks of members
having ``scurried'' back to Washington to participate in ``party
brawls,'' and the LAT calls the episode ``dramatic'' and ``a
fast-moving tale.'' That speakermania grips the papers this way
shows they're a bit out of touch with what seems to be the point of
last week's election results: the public doesn't care about what
Washington cares about.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT redeems itself though, by making the only valuable
policy point lurking in all this. Livingston, the paper notes in a
sidebar to its lead, isn't locking up the nomination because of his
ideology, policy or personal style. It's his money--the $2 million
he's given to Republican candidates and party organizations from
his own campaign PAC. The paper points out that such personal
``leadership'' PACs allow members to take in and disburse more and
bigger donations than are allowed by the limits on contributions to
individual members.
</P>
<P>
   USAT's front reports that the Supreme Court, irked about last
spring's tell-all book by an ex-clerk about the court's inner
workings, has told this term's clerks that the supremes' secrets
are to be kept ``forever.'' The paper points out that this
stricture is not legally binding. USAT goes on to note that a
federal judge in California, Alex Kozinski, thinks the author, now
an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, broke the law and hence,
the prosecutor is ``no longer welcome'' to appear before him. The
story does not explain how a judge can control which government
attorneys try cases in his court.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal reports that just a few months after
announcing economic sanctions against India and Pakistan in
response to the two nations' atomic bomb tests, the Clinton White
House has dropped many of them--those that were holding up deals
involving U.S. firms such as Boeing and GE. Sanctions preventing
lending by international financial institutions remain in force.
(The U.S. has decided to waive even these in the case of Pakistan,
but no such loan has actually been consummated yet.)
</P>
<P>
   USAT, which has always been sensitive to aviation safety
stories, follows up Sunday's WP report on the FAA's decision to
change the way electrical wiring insulation on airliners is tested
for flammability with a Money section package of stories covering
various aspects of the problem. It's sobering to learn that about
half the world's passenger jets contain wire insulation that could
be a fire hazard. One expert quoted calls wiring the most serious
issue in aviation today.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT reports on the activities of a women's group dedicated
to fighting negative images of Jewish women in the media. The story
says that what they're fighting is the depiction of Jewish women as
``pushy, controlling, selfish, unattractive, materialistic,
high-maintenance, shallow, domineering....'' A fine goal, but the
group has its work cut out for it--the most prominent Jewish woman
this year pretty much fits those pejoratives to a T and the media
didn't make her up: Monica Lewinsky.

MAKING HEADWAY ON A LIE-PROOF FISHING TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ How would you like to go fishing with a guy who
is a professional lie-detector?
</P>
<P>
   You know what that would mean? No more tall tales. No more
stretching how big the fish was, how many we caught, or where
exactly we fished.
</P>
<P>
   That could be very difficult, I thought, as we boarded the boat
for our trip in San Francisco Bay recently. Most people are born
honest, you know, but by the time they go fishing, they usually get
over it.
</P>
<P>
   But not Jim Adams of Concord, Calif. He's been running polygraph
tests for 19 years, including testing the winners of fishing
tournaments. ``One time I caught a guy who claimed to have won a
bass tournament,'' he recounted. ``He failed the lie-detector test,
then was exposed to have a limit of fish that had been previously
caught, hidden in a cage underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we're in for trouble, I thought, as we headed for Tiburon
along the Marin shore, overcast and with a light wind out of the
south. Adams, 54, looked over at his dad, Earl Adams, 83, smiled,
and I wondered, ``What if they administer truth serum?''
</P>
<P>
   What brought us together was the San Francisco Examiner's
outdoor quiz, which appears in the newspaper in first Sunday of
December. Earl was the grand-prize winner of last year's contest,
one of a best-ever 86 people who answered all 10 questions right,
then drawn for a fishing trip with the Sturgeon General, Keith
Fraser, and me.
</P>
<P>
   But Earl has had some health problems, first requiring
open-heart surgery, from which he emerged in excellent shape, then
being diagnosed with osteoporosis, a bone problem in which his back
is often very sore and continually stiff. Under doctor's orders, he
was not allowed to fish for sturgeon, especially not the giants
that we have occasionally hooked in San Pablo Bay. How big? Like 7
feet long, maybe bigger. Cannot tell a lie.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, joined by son Jim ``the polygraph man,'' we headed
out in Fraser's 24-footer into the Bay, for striped bass instead of
sturgeon.
</P>
<P>
   After scheduling difficulties, we finally were out.
</P>
<P>
   But there was that south wind. A light rain. The full moon. The
start of minus low tides. Green water turning murky. And then there
was a recent rain, which freshened the Bay and inspired a large
migration of striped bass out of San Francisco Bay and upstream to
Suisun Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The previous three days on the boat, there were 42, 30 and nine
stripers caught, a downward trend. But even then, I noticed Jim
Adams a bit skeptical at these numbers, but hey, Cannot tell a lie.
</P>
<P>
   We let our lines out, trolling Worm-Tail jigs along the shore,
our trip timed for the top of the tide when the water has its best
clarity, and Earl told us about his life, his marriage of 58 years
with his wife, Shirley _ ``It will be 60 years in the year 2000'' _
retiring in the Bay Area, how proud he was of his five sons and
daughter, and grandchildren. And he explained how he had got all 10
questions right while Jim, the expert in the family, had missed
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim pretty much got most of the answers for me, but we
couldn't agree on that one question, the one about what was the
worst of the falls while skiing,'' Earl said. ``Jim thought it was
`biff,' my wife picked `face plant' and I put down `yard sale.'
Then Jim picked up the Sunday paper and saw I'd won the grand
prize. We couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, I'd had one bite, nobody else even a touch. It
was looking grim. Cannot tell a lie.
</P>
<P>
   We tried all our favorite spots. Tried every trick. Nothing. An
hour later, with the outgoing tide now causing the water to lose
much of its clarity and turn murky, the prospects were now bleak.
</P>
<P>
   We turned a corner on a shoreline point, and suddenly: Bang! I
got a jolt on my rod, and a moment later, had one. I passed the rod
to Earl. He grabbed ahold, and braced himself in his seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's strong,'' Earl announced, ``pulling real hard. Might need
some help.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Jim was ready to take over, Earl turned the fish, and
tussled away. It darted, powered down to the bottom, then skirted
the boat on a lateral run. Earl just kept reeling, his eyes like
laser beams, and brought it aside. He wanted the fish released, and
with a flip, the striper was off the hook, and disappeared into the
briny green of the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   To our shock, that turned out to be the only fish of the trip.
So Fraser and I set up a return outing, this one for Mr. Sturgy,
where Earl's grandson, Charlie, could also take part. On the way
in, I explained to Jim, his built-in lie detector now cranked up on
instinct, just how good the fishing has been, and how we had just
missed by a few days some of Bay's best fishing of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time we were out there were so many bass that we had
to fight them off the boat with the oars,'' I explained. ``I hooked
one that was so big, that the first time it jumped, the level of
the Bay dropped 2 feet. The next time it jumped, a boat fell in the
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Cannot tell a lie.

AUTHOR HELPS DEFINE ROLE OF GRANDMOTHERS 
 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BARBARA KARKABI 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, while leaving a store, Suzette Haden Elgin passed
a group of boys.
</P>
<P>
   As she was getting into her car, Elgin heard one of the teens
say to his pals, ``Now that is what a grandmother is supposed to
look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Elgin remembers smiling to herself. The teens were close, she
said, but not quite right. Yes, she had the requisite white hair
and wrinkles, but she was wearing slacks.
</P>
<P>
   With a twinkle in her eye, Elgin explained: ``In my day,
grandmothers would have never gone out in public in slacks. In
fact, most might never have even owned any.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that when a woman became a grandmother, no matter
what her age, she looked and dressed the part. That time has long
since passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, grandmothers are corporate lawyers, out exploring
jungles or being novelists, artists and every conceivable thing,''
said Elgin, author of ``The Grandmother Principles'' (Abbeville
Press, $18.95). ``But you can still be a true grandmother. It is
not nearly as important that you contact your grandchildren four
times or 150 times a year as that they know when they are going to
hear from you and you stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandmothering, Elgin believes, is not about how you cook or how
you look. It's about being a person who is consistent. The
grandmother's role is increasingly important in an age when
everything changes rapidly, she said; instead of ``warehousing
older women,'' we should view them as vital parts of the community.
</P>
<P>
   At 62, Elgin is a loving and experienced mother of five and
grandmother of 10. Her grandchildren, ranging in age from 6 months
to 16, live as nearby as 30 minutes from her Arkansas home and as
far away as New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I was in my late 40s when I became a grandmother for
the first time. I was absolutely thrilled,'' Elgin said. ``I have
sort of been a grandmother from birth. I have always adored babies
and children and stray dogs. I have never worried about this
problem of being old. I think people are reluctant to be
grandmothers because they have this stereotype in our culture that
grandmothers are old women, and we have a negative attitude toward
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being a devoted grandmother, she is a linguist and the
author of 34 books, including 12 science-fiction novels, a number
of linguistics textbooks and a series called ``The Gentle Art of
Verbal Self-Defense'' (Wiley &AMP; Sons, $11.25). So when Elgin's
publisher approached her about writing a book on grandmothering,
she said she felt qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the book came from my own experience as a mother and
grandmother in every kind of crazy situation you can imagine,''
Elgin said. ``I have had every kind of experience, from truly the
depths of poverty to relative privilege, and raising children in
all of these situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been a working mother and a widow. I have had
rebellious adolescent children who got in trouble. I have had
squeaky-clean children who never got into any trouble. I have had
sick children and well children. I've seen the gamut. I have had
divorce in my family and multiracial grandchildren. I really don't
think there's anything I have not had to deal with. I guess that
was my good luck, because I was then ready to write this book.''
</P>
<P>
   When Elgin looked to see what was available on grandmothering,
she found little of practical value: a rather scholarly work on the
role of grandmothers in society and a book on long-distance
grandmothering. She dug up old-fashioned books on how to churn
butter and get stains out of a linen christening dress. Then there
were the trendy guides on theme parks to visit with your
grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   What Elgin envisioned was a more practical book, ``a system or
philosophy of grandmothering that every woman could adapt to her
own situation.'' She initially titled her work ``The Portable
Grandmother.'' She hopes it will help women who never had a
grandmother as a role model and single women struggling to raise
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many young mothers now with no one to turn to in a
tragedy,'' she said. ``Or to turn to and say, `Mom, show me how to
do this.' I don't pretend that a book is going to show them how to
do it, but at least it can say to them, `In situations like this,
here's how you think about it, and here are some things you can
do.' And I can tell them that it will get better.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Elgin focuses on emphasizing to grandmothers
the importance of their role in keeping the modern family together.
She also offers information for grandmothers raising their
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   She derived her ``grandmother principles'' from situations in
which she found herself again and again during her years of
grandmothering.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you learn the rules of golf, and you can play on any
course at all,'' she said. ``And I figured there were rules for
grandmothering that would work no matter how bizarre the situation.
When I came to one of them, I would call it a grandmother
principle. The publisher decided to pull them out in a chart.''
</P>
<P>
   One principle: Somebody has to be the grown-up. One of the
hardest things for grandparents to learn, Elgin said, is that when
a family is grieving and in despair _ whether it's because someone
died or went to jail or got pregnant _ someone has to be the
grown-up and get everyone through it. Generally, Elgin said, it is
the grandmother who takes on that role.
</P>
<P>
   In her down-to-earth style, she tells grandmothers how to
publish a family newsletter, prepare a family history and hand it
down, stay in touch via e-mail and Web TV, take over a household
for a 24- or 48-hour emergency, deal with difficult relatives,
mediate family disputes and teach a child to crochet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all the kind of practical things that older women have
learned how to do,'' she said. ``Younger women would have no reason
to know these things. Where would they have learned?''
</P>
<P>
   Elgin has some strong words for women who are reluctant to take
on the grandmother role, either because they don't want to be
perceived as old or because after raising their own children,
they're too busy for grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `You are going to be sorry, because if the
grandmothers do not get in there and help produce children who are
independent and self-sufficient, it will boomerang,' '' she said.
``The grandmothers will end up having to support them, and there
will go our golden years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think it is the place of older women to extend
themselves to grandmotherless families. Frankly, we have abdicated
our role. Every other culture has grandmothers who automatically
look after these things.'' &QL;

COOKING WITH CLASS: LeNOTRE FAMILY SHARES CULINARY EXPERTISE 
 
By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ At half-past five, Alain LeNotre is showing a visitor
through his family's 6-week-old culinary institute when Patrick
LeNotre, his cousin, interrupts. Patrick, a celebrated chef, speaks
only French.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants us to hear the bread sing,'' Alain explains.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick sweeps into the classroom of the Alain and Marie LeNotre
Culinary Institute. He cradles a baking sheet of baguettes so hot
and fresh that they do seem to sing their charms. Alain nods
approval. Patrick smiles and whisks them away. He has much to do
before the students descend at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Biochemists. Cattle breeders. Financial planners. It doesn't
matter what their day jobs are. At night, students come from near
and far to the institute, about five minutes north of downtown
Houston. Leisure Learning cooking classes offered by the LeNotres
draw people who enjoy taking classes in which even amateur cooks
feel like chefs.
</P>
<P>
   The institute offers four levels of training in day and evening
classes. Courses range from those designed for beginners to
advanced classes for full-time chefs, the institute's real target,
as well as periodic seminars and refresher courses.
</P>
<P>
   Alain and Patrick LeNotre were reared to expect the best of the
best in any culinary arena. They inherited their love of cooking,
baking and teaching from their grandmother, Eleonore, one of
France's first female chefs early in this century. Alain's father,
Gaston, and Patrick's father, Marcel, continued the family
tradition. Gaston LeNotre is one of the fabled names in the French
culinary world.
</P>
<P>
   Roaming through the new school, Alain stops periodically. He is
checking, always checking. Are the floors clean? How are the
cheesecakes doing? Is the ground-floor cookware and utensil
boutique _ a paradise of top-of-the-line French products _
well-stocked? His culinary expertise is extensive. Even more
impressive are Patrick's chef credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But in their kitchen even novice cooks are treated with respect.
</P>
<P>
   The LeNotres stress good teaching, transmitting to others,
whether professional or amateur, the best culinary methods with
skill, patience and more than a pinch of savoir-faire. For
professional students, the institute even offers courses in the
French language at no extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups get a chance to study with the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken cooking classes in Paris and New York,''
30-year-old biochemist Mykel Ngo says at a Leisure Learning class
as he chops and minces vegetables for bouillabaisse. His brown eyes
dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this? This is the best. It's more hands-on. Most of the
other classes, you get to taste and then go home when you're done.
Here, you sit down (after class), and they serve you.''
</P>
<P>
   Students aren't the only ones who are happy about the school.
The LeNotres are delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked about the school for so long ...,'' says Marie
LeNotre. ``So now that it becomes a reality, it is very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   The new school, at 7070 Allensby off Interstate 45, is 14,000
square feet of gleaming stainless-steel kitchens, steam-convection
ovens and refrigerators so big a family could eat Thanksgiving
dinner in them. Much equipment was donated by commercial sponsors,
Alain says, noting those companies hope chefs trained at the
institute may someday order the same equipment for restaurant
kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to be delivered early this month was the ice-cream machine,
a necessity for Alain, a master chef in pastry, chocolate candy,
ice cream and catering.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston institute is modeled on the LeNotre family's
successful Ecole LeNotre Paris. Alain LeNotre, a native of
Normandy, founded the Paris school in 1970, when he was working
with his parents, Gaston and Colette LeNotre.
</P>
<P>
   Alain and his wife, Marie _ a native of Athens, Greece _ moved
to the United States in 1981, settling in Houston. They were
working with LeNotre Paris to extend the family's international
franchise of bakery cafes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, they started their own company, opening a bakery in
Houston, operated independently from LeNotre Paris. They became
well-known for their culinary creativity, catering and pastries,
and their retail outlets became familiar sights in upscale Houston
shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   Those outlets closed when the buildings were demolished, Alain
says, and now the wholesale bakery and catering operation continues
as a separate company, managed from offices at the Culinary
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Marie LeNotre, who has master's degrees in public health and
creative writing, functions as the institute's marketing guru.
Neither Alain nor Marie teach regularly, although both assist if
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's professional-chef program, with day and night
class schedules available, offers two tracks: The first combines
cooking and catering, the second baking, pastries, chocolate and
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs may enter training at one of three basic levels. ``Level 1
is to make sure they like the profession,'' Alain says. ``Level 2
is to prepare them for entering the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   After Level 3 in the cooking sequence, students earn a sous-chef
to cuisine diploma. After Level 3 in the bakery sequence, they earn
a sous-chef patissier diploma. Advanced courses are offered at
Level 4.
</P>
<P>
   The training is not cheap. Tuition ranges from $325 for a
one-week, three nights per week, evening course to $7,500 for the
full 10 weeks in the daytime program or 20 weeks in the evening
program. The evening program takes longer because students attend
only three nights per week, rather than five days per week.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, which has 14 professional students now,
recommends that beginning chefs complete at least the first two
levels before seeking professional employment. Chefs seeking
advanced training may attend on a per-week basis, or sign up for
advanced seminars offered periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Not all students dream of working as chefs. Some are simply
determined to learn to really cook. Evening students in the
professional classes include an attorney, a salesclerk and a
businessman. Day students come from all walks of life. Two
students, a brother and a sister, are studying while preparing to
open a restaurant in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are limited to 10-15 students to ensure that training is
hands-on. The institute has four full-time and four part-time
teachers. There are plans for different chefs to be employed as
teachers so that students learn fresh approaches. In addition,
expert chefs periodically will be used. For example, beginning in
January, chef Nicole Routhier, an expert in French and Vietnamese
cuisine, will teach a series of 10 Leisure Learning classes on
Saturday at the institute. International cuisines to be explored
range from Japanese to Italian.
</P>
<P>
   The Leisure Learning classes cost $55 per three-hour class. Each
is usually part of an ongoing series, held on weeknights or
Saturdays. Students sign up for one class at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The institute also offers continuing-education opportunities for
professional chefs and a technical-assistance center for
restaurants, food-service companies, cruise lines and related
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Institute students will learn some of the 700 recipes brought to
the institute by Patrick LeNotre, an award-winning cuisine, bakery
and pastry chef who earned fame as an executive chef at two of the
family's restaurants in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick's recipes range from basic sauces, stews, soups and main
dishes to Normandy eel cooked in an apple-cider base and
bouillabaisse made with an entire blue crab ground by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Students may learn to create an Eiffel Tower from chocolate or
to prepare caramelized fig tarts.
</P>
<P>
   And those who decide to pursue such pleasures professionally
should find a wide-open market.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for new chefs has been high and is expected to continue
to grow. A restaurant industry association projects that U.S.
restaurant sales will exceed $320 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With sales increasing, the LeNotres see a corresponding increase
in the need for professional chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already know (we will succeed),'' says Patrick, with Alain
and Marie translating. ``Because of the kind of students we have
here, there is a potential to train great chefs in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Chef training is expanding to include more women, he says, as
courses offered for amateurs attract more men. Both reflect
cultural trends in France and the United States in which more men
are doing the family food shopping and preparation and more women
are studying to become professional chefs.
</P>
<P>
   The institute's flexible class schedule and rapid training are
attractive to students, says S. Michael Hirsch, manager of career
development and technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes us unique from some of the other fine culinary
schools is they're on an academic track and we're on a purely
skills track,'' says Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   Professional-level classes are more intense than Leisure
Learning courses, Patrick LeNotre says, but he tries to offer
important tips to both groups. Although he is quieter than his
cousin and doesn't usually join amateur students for dinner after
class, he likes teaching them.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is ``convivial, sympathetic and relaxing,'' he
says, and professional enough to attract people who really love to
cook or want to learn how.
</P>
<P>
   In three short hours, students such as Ngo, the biochemist,
prepare a meal of several courses typical of the cuisine of a
particular region of France. One week there will be flounder a la
Normandie and Marcel Proust, with the oyster, shrimp, mushroom,
mussel, apple cider and cream sauce the author favored.
</P>
<P>
   Another class will celebrate Provence, with an emphasis on a
complex lamb stew seasoned with eggplant, carrots, anchovy fillets,
garlic, onion, roasted red and green peppers and more.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Oliver of New Ulm drives 90 minutes to attend Leisure
Learning classes at the institute. She loves French food. She's
traveled to France. She's building a home with a fantastic kitchen.
She works long, hard hours on her ranch. Cooking is the other side
of life, a time to ponder and learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where I feel very creative,'' Oliver says, jotting
notes in her recipe folder.
</P>
<P>
   In class, the inexperienced and the seasoned amateur explore
French cuisine in full chef regalia. They mix, chop, slice, fillet
and sear under the watchful eyes of Patrick, Alain and Marie
LeNotre and other school staff.
</P>
<P>
   Most are a little awed by Patrick. He was voted French Chef of
the Year by French culinary critics. His cookbook, whose French
title translates as ``The Secret Recipes of Patrick LeNotre,'' has
sold well. He has cooked for the president of France and the
emperor of Japan. He has worked with some of the greatest French
chefs, including Paul Bocuse and Roger Verger.
</P>
<P>
   Alain and Marie LeNotre, who would like to see the school go
national, want to publish a cookbook that is accessible to
Americans cooking at home. They're thinking about a series of
how-to cooking videos.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick concurs, but his focus is on the kitchen and on his
periodic return trips to France. He loves his work, but he misses
his wife, Raymonde; his teen-age daughter, Caroline; and his son,
Olivier, a law student. Every four months, he returns home for two
weeks. Next year, his family will move to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   In the Leisure Learning classes, Patrick is gracious and
understanding but also precise and meticulous. Alain and Marie
translate in the amateur classes; other instructors assist in the
professional courses.
</P>
<P>
   Alain notes that amateur students use the same equipment as
professional students _ except for the knives. ``Too many people
cut themselves in those first classes,'' he says. ``So we switched
to smaller ones.''
</P>
<P>
   As the class prepares strawberries for a dessert, Patrick
LeNotre demonstrates how each strawberry should be gently washed
with a pastry &UR;  &LR; brush. Never, never, never dunk the berries under
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of like a James Bond martini,'' one participant whispers.
``Stirred, not shaken.''

LOOK TO BACK YARD FOR HOLIDAY WREATHS 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the harvest season, gardeners can gather colorful and
textural natural materials to assemble wreaths, swags or
arrangements for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the simplest wreaths you can craft at home are the
grapevine wreath and the pine cone wreath.
</P>
<P>
   To make the vine wreath, scout for muscadine grapevines in the
woods. Wind and wrap the fresh vine in a circle, and leave tendrils
for texture and interest. The wreath will dry hard and last for
years. The grapevine wreath is handsome on its own, but you easily
can add or subtract ornamentation such as dried flowers, seed pods,
berry-laden boughs or ribbon. Often these elements can be woven
into the wreath, eliminating the need for a hot-glue gun.
</P>
<P>
   A pine cone wreath will also last for years. Gather numerous
cones of varying sizes. Cut the bottoms off the cones, then use a
hot-glue gun to attach those of uniform size, each pointing
outward, around the outside of a heavy-duty Styrofoam ring.
Assemble another circle of cones of varying sizes, then create an
inner circle with smaller cones that are relatively uniform in
size. Spray the wreath with varnish.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Natural harvests &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Use your imagination to spruce up a wreath base, whether
homemade or purchased, with natural collections from the woods or
garden. You might borrow ideas from books or catalogs that carry
wreaths crafted from natural materials.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreens can be used for holiday decorations in grapevine
wreaths or attached to wire, straw or Styrofoam forms. Tuck small
clusters of greenery such as boxwood, bundled with wire or florist
tape, into wreath bases or attach with florist pins if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Greenery is often just outside the back door. Holly, Leyland
cypress, juniper, pine, eleagnus, asparagus fern, holly fern,
nandina, boxwood, magnolia, pittosporum, aspidistra and ivy are
subjects for holiday creations.
</P>
<P>
   Pine cones, magnolia seed pods, lotus pods, poppy pods,
butterfly weed pods (spray the silk with hair spray as it begins to
pop from the pod), sweet gum balls, acorns, pecans, moss, rose
hips, cattails, jack-in-the-pulpit, moss and berries from
pyracantha, tallow and holly can be used for ornamentation. Wrap
bundles with florist tape and attach with florist pins or hot glue
as needed.
</P>
<P>
   Ears of corn, bean pods, artichokes, pomegranates, loquats,
lemons, apples and pineapples (the symbol of hospitality) up the
visual appeal, as well. Florist picks can be used to secure fruit
and vegetables to a wreath.
</P>
<P>
   While fresh flowers can be allowed to dry in place in an
arrangement, those with long stems will often sag as they dry,
destroying the lines of your creation. Therefore, those with short
stems work best.
</P>
<P>
   Many gardeners like to dry flowers and herbs to create
long-lasting decorations. Mexican bush sage, yarrow, dusty miller,
celosia, gomphrena, goldenrod, ornamental grasses, rosemary,
oregano and thyme are often bundled and dried.
</P>
<P>
   Air drying is a simple method of preservation. The South Texas
Unit of the American Herb Society makes these suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   Pick materials for drying in late morning. Avoid rain-soaked or
dew-covered blooms. Flowers are brightest when they first open.
Pick flowers just before they peak, when they are fully formed but
the centers are still closed.
</P>
<P>
   Do not dry outside. Flowers fade and green turns brown in our
humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Use rubber bands on bunches, as they will adapt as the material
shrinks as it dries.
</P>
<P>
   Hang small bundles upside down on clothes hangers. Hang in a dry
location with good air circulation. Avoid exposure to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Drying time depends on the original moisture content of the
plant material and the size of the bundles. Usually, the process
takes several days. Stems will snap easily when drying is complete.
</P>
<P>
   Spray final designs with hair spray to discourage shedding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tools &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These tools, available from a florist, nursery or crafts store,
will make crafting natural decorations easier: garden clippers;
glue gun; florist pins; wooden florist picks in 3-, 4- and 6-inch
lengths; floral tape; ribbon (wired kind more easily shaped); and
wreath forms

KNOW YOUR SEAT BEFORE YOU FLY 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While planning a European excursion earlier this year, I debated
whether to use upgrade certificates _ a precious commodity for any
frequent flier _ to secure a business-class seat with an
economy-class ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The free booze and more food weren't important to me. The film
library was no lure; I prefer to sleep across the Atlantic. And at
5 feet 7, I don't need extra leg room. My eventual decision to
upgrade was based on one factor: Being somewhat spacious in girth,
I appreciate a wider seat.
</P>
<P>
   What a surprise! I've felt less cramped in economy class. And no
wonder. Upon return, I was perusing the September issue of Business
Traveler Magazine and learned that the Delta Airlines MD-11
business-class seat I occupied, while generous in leg room, is only
18 inches wide. According to the same study, Continental
BusinessFirst seats are 20 inches wide. Some aircraft feature even
wider seats.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the real pinch: A similar Business Traveler magazine
study of long-haul economy classes, published in May, found that
Delta MD-11 seats in that compartment are 19 inches wide _ as
spacious as any surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   If these studies are accurate, I used valuable upgrades to
secure a seat 1 inch narrower than I had originally booked in the
back of the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More changes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Delta has subsequently announced plans to follow Continental's
successful policy of combining first and business classes on
trans-Atlantic flights. That should result in more comfortable
seating.
</P>
<P>
   But I relate my predicament because the November and December
holiday seasons represent the busiest travel periods for infrequent
fliers. Maybe they can profit from my mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we travel once a year _ or once a week _ we share a
common bond in that we appreciate comfort at 35,000 feet. And not
all airplane seats are created equal.
</P>
<P>
   Did you realize, for instance, that middle seats _ no aisle, no
window _ comprise 32 percent of all available seats aboard an
American Airlines DC-10? But only 13 percent of the seats on
American's Boeing 767 are in the middle. Many passengers aren't
aware that up to 10 percent of the seats on some aircraft don't
fully recline.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures were published in the October issue of the monthly
Consumer Reports Travel Letter as part of a study of coach classes
in wide-bodied aircraft aimed at discovering ``The Worst Seats in
the Sky ... and How to Avoid Them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report identified an estimated 77,000 undesirable seats _
specifically, nonrecliners, middles and seats near bathrooms where
long lines form _ on 800 jumbo jets operated by 11 airlines.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Letting travelers know &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Reports Travel Letter is urging airlines to make
specific information available to travelers. The publication
credits Houston-based Continental for adopting a policy to equip
reservations agents with knowledge about seat-recline on all jets.
It also encourages passengers to ask questions about specific
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Even when traveling on narrow-bodied, single-aisle aircraft _
more uniform in their design _ passengers can enhance their
enjoyment by acting on priorities: Request a window seat if the
view is important, an aisle if you want easier bathroom access or
shoulder room. Inquire about sitting in an exit row, where leg room
is substantial (although airlines often hold these rows until they
can ensure that occupants are physically able to assist in case of
an emergency).
</P>
<P>
   Passengers must be more assertive today in stressing their
preferences. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Advance boarding passes that show seat assignments became relics
a few months back. Security measures now require airport check-in
for photo identification. Electronic ticketing is growing in
popularity. Because airlines figure advance passes no longer
represent time-savers for the traveler or gate agent, they ceased
issuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, most airlines still permit us to reserve seats weeks ahead
of a flight. Travel agents and telephone reservations agents just
don't always bother to remind us of this significant option. This
is especially important for families: I've seen numerous instances
recently when Mom, Dad and the kids arrived at a gate without seat
assignments and were separated.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For many travelers, the Caribbean extends a mystical lure. We
fantasize about sun-drenched beaches, turquoise seas, underwater
adventure, sipping rum punches on a pirate boat.
</P>
<P>
   And all that does indeed beckon _ and reward _ vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   But too often we tend to dismiss this region as one entity, one
vast archipelago with a common background and common culture and
common attractions.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, each island has a unique personality reflected in its
people, its language, its history, its topography, its natural
wonders, its cuisine, its everyday way of life. Except for a bond
with the sea, Curacao is no more akin to Puerto Rico than Vermont
is to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Though the great majority of Caribbean residents are descendants
of Africans, varying influences _ British, Dutch, French, Spanish,
East Indian and countless others _ have shaped their cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Individual islands also vary widely in size: Cuba, the largest,
encompasses more than 4,000 square miles; Saba covers only 3 square
miles. And in appearance: Mountains in the Dominican Republic soar
two miles into the sky; the highest elevation on Barbuda is 150
feet. We discover a lush rain forest on Martinique, desert cactuses
on Aruba.
</P>
<P>
   We dive into a coral wonderland on Bonaire, shop in exclusive
French boutiques on St. Martin, hike and camp in a national park on
St. John, seek out exotic birds on Trinidad and Tobago and exotic
spices on Grenada, walk the cobblestone streets of a 500-year-old
town on Puerto Rico and bathe in a ``drive-in volcano'' on St.
Lucia.
</P>
<P>
   Planning a trip to ``the Caribbean'' that satisfies specific
priorities can require extensive planning. Today, in a special
Houston Chronicle Travel section, we provide island-by-island
capsules that offer perspectives on the region's diversity.
Included are telephone contacts and Internet addresses for islands'
tourist boards. Another good source for information is the
Caribbean Tourism Organization: Call 212-635-9530; or access
www.caribtourism.com. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Access will become easier Dec. 15 when Continental Airlines
begins daily nonstop jet service between Houston and San Juan,
Puerto Rico. Continental already offers twice-weekly nonstop
service between Houston and Aruba; Cayman Airways flies three times
weekly to Grand Cayman Island. Other islands are usually accessed
via Miami or Atlanta. &UR;

minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: For a treat off the beaten path, make reservations
for lunch at Koal Keel in an area known as ``The Valley.'' Beyond
the stellar Caribbean cuisine, where else will you find a bed

   Tourism officials tout 365 beaches _ one for every day of the
year. All are open to the public. Numerous bays entice sailors and
other boaters; late April brings an international yachting
festival.
</P>
<P>
   About half the population lives in St. John, the capital and
major cruise port.
</P>
<P>
   Obligatory tourist stops include Nelson's Dockyard at English
Harbor; Admiral Horatio Nelson, who arrived in 1784, was among
several military leaders to use this secure area as a home base for
his fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Lodging options are varied and satisfy most budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Forming one nation with Antigua are Barbuda, situated 25 miles
to the north, and the tiny Redonda nature preserve.

</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Nonstop flights from Miami, New York and San Juan
serve Antigua. Most major cruise lines stop for a day.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Antigua suffered extensive damage from Hurricane
Georges, but most of the tourist infrastructure is now fully
operational.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Antigua has emerged into a favored tourism
destination not only with Americans but with the British and other
Europeans who arrive daily on wide-bodied jets.

   ARUBA
</P>
<P>
   Location: in the southern Caribbean about 15 miles off the
Venezuelan coast.
</P>
<P>
   Size: 70 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Population: 82,000.
</P>
<P>
   Language: Dutch. But English, Spanish, Portuguese and a local
dialect known as Papiamento also are spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Aruban florin or guilder. U.S. dollars are accepted at
most locations.
</P>
<P>
   History: Indian settlements date back at least 1,000 years.
Spanish explorers arrived in 1499. The Dutch took possession in
1636, yielded to the English in 1805 but regained control 11 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   An island of varying personalities _ a ``resort row'' of huge,
modern hotels and casinos along lovely Palm Beach at one extreme
and hidden coves and rocky passes at the other, with a desert
landscape at the center.
</P>
<P>
   For sports-lovers: Windsurfers from all over North America
gather here; golfing hazards on an 18-hole course include live
goats.
</P>
<P>
   Oranjestad, the largest city and cruise port, is clean and
picturesque with Dutch Colonial-style architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Ample nightlife includes about 10 full-scale casinos and 100
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist information: Call 800-862-7822. Access www.aruba.com.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Continental Airlines offers two nonstop flights
weekly in each direction between Bush Intercontinental Airport and
Aruba.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Aruba's official tree, the divi-divi, serves as a
compass for anyone needing directions. Because of constant trade
wins, the divi-divis always point southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Aruba represents one of the most satisfying
Caribbean destinations. Despite its 2,000-mile distance from
Houston, nonstop flights make it a convenient getaway, too.

   BAHAMAS
</P>
<P>
   Location: 60 miles east of Palm Beach, Fla. (technically not in
the Caribbean but commonly aligned with that region).
</P>
<P>
   Size: More than 700 islands and 2,000 cays with a land mass of
5,382 square miles scattered over more than 100,000 square miles of
the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Population: 278,000.
</P>
<P>
   Language: English, with a musically Irish/African accent.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Bahamian dollar. U.S. dollars are accepted almost
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   History: Populated by the peaceful Lucayans for 500 years before
Columbus' arrival in 1492. Enslaved and shipped to work in the
Hispaniola gold mines, the Lucayans were extinct just 25 years
after the Spaniards' arrival. Pirates and Puritans followed in the
1600s. During World War II, the Duke of Windsor, formerly the king
of England, lived in the Bahamas as governor. The islands earned
their independence from Britain in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Boasts 1.6 million overnight visitors each year, and another 1.7
million day-trippers ferried in by no fewer than 10 cruise lines.
</P>
<P>
   Bustling beaches, glitzy casinos and a Disney-esque
marine-themed resort called Atlantis.
</P>
<P>
   Pink flamingos, the showy national bird, are 50,000 strong on
the island of Inagua, an out island _ or Family Island, as Bahamas
tourism officials prefer _ that also is home to the Morton Salt Co.
</P>
<P>
   Fantastic costumes and vibrant music are at the heart of
junkanoo celebrations on Boxing Day (Dec. 26) and New Year's Day.
These colorful extravaganzas celebrate freedom and Bahamian
culture. &UR;

<P>
   Getting there: Nonstop flights are available from many U.S.
cities, including Miami and Atlanta. Most major cruise lines make
calls at Nassau or Freeport.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Watch sunset from The Cloister, a relocated
14th-century French monastery once owned by newspaper mogul William
Randolph Hearst. The Cloister is located in the gardens of the
Ocean Club, a pricey resort on Paradise Island, but, as ``Frommer's
Portable Bahamas'' (Macmillan, $9.95) reports, admission to the
gardens is free.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Nonstop action, family friendly. Definitely not gay
friendly. Out islands offer the seclusion and peace, but few
amenities. Nice selection of lodging for all budgets.  &UR;

</P>
<P>
   Population: 258,000.
</P>
<P>
   Language: English.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Barbados dollar.
</P>
<P>
   History: Barbados was colonized in 1627 by the British, who had
uninterrupted control for 300 years. The Bajans earned their
independence in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Home of Mount Gay, the world's oldest distiller of rum. This
island also is where the word ``rum'' originated.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred religions are represented here. Among the
sanctuaries is the oldest Jewish synagogue in the Western
Hemisphere. It dates from 1654.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling hills, cricket matches and polo ponies recall the
island's long history with Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Surfers risk their necks and boards at Bathsheba Beach.
</P>
<P>
   American tourists risk their necks driving on the left in a
moke, a locally manufactured electric car that is no bigger than a
golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist information: Call 800-221-9831.Access www.barbados.org.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Nonstop jet service is available via Miami and

<P>
   Insider tip: Hot jazz and cool ocean breezes are on tap Jan.
13-17 at the Barbados Jazz Festival. Among the featured performers
will be Kenny G and Earth, Wind and Fire. Call 888-227-2236.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Tourism has a long history in Barbados. George
Washington visited in 1751; it was the future president's first and
only international trip. His most memorable souvenir: a case of
smallpox. Today the island gets high marks for its sophistication,
welcoming citizenry and fine dining. But be warned, it is not a
budget destination.

<P>
   History: Like Antigua, settled by the British in the 1630s.
Politically merged with Antigua in 1860.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Notable for wildlife sanctuaries, especially for seabirds;
birders come to admire magnificent black frigatebirds (whose mating
season is August-December) that have 8-foot wingspans and soar up
to 100 mph. Local fishermen can assist in facilitating close-up
observation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 underwater wrecks lure divers, but diving is
difficult and facilities limited; filling tanks on Antigua is
recommended. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Hotels are limited and expensive.

<P>
   Tourist information: Call 888-268-4227. Access

<P>
   Language: Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Netherlands Antilles florin or guilder. U.S. dollars
are commonly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   History: Much like Aruba: The Dutch took control back from the
British in the early 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   With its entire coastline a living mass of coral, Bonaire is
regarded as one of the world's premier sites for scuba diving and
snorkeling.
</P>
<P>
   Washington-Slagbaai National Park serves as a preserve for
iguanas and exotic birds; about 170 bird species have been
identified here.
</P>
<P>
   No worries about crowding from thousands of cruise passengers;
only small ships dock here. Despite recent hotel development,
Bonaire remains a quiet retreat.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist information: Call 800-266-2473. Access www.bonaire.org.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Air Aruba offers connecting jet service from
Miami and other U.S. gateways via Aruba; Continental offers nonstop
service between Houston and Aruba, where connections are available.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Bonaire is one of only four places in the world
where flamingo colonies breed. More than 10,000 flamingos call this
island home.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: This is the Caribbean's No. 1 destination _ and one
of the world's best _ for those who relish underwater exploration.

</P>
<P>
   Language: English.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   History: Discovered by Columbus in 1493, it was a favorite
hideaway of buccaneers such as Henry Morgan and Blackbeard. A
member of the Commonwealth, BVI became self-governing in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Just says no to mega-size cruise ships.
</P>
<P>
   Deadman's Bay on Peter's Island typifies the laid-back and
lonely bathing beach.
</P>
<P>
   Neverland for sailors, who can explore isolated inlets, picnic
on palm-fringed beaches and then dock for an evening of reggae and
rum.

</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Take a flight from San Juan on Puerto Rico (or
from one of another half-dozen Caribbean islands) or ferry over
from the U.S. Virgin Island of St. John, which is less than two
miles from Tortola, BVI's largest island.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Are you the host with the most (money)? Consider a
vacation on Necker Island, owned by billionaire Richard Branson.
The 74-acre island boasts a Balinese-style house with panoramic
views, swimming pools, a white-sand beach and a fine European chef.
You can invite as many as 23 guests, which just about equals the
number of staff that will be at your service. Prices start at
$13,000 per day for up to seven guests. Access
www.neckerisland.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Times are changing in the British Virgin Islands.
While these islands will never match the welcome mat put out by
neighbors St. John and St. Thomas of the U.S. Virgin Islands, the
BVI is working on its infrastructure to lure more tourists,
particularly from the United States. Go now so you can bemoan the
changes on your second visit.

<P>
   Outstanding scuba diving and snorkeling.
</P>
<P>
   Seven Mile Beach on Grand Cayman is lined with high-quality
hotels and condominiums
</P>
<P>
   Tortuga Rum Cakes, available in George Town (the largest town

   Insider tip: If you are told to go to Hell on Grand Cayman,
don't take offense: A jagged rock formation known as ironshore is
named Hell, and it even boasts a post office where you can get mail
stamped from Hell.

<P>
   Bottom line: The Caymans, a major banking center, are clean and
virtually crime-free; residents have a high literacy rate and
standard of living and are among the most courteous in the
Caribbean.

<P>
   History: Cuba was discovered by Columbus in 1492, but Spain did
not begin to colonize until about 1511. The United States aided a
Cuban rebellion against Spain in 1898, and the country earned its
independence in 1902. A revolution in 1959 followed many years of
dictatorial rule in Cuba. Fidel Castro, the revolution's leader,
then instituted a communist system of government.

<P>
   Tourist information: Call 416-362-0700. Access www.cubaweb.cu.

embargo that has been in effect since 1961.

<P>
   Currency: Netherland Antilles florin or guilder.
</P>
<P>
   History: Curaao has been the administrative capital of the ABC
islands (also including Aruba and Bonaire) since the Dutch arrived
in 1634.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Shares the same beautiful turquoise waters as sister islands
Aruba and Bonaire; diving is excellent, but beaches aren't an
asset.
</P>
<P>
   In capital city of Willemstad, the waterfront is lined with
beautiful Dutch gable houses bathed in pastel colors; it's easy to
imagine being in the Netherlands.
</P>

Aruba.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: From Islands magazine's December issue (available
on newsstands for $4.95): The latest curiosity is the Curaao
Ostrich and Game Farm, where 600 of the world's largest birds strut
their stuff. Most are raised for export.
</P>

   Currency: East Caribbean dollar. U.S. dollar accepted almost
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   History: Columbus named the island in 1493. It was colonized by
the French in the 18th century and taken over by the British in
1815. Independence came in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Pure-blood Carib Indians still live in an area known as the
Carib Indian Territory on the northeast corner of the island.
</P>
<P>
   365 rivers and hundreds of waterfalls, but just 700 guest rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Not known for beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti is the only Caribbean country poorer than Dominica.

<P>
   Tourist information: Call 212-475-7542.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Flights arrive from Puerto Rico and a half-dozen
other Caribbean islands. Ferry service is available from Martinique

<P>
   Insider tip: A rigorous, half-day hike steers visitors to the
Boiling Lake in Morne Trois Pitons National Park. This volcanic
chimney is the largest of its kind in the world. Creating a
200-foot-wide lake that boils in the middle; it's only about 190
degrees around its rim.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Dominica is the destination for the adventurous
ecotraveler who shuns nightlife and creature comforts for the
opportunity to hike rugged mountain trails, spy rare birds in the
rain forest or explore an underwater volcanic crater.

   About 250 miles of sparkling beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous moderately priced all-inclusive resorts, especially
popular with Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme poverty in many areas.
</P>

<P>
   Insider tip: From ``Fodor's Exploring Caribbean'' (Fodor's,

milkshakes known as `bastidas.' Flavors include `pina' (pineapple),
`china' (orange), `lechola' (pawpaw) and `guanabana' (soursop).'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bottom line: The island's poverty, crime and unreliable power
sources are factors to consider when planning a trip; those who
visit are rewarded by a rare combination of historical and natural
wonders. Some areas, including the Punta Cana resort region, were
badly damaged by Hurricane Georges. Consult a travel agent. &QL;

Declared independence from the British Commonwealth in 1974.
Subject of first modern coup in the English-speaking Caribbean in
1979 by Maurice Bishop, who had ties to Fidel Castro's Cuban
regime. Controversial U.S. military intervention in 1983 has led to
regular democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   The island of spice _ nutmeg, mace, cocoa beans, cinnamon,
allspice, bay leaves, cloves and more. Vendors sell packets of

$19): ``It was on Grenada that the Caribbean rum punch was
perfected (when a planter sprinkled nutmeg into his guests' glasses
at a party in 1813).'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bottom line: Don't let images of the 1980s U.S. military action
dissuade. Those who enjoy hiking or otherwise escaping into natural
paradises will find Grenada accommodating. Wonderful aromas enhance
the ambience on the Spice Island.

<P>
   History: Discovered by Columbus in 1493, Guadeloupe was first
colonized by the French about 1635. The settlers, however, were
ill-equipped for tropical life and growth stagnated. Emboldened by
the French Revolution, the islanders asserted their independence,
abolished slavery and opened the door for British occupation. Bad
call. French forces were sent to restore order and oust the Brits.
More than 4,000 Guadeloupians lost their heads on the guillotine.
The British were to invade Guadeloupe once again in 1810, but
surrendered the island back to the French in 1815.  &UR;

<P>
   Insider tip: A short but memorable flight or a ferry crossing

<P>
   Population: 6 million.
</P>
<P>
   History: The first 40 European settlers, left by Columbus in
1492, died. Later, African slaves endured decades of torture at the
hands of French colonial masters before rebelling in 1804,
declaring independence and forming the world's first black
republic.

   Bottom line: As recently as the 1960s, Haiti's beautiful
beaches, varied topography and arguably the finest handicraft and
native art in the Caribbean made it a popular tourist destination.
Now it is the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, seriously
overcrowded and wracked with political instability. Tourism is not

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   History: The motto ``Out of many, one people'' describes the
island's history as much as it reflects its diversity. The Arawak
settled as early as A.D. 700. Christopher Columbus showed up in
1494.Spaniards began colonizing about 1510. The English invaded
about 1655. Slavery allowed Jamaica to develop into the world's
largest sugar producer. It also led to centuries of strife, pain,
rebellion and death. Slavery was finally abolished in 1874. Jamaica
earned its independence in 1962.

<P>
   Getting there: Air Jamaica serves both Montego Bay and Kingston

</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Quirky Negril was once ``the'' place to be, but
Palm Beach (Fla.) Post travel writer Cheryl Blackerby is telling
tourists to head to the east coast: ``Port Antonio is the place to
enjoy the real Jamaica: to hike the mountains and cool off in a
waterfall, to ride a bike down the winding roads of a 5,000-foot
peak, to wander the countryside and meet people accessible only by
steep, muddy trails.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Jamaica has gotten a bad reputation for its crime
rate and pushy peddlers. But its stunning beaches and cheerful
populace can't be beaten. This is a destination for the adventurer,
nature lover and sun worshiper. Like its rum, Jamaica is
intoxicating.

the Mount Pele volcano in 1902, which killed 30,000 in St.-Pierre,
was a prisoner named Cyparis who was protected by thick dungeon
walls. He later became an attraction in the Barnum and Bailey
circus.''

   History: Another of Columbus' discoveries, Nevis was in the
center of more than 150 years of sparring between the French and
British. Britain won the island outright via the Treaty of
Versailles in 1783. Then in 1983, Nevis was awarded independence
from everyone except St. Kitts.

<P>
   Insider tip: Nevis boasts one of the best golf courses in the
Caribbean. The Four Seasons' scenic 18 holes were designed by
Robert Trent Jones Jr. The course reaches up toward 3,232-foot
Nevis Peak and down to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: According to ``Fielding's Caribbean'' (Fielding,
$19.95): ``No one seems to move faster than a ceiling fan in Nevis,
and following a lavish gourmet dinner in a history-filled
plantation home, your dreams may well be about the luscious array

Juan, readily available near the port dock, then take off on
cobblestone streets and alleys to discover historical forts, art
galleries, museums and homes featuring Spanish architecture.

   Currency: Netherlands Antilles florin.
</P>
<P>
   History: Became another notch on Columbus' belt in 1493. First
settled in 1640 by the Dutch, but went on to change hands more than
a dozen times. Dutch took undisputed and final claim to Saba,
pronounced Say-bah, in 1816.

terrific hiking. Try the steep, 1,064-step trail that cuts through
the rain forest on the way to the top of the appropriately named
Mount Scenery.

</P>
<P>
   History: All but unexplored by Europeans until 1637, St. Barts
or St. Barths (as it is commonly known now) is so tiny that it
became a secret hiding place for pirates. It has been a French
dependency of Guadeloupe since 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Arguably the most chic, exclusive and expensive island in the
Caribbean. Known for luxury-oriented and intimate accommodations;
the largest hotel has 76 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   More French than Creole, with almost 100 percent employment and
high literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Unusual among Caribbean islands in that the population includes
few blacks; early slave ships passed St. Barts by.

to say that the landing approach by plane is an experience you
likely won't soon forget.

purchased with St. Thomas and St. John by the United States from
Denmark for $25 million in 1917. U.S. citizenship was granted
natives in 1932; the U.S. Virgin Islands is now a self-governing,

   ST. EUSTATIUS

   Population: 2,200.
</P>
<P>
   Language: Dutch, but English is spoken everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Netherlands Antilles florin.
</P>
<P>
   History: During the late 1700s, St. Eustatius, first colonized
by the Dutch in 1636, was one of the most prosperous islands in the
Caribbean. It was a trading center with more than 8,000 residents.
Its demise was hastened by British plundering and the emancipation
of the island's slaves, which ruined the agricultural industry.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Lovely beaches where swimming isn't advised; and great places to
swim but with no sand in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Island is known as Statia by everyone except guidebook writers.
</P>
<P>
   Like its neighbor Saba, St. Eustatius is casino-, disco- and
pretense-free.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist information: 800-722-2394.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Air service is available from St. Maarten. Flight
time is about 17 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: The ruins of more than 250 ships are believed to
rest untouched in Oranje Bay. Along the shore at Oranjestad, be on
the lookout for blue beads. The five-sided beads originated in
Holland and probably were used for trade with Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Early to bed, early to dive. When you return home,
you'll be tan, well-rested and still have some money in your
wallet.

<P>
   History: Basically the same as St. Croix.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Almost two-thirds of the island _ and 5,600 acres of underwater
territory _ make up the Virgin Islands National Park. Main reasons
to visit include camping and hiking on well-preserved nature
trails. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Idyllic beaches and coves.
</P>

   Trunk Bay, celebrated for its 225-yard snorkeling trail but
often overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist information: Call 800-372-8784. Access www.usvi.net.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Ferry service is offered daily from St. Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Even if you have only a half-day during a cruise,
it's worthwhile making the boat ride from St. Thomas to St. John
and taking an island tour; most cruise lines schedule excursions,
with several sightseeing options.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The bustle of St. Thomas seems far removed once you
arrive on St. John. Instead of ducking past hordes of overly
aggressive panhandlers, the biggest challenge here is waiting for
wild donkeys to cross the road in the national park. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Language: English.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: East Caribbean dollar.
</P>
<P>
   History: St. Kitts was a base for Caribbean colonization for
both the French and the British, who had joined together to battle
Spain and then cohabited peacefully on the island for several
decades. After the ``friendship'' faltered, the French booted the
Brits off the island following the siege of Brimstone Hill
Fortress. St. Kitts was returned to the British via the Treaty of
Versailles in 1783. In 1983, St. Kitts and Nevis were allied as an
independent federation.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating petroglyphs createdby the native Caribs, who were
massacred in the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   Black beaches of volcanic sand on the island's northern end
contrast with its sugar-colored shores to the south.

   Getting there: Daily flights leave San Juan as well as other
islands such as Antigua, St. Thomas and St. Maarten. A 10-minute
flight or a 45-minute ferry ride connects St. Kitts and Nevis.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: If you wake up to sparkling clear skies here, head
immediately to the Brimstone Hill Fortress, which is perched 800
feet above the sea. Built of volcanic rock with walls as thick as
12 feet, the fortress offers both a view of 18th-century military
life and sweeping Caribbean vistas.

the early riser. More bustling than its neighbor Nevis, but that's
not saying much.

</P>
<P>
   Language: English.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Eastern Caribbean dollar. U.S. currency is widely
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   History: Occupied for centuries by the Arawak and then the Carib
Indians, St. Lucia was settled by the British in the early 17th
century. The British and French exchanged control 14 times before
the 1814 Treaty of Paris designated the island as a British Crown
Colony. St. Lucia is as an independent member of the British
Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:

<P>
   Among the lushest and prettiest Caribbean islands, with a dense
tropical rain forest, fertile green valleys, towering mountains and
numerous banana plantations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pitons, twin peaks that rise directly above the sea along
the southwest coast.
</P>
<P>
   The hot mineral baths of La Soufriere, a rare ``drive-in
volcano,'' and a nearby multicolored waterfall.

   Remote bays and inlets _ some reachable only by boat _ and good
diving.

   Insider tip: Don't waste much time in Castries or Soufriere, the
largest cities; this is an island made for exploration _ preferably
on foot if time and energy permit.

   Bottom line: St. Lucia is one of the Caribbean's most beautiful
islands; Mother Nature is the real attraction.

   Language: Dutch on St. Maarten, French on St. Martin. English is
widely spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: Dutch guilder on St. Maarten, French franc on St.
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   History: Dutch and French settlers found the island to their
liking. A treaty in 1648 divided the land: According to legend, a
Dutchman and Frenchman stood back to back, then raced in a circle
around the island until they met again face-to-face, thus
establishing the boundary. The same legend holds that the French
side is slightly bigger because the Frenchman drank only wine and
was faster than his gin-guzzling Dutch counterpart. Others contend
that the Dutchman was distracted by a French woman. St. Maarten is
now part of the Netherlands Antilles; St. Martin is a commune of
Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Two cultures on one small island; there are no restrictions or
checkpoints in crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   A faster pace on the Dutch side, home to Philipsburg, the main
cruise port (overcrowded when several ships are anchored offshore),
and several casinos.
</P>
<P>
   A Continental flair on the French side: Marigot is among the
Caribbean's most charming small towns, dotted with bistros and
creperies; its colorful marina is jammed with expensive yachts. At
first glance, Grand Case resembles any other one-street village by
the water, but some call it the restaurant capital of the
Caribbean; more than 20 eateries serve an international

<P>
   An emphasis on water sports and shopping, not sightseeing or
historical attractions.

<P>
   Notable for fine resorts, especially La Samana, which resembles
a Moorish Mediterranean village and occupies 55 secluded acres on
the French side.

<P>
   Insider tip: This is the place to be if you are short on laundry
money: Orient Beach on the French side is the Caribbean's most
popular clothing-optional beach; topless bathing is OK at many
other beaches. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bottom line: Perhaps no other island has experienced such a
rapid growth in tourism over the past two decades. While this led
to the construction of many new hotels, restaurants and shops,
Caribbean connoisseurs bemoan the loss of an unspoiled ambience.

   ST. THOMAS
</P>
<P>
   Location: 75 miles east of Puerto Rico, 2 miles west of St. John
and 40 miles north of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Size: 32 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Population: 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Language: English.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   No other Caribbean island caters so openly to cruise ships; as
many as 10 per day in peak season dock or anchor at Charlotte
Amalie.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds can be intense in the downtown area, especially on peak
cruise arrival days. Vendors, taxi drivers and panhandlers have
become increasingly rude and aggressive in recent years. But
shopping bargains abound, and as on the other U.S. Virgin Islands
duty-free allowances are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Much-photographed Magens Bay is stunning in its beauty; tours
will take you there and back.
</P>
<P>
   A good diving destination, with numerous companies vying for
business.
</P>
<P>
   A wide range of lodging options, from budget-conscious
accommodations to luxury resorts _ many rebuilt or refurbished
following extensive hurricane damage in recent years.

</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Delta Airlines offers connecting service via
Atlanta, American via Miami or Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Cruise passengers can avoid the crowds of downtown
Charlotte Amalie and still find good bargains at a large shopping
complex within walking distance of the ship's docking location.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: This is the Caribbean's most commercial island and
certainly a top shopping destination. Those interested in other
pursuits are advised to bypass Charlotte Amalie and head toward
Magens Bay or other scenic outposts away from the crowds.

   ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES
</P>
<P>
   Location: 61 miles south of Martinique.
</P>
<P>
   Size: St. Vincent is 133 square miles; the 32 islands that
comprise the Grenadines have a combined area of 17 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Population: 119,000.
</P>
<P>
   Language: English and French patois.
</P>
<P>
   Currency: East Caribbean dollar.
</P>
<P>
   History: Tenacious Carib Indians were able to keep European
intrusion at a minimum until the mid-1700s. The British finally
gained control of St. Vincent in 1763 and ruled the island almost
uninterrupted for 200 years. St. Vincent and the Grenadines
officially earned their independence in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics:
</P>
<P>
   Captain Bligh of the mutinous Bounty introduced breadfruit trees
to St. Vincent in 1793.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent boasts the oldest botanical garden in the Western
Hemisphere. It was established in 1765.
</P>
<P>
   Beach lovers should head for the Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
   There's a yacht happening in the Grenadines, 7Vhere
island-hopping has become an art form. The chain is dotted with
secluded beaches and private-island resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist information: Call 800-729-1726; or access www.vincy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Flights are available to Kingstown, St. Vincent
from Puerto Rico, Barbados and Grenada. In addition to inner-island
flights, regular ferry service connects St. Vincent with the
Grenadines' Bequia, Canouan, Mayreau and Union islands.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Want to taste the good life? Pool your money with
some friends and take a whirl around the islands on a chartered
yacht. You can go bare-bones or plush, for a day or a week. Every
day will be a picnic, every night a laid-back party.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: While plenty of people use St. Vincent as just a
springboard to the pretty Grenadines, you'll be well-rewarded if
you give the island a little of your time. It offers plenty of
natural sights such as attractive waterfalls, exotic gardens and
the volcano La Soufriere.

Port of Spain. The Tobago airport serves flights coming from Puerto
Rico and Trinidad, the latter a 25-minute journey. A five-hour
ferry ride is another option.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: The islands' location just off the coast of
Venezuela puts them south of the hurricane belt and makes Trinidad
and Tobago a good island destination for travel during storm-prone
months.

<P>
   History: An influx of British loyalists abandoned the States for
these islands after the U.S. declared its independence. These new
settlers set up cotton plantations that were doomed to fail. The
islands were designated a British Crown Colony in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristics: &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Islanders call themselves ``Belongers.''
</P>
<P>
   The uninhabited island of East Caicos is popular with nesting
sea turtles because of its superb 17-mile beach and its abundance

</P>
<P>
   Getting there: Direct air service is available out of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Insider tip: Plan your diving trip between the months of
December and April and you may be treated to an underwater
symphony. More than 2,500 humpback whales pass through this
archipelago, and their whale song often can be heard by divers.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: &UR;  &LR; Life is slow, breezes constant and clothing
modest. Another great diving destination with some distinguished
high-end resorts such as the Grace Bay Club on Providenciales and
the Meridian Club on Pine Cay. &QL;

 &HT;    CHINESE TROOPS DETAILED TO RENOVATE TIANANMEN SQUARE
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 400 words.
 &HT;    With photo placed in the International folder on the Cox Server.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Scores of troops of the People's Liberation Army were
at work Monday in Tiananmen Square, this time breaking up paving
rather than demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation is for next fall's celebration of the 50th
anniversary of the Chinese communist revolution. But the big
question hanging over the soldiers' labor is precisely when they
will finish the estimated seven-month face-lift in relation to a
less festive anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Will Tiananmen Square reopen before or after the 10th
anniversary of the pro-democracy demonstrations that were crushed
on June 4, 1989, some diplomats wondered Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Chinese authorities have forbidden any commemoration
of the protests that began in Tiananmen that May and ended in a
scattered series of bloody confrontations. A closure of the square
continuing into next June would make the prohibition easier to
maintain in an important anniversary year, one that well might
tempt some Chinese to mark the sad events of a decade past.
</P>
<P>
   However long it lasts, the closure that began last week has
surprised tourists for whom a visit to Tiananmen Square is normally
a key component of seeing Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a part of history,'' said Emanuel Washington, 38, an
electrical engineer visiting this week from Freemont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see what it was about, where the students were
(demonstrating). This is a disappointment,'' said Washington, who
said he was surprised to be barred from entering the square.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation of Tiananmen Square was announced on Oct. 31, and
dozens of canvas-topped Army troop trucks were spotted in the
square in the middle of last week.
</P>
<P>
   All day Monday, uniformed military and state security officers
guarded the entrances of the new, sky blue sheet metal wall that
surrounds nearly all of the square. Only authorized persons and
vehicles could pass into the broad expanse of Tiananmen Square,
covering more than 100 acres, that until now has been open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   At about seven feet high, the wall also limits ground-level
viewing of the roughly 500 soldiers in green fatigues and some
civilian workers who already have busted up large portions of the
concrete brick plaza, creating jagged holes and tall piles of
rubble peeking above the wall.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Why did the Chinese government choose to assign the job to
soldiers?
</P>
<P>
   A score of phone calls by the Cox News Service failed to find
the answer. The information or propaganda offices of the city
government, the Beijing City Construction Group, the Tiananmen
Square Management Committee and the Beijing Committee of the
Communist Party -- all of which were purported to have
responsibility for the repairs -- said they could not answer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sensitive nature of the square prompted leaders to
assure no one would sabotage the work. Perhaps the army has the
right equipment and manpower. Or maybe the price is right.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers have not been seen laboring at the multitude of other
construction/renovation projects underway in Beijing in preparation
for the big 50th birthday of ``New China'' that falls on October 1
next year.
</P>
<P>
   The official news agency Xinhua reported earlier this year that
Beijing had begun ``67 giant projects'' estimated to cost $14
billion to mark the anniversary. They range from subway expansion
to new sewer lines to refurbishing the Great Hall of the People and
the Museum of the Revolution, both located on Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   At the square, the cement bricks in an area of 170,000 square
meters are to be replaced by granite ones, the loudspeaker system
is to be revamped, and lighting improved. A new fountain with laser
lights will be added, Xinhua said.

LIKE THE CUCKOO CLOCK, ANTI-SEMITISM IS AN OLD SWISS TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The recently settled controversy over how much Swiss
banks owe the relatives of Jewish depositors later killed by the
Nazis has unleashed a strong wave of anti-Semitism in Switzerland,
according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting aspects of the report are that it was
compiled by an official Swiss government agency and that it admits
anti-Jewish sentiment among the Swiss was already widespread before
the dispute erupted. In fact, the Commission against Racism said
anti-Semitism is ``endemic'' among all classes and goes back a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   This comes as little surprise to journalists, including me, who
in reporting on the so-called Holocaust gold debate received
patently anti-Semitic letters from Swiss nationals accusing us of
being part of a Jewish conspiracy. One letter that I received
declared that Swiss bankers were honest, unlike ``the Jew, Meyer
Lansky, who was the banker to the Mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   The official report noted that during the debate over the banked
funds ``a wave of anti-Semitism manifested itself in letters to
Swiss newspapers, hate mail to Jewish organizations and incidents
in which individual Jews were insulted and ostracized.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-Semitism achieved a ~~``high level of social
respectability,'' according to the report, because it appeared to
be in accord with what many prominent Swiss people, including some
politicians, believed. Jean Pascal Delamuraz, a former president of
the Swiss Confederation, for instance, publicly described the
action of Jewish groups to recover the money as ``blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Major Swiss banks finally agreed in July to pay $1.2 billion to
the claimants after initially contending that those with a right to
the funds were paid off long ago and later offering much smaller
amounts than the sum eventually agreed to. The $1.2 billion was
judged to be comparable at today's prices to the total of Jewish
deposits before World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Although Switzerland likes to portray itself as a haven for
anti-Nazi refugees during the war, thousands of Jews fleeing German
Fuhrer Adolf Hitler were turned away at the frontier. The report
said the underlying cause was popular antipathy to Jews, an
attitude that it conceded ``goes back centuries.'' Some officials
who tried to help Jewish refugees were fired from their jobs, the
study added.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bankers' agreement was reached, antagonism toward Jews
has mounted, the report stated. Opinion polls show anti-Semitism
still on the rise, it noted, with many Swiss believing the banks
should not have ``capitulated.''

MITCH'S BIGGEST LEGACY MAY BE POLITICAL

<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ When Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman
lumbered into a nationally televised charity event to donate his
own money to victims of Hurricane Mitch last week, he pointedly
handed the check to telethon organizers with his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do anything with the left,'' Aleman joked, referring
to his hard-line stance against the leftist Sandinista National
Liberation Front, which took power 19 years ago through
insurrection and was voted out of office in 1990 after years of
civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch, which swept through Central America last weekend, killed
up to 10,000 people, almost all of them in Honduras and Nicaragua.
The storm left nearly 1 million homeless and destroyed national
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Experts worry now about the economic toll on the region and the
possibility of epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   But the storm's most important legacy could be political, some
analysts say. Mitch could reignite some of the region's old feuds
and hatreds, roiling its fragile political balance.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala only recently ended the
civil wars that tormented them in the 1970s and 1980s. Those
countries, which are now ruled by elected leaders, all reported
Mitch-related deaths. Officials in Nicaragua have placed the death
toll there at 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, where an estimated 6,000 people died, a weak
civilian government has only begun to break the hold of its
powerful military.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to put them back as far as their political
development goes,'' said Vincent Gawronski, a political scientist
at Florida International University in Miami who studies the
political impact of hurricanes and other calamities in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disaster reveals the health of a political system, a society
and an economy,'' he said. ``It's like taking the lid off a
stinking garbage can.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, much of the civil war fought between the
Sandinistas and U.S.-backed rebels in the 1980s was centered in the
areas worst hit by Mitch. That war claimed more than 30,000 lives
and gutted this impoverished nation's economy. Guerrilla bands of
various political stripes still roam remote corners of the north.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers fear serious violence could return, if political
feuding gets in the way of relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If hunger takes hold of the country, you could see social
explosions,'' said analyst Oscar Rene Vargas, a frequent critic of
Aleman's.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation where political grudges have spawned numerous civil
wars over the centuries, and where democratic government was
restored only eight years ago, the recriminations started even
before the rains stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman and his Liberal Party won a hotly contested 1996 election
over the Sandinistas, promising economic development and a rollback
of the revolutionary government's socialist policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sandinistas remain the country's second most powerful
political force, their strength based in the very communities Mitch
hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Sandinista mayors complain that they are being cut out of the
aid pipeline in the northwestern communities near the volcano where
a Mitch-triggered mudslide killed at least 2,000 on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   When Aleman traveled into the countryside last week to survey
the storm's damage, he was greeted by insult-slinging protesters,
some of whom were undoubtedly sent by local Sandinista leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's manner of providing aid is taking inhuman
proportions,'' charged Lludely Aburto, a member of the Sandinista
delegation in the national congress. ``This reflects the state of
incompetence of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, the Sandinista congressional delegation
launched a short-lived effort to have Aleman removed from office
because of alleged indifference and incompetence in the face of
Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman has not done much to dampen the feuding.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy lawyer who served as the pro-business mayor of Managua
before being elected president, Aleman balked at accepting
physicians, medicine and other aid from Fidel Castro's Cuba, which
was a prime backer of the Sandinista government.
</P>
<P>
   And he angered many Sandinistas by naming members of Nicaragua's
conservative Roman Catholic clergy to oversee distribution of food
and other aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to see to it that Sandinista communities don't
receive any aid,'' charged Ramona Castellon, a Sandinista leader in
a flooded farm village near the city of Leon.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials insist that the slow pace at which aid is
reaching Mitch's victims has to do with logistics, not political
vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   The relief operation ``doesn't have political tints,'' said
David Robleto, the government minister who coordinates
international aid. ``It has nothing to do with political parties.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the aid pouring into Nicaragua from around the
world will be administered by municipal emergency committees headed
by local clergy. Members include military officers, politicians and
civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the places we visited there is a certain working
relationship,'' acknowleged Aburto, the Sandinista congresswoman,
who toured hurricane-damaged communities on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandinistas and some foreign aid agencies argue that Aleman
should have declared a national emergency in the face of Mitch.
Such a declaration, they say, would have made Nicaragua's crisis
seem as urgent as that of neighboring Honduras, assuring this
country an adequate share of the tens of millions of dollars in
foreign aid being sent to the region.
</P>
<P>
   But members of Aleman's administration _ many of whom lived in
exile during the Sandinistas' rule and remain their intractable
foes _ argue that such a declaration was unnecessary and would have
been undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   It would have allowed authorities to tap phones, curtail travel
and restrict business operations, Vice President Enrique Bolanos
argued last week. An emergency declaration also would have given
additional authority to the army and police, organizations still
heavily influenced by the Sandinistas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suffered all of that in the '80s,'' Bolanos said in a
televised address, referring to the years of Sandinista government.
``We don't want it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political wrangling and maneuvering, leaders from
all sides continue to call for national unity. While national and
local leaders bicker, some aid workers say, people in ravaged
communities are putting their differences aside, at least for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the local level, the people faced with the emergency are
saying that (even if) they don't agree on much, they can agree that
they have a common problem,'' said the director of a foreign
private aid agency in Managua. &QL;

OPPORTUNITIES SEEN FROM RUIN OF MITCH 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ By erasing entire communities from the
map, Hurricane Mitch changed the face of Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   In a land where life was already calamitous for thousands of
poor families, Mitch came as an end-of-the-millennium apocalypse, a
disaster that hit just as the country was struggling to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   According to an editorial in the Tegucigalpa daily El Heraldo on
Saturday, Honduras' losses were worse than the total material
damage caused by civil wars in nearby Guatemala, El Salvador and
Nicaragua in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the disaster suffered by the Honduran people is
worse than what any (Central American) nation suffered in
decades,'' said Jose Alejandro Arevalo, president of the Central
American Bank of Economic Integration.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Mitch _ which killed an estimated 6,000
Hondurans, left 1 million homeless and destroyed 70 percent of
agricultural lands _ the country could face famines, epidemics and
social uprisings, said Manuel Torres Calderon, a Honduran political
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts worry that the disaster could strengthen the hand
of the military after 15 years of civilian rule and leave Honduras
even more dependent on foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is an emerging sense that an opportunity
is at hand to right some historic wrongs and design a blueprint for
a better Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Efrain Diaz argues that reconstruction must include
everything from improved urban planning to environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the chance to remake the country with an eye on the
future,'' he said. ``We need a new mentality, a new attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet true nation-building in Honduras, Diaz and other analysts
say, requires more than new roads, bridges and factories to replace
those destroyed by Mitch. It requires fundamental political and
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about making things the way they were before the
disaster,'' said Pablo Carias, a sociologist at the National
Autonomous University of Honduras. ``The nation must seize the
moment to break with the humiliating past.''
</P>
<P>
   This Tennessee-sized country of 5 million has been wracked by
corruption, coups and economic stagnation _ all of which have
helped turn Honduras into the third poorest country in the
hemisphere, behind only Haiti and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Since independence in 1821, Honduras has gone through
rebellions, civil wars and changes of government. A series of
military rulers gave way to a democratically elected president in
1983, but the military remains a dominant force.
</P>
<P>
   Although Honduras was never seriously threatened by guerrilla
groups, the country became a staging ground in the 1980s for
Washington's efforts to topple Marxist revolutions in Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Guatemala. In exchange, Honduras received more than $2
billion in U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Honduras was home to the largest CIA station in
the world as well as three armies _ those of the Hondurans, the
Americans and the U.S.-backed Contra rebels fighting in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   Critics took to calling their homeland ``the U.S.S. Honduras.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, much of the aid was squandered. And when the Cold
War petered out, so did much of Washington's interest in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. aid to Honduras dropped dramatically, but analysts say the
belt-tightening did some good. Partly because the Honduran military
no longer enjoys unconditional U.S. support, its size and influence
have dwindled, and civilian government has solidified.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, the government said, ``We're helping the United
States in their fight against (communism), so pay us,' '' said Leo
Valladares, head of the the National Human Rights Commission.
``Now, we know we have to open up to the world and not just depend
on Uncle Sam.''
</P>
<P>
   The devastation wrought by Mitch, however, could force Honduras
to pass the hat for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a huge setback in terms of Honduras' ability to make
decisions and to act as an independent, sovereign nation without
being so reliant on the United States and the international
community,'' said Susan Peacock, a Honduras expert at the National
Security Archive in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The scramble for disaster aid has led to unseemly bickering,
even as the dead are being counted. Several newspapers have
complained that Honduras will lose aid dollars to Nicaragua, unless
President Carlos Flores does a better job of articulating the scope
of the damage here.
</P>
<P>
   Some Hondurans believe the Clinton administration, which has
announced about $70 million in relief assistance for Central
America, should do more.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to U.S. largesse during the Cold War, a recent
newspaper cartoon depicted a stingy Uncle Sam handing out a few
dollars to a hurricane victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is strange,'' the victim says. ``In the '80s, you gave a
lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' says Uncle Sam. ``But you can't compare Mitch to the
communist menace.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more radical suggestions from both Honduras and
Nicaragua is that governments and banks ought to forgive the
countries' foreign debts or engage in debt swaps for hurricane
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras spends about 30 percent of its national budget just to
pay the annual interest on its $4 billion debt. Between January and
October, Honduras spent $245 million on debt-service payment, an
amount that could pay for a new road system in the
hurricane-ravaged capital of Tegucigalpa, Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the inevitable snags in the civilian
government's relief effort are bound to weaken President Flores,
who took office in January. Any such shortfalls could provide an
opening for the military, said George Vickers, executive director
of the Washington Office on Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras' army has been weakened by the elimination of the
draft, the transfer of the police force to civilian control and
revelations about army-linked death-squad activities during the
1980s. At the same time, however, recent civilian governments have
come under scrutiny for corruption and for their failure to combat
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even under normal circumstances, the ability (of the
government) to deliver services is extremely weak,'' Vickers said.
``The military will try to leverage that to their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The efficient handling of disaster aid will be vital to
maintaining a level of national unity in the coming months, said
Valladares, the human rights commissioner. Another key is to
promote the sort of citizen solidarity and good will that Hondurans
have shown the many victims of Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch was a disaster, but it left behind a united family,''
said Marta Bonilla, an Interior Ministry official. ``It made us
reflect a lot. We have to stick together all the time, not just
during tragedies.''

I DIDN'T FIGURE GINGRICH FOR A WIMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I figured Newt Gingrich for a lot of things, some good and some
not so good: Smart, articulate, visionary, arrogant,
self-indulgent, combative, uncompromising ...
</P>
<P>
   One thing I didn't figure him for was a gutless wimp, a coward
who would cut and run in the face of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   When rebellious Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives
reacted to GOP losses in Tuesday's congressional elections by
threatening to oust Gingrich from his post as speaker, it seemed
reasonable to assume that he would battle the insurgents with every
resource at his command.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Gingrich's leadership had been challenged before, by
many of these same people, and he quickly quelled the rebellion.
What reason was there to expect that this time would be any
different?
</P>
<P>
   But this time was different all right, different as night is
from day. This time, Gingrich opted not to fight for the position
he maneuvered throughout his political career to attain; this time,
Newt decided to surrender without so much as a whimper of
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had always approached political combat with the bravado
expressed in that great line from ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid'': ``There aren't any rules in a knife fight.''
</P>
<P>
   He joyously slashed and sliced his way through any opposition,
in or out of Congress. He defended his turf with a
take-no-prisoners ferocity that earned him the respect if not the
admiration of his adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   But last week some of his fellow Republicans _ including some of
the very people who charged into Congress as part of the
Gingrich-led Republican Revolution of 1994 _ hurled a few
rhetorical hand grenades in his direction and he suddenly,
inexplicably, dived into the nearest foxhole. As his enemies
rallied their troops, Gingrich looked out upon the battlefield and
recoiled from the fight that loomed.
</P>
<P>
   I figured Newt for a lot of things, but not for a gutless wimp.
</P>
<P>
   Who could have guessed that by week's end, Gingrich would be
telling associates that he would not fight to keep his job as
speaker, that he would not even ask to be re-elected to the
position that places him second to the vice president in the line
of succession to the presidency of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich didn't even have the gumption to step in front of the
TV cameras that he has so often courted. Instead of holding a news
conference and telling the world that he had no stomach for a
political showdown, he confided his decision over the phone to
colleagues who in turn passed along the information to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Gutless wimp.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits have sometimes drawn comparisons in recent years between
Gingrich and his frequent adversary, President Clinton. The theory
seemed to be that despite drastic differences in their political
philosophies, Clinton and Gingrich had a great deal in common _
their intense combativeness and will to win, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Now we see that the comparisons were bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is a man who never, ever quits. Tenacity is the defining
quality of his life. Perseverance is the one principle he holds
dear.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, if no other, Gingrich had seemed to be a similar
soul. But he is not. He is a quitter.
</P>
<P>
   It would be one thing if Gingrich had fought for his job and
been defeated. He could have been a gracious loser, acknowledging
the need for new leadership in a Republican Congress that can't get
anything done and can't even agree on what ought to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Newt's time was up. Maybe his vision had run its course,
or just run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans who once saw him as their party's savior, who
may have believed that his leadership was not entirely spent,
deserved to see him stand tall in defeat. Instead, he crawled away
in the night, unwilling to face friend or foe at his moment of
capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   Newt and others will try to pass off his surrender as
statesmanship, as a noble sacrifice that he made for the good of
the party.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is inescapable. He's gutless.

WHEN CONFLICT ARISES ON THE JOB, MANY TURN FIRST TO THEIR
OMBUDSMAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are like corporate den mothers with a soothing presence,
big shoulders to cry on and a box of tissues at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   Their offices are discreet and located far from the offices of
power _ some having private exits.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, perhaps, they are independent operators,
reporting directly to the president or chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   They are company ombudsmen, and they are there to help.
</P>
<P>
   Long a fixture on university campuses and on some newspaper
staffs, ombudsmen are now making their way into corporate offices,
resolving personality conflicts before they reach the boiling
point, settling disputes over pay or helping to determine if an
employee has been terminated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike union shop stewards or human resources managers, they
represent neither a union nor a company. The ombudsmen, created to
avert expensive employment lawsuits, pride themselves on
confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Shell Oil Co., Chevron Corp., Halliburton/Brown &AMP;
Root, Texaco and the Houston Independent School District all have
ombudsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues ombudsmen handle don't seem like major
problems to most people, but for the individuals involved, they
are, said the HISD ombudsmen, Harold Trahan and Richard Timmons.
They listened to 1,600 concerns last year from 1,300 individuals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, two coaches at different schools spent two days in
mediation because one was angry with the other for supposedly
stealing his star players. Another time, the ombudsmen helped
broker a truce between two employees who wanted to park in the same
parking space.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth F. Schaumburger, one of five ombudsmen for Chevron and
the only one in Houston, had a recent case in which two employees
who had to work together stopped talking and communicated only by
e-mail. It took three sessions and a lot of tears to reach a
resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many issues, however, are more serious and can make the
difference as to whether an employee keeps or loses his job.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the case of Annie Sandles.
</P>
<P>
   Sandles is a 59-year-old smoker who has trouble blowing into a
Breathalyzer. When the HISD bus driver was chosen for a random drug
test recently, she passed the urine test but couldn't get enough
air into the Breathalyzer.
</P>
<P>
   Sandles, who couldn't get behind the wheel of her bus until she
passed the entire drug test, got a special Breathalyzer clearance
from her doctor. Sometimes that sort of exception takes a while to
work its way through a bureaucracy, during which time the employee
wouldn't be paid. This time, however, it was smooth sailing.
</P>
<P>
   After a phone call to the ombudsman at the request of Sandles'
union leader, she was back driving her bus that very evening.
</P>
<P>
   The ombudsmen accelerate the process, said John Bland,
international representative of the Transport Workers Union of
America Local 261 in Houston. They make school officials move a
little faster and can get things done.
</P>
<P>
   About 95 percent of ombudsmen come from within a company, so
they know the culture, unwritten rules and power structures that
are generally hidden from outside view, said Carole M. Trocchio,
executive director of the Ombudsman Association in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   They're also neutral, representing neither the interests of the
company nor the interests of employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask: ``Who pays you?' '' said Wilber Hicks, an
ombudsman for Shell's Resolve program. ``If you're paid by Shell,
how can you be neutral?''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said he explains that it's in their job description to be
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just defended the company, then no one would come to
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same with employees _ if the ombudsmen took the employees'
side, managers would have no confidence in them.
</P>
<P>
   HISD has an identical code of neutrality that governs its
ombudsmen, but one union leader believes that it renders the school
district's ombudsmen rather ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   They're very helpful with minor insurance problems when no ego
is involved, but when it comes to handling a real conflict between
a teacher and an administrator, the ombudsmen don't have any power,
said Gayle Fallon, president of the Houston Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   They can commiserate all day with you but they can't hand down
enforceable decisions, she said. And by the time a teacher works
her way through the ombudsman process, she may exceed the time
during which she is allowed to file a grievance, Fallon said.
(Teachers have 30 days in which to file a grievance.)
</P>
<P>
   Fallon also complained that administrators aren't forced to deal
with the ombudsmen if they don't want to. She said there aren't any
penalties for a manager who doesn't participate in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon said the program was put in place to replace unions. But
the ombudsmen aren't advocates for employees, she said, and don't
have the credibility they need to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Trahan and Timmons said the ombudsmen's office has been open for
three years and they seek out opportunities to meet with school
district employees to let them know they're available. But they
can't go to a school unless they're invited.
</P>
<P>
   Some administrators aren't too excited when they hear it's the
ombudsman on the other end of the phone, Trahan said. But once they
see that the ombudsman can help, they are usually cooperative, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   An ombudsman adds another level of review, so a person feels
he's had his day in court with someone who has no interest in the
outcome, said Joe Rosse, associate professor of management at the
University of Colorado at Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the decision stays the same _ for example, a co-worker
gets to keep his choice assignment _ the employee who complained
feels better, said Rosse, who specializes in employee-satisfaction
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a bit of research shows that if an employee believes a
particular system is fair _ in choosing who is laid off, for
example _ the employee will be able to handle the unfavorable
decision better than if he believes it is arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption of an ombudsman program has been a real sea change
for some companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, people at Shell worried about retaliation if
they complained about employment practices, said Shell ombudsman
Walter Krudop.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company is trying to change the culture to make it
more relationship-driven, and that includes bringing conflicts to
the fore. But employees are still understandably unsure whether top
company officials really want employees to come forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a while to build up trust, but as people hear through
the grapevine that the ombudsmen are helpful at resolving conflicts
in a confidential way, there will be even less hesitation about
coming forward, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ombudsmen are confidential and zealous about protecting the
information they receive. Unless an employee asks the ombudsman to
pursue a complaint, the information must remain confidential.
</P>
<P>
   That includes complaints of sexual harassment or race
discrimination _ if the employee doesn't want to make a formal
complaint or pursue the problem, there's nothing an ombudsman can
do.
</P>
<P>
   HISD's ombudsmen make an exception to that code of
confidentiality if an employee indicates a child is being abused or
there is evidence that an employee may harm others, Timmons said.
</P>
<P>
   About once a year, they get a call from a secretary that someone
is highly agitated and needs someone to talk to, so Timmons or
Trahan rush over.
</P>
<P>
   To keep that confidentiality, ombudsmen are keen to ensure their
clients' privacy and go out of their way to make it difficult for
visitors to be spotted. Consequently, the HISD ombudsmen's offices
are located in an office building several miles away from the main
administration office and can't be seen from any school.
</P>
<P>
   Each ombudsman has a private door leading out into a hallway, so
clients who don't want to be spotted can dash out and leave the
building through a back staircase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meet people in airports, hotel lobbies and restaurants,''
said Schaumburger. He said he was at a meeting in which he sat next
to a former client, who didn't even acknowledge his existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a lonely job,'' said Schaumburger. His office is
sandwiched in with a hodgepodge of Chevron offices, such as one for
medical services, and the health club. It's hard to figure out who
has come to see which department, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to lunch with you, quipped Shell's Hicks and
Krudop, for fear people will think you're discussing a workplace
problem.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, ombudsmen know a lot of very interesting gossip but
tend to be very diplomatic. The ombuds, as they are called at
Shell, just smile when they're asked for some really good stories,
with names deleted of course.
</P>
<P>
   While ombudsmen keep confidential information close to their
vests, they do make reports that list the types of issues that
they've handled, with no names attached.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of the job is to identify for the president ``threads
of similarities'' before things get out of hand, such as a rash of
sexual harassment complaints, Schaumburger said.
</P>
<P>
   That confidentiality, which has been the trademark of ombudsmen,
has been challenged recently in court.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in St. Louis ruled last year that an
ombudsman at McDonnell Douglas Corp. (now part of Boeing Co.)
couldn't keep his records secret in a case involving a manager who
had a dispute with his supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The employee who had complained to the ombudsman later filed an
age discrimination case and sought copies of the ombudsman's
records.
</P>
<P>
   The company sought to keep the records secret, citing ombudsman
privilege, but the appeals court ruled the records must be turned
over to the employee.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision isn't binding on judges in other parts of the
country, it does open the door for employees and their lawyers to
obtain a wealth of information about personnel practices from the
corporate ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   Before the decision came down, John Delaney said he believed
that corporate ombudsman programs would really take off.
</P>
<P>
   But in light of the McDonnell Douglas decision, Delaney, a
professor of management at the University of Iowa, said companies
are taking a second look at the value of an ombudsman if their
confidentiality can't be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   While many companies started their ombudsman programs to solve
potential legal problems before they turn into expensive lawsuits,
it's hard to get a handle on exactly how much companies save by
using them.
</P>
<P>
   Several employees have said they would have filed a lawsuit
without Shell Resolve, said Krudop, but it's hard to say whether
that's really true.
</P>
<P>
   Shell is undertaking a study to determine how much money it is
saving in legal fees, which is hard to do because it can't turn
over its records of individuals, even to an independent third
party, Krudop said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, it is considering conducting a companywide survey
that will ask people who have used the program for their
confidential input.
</P>
<P>
   While the jury is still out, Krudop and Hicks are proud that
since the introduction of its ombudsman program 18 months ago, the
number of employment-related lawsuits that have been filed against
Shell has fallen drastically _ about 90 percent. Shell requires its
employees to use the ombudsman program before they file a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The ombudsmen at HISD figure their program saves $685,000 a year
in legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Timmons said it's hard to estimate who would have sued had they
not had a chance to meet with the ombudsmen, but the ombudsmen go
through their cases each year and try to make their best guess.
</P>
<P>
   They figure each federal court case avoided saves $150,000, and
each mediation they handle saves $800 in outside mediation fees. &QL;

<P>
   SCI-WATER-USE (Undated) _ In a little-noticed but potentially
historic environmental turnabout, federal analysts report that
Americans' use of water declined by about 9 percent from 1980 to
1995 _ even as the United States' population grew by 16 percent
over the same period. By William K. Stevens. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ANTARCTICA-WOMEN (Undated) _ Life is vastly different these
days in Mactown, as its inhabitants call McMurdo Station, the main

austral summer, about a third of them are women. By Cornelia Dean.
With map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-DRUGS (Undated) _ Medical researchers have long
done experiments either in vivo, in living organisms, or in vitro,
in glass or test tubes. Now they are starting to work in silico, or

cataloging and analyzing the massive amounts of data being
discovered about human genes. By Andrew Pollack. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRAIN-CELLS (Undated) _ Officials of the National Institutes
of Health are seeking legal advice as to whether the congressional
ban on fetal research applies to the primordial human cells that

<P>
   HEALTH-POLIO (Undated) _ Dr. Nancy Frick, one of the world's
foremost experts on the long-term psychological effects of
childhood polio, describes herself as absolutely Type A, driven to
succeed almost to the point of exhaustion. She is the director of a
research group, Harvest Center in Hackensack, N.J., which focuses
on the study of post-polio syndrome, a very late, totally

   HEALTH-GENDER (Undated) The Society for the Advancement of
Women's Health Research released an analysis of disease and disease
treatments showing significant differences in how men and women
fare. The society, a Washington-based advocacy group that has
championed the study of gender-based biology, identified the 10
most important findings in the field to date including the fact

<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ Short takes: Though gluttony is cited in
the Bible as a sin and a sign of moral weakness, religious people
in the United States are more likely to be overweight than
nonreligious people, researchers from Purdue University have found;
like tilting a pinball machine, leaning on the rails of a stair
climber comes with a penalty _ even if it's just for a short rest;
how to deal with images of youth and alcohol on television. With

TEACH ME! 
Kids Will Learn When Oppression Is the Lesson 
By Murray Levin 
Monthly Review Press, 152 pp., $23 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For 45 years, Murray Levin taught political theory at
Boston University, Stonehill College, and Harvard Extension School.
But in 1993, at age 70, he decided to explore a very different
educational terrain. He spent three years teaching history at the
Greater Egleston Community High School, an alternative school in
the city's Jamaica Plain neighborhood with a student body mostly
African American and Latino, students who had failed to learn at
mainstream schools.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Teach Me! Kids Will Learn When Oppression is
the Lesson,'' Levin chronicles his experience at the school he
refers to as ``a venue of last resort'' for the students whose
living environments present daily threats to learning.
</P>
<P>
   After months of frustration, Levin abandoned the textbook he had
thought his students would respond to: ``A People's History of the
United States,'' by fellow academic Howard Zinn. Students
considered it boring and refused to read it. Instead, he decided to
teach logic to students whose thinking was fragmented and
unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of textbooks, he used the study of the Cuban missile
crisis to discuss power struggles, uncertainty, and drawing wrong
conclusions that seem right. He dissected advertising and political
campaigns to show how they manipulate minds. He had students
role-play. He ate lunch with them and talked to them.
</P>
<P>
   The results were mixed. Students dropped in and out of his
class, sometimes showed up high or drunk, were unable to grasp the
significance of education in their lives, or were distracted by
abusive relationships or friends murdered in street violence.
</P>
<P>
   Levin says he intends the book to be ``an intellectual history,
an analysis of how black and Latino adolescents see the world ...
an account of their political and social theory, their perception,
their cognition, their despair and their attraction to
conspiratorial thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing this, he hopes to lay out a successful, unconventional
approach to teaching that will reach difficult students where they
live _ one that takes into account the conditions of poverty,
violence, drugs, and abuse that prevents them from learning by
traditional methods. It is a noble desire, and Levin explains
effectively why such an approach is needed. Unfortunately, his book
fails on many levels.
</P>
<P>
   Levin has taken a snapshot of a small group of black and Latino
students and used it to project a global image. These students so
hopelessly lost in despair and paralyzed by what they think the
white world is doing to them wrongly become representative of all
minority students living in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book consists of verbatim accounts of students
talking about how they view politics, history, poverty, violence,
and the causes of despair in their lives. Often that cause is white
oppression. Often the quotations are rambling, profanity-filled,
laced with broken English.
</P>
<P>
   Levin does this no doubt to show the fragmented thinking process
of the students he dealt with over a three-year period and to
illustrate the challenge he faced as a teacher. But the result is a
book that's an unpleasant struggle to read. It is not always clear
which student is speaking; none of the voices is distinctive or
individual.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, Levin's insistence on interpreting what a
student has just said comes across as insulting. He wants to allow
the students to speak for themselves, but he assumes they cannot be
understood. And though he praises the students' writing ability and
even includes some of their poetry, he continually points out that
their comments in class are ridiculous, even paranoid _ they
believe white people are trying to destroy minorities; they
theorize that the government created the AIDS virus to kill blacks
and Latinos and is involved in the drug trade for the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, given the years he devoted to the school, Levin cared
about the frustrating mission of trying to make education work for
urban kids so often left behind. But that caring doesn't translate.
Instead, he projects the cold detachment of a scientist viewing
specimens through a microscope. &UR;  &LR; ``Teach Me!'' has a Professor
'enry 'iggins in the 'hood feel. His time at the Egleston school
may have been an interesting experiment, for him and for his
students. But his report on the experiment is not a plan for
change.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ They thought they could win, but never like
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think it would happen this way,'' said Atlanta coach
Dan Reeves of the 41-10 beating his team gave the Patriots Sunday.
``But we did the two things we had to do to win. We ran the ball.
We got turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy for Atlanta because the Patriots played like they
didn't care, according to several veteran Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It was also easy for Atlanta because they had a better game plan
than the Patriots, taking advantage of New England's injury
problems.

   ``When No. 88 (Terry Glenn) doesn't play for them, that makes a
big difference in their offense,'' said safety Eugene Robinson.
``They have no one to go to right away with the ball. We thought we
could handle their wide recievers. We played against Henry Ellard
and knew what he could do. And then we didn't think the other kid
(Tony Simmons) could take advantage of what we were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to do is start by stopping their wide
receivers,'' said Falcons defensive coordinator Rich Brooks. ``Our
cornerbacks did a great job. This forced Drew Bledsoe to hold on to
the ball longer, and when he did our pass rush was able to get to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted heat on Bledsoe,'' said Robinson. ``We wanted him to
move in the pocket, because when you make him move, he doesn't
throw as well as when you let him stand still.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our corners shut down their wide receivers. Then we kept on
blitzing, and they had to keep Ben Coates in to block. When we did
that, they tried to throw quick to the running back (Robert
Edwards), and that didn't work. So there really wasn't anywhere
they could go with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offense was shut down. With New England's top
receivers out with injuries, Bledsoe had no one to throw to right
away, and the Falcons roared after him all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the most we have blitzed any team in the two
years I've been here,'' said linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the
former Bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got good pressure on Drew. When I saw them keeping Coates
in to block, then I knew we had them. I've played against them
enough to know that when you take Coates out of the game, no matter
how you do it, you have them beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' offense also had answers for whatever the Patriots'
defense tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in here expecting to play against the best defense we
played all year, and it didn't happen,'' said Falcons quarterback
Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a crazy game. We had the lead on them so fast, it
changed how we thought it would go. It was big for us to get a play
all the way to their 1-yard line,'' Chandler added about his
39-yard pass to Bob Christian on Atlanta's first possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, when our defense got a turnover and we scored right away
to go up, 14-0, we thought we could score some points. Not 35
points. I never thought we could score five offensive touchdowns
against these guys here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots appeared to have stacked their defense to stop the
running of Jamal Anderson. Even with that, they couldn't stop him.
With his running game going, Chandler had fun taking apart the New
England secondary with his play-action passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to double-cover Tony Martin's side of the field a
lot,'' Chandler said. ``They rolled their coverage that way. So I
went to Terance Mathis. He's a good receiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said the Falcons weren't picking on one person in the
secondary, although it looked like they feasted on Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran the play, and took what was open,'' he said. ``The
plays we made to the tight end (O.J. Santiago) came off some
bootleg action, and we got him up the field to make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had no running game. Edwards carried 10 times for
11 yards. ``He played like he was hurt,'' said Bennett. ``He didn't
seem to be running as hard as he did earlier in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was sacked five times, and it seemed like he was knocked
down 20 more.
</P>
<P>
   However, the most negative stat about the Patriots involved the
defense. This is where they were supposed to be stout this season,
and where they have disappointed most.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, the Patriots had given up 111 passing first
downs. No other team in the league had given up 100. In fact, the
league average was 82.8.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the same weakness was evident. The Falcons threw just 25
passes, but had 14 first downs through the air. The Patriots will
be 30th and last in the league once again, and it is a problem that
has to be fixed.

COMPUTER GOLF  
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN    
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger    
 c.1997 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend of mine and I have been playing computer golf for so
long that we have putted on the greens of Leaderboard, an Access
Software title for the now-defunct Commodore 64 and long-retired
Apple computer.
</P>
<P>
   The greens of Leaderboard were flat (and only one color of
green). On the early versions of the mid-1980s, there were
sandtraps and water hazards, but no trees. Back then, a ``software
upgrade'' was the addition of trees along the fairway that looked
as if they'd been cut from a block of wood using crosscut saws.
Adding leaves to the trees and texture to the fairways came a
version or so later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great game, however. It was the first golf-sim title to
actually give the feeling of playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Links LS 1999 was released. It had its beginning
with Leaderboard, which has now grown into a game that became the
first and only golf game endorsed by Arnold Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   The new edition offers plenty of new features. St. Andrews is
included on the course list, along with Palmer's Bay Hill Club &AMP;
Lodge, Latrobe Country Club, and Entrada at Snow Canyon. Video
tours of the courses and nearby attractions are included on the
four-disk set. The virtual tour of Palmer's office, workshop and
trophy room at Latrobe also is included.
</P>
<P>
   Latrobe now can be played during the fall, when the leaves are
in full color. Even if you bogey every hole, the trip around the
course is enjoyable for the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than two dozen new features, including two new
swing options. In addition to the two clicks of the mouse used to
control the swing's power and straightness, a three-click option
has been added. Players can also make shots and putts by moving the
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Taking something from another golfing program, a ``tournament
environment'' adds spectators to the fairways and allows players to
select the size crowds they want, ranging from a few onlookers to a
throng rivaling Arnie's Army.
</P>
<P>
   Depth of the screens has been improved, giving more of a feel
for looking down a fairway. In addition, overhead objects have been
added, including blimps, airplanes, birds and hot-air balloons that
move across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A ``caddie book'' gives tips for shooting par on each hole. In
addition, players can now record their own comments (in .WAV files)
and add them to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Access is trying to expand golf play for the Internet, and this
addition of Links includes a real-time voice chat for Internet
play. In addition, the company has set up the LS Tour Web site
(www.LSTour.com) which has live leaderboards and free tournaments
for Internet golfers of varying skill levels.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best features of Links LS 1999 is it takes the
customer into consideration: There are two versions of the product.
One is for people who already have purchased Links LS 1998 and only
need to upgrade. The other is the full version of the program for
the first-time buyer. The full game sells in the $40-$50 range; the
upgrade version is available for about $25-$30.
</P>
<P>
   Cut-Up Time For Kids
</P>
<P>
   Here's a neat little idea for youngsters for a playtime
experience at the computer: Tonka's Workshop (Windows 95/98; about
$40). It's a collection of plastic workshop tools _ saw, plane,
hammer, screwdriver, drill and spray-paint can. They're housed on a
plastic case that straps to the computer's keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Using a tool causes a key lined up beneath it to be pressed.
Kids use this no-tech interface to help Tonka Joe onscreen as he
guides them through building various projects in his workshop and
performing fix-it chores in the barn, storage shed, pickup truck,
tree house and cellar. It's designed for children ages 3 and older
and works with nearly any keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   While the projects sound complex, building them is not. A few
swipes of saw cuts a sled from a piece of board. Twist the
screwdriver a couple of times and the runners are bolted in place.
Press the spray can lever a few times and the project is complete.
</P>
<P>
   For its oversimplistic approach to the tool shed, Tonka Workshop
has drawn some reviews that imply Hasbro Interactive (the
publishers) should be taken out behind the wood shed. True, the
can't-make-a-mistake world of Tonka Joe's tool bench isn't going to
win any awards from the carpenters down at the union hall who never
had the luxury of an ``undo'' button.
</P>
<P>
   But it's for young kids, for goodness sake, who want to hammer,
pull and twist. The not-so-favorable reviews have come from the
general computing press. The reviews from organizations that cover
children's software specifically have been much more favorable.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the kids seem to enjoy the program, even if saws
never cut a crooked line or threads never strip. The old
carpenter's advice of ``measure twice, cut once,'' need not apply
in Tonka Joe's workshop.
</P>
<P>
   And to a youngster, that's just fine.

   Who Knows Jack?
</P>
<P>
   The message on the outside of the box containing HeadRush, a
trivia game for the younger generation, says the game is, in so
many words, ``not for geezers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the purchaser knows the names of the South Park
characters, along with other timely, seldom worthwhile,
information, he or she might want to consider another trivia game.
</P>
<P>
   This one (Windows/Macintosh; about $30) is from Berkeley
Software, which has a line of trivia software under the ``You Don't
Know Jack'' title. Company officials said the younger crowd was
shying away from the line, which covered ``crusty old '70s
trivia,'' in the words of one company executive.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``You Don't Know Jack'' concept was kept, but given
additional graphics and a ``coolness factor,'' a company
spokeswoman said. It also has more than 550 questions offered in a
variety of formats, and allows three players to compete with each
other or a computer opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Questions are introduced by cartoons. Sessions have a break for
the ``game show'' fictitious sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   And to appeal to the younger audience, the CD contains one audio
track from three bands recording on Mercury Records: Motorbaby, 2
Skinnee J's and Swirl 360.

<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Defying political correctness, descendants of
Panola County, Texas, slaves are dedicating a historical marker to
the slavemaster who brought their families here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird that black people would want to do a marker on a
slavemaster,'' admitted Barbara Jefferson-Bonner, a Panola County
historian specializing in black history. ``Slavemasters are
supposed to be mean and cruel, but he wasn't that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The marker will be dedicated for Spearman ``Major'' Holland, who
brought Bonner's family here as slaves in the 1840s.
</P>
<P>
   Holland Quarters, a predominantly African-American community, is
four miles north of Carthage in Panola County. A former plantation,
the community has been home to generations descended from Holland's
slaves. Panola County is 35 miles southeast of Longview, on the
Louisiana border
</P>
<P>
   According to intensive research by Bonner, Holland was known for
his generosity toward his slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great guy. He cared for his slaves in a unique kind
of way,'' she said. ``When Spearman left here, he left his
thousands of acres to his slaves, who were ancestors of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Path to history
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's search into Spearman Holland began with her own family.
A dedicated genealogist for more than a decade, Bonner found three
generations of men in her family named after Spearman Holland and
his brother, Bird Holland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run across several different things as you're doing
research,'' Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner's sources included census reports, family Bibles, tax
records and other legal documents, as well as interviews with ``the
old heads,'' as she calls community elders.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner said she particularly questioned why former slaves would
name their children after a slave owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``A slavemaster was a slavemaster,'' Bonner said. ``He could be
good, bad or indifferent, but I definitely wouldn't name my
children after him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in going through and listening to the elders and the
records, he was a great man,'' Bonner said. ``That was proved
because they continued to name their children after him and his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``And these were the blacks naming their children after the
slavemaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Lives of contradictions
</P>
<P>
   In addition to leaving his land to his former slaves, Holland
also was reputed to be a kind man while slavery was in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the slaves would complain about family members they'd
been separated from, he would find them and buy them,'' Bonner
said. ``One woman who didn't have any family, he bought her a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just trying to make sure he had all his families there,
and of those, he wanted them to be happy,'' Bonner explained.
</P>
<P>
   Holland was born in Virginia in 1801 and traveled to East Texas
by way of Carthage, Miss. A wealthy man involved in politics,
Holland was elected to the state Legislature and represented
Harrison County, which encompassed what is now Panola County, in
the Convention of 1845 and in the first Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (Spearman and his family) were deep into politics,''
Bonner said. ``Their slaves cared for the land while he was away.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories passed down through the years recounted that when
Spearman came home after a trip he would bring back gifts for
everyone on the plantation, including the slaves, Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Civil War, Spearman served as a captain in the Texas
State Troops, Fourth Brigade. After the war, Holland and his family
moved away from East Texas, and Holland left the land ``to those
who had worked it,'' Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   The gift of land
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been word of mouth through the family how we got the
land,'' Bonner said. ``It was so much land, blacks weren't supposed
to have that much land.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a type of caretaker relationship developed, where the
former overseer who had worked for Holland kept the land in trust
for the ex-slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner found records showing sales of large pieces of land from
the overseer to former slaves for amounts as little as $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the nine families who came here, all of them had a piece,''
Bonner said. ``It happened to people who just deserved a piece of
the pie, and they got that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1867, the freedmen changed the name of their community from
Holland Plantation to Holland Quarters, but they still sought a way
to repay Holland, Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they could do for him was to name our children after him
and remember,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's legacy
</P>
<P>
   The Holland generosity wasn't limited to Spearman, according to
Bonner's research. Spearman's brother, Bird, was known to buy
slaves just to give them their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1850, Bird bought three young male slaves from Spearman
and took them north to be educated at Oberlin College in Ohio. One
of the former slaves, Milton Holland, went on to join the Union
Army during the Civil War and was the first black Texan to be
awarded the Medal of Honor. Another of the former slaves, William
Holland, became a Texas state legislator after the war. He
introduced the bill to create what is now Prairie View A&AMP;M
University.
</P>
<P>
   Bird Holland, who had been Secretary of State in 1861, joined
the Confederate army and was killed in the Battle of Mansfield in
1864.
</P>
<P>
   Marking history
</P>
<P>
   The idea to request a historical marker for Spearman Holland may
have seemed odd on the surface, but it has some logic, said Emily
Bell, historian with the Texas Historical Commission, the panel
that approves and creates historical markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual, but not terribly surprising to me that the
descendants of ex-slaves would request the marker,'' Bell said.
``He gave the land that started the town. So in a way, he's the
founder of their town.''
</P>
<P>
   The marker was submitted to the state last spring and finally
approved in August. One of the members of the review board wrote
that the story was ``heartwarming.''
</P>
<P>
   Historical markers don't just mark significant places, Bell
said, they also indicate things of human importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the reasons he should have a marker is to tell
those human stories,'' she said. ``This will tell people there was
that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Slavery was a way of life, Bonner said. ``It wasn't always as
bad as people thought,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By adding to history, the descendants of slaves show that their
ancestors were more than just victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``To add to history is a great thing,'' Bonner said. ``We're
doing our part.''
</P>
<P>
   Because she was unable to find where Holland is buried, the
marker, which should arrive next year, will be placed in the front
yard of one of Holland Quarters' most respected elders -- Annie Lou
Rayson-Lister. Lister taught school in Holland Quarters for 32
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the oldest living teacher that had taught at Holland
Quarters,'' Lister said from her daughter's home in Dallas. ``I was
reared in Holland Quarters, and I taught everybody in Holland
Quarters, just about. Mothers, grandmothers and
great-grandmothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lister said the fact that the marker was to honor a former
slavemaster does not concern her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it doesn't bother me,'' Lister said. ``It's perfectly all
right with me. ``I've always heard about the slaves that he had,''
Lister said. ``When slavery was abolished, he got up and left and
gave that land to the slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've ever heard was that he was good to his slaves,''
Lister said.
</P>
<P>
   In doing the work, Bonner said she believed she was contributing
to a legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like reliving the lives of my great-great-grandparents
and wishing it didn't have to be this way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they're watching and saying, 'You're doing a good
thing.' ``

   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Defying political correctness, descendants of
Panola County, Texas, slaves are dedicating a historical marker to
the slavemaster who brought their families here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird that black people would want to do a marker on a
slavemaster,'' admitted Barbara Jefferson-Bonner, a Panola County
historian specializing in black history. ``Slavemasters are
supposed to be mean and cruel, but he wasn't that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The marker will be dedicated for Spearman ``Major'' Holland, who
brought Bonner's family here as slaves in the 1840s.
</P>
<P>
   Holland Quarters, a predominantly African-American community, is
four miles north of Carthage in Panola County. A former plantation,
the community has been home to generations descended from Holland's
slaves. Panola County is 35 miles southeast of Longview, on the
Louisiana border
</P>
<P>
   According to intensive research by Bonner, Holland was known for
his generosity toward his slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great guy. He cared for his slaves in a unique kind
of way,'' she said. ``When Spearman left here, he left his
thousands of acres to his slaves, who were ancestors of mine.''

UNIONS TEAMED UP ON WILSON TO DEFEAT GOP HOPES IN CALIFORNIA

<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ For some California voters, last week's
election was about repudiating a Republican who wasn't on the
ballot: Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Although he walked a pragmatic path during his eight years as
governor and will leave office with the vast majority of voters
feeling good about the state, Wilson energized some wealthy and
well-organized giants _ trade unions, Indian tribes and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting Wilson as much as the Republican candidate for
governor, Dan Lungren, unions spent more than $33 million to help
elect Lt. Gov. Gray Davis to succeed Wilson, who was barred by law
from running for a third term. The unions set up hundreds of phone
banks, dragged people to the polls, mailed literature to millions
of voters and walked precincts.
</P>
<P>
   The spillover, analysts believe, helped Davis and other
Democrats sweep the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a happy night for Latinos, for union members ... and
pretty much everyone Wilson has managed to anger in the past four
years,'' Gary Segura, assistant professor at Claremont Graduate
University, said of Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat for California Republicans may put a dent in Wilson's
ambition to become his party's nominee for president in 2000.
Another potential Republican candidate for the presidency, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, won by a landslide Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, the nominal head of the Republican Party in California,
was rarely seen campaigning for Lungren. Instead, he spent the
second-to-last week of the campaign traveling in other states to
help other GOP candidates _ and boost his own national stature.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked how much responsibility Wilson should take for
the GOP debacle in California on Tuesday, gubernatorial spokesman
Sean Walsh said: ``Virtually none.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's efforts to restrict political activities by labor
unions and end affirmative action had nothing to do with the
impressive Democratic showing, Wilson administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said trade and teachers unions already were energized by
the Davis campaign. He said the unions, which contributed $7
million to the Davis campaign, smelled a victory after Lungren
faired poorly in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the Lungren campaign, Wilson's people say, had
more to do with the attorney general's inability to reach moderate
and women voters. In addition, Walsh said, the polls showed that 70
percent of Californians believed the state was headed in the right
direction after eight years under Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're leaving office, that is a phenomenal record'' to
leave for Lungren, said Walsh, noting that Davis frequently aligned
himself during the campaign with Wilson as a way to demonize
Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had two favorite targets while governor: the
rank-and-file trade and state employees' unions, and the California
Teachers' Association. Those groups worked overtime to defeat
Republicans and help elect Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever union members in May and June phoned potential voters
in the primary election, they had two messages: Defeat Proposition
226, the ballot initiative that would have restricted political
lobbying activities by unions; and vote for Davis. That same
momentum carried into November, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But no single issue rallied workers more than Wilson's decision
to change the state's overtime rules, union officials said. Under
the old regulations, which had been in place for 125 years, workers
qualified for overtime after working 8 hours in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Industrial Welfare Commission, acting at Wilson's
behest, changed the regulations so that overtime could be paid only
after working 40 hours in a week. One estimate showed that
California workers lost $1 billion in wages because of the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a move toward more nonpartisanship, and in fact
some percentage of our membership votes Republican,'' said Art
Pulaski, executive secretary of the California Labor Federation.
``But even among those who vote Republican, Wilson has managed to
alienate them.''
</P>
<P>

</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 290,000-member California Teachers' Association, a longtime
Wilson opponent, spent at least $6 million fighting Wilson's
Proposition 8, which would have required teacher competency tests
and created school councils to influence curriculum. They outspent
Wilson 7-1, and the measure was readily defeated.
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence anti-Wilson sentiment ran beyond just unions.
</P>
<P>
   California tribes paid for 6 million pieces of anti-Wilson
campaign mailers that helped motivate Hispanics to vote for
Proposition 5, which allows Las Vegas-style gambling on Indian
lands.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans made some gains among Hispanics this year,
the party still hurts from the dramatic drop in Hispanic and
minority voting because of Wilson's support of Proposition 187,
which cut off services to illegal immigrants, and Proposition 209,
which banned affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Where Republicans could count on 40 percent of the Hispanic vote
before Wilson backed Proposition 187 in 1994, exit polls show
Republicans got only about 18 percent this election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, Wilson's politics on immigration, Latinos, and
ethnic issues in general were the political equivalent of running
up a big credit-card debt to have a party, with no thought to what
happens when the bill comes due,'' said Jim Shultz, executive
director of the Democracy Center, a nonpartisan public policy
institute in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson became the favorite figure of scorn this election in
millions of pieces of Democratic mail to Hispanics and union
workers. Democrats printed 2,000 ``Adios! Pete Wilson!'' bumper
stickers. Davis' Spanish-language television commercials were about
Wilson, without saying his first name or that he was governor.

   Whenever union members in May and June phoned potential voters
in the primary election, they had two messages: Defeat Proposition
226, the ballot initiative that would have restricted political
lobbying activities by unions; and vote for Davis. That same
momentum carried into November, union officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But no single issue rallied workers more than Wilson's decision
to change the state's overtime rules, union officials said. Under
the old regulations, which had been in place for 125 years, workers
qualified for overtime after working 8 hours in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Industrial Welfare Commission, acting at Wilson's
behest, changed the regulations so that overtime could be paid only
after working 40 hours in a week. One estimate showed that
California workers lost $1 billion in wages because of the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a move toward more nonpartisanship, and in fact
some percentage of our membership votes Republican,'' said Art
Pulaski, executive secretary of the California Labor Federation.
``But even among those who vote Republican, Wilson has managed to
alienate them.''

<P>
   The 290,000-member California Teachers' Association, a longtime
Wilson opponent, spent at least $6 million fighting Wilson's
Proposition 8, which would have required teacher competency tests
and created school councils to influence curriculum. They outspent
Wilson 7-1, and the measure was readily defeated.
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence anti-Wilson sentiment ran beyond just unions.
</P>
<P>
   California tribes paid for 6 million pieces of anti-Wilson
campaign mailers that helped motivate Hispanics to vote for
Proposition 5, which allows Las Vegas-style gambling on Indian
lands.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans made some gains among Hispanics this year,
the party still hurts from the dramatic drop in Hispanic and
minority voting because of Wilson's support of Proposition 187,
which cut off services to illegal immigrants, and Proposition 209,
which banned affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Where Republicans could count on 40 percent of the Hispanic vote
before Wilson backed Proposition 187 in 1994, exit polls show
Republicans got only about 18 percent this election.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, Wilson's politics on immigration, Latinos, and
ethnic issues in general were the political equivalent of running
up a big credit-card debt to have a party, with no thought to what
happens when the bill comes due,'' said Jim Shultz, executive
director of the Democracy Center, a nonpartisan public policy
institute in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson became the favorite figure of scorn this election in
millions of pieces of Democratic mail to Hispanics and union
workers. Democrats printed 2,000 ``Adios! Pete Wilson!'' bumper
stickers. Davis' Spanish-language television commercials were about
Wilson, without saying his first name or that he was governor.

A TALE OF TWO LITTLE BOYS WHOSE LIVES DIVERGED YEARS AGO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY BINGHAM 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The picture sits on top of the china cabinet in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   It is a black-and-white picture, so you can't tell which of the
babies has brown eyes and which has blue. They look almost
identical.
</P>
<P>
   They look so much alike that their mother slicked up a wave of
hair on one of the boys' heads. All their lives, people looked at
them and assumed they were close. But I know differently. I know
what happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   I know those boys were never as close as they are in that
picture.
</P>
<P>
   I know, because one of them is me.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He asked me to stick around but I said I had to go.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I saw my brother, Barry, we talked on the back
porch of the house where we grew up, in the mountains of Virginia.
Barry sat in the corner of the porch, and I leaned against the
wall, under a window.
</P>
<P>
   We were little boys in matching pajamas when we stood tiptoe on
the other side of that window to see whether a blanket of snow had
covered the picnic table. We were inseparable then, lugging two of
everything wherever we went: two cap guns, two stick horses, two
bicycles we pretended were cars.
</P>
<P>
   We rode beside the river, where the pavement ended and you could
let go of the handlebars and coast, no hands, forever it seemed,
nothing behind you but a plume of dust.
</P>
<P>
   My brother was the quarterback, the Little League hitter, the
wrestler. He was the one who caught hepatitis after eating
tadpoles; the one who swallowed Granny's nitroglycerine pill; the
one who kicked over Mrs. Davis' jack-o'-lantern. I was the one who
watched. I was the one on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   When I was10, the doctor told my parents I cried at night
because I had something called Legg-Perthes disease. My hip bone
was crumbling. He said I couldn't keep up with my brother because
the bone was dying.
</P>
<P>
   I came home from the children's hospital in a metal brace that
ran down my legs like the letter A. For the next few years, a
distance grew between my brother and me as he ran ahead and I
hobbled behind. He left me standing in the outfield, ankle-high in
dandelions and weeds, waiting for a ball that never came.
</P>
<P>
   It took me years to forgive him for that.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't forgive him until after he died.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time we went to high school, the brace and the crutches
lay in the attic, gathering dust, but it was too late. We were
changed.
</P>
<P>
   My brother spent Friday nights under stadium lights or on a
wrestling mat. I spent mine in the bleachers or in the parking lot,
drinking beer.
</P>
<P>
   At our high-school graduation, we sat side by side, the
difference between us then as real as the space between our chairs.
I kept tapping my legs, anxious to leave. He sat still, content to
stay.
</P>
<P>
   The town we grew up in was so small that we told people we were
from another, but nobody had heard of it, either. Our dad was a
third-generation coal miner who lost his father to black lung
disease and his grandfather to a mine collapse. He gave 35 years of
his life to a dark hole inside a mountain so we wouldn't be like
him. But Barry didn't want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   He was the one who dated the same girl for three years; the one
who blew off college recruitment day; the one who wanted to spend
the rest of his life in a coal-mining town in the mountains of
Virginia. I was the one who wanted out.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My brother was a big shot in high school, a state champion
wrestler, a senior on the homecoming court, but two hours from
home, at the biggest university in Virginia, he was just another
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   I knew something was wrong when I found him in the dorm room we
shared with the door locked, the blinds closed. He lay on the
bottom bunk, his back toward the door. It was the middle of the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get it,'' he told me. ``You don't know what it's
like to be so depressed you don't have the energy to roll over.''
</P>
<P>
   He left 110 Lee Hall at the end of his freshman year and moved
back in with Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed. If people made fun of my hillbilly accent, I lost it.
If people never heard of my hometown, I never mentioned it again. I
was ashamed of the mountains and the mines; I wanted to be like the
kids who grew up in Baltimore and D.C., who smoked and drank and
knew the Metro line schedule.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't find time to make it home for summer breaks.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mom passed him on the highway while she was running errands. She
knew he was supposed to be in class at the community college so she
turned around, suspicious. He'd already taken the pills by the time
she got home.
</P>
<P>
   Barry wrote each of us a note. He said he loved us, that he was
sorry and that we weren't to blame. Then he swallowed 64
anti-depressants.
</P>
<P>
   The next time, a note lay on the bed in the middle room.
</P>
<P>
   It led Dad to the road by the river, where we rode our bikes and
fished for redeyes and shot pop cans off tree stumps. It was just
getting dark when Dad found him in the woods, by the river, with a
shotgun. Dad talked him into coming home.
</P>
<P>
   They were asleep the third time, when Barry knocked on their
bedroom door, crying and holding up a bloody wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Mom found him in the garage on his fourth try, lying on the
cement floor with his head beneath the exhaust pipe. The engine was
running.
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist diagnosed Barry as ``schizoaffective,'' lost
somewhere between schizophrenia and depression. He said Barry was
born with a chemical imbalance, and his brain didn't make enough of
the chemical seratonin.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I visited him in the mental hospital where he spent weeks
and sometimes months. On a Sunday afternoon, while we walked around
the parking lot, Barry made jokes about his escape.
</P>
<P>
   He twirled a finger beside his head when telling me about some
of the other patients. He talked about an old man who was committed
for buying four cars in one day. The psychiatrists put the man on
so much medication that his mania was reduced to baby steps. Barry
called it The Thorazine Shuffle. He did a mean imitation.
</P>
<P>
   My brother could be a funny guy.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The house was full of people by the time I got there. I flew to
Virginia and met my baby sister at the airport. Her husband drove
us back through the mountains to the house where we grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Lights were on in every room. People stood outside in the
shadows, and more people were inside. Mom and Dad were in the
living room. Mom was on the couch, Dad on the floor at her feet,
holding her hands.
</P>
<P>
   They met on a blind date, in a bowling alley. She quit her job
at the Ben Franklin Five &AMP; Dime after they got married. He got a
job in the coal mines.
</P>
<P>
   They moved into a rented trailer until they saved up enough
money to buy a trailer of their own. They married in January and
had a family by the end of the year. The twins came early, on
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Brown-eyed Barry came first. Blue-eyed me came 15 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   The house where we grew up is full of our pictures, even now. It
seems there are pictures of us in every room.
</P>
<P>
   When people came for the funeral, they looked at the images _ on
the wall and on the TV and on the china cabinet. In awkward
moments, they asked whether I knew the moment when Barry died.
``Don't twins feel something?''
</P>
<P>
   I told them I knew when Dad called me on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Barry was getting over a bad cold, but he still wanted to go on
a trip the county mental health department planned for the next
day. He took a friend's pain pills to sleep better.
</P>
<P>
   The pain pills and his anti-depressants were toxic together.
They slowed down his heart, filled his lungs and caused his entire
body to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   He was living alone and seemed to be getting his life together.
All he wanted was a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He never woke up.
</P>
<P>
   _ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My brother Barry died on Sept. 24, 1993. He was 27 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He is buried on a hillside, under an acorn tree so tall it
reaches over a goldfish pond at the base of the hill. Dad taught us
to drive in this cemetery when we were 15.
</P>
<P>
   This is what I think about, sitting on the bench beside his
grave.
</P>
<P>
   I think about the paisley tie I picked out to bury him in and
the salesclerk who felt so sorry for me that she didn't know what
to say so she cried, too.
</P>
<P>
   I think about how we started out as twins but ended up more like
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   I think of how I spent the first half of my life wanting to be
like him and how he spent the last half of his life wanting to be
like me.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's too bad we grew apart. I think maybe there was
nothing we could do about that.

   MITCH-REFUGEES (Tololar, Nicaragua) _ Stumbling across the
hardening moonscape of mud that was once her village, Maria Elva
Bran let out a subdued but satisfied yelp as she spotted a bit of
good fortune. She leaned toward the earth that had become a grave
for thousands of her neighbors and pried loose a small ear of corn.
``What luck,'' Bran said. Such mercies sustain millions of people
whose lives were sundered by the storm known as Mitch. By DUDLEY
ALTHAUS.

<P>
   MITCH-HONDURAS (Tegucigalpa, Honduras) _ By erasing entire
communities from the map, Hurricane Mitch literally changed the
face of Honduras. In a land where life was already calamitous for
thousands of poor families, Mitch came as an end-of-the-millennium
apocalypse, a disaster that hit just as the country was struggling
to its feet. By JOHN OTIS. (Already filed).
</P>
<P>
   MITCH-NICARAGUA (Managua, Nicaragua) _ When President Arnoldo
Aleman went on television to donate his own money to hurricane
victims, he pointedly handed over the check with his right hand.
``I don't do anything with the left,'' he joked, referring to his
stance against the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front,
which was voted out of office in 1990 after years of civil war. By
DUDLEY ALTHAUS. (Already filed.)

   OMBUDSMEN-HELP (Undated) _ They are like corporate den mothers
with a soothing presence, big shoulders to cry on and a box of
tissues at the ready. Their offices are discreet and located far
from the offices of power. Most importantly, perhaps, they are
independent operators. They are company ombudsmen, and they are
there to help. By L.M. SIXEL. (Already filed.)

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ Trying to figure how to get out of
an impeachment process the voters don't want, House Republicans are
discovering an old military truism _ it is easier to start a war
than end one. Even so, Democrats have suffered a blow with the loss
of their most useful bogeyman, Newt Gingrich. By MARIANNE MEANS.

   SWISS-JEWS (Paris) _ The recently settled controversy over how
much Swiss banks owe to the relatives of Jewish depositors later
killed by the Nazis has unleashed a strong wave of anti-Semitism in
Switzerland, according to a new government report. Among the most
interesting points is the admission that anti-Jewish sentiment
among the Swiss was already widespread before the dispute erupted.

WAR HERO BATTLES AILMENTS BUT REMAINS DEVOTED TO DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Vietnam War veteran Roy Benavidez paused while
talking of his storied past and thought about the future. He
squeezed his right eye shut and grimaced.
</P>
<P>
   A long, high-pitched moan pierced the silence of his hospital
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God!'' Benavidez cried. ``Where are they (the nurses)
at?''
</P>
<P>
   The stump that used to be his right leg was the obvious source
of his pain, and the blood that pooled at the base of a heavy
plaster cast was a reminder of his grim reality.
</P>
<P>
   At 63, Benavidez's memory is fuzzy. The strength that sent the
retired master sergeant to the Army's Special Forces and later
carried him to a miraculous recovery after stepping on a land mine
in Vietnam is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Brooke Army Medical Center here amputated his leg
last month as diabetes threatened to trigger a fatal infection.
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez spent the days before Veterans Day in a San Antonio
hospital battling diabetes, anemia and a host of other illnesses _
all of which remind him of the day 30 years ago when a swarm of
North Vietnamese troops left him with more than three dozen scars.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Americans will gather Wednesday for
ceremonies nationwide honoring the more than 1 million veterans who
have died in battle since the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   A Green Beret and longtime resident of El Campo, Texas,
Benavidez received the Medal of Honor from President Ronald Reagan
in 1981 for saving eight fellow Special Forces troops.
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez recalled the battle in dreamlike fragments. He can't
say how many times he was clubbed, shot or stabbed. But he defied
the enemy and the odds, determined to rescue his comrades and then
recover classified documents from the body of a dead team leader.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is fighting again.
</P>
<P>
   Without detailing his illnesses, nurse Lainey Klingemann said
Benavidez was battling back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got medical problems that are very involved and each
complicate each other,'' said Klingemann, a nurse at Northeast
Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, where Benavidez began therapy
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They almost feed on each other to challenge his quality of
life,'' she said. ``It's a dynamic effect because they are all
interacting with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain from surgery is but one problem. He still can feel his feet
and toes in the leg he lost, a sensation known as phantom pain.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists also must help him regain lost upper-body strength.
During an interview, two people lifted Benavidez on several
occasions so he could shift in a wheelchair and be more
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his failing health, Benavidez wants to sell his book,
``Medal of Honor: A Vietnam Warrior's Story.'' He hopes to inspire
children and see Hollywood filmmakers recount his experience, much
as they did with World War II hero Audie Murphy in the 1955 movie
``To Hell and Back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood never has done a movie about a Hispanic war hero, and
youths need role models, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud to be an American,'' Benavidez said. ``I'm proud to
serve my country, serve it well. I'm proud of being rewarded for a
job well done, and for my country to give me the benefit and
opportunity to advance in my career.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Born Aug. 5, 1935, in the tiny South Texas community of
Lindenau, Raul Perez Benavidez was a sharecropper's son who barely
knew his parents. Salvador and Teresa Benavidez died a year apart,
leaving him and a younger brother, Rogelio, to live with an uncle,
Nicholas Benavidez.
</P>
<P>
   His family worked from dawn to dusk as migrant farm workers who
toiled in sugar beet and cotton fields from West Texas to Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Though he went go to school for a few months, Benavidez said he
spent more time at harvests than in the classroom and only finished
the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by racial discrimination, Benavidez vowed to master
English and find a way to get ahead. He found it in the Army, where
he earned his high school diploma, saw some of the world and earned
promotions.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his assignment to airborne school in 1958 that ``woke
me up'' and fueled a new ambition to ``become a soldier and be the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Benavidez said: ``I was just picking up a
paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez adopted the motto, ``duty, honor, country,'' and began
living it.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 2, 1968, three months into his second tour
of the Vietnam War, he made history.
</P>
<P>
   A North Vietnamese regiment surrounded a dozen soldiers from his
unit during a secret mission in Cambodia. Three helicopters trying
to save the men came under heavy fire and were unable to land.
</P>
<P>
   When he became aware of the situation, Benavidez thought of
three friends trapped in the fire zone and bulled his way onto a
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got on that 'copter, little did I know we were going to
spend six hours in hell,'' Benavidez said.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after jumping off his helicopter in a clearing, he
suffered wounds to the right leg, face and head while charging
through heavy enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez repositioned team members so they could give cover
fire for the helicopters. He then carried half the wounded troops
to nearby aircraft. But his battle had only begun.
</P>
<P>
   Benavidez recovered classified documents from a dead team leader
and then guided wounded troops from a downed aircraft and set up a
defense line.
</P>
<P>
   As the enemy gained strength, he called in airstrikes, directed
fire from helicopter gunships and provided first aid to a wounded
soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Bleeding from new gunshot wounds to the thigh and abdomen, and
hit in the back by grenade fragments, Benavidez was clubbed in the
head while leading a second extraction.
</P>
<P>
   In hand-to-hand fighting that ensued, he suffered wounds to his
head and arms before killing his adversary. He later cut down two
more enemy soldiers as they rushed toward a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Then Benavidez made one last trip. He looked for classified
documents and carried more wounded to a waiting helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many times I was stabbed,'' he said. ``All I
had was wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the fighting, Benavidez, a devout Catholic, made the
sign of the cross so often his arms ``were going like an airplane
prop.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite new wounds, the ailing Benavidez still hears the call of
duty. He wants to continue inspiring children to stay off drugs and
get an education, a mission he would gladly undertake.
</P>
<P>
   Failure isn't an option, he said. ``Quitters never win and
winners never quit.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hopeful of finding clues to a better understanding of obesity
and other disorders, scientists have long been interested in why
people start and stop eating.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, researchers have assumed the answers have to
do with physiology: caloric content, taste, and the functioning of
brain centers involved in hunger and satiety.
</P>
<P>
   A new study, however, suggests that cultural context _ in
particular the memory of when a person last ate and how much was
consumed _ plays an equally important role.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Rozin, a psychologist at the University of
Pennsylvania, and his colleagues studied meal regulation in two
patients with amnesia so severe they had virtually no memory of
events occurring even two minutes before.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, men whose long-term memory centers in the brain
had been damaged by illness, could not remember whether they had
just eaten a meal. When the researchers offered them a second
lunch, 10 to 30 minutes after they had eaten a first, the patients
consumed the additional food happily.
</P>
<P>
   Both patients also began to eat a third meal, presented 10 to 30
minutes after the second was finished. One of the men, called R.H.
by the researchers, ate much of the third lunch and, 20 minutes
later, announced that he planned to ``go for a walk and get a good
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when two control subjects were offered lunch a
second time, Rozin said, they replied, in effect, ``What are you,
crazy? I just ate.''
</P>
<P>
   The control subjects indicated on a rating scale that they were
less hungry after eating. But R.H.'s hunger ratings dropped only
slightly after a meal, and by the next meal had returned to their
original levels.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the study, Rozin said, indicate that ``a lot of
things that control what and how much people eat have nothing to do
with the state of nutrition.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As they try to figure out how to punt gracefully in
an impeachment process the voters don't want, House Republicans are
discovering an old military truism: It is easier to start a war
than to end one.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP election debacle stripped the congressional debate over
whether to impeach President Clinton for lying under oath about
adultery of its major constitutional pretensions, exposing it for
the purely political exercise it has always been.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee is going through the motions of
examining the differing ways of defining impeachable offenses. But
the Constitution is vague and the experts who are testifying
contradict one another. In any case, they will have less influence
on the outcome of the hearings than the election has already had.
</P>
<P>
   GOP enthusiasm for bringing down a popular president in defiance
of public opinion essentially evaporated when the much-anticipated
Republican gains never materialized. Although many partisans are
stuck with their previous pious positions, some have been
sufficiently evasive to claim they are only now making up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   No consensus for an alternative Clinton penalty has yet emerged,
although a toothless censure is often mentioned. But what once
seemed a sure committee impeachment vote now is anybody's guess,
and a full bipartisan House recommendation that the Senate try
Clinton is quite unlikely. There is, in any case, not a prayer that
a Senate trial would muster the required two-thirds majority to
impeach.
</P>
<P>
   With House Speaker Newt Gingrich's abrupt departure, Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde is expected to run his hearings in
orderly fashion when Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr appears next
week. Hyde is now free to protect his own reputation as a judicious
fellow without being pressured by Gingrich, who had been directing
the scenario backstage.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's least radical Republicans are also free to do
their own thing, rather than Gingrich's thing. And Democrats who
once might have caved can discover newly stiffened spines.
</P>
<P>
   What Starr says could potentially tip the committee against
Clinton, but that too seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The two most singularly unpopular public figures in America are
Gingrich and Starr, both of whom had recent approval ratings below
20 percent, mostly because of voter distaste for their pursuit of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek reports in all seriousness that Starr is frantically
trying to come up with fresh sinful behavior to shock the nation _
lies to conceal a lipstick-stained towel in the Oval Office, for
instance, or another charge against picked-upon Webster Hubbell,
the former associate attorney general who stubbornly persists in
refusing to sell out Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Starr will need more than such pettifoggery to convince us
at this late date that he has impeachable goods on Clinton not
previously disclosed. He had his primary shot with his official
report. If he has more hot stuff, why didn't he include it?
Whatever happened to Whitewater, the travel office firings and the
oddness about the FBI files? If Starr knows something awful, why
didn't he say so before?
</P>
<P>
   There are also all those questions about Starr's own conduct,
from improper grand jury leaks to a mysterious failure to fully
inform Attorney General Janet Reno about his contacts with
right-wing Clinton enemies and Paula Jones' defense team. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La, the conservative pragmatist who is
slated to replace Gingrich as speaker, virtually made it official
that Clinton will get at least partially off the hook. Livingston
acknowledged that Congress is influenced by public opinion when it
thinks about whether to impeach a president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have certainly indicated in the polls that
they don't see it (lying about sex) as an impeachable or
dismissible offense, and that would have to be considered in the
political arena,'' Livingston said in a television interview. With
the GOP vote that will seal his new power still some days away, he
tactfully hedged his comments in order not to appear soft on the
president, adding that Clinton must answer to the voters somehow.
</P>
<P>
   But Livingston is not an ``impeach now, impeach forever''
fruitcake like Gingrich and Georgia Rep. Bob Barr. Gingrich had to
go because he kept stoking the fires under the president beyond a
point the voters thought reasonable. Such a relentless assault had
worked to bring down Democratic Speaker Jim Wright, but Clinton
proved a tougher bird than Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the impeachment issue is out of the way can there be
true bipartisan cooperation in Congress. Livingston knows this, and
is willing to go along. Hooray.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who felt Clinton should resign because there seemed
no other civilized way to avoid two years of constant bickering may
now reconsider our position. The voters have provided the prod. It
is up to Congress to respond sensibly, or go the way of Gingrich in
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Censure the bum in the White House, shift the dialogue to real
national issues and get on with the business of governing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the history of women's bodybuilding is written, 1998 will
emerge as the year that the weights tipped in favor of the sport's
old nemesis, femininity.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since women began publicly showing off their
muscles in earnest, this issue _ whether the muscles that make the
man also make the woman manly _ has hewn the sport more than any
other.
</P>
<P>
   What has happened this year might have seemed, to some,
inevitable: Fitness competition, a slenderized version of women's
bodybuilding, has eclipsed the bulked-up muscle shows in
participant and audience popularity.
</P>
<P>
   What has surprised many in the field of strength and fitness,
however, is the swiftness with which women's fitness competitions
have swept the world. In the four years since the National Physique
Committee's first National Bodybuilding and Fitness Championships,
registration for the women's fitness competition has tripled.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's nationals, to be held on Nov. 20 and 21 in
Atlanta, fitness competitors will outnumber their bodybuilding
sisters. By the end of the year the committee will have overseen
600 regional bodybuilding and fitness competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Other groups also hold fitness events. Fitness America hosts
nearly 50 regional events each year, including ther 21 Fitness
America Pageant, to be held Nov. 21 in Redondo Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That contest, as well as its preliminary round, will be
televised on ESPN2, which now shows coast-to-coast fitness workouts
every weekday from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m., frequently followed by
reruns of the previous years' fitness contests. Ms. Fitness runs
two events, licenses its name to many others and publishes a
magazine for competitors.
</P>
<P>
   This new version of women's bodybuilding is not news to
everyone. Readers of fitness and muscle magazines knew things were
changing by 1994, when women's fitness competitors had all but
replaced traditional women bodybuilders as models on the magazines'
pages.
</P>
<P>
   And with that visibility came the controversy. Ridiculed by
feminists, held in disdain by many women in power lifting,
bodybuilding and strength training circles, the new women's fitness
events have many detractors. As has always been the case with
women's strength and the sports that display it, the criticism
centers on how things look.
</P>
<P>
   With fitness, the criticism is directed at its portrayal in
magazines that feature champions laid out in lingerie and publish
special swimsuit editions.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Manion, president of the National Physique Committee, takes
a Darwinian view of the evolution of the women's bodybuilding
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the two sports is right there in the
name,'' he said. ``Body builders build their bodies. In fitness we
are looking for fit, toned bodies with good muscle shape, but not a
lot of size.''
</P>
<P>
   Like traditional bodybuilding, fitness competitions require the
athletes to pose in stances chosen to accent particular groups of
muscles. While body builders pose barefoot, fitness competitors do
so in heels, in two of three required competitive rounds. In the
first, they wear a two-piece bathing suit. In the third, it's a
one-piece suit.
</P>
<P>
   But, heels (and big hair) aside, what distinguishes fitness
competitions is round two, in which the athletes are required to
perform a three-minute choreographed routine. It is a something of
a breathtaking combination of aerobics, dancing and tumbling
designed to show strength, flexibility and agility.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for fitness competitions shares many of the
characteristics of training for competitive bodybuilding, including
weight training, diet restrictions to reduce fat and increase lean
muscle mass, aerobic exercise and posing. But the notion of a dance
segment, to be sure, seems more Miss America than Ms. Olympia, far
from the Arnold Schwarzenegger days of the sport of bodybuilding.
</P>
<P>
   It was the emergence of Schwarzenegger in the 1970s that
catapulted men's bodybuilding to a mass market.
</P>
<P>
   Women who were attracted to the sport late in that decade were
competitive athletes who were able and willing to make their
physiques look like dancers'. One was Lisa Lyon, a UCLA graduate
who had studied kendo, a Japanese martial art, and who had been
encouraged by Schwarzenegger to become a bodybuilder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 she won the first World Women's Bodybuilding
Championship and became the sport's only media star, as well as its
unofficial spokesperson _ a role that led to a Playboy photo
spread. But by 1980 she had stopped competing. She was too small.
</P>
<P>
   That year, at the International Federation of Bodybuilders'
first Miss Olympia (now Ms. Olympia), the easy winner was Rachel
McLish, whose soap-opera-star looks were a perfect match for her
long-waisted, rippled, hard body.
</P>
<P>
   For a time it seemed Ms. McLish was the epitome of the sport. In
1983 she again placed first in the Ms. Olympia competition, but was
disqualified over a controversy involving padding in her swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   This was just one of the controversies the judges handled that
year. The other involved Bev Francis, a former shot-putter and
javelin and discus thrower from Australia who held six individual
world power-lifting records. Her 24-inch thighs, planed chest and
quilted abdomen rocked the world of women's bodybuilding and, some
say, changed it forever.
</P>
<P>
   That world was, of course, a small one. While the standard set
by Ms. Francis made other competitors strive to reach that muscular
mark, the evolution of the sport to emphasize a bigger female
physique went unseen by the general sports consumer.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1990s, television brought the Ms. Olympia
competition to a public outside the close-knit world of
bodybuilding.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The calls and letters to the of fans reported an overall
disgust at the women, their size and even their sport,'' said Maria
Lowe, author of the book ``Women of Steel: Female Bodybuilders and
the Struggle for Self-Definition'' (New York University Press,
1998). ``In the early 80s, the women bodybuilders looked good and
women wanted to look like them and men wanted to look at them. But
when the women got big, that was not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   This just added to the already perplexing reality of a sport in
which there are no sanctioned rules about size. For instance, a
24-inch thigh is not of more competitive value than a 20-inch
thigh, but a woman who is ``too big'' is penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Added to that are other troubling aspects of traditional
competitive bodybuilding: drugs and nutritional supplements that
hold out the promise of bigger bodies; the increasing appearance of
breast implants to match the increased size of muscles (while
muscle implants are banned for all bodybuilders, breast implants
are not), and the radical pre-posing diet designed to make
competitors look highly defined, or ``cut,'' which many athletes
consider antithetical to a healthy regimen.
</P>
<P>
   So it is not surprising that by the 90s, the posing stage was
set for something new to step in. Or that what stepped in was
wearing heels.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is that this women's sport, so long in the
shadows of the men, has given birth to a fast-growing male
counterpart. This month, after only a few years in existence, some
male fitness competitions are expected to attract more participants
than traditional bodybuilding competitions.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that traditional bodybuilding is
disappearing. If all goes as scheduled, bodybuilding will be, at
the very least, a demonstration sport for men and women in the
Australia Olympics in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the sport are yielding to the new direction,
including Carla Dunlap-Kaan, one of the premiere bodybuilders of
the 80s, who now helps train fitness competitors and judges Ms.
Fitness contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fitness competitions are the future,'' said Manion of the
National Physique Committee. ``It is something that almost
everybody can relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   And lest anyone think that fitness competition is ``
bodybuilding lite,'' ask a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Curry, 26, lives at the gym. After graduating from the
University of North Carolina, where she competed as a gymnast, she
needed another outlet for her athletic drive. She found it in
fitness competition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Curry works out five hours a day at the gym she co-owns in
Bremen, Ga. In March of this year she placed first in the
International Federation of Bodybuilders Fitness International, the
Arnold Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fitness is healthier,'' said Ms. Curry, who averages about two
competitions a year. ``Bodybuilders cannot maintain their
competitive sizes all year round and have to really strain before
every competition to get into that shape for one day. With fitness,
you are fit all year round.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The women who compete in the Ms. Olympia are incredibly fit by
all standards,'' said Dr. Jan Todd, a professor of kinesiology at
the University of Texas in Austin and a former national champion in
weight lifting and power lifting. ``But on the day of competition,
they are probably not the healthiest people. They are dehydrated,
have deprived themselves of food for considerable lengths of time.
But the very nature of the aerobic competition insists that they
not be all drawn down,'' she said. '`So they might have a healthier
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   But there remains that controversial edge, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pornography,'' said Leslie Heywood, champion power
lifter, professor of English and author of the books ``Pretty Good
for a Girl'' (Free Press, 1998) and ``Bodymakers: A Cultural
Anatomy of Women's Body Building'' (Rutgers University Press,
1998). ``In 1994, all the bodybuilding magazines started having all
these spreads featuring fitness models in stock pornography poses,
wearing lingerie, and featured a swimsuit issue. It's depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The hair, the heels, sure, it sells,'' Ms. Curry argued, ``but
if you want to see what the sport is all about, come and watch us
work out. We are athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Todd, who at the height of her power-lifting career could
dead-lift 394 pounds, takes a more measured view of fitness
competition. ``There is no question that its portrayal is partly a
commercial decision,'' she said. ``But women bodybuilders may have
reached a point in the development of their physiques that may not
sell in Iowa in the grocery store. They may have painted themselves
into a corner that fewer women are willing to enter.''

   McMURDO STATION, ANTARCTICA _ Twenty years ago, when Julia
Uberuaga first began working in Antarctica, she was one of only a
few women among hundreds of men. They stared at her, or leered at
her, or otherwise let her know she was unwelcome on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried myself to sleep more than one night,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Mathews, a microbiologist then at Hunter College, remembers
being ``pretty well beset by men'' when she did research at McMurdo
for a few seasons in the late 70s and early 80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a nuisance,'' she said. ``They were all over the
place. There were some that would never stop going after you.''
True to her biologist's calling, Dr. Mathews devised a taxonomy for
the Antarctic male: there were the predators, who lurked at every
turn, the scavengers, who usually were considerate enough to wait
for a signal before pouncing; and herbivores, who apparently wanted
nothing to do with women.
</P>
<P>
   The women's usual response, Dr. Mathews said, was to link up
with one man. He would keep the others away.
</P>
<P>
   Life is far different now in Mactown, as its inhabitants call
McMurdo Station, the main American base in Antarctica. As 1,000 or
more scientists and support staff return to ``the Ice'' for another
season of work in the austral summer, about a third of them are
women.
</P>
<P>
   Like the men, they are drawn by the wild beauty of the
landscape, the idea of living at one of Earth's last frontiers and
the chance to contribute to scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, they are bringing profound change to one of the
most unusual outposts of American society. And they have made
McMurdo a kind of laboratory for watching what happens when an
all-male group is gradually infiltrated by the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   When it was established by the Navy in 1956, McMurdo had all the
charm of a frontier mining camp. Buildings were a hodgepodge of
strictly utilitarian Quonset huts and sheds, painted in the
military palette of gray or green and plunked down, seemingly at
random, on volcanic soil devoid of even a blade of grass. Social
life centered around alcohol, lots of it, and the first few women
to visit were protected by military guards.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it looks much the same. But there are women in offices
and research labs, driving trucks, managing remote field sites and
even, like Ms. Uberuaga, operating heavy earth-moving equipment.
And they seem to be accepted, confident and at ease.
</P>
<P>
   To researchers like Charles Moskos, a professor of sociology at
Northwestern University who has studied military organizations, the
change is a matter of numbers. As more and more women join an
organization, he said, there is a ``tipping point'' when its
atmosphere changes.
</P>
<P>
   In the military, he said, the point is somewhere between 15
percent and 20 percent of the group. Then, he said, ``women are no
longer regarded as abberant people who have to be treated with kid
gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, many of the issues involving women in remote
outposts relate to sex, and not just to sexual relations. For
example, Moskos said, when there are only a few women around, men
may feel free to make off-color jokes, and the women may feel
pressure to laugh at them.
</P>
<P>
   Or, he went on, ``if there are only a few women, trying to
maintain modesty looks like extraordinary perks given to them.''
All that starts to change at the tipping point, he said. ``A more
civil culture develops.'' The women begin to censor their own
behavior, and men keep other men in line.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he and other social psychologists say, the presence of
women seems to encourage men to behave better toward each other.
Past the tipping point, for example, men get into far fewer fights.
</P>
<P>
   This change is good, because ``aggression is one of the major
things you can't tolerate'' in the isolation of Antarctica, said
John Nicoletti of Lakewood, Colo., a psychologist who headed the
team evaluating the men and women who spent this winter (summer in
the Northern Hemisphere) on the ice. ``The presence of women adds
normality,'' he went on. ``It's less like a wilderness experience.
It mimics regular society where there are rules and you have to
follow them.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in social code has probably been accelerated by the
change in McMurdo's mission since the end of the Cold War. Until
then, the base was primarily a military outpost where some
scientific work also went on. Today, it is a research establishment
run by the National Science Foundation and administered by a
private contractor, Antarctic Support Associates. Almost everyone
works as a scientist or in support of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   And social life no longer revolves around Navy liquor rations.
</P>
<P>
   Women were almost totally excluded from Antarctica until about
30 years ago. The first woman to set foot on the continent was
Caroline Mikkelsen, the wife of a Norwegian whaling captain, who
landed with him at the Vestfold Hills, on the Antarctica peninsula,
in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   The first women to winter on Antarctica were also accompanying
their husbands, on a private expedition in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, though, the nations that ran Antarctic programs
officially banned women, supposedly because the rigors of the
continent were too great for the women and the rigors of providing
separate bathroom facilities were too great for the program
administrators. It was widely acknowledged, however, that the real
reason was fear of sexual misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though other countries, notably Chile and the Soviet Union,
gradually allowed more and more women into their stations, the
United States' Antarctic programs were all-male until 1969, and it
was not until 1974 that American women wintered over at McMurdo,
two among 128 men.
</P>
<P>
   One was Mary Alice McWhinnie, the first woman to head scientific
operations there, and the other was her assistant, Sister Mary
Odile Cahoon, a teaching nun from St. Scholastica College in
Duluth, Minn. Barbara Land described their first winter in her
book, ``The New Explorers,'' (Dodd, Mead, 1981). ``Both the Navy
and the NSF were still a little uptight about having women at
McMurdo for the winter,'' Sister Odile told her. ``I am sure they
felt more comfortable having a couple of maiden aunts test the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The first women at the South Pole arrived in 1969, in a Navy
plane. So that none could grab credit for being the first woman at
Pole, the six left the plane together, walking down its rear cargo
ramp arm in arm. But women did not stay overnight at the polar base
until 1971 and it was not until 1979 that a woman wintered there.
</P>
<P>
   But it is only within the last few years that there have been
enough women at the United States' Antarctica stations to make a
big difference. When women first arrived on the Ice, the Navy Shore
Patrol was still making regular sweeps to rescue men who had fallen
down drunk, so they would not freeze to death in the McMurdo
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty rough place,'' said Rebecca Johnson, an author
who first visited Antarctica in 1991, as part of the NSF's Writers
and Artists program. ``There were three bars,'' she recalled,
``When I came back in '94 one of those that had been the
hardest-driving had been converted into a gym and what had been the
Officers' Club had been converted into the Coffee House.'' Today,
it is a popular after-work spot for wine, cheese, capuccino and
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the base store still stocks liberal supplies of
beer, wine and liquor, and plenty of people enjoy a cocktail or two
after work. But social life is not limited to drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are literally so many things to do you can't decide,''
said Amy Madden, who tended bar there until February. ``You can
work out in the gym, and there are aerobics, skiing, hiking, bingo,
karaoke, ceramics.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, she was knitting a cap, her first project in
Stitch-n-Bitch, an organization of about a dozen women (and two
men) that met regularly to do needlework. There are groups for
writers, musicians and even Bible study.
</P>
<P>
   As researchers, women have participated in or led studies of the
diet of the penguin, how fish keep from freezing, the life cycle of
microscopic worms and a host of other research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are women lab managers, more women involved in every
aspect,'' said Professor Diana H. Wall of Colorado State
University, where she directs the Natural Resource Ecology
Laboratory. Dr. Wall has been doing field work since 1989 on
microscopic worms that live in Antarctic soil.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere for women has definitely improved since then, she
said, primarily because there are more of them both at McMurdo and
in field camps. ``There is a comfort level,'' she said. ``You can
talk to them about things you would not necessarily want to talk
with men about. The women don't have to be so macho.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from research, women fill all kinds of support jobs at
McMurdo, South Pole and Palmer Station, the other main American
bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women seemed to break in first in supply,'' said Stanley P.
Wisneski, who runs McMurdo and several outlying installations for
Antarctic Support Associates this year, his 13th season on the Ice.
``From that point, once they did get here, maybe if they were
already a trades person they could move into those spots.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, there are women working as machinists, carpenters,
heavy equipment operators and ``fuelies,'' the people who drive the
big white ``fuel mule'' delivery trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Abbott, the manager of helicopter operations, began
working on the Ice, as people there call Antarctica, as a janitor
in the 1985-86 season. At that point, she said, ``there were 26
women and hundreds of men.''

<P>
   Mactown was a mess, with trash everywhere, she recalled, and
``you felt leered at, looked at.'' Today, the base is scrupulously
neat, and as she dispatches the helicopters that ferry scientists
and supplies to and from remote field camps, most of her colleagues
are women. At age 46, she thinks of this job as her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sort of fought it for a while,'' Ms. Abbott said. But when a
boyfriend wanted her to settle in New Zealand, she resisted. This
year found her back at work in her cramped office, off the storage
area for helicopter parts and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny day, light reflected off the Ross Sea ice, is
blinding. That's the way Ms. Abbott likes it. On sunny days, the
helos (pronounced HEE-lows) fly on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   As in more normal environments, some of the people working here
develop romantic attachments. With at least two men for every
women, women here do not languish for lack of suitors. But like
everything else, romance is difficult in Antarctica, even in the
relative civilization of McMurdo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to date here,'' said Anne Vick, who arrived a
few weeks ago for another season running the Mechanical Equipment
Center, where generators and other equipment is kept in shape.
</P>
<P>
   There are regular movies, but people view them from
straight-back chairs in the galley. Couples can leave the base for
a stroll, but only if their survival skills have been checked out.
And, at least in the summer season, there is never any romantic
twilight. Unless it is raining or foggy, the sun shines with the
same lurid brightness 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to socialize,'' Ms. Vick said.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, almost everyone lives in a dormitory and
in the summer season almost everyone has a roommate. ``If one
person has a roommate who leaves town you can get several shifts,''
Ms. Vick said. ``One guy goes into the field so his roommate's
girlfriend comes over, then her roommate's boyfriend comes over.''
</P>
<P>
   Things are even rougher in remote camps, and not just because of
their isolation. A leaflet issued to women offers a warning ``about
doing it in the field,'' noting that that no one is as clean in
camp as back at Mactown, and that pregnancy means an immediate
flight home.
</P>
<P>
   The guide also offers how-to tips for using a device that some
women say has vastly improved their lives in the primitive cold of
remote camps: an anatomically contoured funnel and extension hose
that _ almost _ allows women to urinate like men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secrets of success are proper positioning of the funnel and
insuring you have a good seal between it and your body,'' the guide
says.
</P>
<P>
   But many women say they never use it because if it is not
positioned exactly right they can end up wet, a potentially
disastrous problem. Anyway, Ms. Johnson said, ``you quickly lose
all sense of embarrassment in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite changes that have made Antarctica more inviting to
women, it will never seem like home. Even in McMurdo the ratio of
men to women is wildly out of balance and there are no old people,
no children and no pets.
</P>
<P>
   For some who come to the Ice, that is fine. ``There are some
people who (italics)want(end italics) to be away from home,'' Ms.
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wisneski said, about half to two-thirds of the workers
return each year. ``Wanderers,'' he calls them.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Ms. Vick, 27, fits that pattern. She had worked on the
Ice in the 1993-94 season, and then earned a master's degree at the
Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge University. By 1997,
she was living in Manhattan, in the West Village, and working for
the Hearst Corp., on the international editions of magazines like
Esquire and Harper's Bazaar.
</P>
<P>
   She took a job in marketing, but she hated it. ``I thought,
`it's time to go back.' I missed the people and the life style.
There is such a fantastic communiuty of women here _ interesting,
motivated, savvy women in very non-traditional roles.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, after some travel, work in Greenland and an
exhibition of her Antarctic photographs in New York last summer,
she returned again.
</P>
<P>
   Other women, like Ms. Uberuaga, simply fall in love with the
place.
</P>
<P>
   It was her mother, an employee of the civilian contractor then
running services at McMurdo, who suggested that she try a season in
the Ice in 1979. ``In those days if you recruited someone they
would pay you a $50 bonus,'' Ms. Uberuaga recalled wryly.
</P>
<P>
   She was 24 that first year, and she worked as a laborer. There
were only a handful of other women. ``This was a big bastion of
masculinity and military conservatism,'' she said. ``I had a
million critics.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Uberuaga stuck with it, in part because she loved the
landscape and the outdoor life but also because her supervisors
held out the promise of promotion that, over the years, she won.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Ms. Uberuaga ran an earth-mover with a 16-foot
blade, working on the site for a new fuel tank. She has become so
skilled on the big machine that she could smooth the tank base to
within a fraction of an inch, and she is proud of it. ``It's a very
diverse and interesting job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With Antarctic Support Associates providing housing, food and
even clothing, Ms. Uberuaga's expenses are few. Like many of her
co-workers, she works from October to February in Antarctica,
saving enough to support herself the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a house in the mountains in Idaho,'' she said. ``It's
paid for, it's right on the river. Everything I have is paid for. I
just have a great life.''
</P>
<P>
   But she is 43 now and, although there is no formal age limit for
working in Antarctica, she realizes that at some point she will no
longer be able to pass the required physical exam. ``I am very
attached to the landscape here and yet there will be a day when I
can never come back,'' she said. ``That makes it so poignant.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she said, a friend she met at McMurdo decided not to
return for another season. A few months later, Ms. Uberuaga
recalled, she received a letter from her. ``Halfway through the
Montana winter she was dreaming of the Ice.''

</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 15)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics. Double parentheses

(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who are the Joneses, anyway, and why are we still trying to keep
up with them?
</P>
<P>
   They started out as a snooty family standing apart from the
crowd in England. In ``Memoirs of a Station Master,'' E.J. Simmons
wrote in 1879 about the social interplay at his public meeting
place, the railway station: ``The Jones', who don't associate with
the Robinson's, meet there.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1913, the cartoonist Arthur R. Momand, who used the pseudonym
``Pop,'' titled his New York Globe comic strip ``Keeping up with
the Joneses.'' (``Pop'' got the spelling right: It's  &UR; Joneses &LR; ,
plural, not  &UR; Jones's &LR; , possessive.)
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, it's been a scramble keeping up with the
puttings-down of the upwardly mobile. In 1924, the founder of
social psychology as a behavioral science, Floyd Allport, wrote
that ``an inconsequential genealogy'' might cause an ambitious
young man to be labeled ``a  &UR; social climber &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   That professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School thereby
coined a derogation that was popularized two years later in the
novel ``Mantrap,'' by Sinclair Lewis: ``You sniveling little
 &UR; social climber &LR; !'' (Eager to claw my way up life's ladder, I
audited a course by Allport at Syracuse in 1950; he thought I was
uppity, and now I know why.)
</P>
<P>
   About the time Allport coined  &UR; social climber &LR; , P.A. Sorokin was
titling his 1927 work `` &UR; Social Mobility &LR; .'' In our more
meritocratic times, social climbing is not seen as such an offense
against good taste; it is better to be  &UR; nouveau riche &LR;  than not
 &UR; riche &LR;  at all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Upward mobility &LR;  has become a positive value.  &UR; Status &LR;  is now
worthily achieved, not born to, and while a  &UR; status seeker &LR; 
juggling  &UR; status symbols &LR;  is considered a little tacky, the terms
are not quite as pejorative as  &UR; social climber &LR; , sniveling or
otherwise. (That is usually pronounced STAT-us, as in  &UR; statistics &LR; ,
by the hifalutin, and STATE-us by the hoi polloi. It comes from the
Latin  &UR; stare &LR; , ``to stand''; in law, your status is your standing.)
</P>
<P>
   The happy achievability of status, sometimes called the American
Dream, was hammered home in the theme song of ``The Jeffersons,'' a
television sitcom that lasted an incredible 10 years: ``Well, we're
movin' on up!/To the East Side/To a dee-luxe apartment in the
sky./Movin' on up!/To the East Side/We've finally got a piece of
the pie!''
</P>
<P>
   DISMISSALESE: MOVIN' ON
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country has been distracted by this matter for too long,''
said President Clinton in his brief Aug. 17 speech after his grand
jury appearance. ``Now it is time, in fact it is past time, to
 &UR; move on &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Paley quickly agreed: ``I wish the
situation was what he said in January. But it isn't. So let's  &UR; move
on &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase soon became the mantra for those supporting the
president. Some, like Sen. John Glenn, preferred ``Let's  &UR; put it
behind us &LR; ,'' but  &UR; move on &LR;  was the dismissal of preference by
those who objected to the sex revelations. Sen. Tom Harkin used
both: ``It's in our best interest to  &UR; put this behind us and move
on &LR; .'' (In 1992, Newsweek quoted his wife, Ruth Harkin, saying of
the incoming first lady, ``One of the things about Hillary
((Clinton)) is she  &UR; moves on &LR; .'')
</P>
<P>
   Seekers of the president's impeachment could not effectively
counter with ``Let's stay with this'' or ``No moving on,'' because
a call for stasis is hardly rousing; they chose to counter a
different dismissal, ``It's just about sex,'' with the
bumper-sticker slogan ``It's the Perjury, Stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   The imperative dismissal was first recorded in 1831, as a
direction given by a London policeman to loiterers. In the 1978
song ``Move On,'' by Paul Stanley of Kiss, the singer recalls
advice from his mother not to be tied down to one woman: ``Move on,
that's what she told me/Move on, mmm yeah/Move on, whoo oh oh/Move
on, I'm leavin' on my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, few supporters of Clinton used the phrase hurled by
the mayor of Washington, Marion Barry, at those who objected to his
election comeback: `` &UR; Get over it &LR; .'' That formulation of dismissal
is too confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some saw  &UR; move on &LR;  as insufficiently contrite: ``Nothing
sets a woman off faster,'' observed Janis Spring, a Yale
psychologist, than  &UR; move on &LR; . ``The idea of moving on _ men have a
tendency to use that expression. You can't  &UR; move on &LR; . You can only
move through.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the White House damage controllers included a
psychologist, because both the president and the vice president
subtly modified their phraseology soon after the speech. ``It is
very important that our nation  &UR; move forward &LR; ,'' Clinton and Gore
said at various times. ``It is time to  &UR; put this matter behind us &LR; 
once and for all and  &UR; move forward &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Cannot spend too much time in close analysis of this propelling
locution. Time to get on with the business of lexicography. (Unlike
the command  &UR; get over it &LR;  or the exhortation  &UR; move on &LR; , the brisk
 &UR; get on with it &LR;  is a more neutral dismissal.)
</P>
<P>
   FUMBLERULES
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, I collected a bunch of ``fumblerules'' that
illustrated mistakes in English by using them. For example, ``don't
use no double negatives,'' ``avoid run-on sentences they are hard
to read,'' ``place pronouns as close as possible, especially in
long sentences _ such as those of 10 or more words _ to their
antecedents'' and ``a writer must not shift your point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Maggiani of Burlington, Vt., found a few more on his
e-mail. My favorites: ``Foreign words and phrases are not
apropos.'' ``Be more or less specific.'' And finally: ``Who needs
rhetorical questions?''

IMAGINE, ANOTHER JOHN LENNON BOXED SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Lennon could seem simultaneously to be both cynic and
enthusiast. That's what we have to be when considering ``The John
Lennon Anthology,'' a newly released four-CD boxed set from Capitol
Records consisting mostly of studio outtakes, snippets of
conversation, midst-of-composing song snatches, and a few live
performances that haven't appeared on previous albums.
</P>
<P>
   Cynicism first: We already have an ``official'' Lennon boxed
set, plus a couple of greatest-hits packages. Most fans already own
one or two versions of his best-known solo tunes, plus a good
sampling of everything else. In the booklet that accompanies this
new anthology, Yoko Ono occasionally interrupts her own whining
about how she and John were misunderstood to reiterate how these
new CDs show fans the John she knew, how John's entire body of work
is important, and how the songs on this set are ``the ones John
wanted you to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: If he wanted us to know them, why were
they never released during his lifetime?
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible not to suspect that Ono has assumed her
occasional role of still-grieving widow in hopes of squeezing a few
more millions out of Lennon's musical corpse. If ``The John Lennon
Anthology'' sells respectably, don't be shocked if Yoko comes up
with some more long-lost outtakes John wanted us to know, too.
</P>
<P>
   But having said that ...
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that any Lennon fan, rabid or casual, will find
a lot to like about ``Anthology.'' Even the most casual throwaways
have something entertaining to offer, and hearing alternate takes
on Lennon classics like ``Jealous Guy'' and ``Whatever Gets You
Thru the Night'' is not only interesting but exciting.
</P>
<P>
   The CDs are beautifully packaged, with each heavy-cardboard
fold-over sleeve illustrated with Lennon drawings (weak-of-heart be
warned _ some are pretty racy), and careful booklet annotation
about what was recorded where and when and with whom. Individual
CDs celebrate distinct portions of Lennon's solo career _
``Ascot,'' with a focus on his first two albums; ``New York City,''
at once the most uneven and the most fascinating, with seven live
cuts from various benefit concerts; ``The Lost Weekend,'' dominated
by Lennon's chaotic collaboration with demented production genius
Phil Spector; and ``Dakota,'' with songs culled from Lennon's final
years, when he celebrated marriage and fatherhood above rock
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Just about any multiple-CD boxed set contains some bloat. We
could have done without a few of the studio conversations between
Spector and Lennon; outtakes of ``Slippin' and Slidin' '' and
``Peggy Sue'' contribute nothing to the preservation of Lennon's
own musical legacy. But nearly everything else is meat, not fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ascot'' will probably please the most listeners. Much of the
breakthrough, right-to-the-bone tunes from ``John Lennon'' are
reintroduced as works in progress, and there is a generous sampling
from the more accessible ``Imagine'' album. ``Jealous Guy'' is
especially engaging; so, in a nastier sense, is listening to Lennon
craft ``How Do You Sleep?'' a song meant to libel ex-Beatle buddy
Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Many of ``New York City's'' tracks were labeled hedonistic dreck
as soon as they were issued back in the '70s. ``New York City,''
``Luck of the Irish'' and ``Attica State'' are more interesting now
as social nostalgia than as rock-your-socks entertainment. But
there's a stunning live version of ``Imagine,'' with Lennon
explaining that he's playing it on acoustic guitar because his old
band broke up and he hasn't got a new one yet, and there are fun
demos of ``I'm the Greatest'' and ``Goodnight Vienna,'' Lennon
tunes that were eventually recorded by Ringo Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lost Weekend'' is predictably boozy and overblown; these
songs were mostly written and recorded during Lennon's lengthy,
highly publicized separation from Ono. It's probable that most
``Anthology'' purchasers will listen to this CD once, and then
leave it in the box while they replay the other three over and
over. Forget the warmed-over cover versions of '50s rock hits; the
stuff that matters here is pure Lennon, especially the two takes of
``Whatever Gets You Thru the Night'' and a heart-rending ``Steel
and Glass.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dakota'' is a reminder of Lennon's happiest times. The best
``Double Fantasy'' songs are here, with ``Beautiful Boy'' the most
effective. ``Serve Yourself'' and ``The Rishi Kesh Song,'' two
hilarious Lennon skewerings of Bob Dylan and George Harrison,
respectively, will undoubtedly get a lot of notice. ``Anthology''
would have responsibly concluded with ``Dear John,'' ``Dakota's''
last cut, where Lennon sings to himself that everything's OK, the
troubles are over. But, no, someone had to stick on a few last
goofy outtakes. No purpose is served. We already know the irony of
how John Lennon died.

   LONDON _ With eight weeks to go until the debut of the euro,
many Europeans remain confused about the new unified currency and
what it will mean to them.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent The Economist magazine survey, just over half the
people in the Republic of Ireland knew the name of the new
currency, while only half of Portuguese citizens asked could
correctly answer a basic six-question quiz on the currency.

   Consequently, many European governments are launching campaigns

TOM WOLFE PAINTS VIVID CHARACTERS IN A DICKENSIAN OPUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You know the literary event of the year (the decade?) is here
when you see the smiling man in the white suit, there on the cover
of Time. You see Tom Wolfe on television, too, expounding on a book
that needs no promotion, with more than a million copies in print
before its official publication this week.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe's rhetorical corpulence is ``A Man in Full,'' already
overhyped and, I believe, already overrated. But at least in the
measure of its ambition, it is the equal of the same author's ``The
Bonfire of the Vanities,'' which was merely the best American novel
of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The two novels are similar in both design and theme. Charlie
Croker, the focal ``man in full,'' is, like Sherman McCoy in
``Bonfire,'' corrupted by his own success but ripe for spiritual
redemption.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a protagonist in the new novel, it has to be
Charlie, and he is so described in dust jacket copy; but ``A Man in
Full'' is a parallel construction, with a half-dozen major
characters (and hundreds of minor ones) riding three separate story
lines that of course will arrive at a confluence.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Croker at 60 is a fabulously successful real estate
developer in booming Atlanta. Intoxicated by sex, he has dumped
Martha, his well-born wife of three decades, in favor of sirenly
Serena, now 28. Charlie's ``cracker'' origin is unmistakable, and
his spiral into immense wealth was aided long ago by his celebrity
as Georgia Tech's ``60-minute man,'' a bruising running back who
also played defense.
</P>
<P>
   Now Georgia Tech has another celebrated running back, but Fareek
(The Cannon) Fanon is black; and he may or may not have raped the
daughter of one of the pillars of Atlanta's white establishment.
Atlanta's black mayor, Wes Jordan, determined to preserve the
city's delicate racial balance, enlists dapper black attorney Roger
White II _ not illogically called Roger Too White _ to defend The
Cannon against possible charges; and Jordan and White bring Charlie
Croker into their scheme.
</P>
<P>
   They can make it worth Charlie's while, because Charlie is in
trouble. The real estate developer has overextended himself with
the self-glorifying Croker Concourse and is in debt by more than a
half-billion dollars. The vultures at PlannersBanc, Charlie's
primary creditor, are out to get him; they've taken possession of
his Gulfstream Five jetliner and set their sights on Turpmtine,
Charlie's 29,000-acre plantation that exists mainly for shooting
quail.
</P>
<P>
   As Charlie begins the necessary downsizing of his empire, young
Conrad Hensley is an early casualty, laid off his job in Oakland,
Calif., where workers' noses drip icicles in the frozen-foods
warehouse of Croker Global Foods. Thus begins Conrad's undeserved
descent into the Hades of Santa Rita, the Alameda County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, all these things will come together, but it must take some
time, because Tom Wolfe _ prophet and architect of the New
Journalism _ must write a novel whose very size will dwarf its
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a novel other than ``Bonfire'' with which to compare
``A Man in Full,'' let it be ``Bleak House,'' Charles Dickens'
masterpiece of convolution. There is something quite Dickensian in
both of Tom Wolfe's novels, and not only in their excessive
reliance on coincidence and their big parades of richly drawn
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe is the master's equal at writing, whether or not it
may be called overwriting. The text of ``A Man in Full'' spans 742
pages, and its story could be related in half that or less; but
Wolfe exploits his glorious talent by elaboration, piling detail
upon detail. The reader is kept dangling, but the reader is
charmed.
</P>
<P>
   Some set-pieces in ``A Man in Full'' are quite marvelous. The
narrative gets good early steam in the second chapter, ``The
Saddlebags,'' when Charlie Croker is manipulated outrageously by
his bankers. There is a spellbinding if irrelevant passage in which
a bizarre cheering section watches a champion stallion copulate
with a mare. Scenes depicting Conrad Hensley's ordeal at Santa Rita
have surreal power. Wolfe is in his element when Atlanta's elite
all meet at the High Museum for the scandalous exhibition of Wilson
Lapeth's homosexual art.
</P>
<P>
   All of the descriptive writing is spectacular, but too much of
it testifies for the law of diminishing returns. And the
descriptive writing is so much better than the dialogue, of which
there is much. The characters are more vivid in Wolfe's
observations than in their distended speech.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the characters, however well-drawn, are not sufficiently
attractive. For all of Sherman McCoy's shortcomings, we finally
pulled for him in a way that we really can't pull for Charlie
Croker. The only truly sympathetic character _ Conrad _ is also the
least credible in his spiritual/intellectual development.
</P>
<P>
   The least consistent character is second wife Serena,
unexpectedly articulate near the end. The best character may be Ray
Peepgass, a PlannersBanc functionary whose cunning opportunism is
the heartbeat of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   This will be hailed as the great Atlanta novel, although most in
the city's power structure won't like it. ``A Man in Full'' is a
tour de force, and it will be a staple of cocktail-hour chatter,
probably a novel more talked about than read. It has been nominated
for the National Book Award in fiction because Tom Wolfe is its
author. No other reason.

MEXICO CITY DOES NOT LEAVE THE HEART LIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was in Mexico City a couple of weeks ago for an international
seminar on journalism ethics. It was anything but stimulating.
</P>
<P>
   For years I have been hearing about all the problems facing
Mexico City: soaring population, terrible pollution, snarled
traffic, poverty. All the reports did not prepare me for what I was
to find.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't been to Mexico City in 30 years. As I looked out of the
airplane window as we were approaching the airport, I was stunned
at how much the city had grown.
</P>
<P>
   We landed in the afternoon. They say you get the full impact of
the city's size when you approach the airport at night. The city is
creeping up the sides of mountains that were on the far outskirts
of the city when I was last there.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those I talked to while attending the seminar estimated
the population at 20 million _ about the population of Texas. That
makes it the most populous city in the world. Its residents do not
boast about this, for it is a calamity, not a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there simply is not enough water for that many
people. Signs in hotel bathrooms urge you, in both English and
Spanish, to conserve water.
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of the city, I noticed that most homes had metal
tanks on the roofs. Our tour guide said that people keep them full
of water because the supply is cut off from different parts of the
city from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't drink the water under any circumstances'' were among the
first words out of the mouth of one of my hosts on arriving at the
airport. It seems that even the residents do not dare drink the
water because it is so impure. I don't think things were that bad
the last time I was there.
</P>
<P>
   My chief host was Ernesto Villanueva, a professor at
Iberoamericana University in Mexico City. He teaches media law and
ethics. He made me promise, shortly after my arrival, never to hail
a taxi in Mexico City. He said it was too dangerous for a tourist.
</P>
<P>
   Street violence became a very serious problem in the city after
the 1995 economic crisis, when the peso was devalued from 3.5 pesos
to the U.S. dollar to seven pesos to a dollar, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Villanueva explained, ``it is not safe to take cabs
at the street for international tourists because they usually have
money in their pockets.'' In recent months, taxi drivers have
assaulted and robbed a number of tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Our hosts arranged for the seminar speakers to stay at a
comfortable hotel on the beautiful Reforma boulevard, which was
copied after the Champs-Elysees in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I also stayed in a hotel on Reforma when we were
there in the 1960s, and we loved to walk up and down the boulevard
at night. This time I was told never to stroll after sunset. It was
too dangerous for tourists, in spite of its being well-lighted and
heavily populated with pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic can be maddening, especially at rush hour. On one
occasion _ it was about 3 p.m. _ I saw an ambulance trapped in
traffic. No one seemed to pay any attention to its screaming siren.
When the traffic did inch forward, no one would yield to the
ambulance. I prayed that it was not on a life-or-death run.
</P>
<P>
   My hosts said I should have been thankful that there was little
pollution in the air. It seems that hurricanes lurking on both
sides of Mexico in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans had a cleansing
effect.
</P>
<P>
   These problems were bad enough. But I think they are dwarfed by
the terrible poverty you encounter everywhere. Many of those who
continue to pour into the city are impoverished. And there are no
jobs for them.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva said there is no government welfare system to care
for them. There are no food stamps. Consequently, people will do
almost anything for a few pesos.
</P>
<P>
   You will see someone dash into snarled traffic and wipe a
windshield, hoping for a small tip. Girls who should be playing
with dolls resort to prostitution for their survival.
</P>
<P>
   One night, as we sat in stalled traffic on Reforma, a woman
suddenly appeared in the headlights with three children. She bent
over from the waist, and one of the children _ she looked to be
about 10 _ jumped on her back and began performing an acrobatic
dance. The other two children began working their ways through the
sea of halted vehicles, hands outstretched for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the only way they can live,'' our driver said.
</P>
<P>
   I left Mexico City with a heavy heart.
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva said many consider the situation hopeless. We need to
pray for that city, for it probably is a hopeless situation for all
but God.

CALIFORNIA CANDIDATES SPEND RECORD SUM ON ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's enough to pay the annual salaries of 10,000
teachers or build Bill Gates' Seattle mansion nine times over.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the record $500 million raised for this year's
California elections paid for nasty television advertising, piles
of glossy campaign mailers and an army of political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Although the final tabulations on spending are pending, the
money given to 1998 political campaigns for state and federal
office and ballot initiatives was up 25 percent over the election
four years ago, according to the nonprofit California Voter
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for that much cash creates an exclusive club, which
you can only enter by either taking lots of special interest money
or being personally wealthy,'' said Ellen Miller of Public
Campaign, a Washington-based group that advocates overhauling
campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real shame of it is that most of that money is spent on
advertising meant to confuse voters, manipulate voters, instill
fear in voters and appeal to the emotions of voters rather than
their intellects,'' said Kim Alexander, president of the California
Voter Foundation, which has started a network of computerized
information to help voters get to the bottom of election issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking about what I could do with $500 million to
really educate voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Some political workers argue that skyrocketing campaign costs
are merely the price of democracy in an age of multimillion dollar
TV spots and jet travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, with the money spent on politics this year, you could
fund every orphanage from here to Saigon,'' said Bob Mulholland,
campaign adviser to the California Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is expensive,'' he said. ``Nobody should undercut
it. These are the most important jobs in the nation we're electing
here.''
</P>
<P>
   This year saw several firsts in California political spending.
</P>
<P>
   Multimillionaire Al Checchi made the record book by pouring
$38.9 million of his own money into his Democratic primary bid in
the governor's race. He lost.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was that sum more than had ever been spent in a state
gubernatorial primary, it topped the spending of all state Assembly
and Senate primary races combined.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, supporters and opponents of Proposition 5, which will
legalize casino gambling on Indian reservations, raised $96
million, more than any other initiative in state history. The
fund-raising blitz included $25 million in contributions from a
single Indian tribe, the San Manuel Tribal Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Gray Davis and his Republican opponent, Dan Lungren,
topped the $31.8 million general election spending record set by
retiring Gov. Pete Wilson and his Democratic challenger in 1994,
Kathleen Brown. Davis and Lungren have reported spending nearly $40
million since the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Krumholz of the Center for Responsive Politics in
Washington said one reason the cost of campaigning keeps rising is
the pressure to support a growing industry of consultants and
election experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant money chase, and that money lines a lot of
pockets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the largest chunk of this year's campaign money went to
paying for television time to broadcast campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   In a 17-day period in October, Davis and Lungren reported
spending $13 million dollars on commercials, 87 percent of their
total spending during that time. During the same 2 1/2 weeks, Davis
spent $15,000 paying his campaign manager, Garry South, while
Lungren devoted $160,000 to catering costs, ballroom rentals and
other fees for organizing fund-raising events.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic campaign consultant Bill Carrick said it could cost
up to $1.6 million for a candidate to saturate the state with a
single 30-second spot. The cost is rising rapidly, not only because
of increased broadcasting fees, but because it's becoming harder
and harder to catch the attention of TV viewers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up advertising more and get less for it,'' Carrick
said. ``In the '60s on Sunday night you had 80 percent of America
watching the Ed Sullivan show. Now, you have dozens of different
channels. It's harder to reach people.''
</P>
<P>
   People vying for office are spending less time shaking hands and
more time raising money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates no longer have to hit the street and get out and
meet people,'' said Rich DeLeon, a professor of political science
at San Francisco State University. ``Activism and direct
involvement are on the decline. Election politics has become a
spectator sport of sitting around and watching stupid TV ads.''

<P>
   YOU'RE OUTTA HERE!
</P>
<P>
   Before they were successful, they got tossed out of school:
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey Bogart _ The tough-guy screen legend grew up in a
cultured and wealthy family, which, of course, meant nothing when
he was sent to an exclusive prep school in Andover, Mass.
Schoolmates said he never cracked a book and he failed three out of
five subjects his first semester. By the following May, he was
expelled, after which he left home to join the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Abbie Hoffman _ The soon-to-be political activist honed his
skills on the teachers and administrators of Seaver Prep in
Worchester, Mass. In his sophomore year, he wrote a paper for his
English class defending atheism titled, ``Reward, Punishment and
God.'' The teacher objected to the paper, called him a ``little
Communist bastard'' and ripped the collar off his shirt. Hoffman
overturned the teacher's desk and began hitting him, resulting in
his suspension from school.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis _ In his first year of high school in Irvington,
N.J., Lewis caused an explosion in the chemistry lab. Called to the
school's office, the principal called the boy a ``dumb Jew.''
Without hesitation, Lewis punched the principal in the mouth and
knocked out one of his teeth. He was expelled from school and later
enrolled in a nearby vocational school.
</P>
<P>
   GIRLS WHO ACTED LIKE BOYS
</P>
<P>
   Katharine Hepburn _ When she was 8, ``Kathy'' called herself
Jimmy, after a friend of her brother Tom. To keep kids from pulling
her red hair, she cut it so that it was a half-inch long. She wore
boys' clothes and was sent home from school several times to change
into a dress.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Fonda _ Emulating her famous actor father, Fonda cut her
hair short, wore jeans and flannel shirts and purposely stood and
walked like him. When someone asked if she was a boy, she was so
overjoyed she couldn't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Martin _ Before she was Peter Pan, she was a tomboy. In the
second grade, she put on a pair of boxing gloves she got for
Christmas and took on the best fighter in her class at school. She
won, knocking out the boy's two front teeth.
</P>
<P>
   BOYS WHO ACTED LIKE GIRLS
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Hemingway _ At age 3, he was worried that Santa Claus
would not know he was a boy because his mother, Grace, dressed
Ernest and sister Marcelline, as if they were twins.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Peary _ The arctic explorer was pampered as a boy by his
mother. To keep the sun from burning his fair skin, she sent him
outside in frilly bonnets. The girlish clothing, plus an
embarrassing lisp, were ridiculed by his playmates in Portland,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Christian Andersen _ The Danish writer was quiet and timid
as a child and often spent time at home sewing clothes for his
dolls.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN I GROW UP
</P>
<P>
   Forget about being a firefighter or a nurse. This is what some
celebs said they wanted to become when they were kids:
</P>
<P>
   Madonna _ A nun . . . at least until she ``realized that nuns
didn't have a sex life.''
</P>
<P>
   Marian Anderson _ The opera legend doctored her dolls and
bandaged her friends, harboring wishes of becoming a surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   k.d. lang _ A roller derby queen. She watched roller derby shows
on television and then perfected her technique in the basement of
her home.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Lombardi _ A priest. He attended a seminary but dropped
out. (Probably a good thing. As a boy, a teacher at his Catholic
school left the room and put him in charge of the daily recitation
of the Hail Mary. She returned to find him hitting another boy's
head against the blackboard for not praying.)
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stalin _ A priest. (Wonder how he said the Hail Mary . .
.? )
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Stewart _ An aviator.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Lancaster _ An opera singer.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Burnett _ A cartoonist.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Day-Lewis _ A woodworker.
</P>
<P>
   C'MON BABY, GIMME SOME SUGAR
</P>
<P>
   First-kiss memories of the rich and famous:
</P>
<P>
   Alan Alda _ At his 13th birthday party, the future star of M A S
H was dancing with Antoinette Dell'Olio to the song The Girl That I
Marry. At the end of the dance, he kissed her, but because his
mouth was full of silver braces, saliva ran down her face. She
waited until he wasn't looking to wipe her mouth off.
</P>
<P>
   Burt Reynolds _ His first long kiss happened at 15 when he and a
cheerleader named Margie were sitting under a tree in a park. Burt
thought Margie was a pretty experienced kisser, but when she put
her tongue in his mouth (``almost choked me to death,'' he wrote in
his 1994 book My Life) he questioned her sophistication. Later, a
friend explained that Margie had French-kissed him.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Davis _ At one birthday party _ either his sixth or
seventh _ he kissed Velma Brooks too aggressively. His sister,
Dorothy, told on him to their mother, who demanded that their
father stop Miles from smooching with the girl. When the father
refused, his miffed sister replied that someone had better stop
Miles before he gave Velma a baby. His mother told him later that
it was bad to kiss a girl with so much gusto and then slapped him.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Collins _ When she was 4, the singer went on a Halloween
hayride. On her way back to her home in Los Angeles, a boy she went
with told her to close her eyes and then kissed her. When she
opened her eyes, he asked, ``Do you know what that was?'' She said
no, but in her autobiography Trust Your Heart, she said she knew
what it was. ``It was the beginning of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   RED-FACED BEFORE THEY WERE FAMOUS
</P>
<P>
   Think you had it tough as a kid? Consider the childhoods of
these celebrities:
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage _ A not-so-rich kid attending the wealthy Beverly
Hills High School, Cage couldn't get girls to date him because it
meant riding the bus. When a beautiful girl agreed to go to the
prom, Cage cashed in a savings bond to rent a limosine. He was so
nervous though, that when he went to kiss her, he threw up. The
limo driver wouldn't let him back into the car because of the vomit
on his shoes and he had to walk home.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly Parton _ Parton grew up poor in Tennessee. When Dolly was
in grade school, her mother made a patchwork coat for her, tailored
from bright-colored scraps of material. Proud of the work of art,
Dolly couldn't wait to show off her coat at school. The kids
instead mocked her, saying it was nothing more than a bunch of
rags. She got the last laugh. Years later she turned the experience
into a song. Coat of Many Colors became her signature tune.
</P>
<P>
   J. Robert Oppenheimer _ A shy, sickly, intellectual kid, ``the
father of the atomic bomb'' was kidnapped at summer camp by fellow
campers and dragged to an icehouse, where he was stripped, beaten
and had his backside painted green.
</P>
<P>
   John Wayne _ Kids ridiculed Marion Morrison (his real name)
after he moved to California from Iowa because he was shy, skinny,
taller than the other boys and had a ``sissy name.'' They
repeatedly beat him up and called him ``little girl'' until he
filled out and began to play football.

   ``Former wrestler Jesse 'The Body' Ventura was elected as
Minnesota's new governor. This is pretty exciting because he's the
first professional wrestler to hold public office since Janet
Reno.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A department store in Minnesota is trying to catch a woman who
has stolen over $1,000 worth of size 44-D bras. Police are looking
for the woman, as is every other guy in town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A plastic surgeon in Italy announced he's going to perform the
world's first penis transplant. Shortly thereafter, Hillary Clinton
called to say she knows the perfect donor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today, President Clinton said, 'The American people
sent a message that would break the eardrums of anybody listening.'
In fact, the President said the last time he heard something that
loud, he had to tell Monica to keep it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been reported that Jesse 'The Body' Ventura spent only
$250,000 on his entire campaign. It would have been even less, but
he spent $50,000 on body oil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Famous radio personality Dr. Laura Schlessinger apologized
yesterday for the nude photos of her that have popped up on the
Internet. Apparently, the photos reveal why Dr. Laura is on the
radio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore talked to the astronauts on board the space shuttle
today. Reportedly, he asked them what zero gravity is like and they
asked him what zero charisma is like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, the Republican National Committee rejected New York
as the site of their next presidential convention. A spokesperson
explained by saying, 'Just like any other convention, we want a
place with good strip bars.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``John Glenn's historic space flight is coming to an end and
he'll be returning to Earth tomorrow. Unless they let him drive and
then it could take a few more days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paula Jones' lawyers have quit because they say that she is
'unreasonable.' After hearing this, President Clinton said, 'Hey, I
found that out the first time I met her.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``O.J. Simpson had surgery recently. Apparently, there was an
awkward moment just before O.J. went under when he told the
surgeon, 'You're holding the knife wrong.'''

<P>
   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There were two things I always wanted as a child _ a
three-wheeler and shoes that squeaked. I remember how my classmates
had shoes that squeaked as they walked, and I never knew what
caused it, but I liked the sound. I would walk through puddles of
water hoping that would do the trick, but it never did.
</P>
<P>
   I always loved any toy that had wheels, and it was a thrill when
my superintendent's son let me ride his tricycle. My parents were
poor, so I just dreamed about owning one. I never got the squeaky
shoes or the tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I wore my Nike shoes, and as I was walking to the
trash room, I heard them squeak. I couldn't believe it. After all
these years, I finally had a pair of shoes that squeaked.

   Edward Levine was playing a word game with Lily, his 9-year-old
daughter. The game covers a variety of subjects and requires each
player to come up with a word or phrase beginning with a particular
letter. In one round, the letter was H and the category was
``action words.'' Where else but New York would Lily have responded
with ``Hail a cab!''
</P>
<P>
   My 21-year-old daughter graduated from college in May and headed
to Europe for a planned three-month vacation. Six weeks later, she
was notified about a potential job in New York and deemed it such a
great opportunity that she returned immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Switching into her ``take charge mode,'' she bought a new suit
for the interview, had her hair styled, called her references in
advance and left me wondering if this was really my child. She got
the job, and in record time moved back into her dad's apartment in
Manhattan, reorganized her room there and went to work at a
prestigious media organization.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, we were discussing the nuts and bolts of her
new life, and I offered her one of my favorite and extremely hardy
plants for her room. ``No,'' she replied. ``I'm not ready for that
level of commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   _ VALERIE M. JOSEPHSON
</P>
<P>
   When her daughters were 5 and 7, Linda Weil attended a lecture
by a psychologist. The message she took home was that life was
filled with choices, and that a parent's job was to present the
choices on a regular basis as training for adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, as the girls were dressing, Ms. Weil asked if
they wanted pancakes or waffles. There were a few short ``I don't
care'' shrugs, but Ms. Weil was determined to make them choose. She
kept repeating the question. Finally, one of the girls looked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been something at last night's lecture,'' her
daughter said. ``Please don't go to any more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The panhandler near Rockefeller Center wasn't doing too badly,
all things considered. His sign read, ``Help me continue my beer
research.'' A surprising number of passers-by did.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, my wife took our 10-week-old son for his first subway
ride. Everyone said that he would sleep through the whole ride. He
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He started screaming as soon as they sat down. Instead of
leaving the car or rolling their eyes, the other passengers gave
advice. One woman suggested turning him around in his harness
(didn't work), a Russian woman came over and bounced him around and
sang (worked for about 40 seconds), and a guy offered what seemed
to be a lot of sympathetic advice (my wife couldn't hear it over
the screaming). Then he gave her a package of earplugs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a homeless man, who gave his ``Ladiesanjennulmun may I
please have yer attention'' speech, even though it was completely
drowned out by the screaming, came over and said ``Don't cry baby!
Jesus loves you! Praise the Lord! Hallelujah! Hallelujah!''
</P>
<P>
   My son stopped crying immediately. The whole car burst out
laughing. He slept for the rest of the afternoon.

   Marcel Kristel was intrigued by recent sightings of two signs.
In Los Angeles, ``Antique tables made daily'' and in London,
``Breakfast served all day 9 a.m. to 2 p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Scene: Metro-North train from Pawling to Grand Central Terminal
on a Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Players: Henry Baker, sitting in a double seat with an
unobstructed view of the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Tall young man with a shoulder bag, making a beeline for
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Action: None. The man doesn't emerge. Baker sits and thinks:
``Aha, he's hiding from the conductor. He's not going to pay his
fare.''
</P>
<P>
   The conductor goes by. More time passes. What could be going on
in there?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the restroom door opens. Out walks a tall, perfectly
coiffed, beautifully dressed, very elegant _ woman.
</P>
<P>
   As Baker summed it up: and so, another Saturday night in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Secunda was on the Upper West Side when he heard this
Clintonian exchange:
</P>
<P>
   A father, impatiently tugging a rambunctious boy about 10 years
old, said, ``If you don't start behaving, we're turning around and
going home this minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy replied, ``Define behaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Bass, the president of the Strand Book Store, has a new
definition of chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a man called the store saying he had a Britannica set
to sell. He was told the store would pay him $100, and he accepted.
A little later, as he drove up with his books and was unloading
them, a passer-by spotted them, offered him more money and within
the proverbial New York minute was carrying away the set.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, the wheeler-dealer buyer returned. This
time he entered the store, but not to make a purchase. He demanded
satisfaction, he said. The set was incomplete. Bass suggested he
hang a shingle out on the curb.

 &HT;    WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG
 &HT;    By JEFF HOUCK
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Madonna wanted to be a nun. Oprah was abused. Elvis Presley was
a mama's boy sleepwalker who believed nightmares were hereditary.
Burt Reynolds' success began when he won a high school foot race. A
grief-stricken Martin Luther King Jr. threw himself out of a
second-floor window when he learned his beloved grandmother had
died. Barbra Streisand dressed a water bottle up as a doll and
filled it with warm water to make it feel like a real baby.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, famous people had strange childhoods, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point made by the new book, When They Were Kids,
(Random House, $14.95). No matter if you're the pope (who harbored
boyhood dreams of a life in the theater) or the president (Abe
Lincoln was a geeky six-footer at age 15), the message is: your
childhood probably wasn't much different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Childhood is a memorable experience for all of us, whether the
stuff that happened is good or bad,''
</P>
<P>
   ``The social mores may change over time and the accoutrements
accouterments of history may change,'' says author Carol Orsag
Madigan, who wrote the book with friend Ann Elwood, a history
professor who teaches at universities in southern California. ``But
what underlies many of the stories are emotions and relationships
and problems with self-esteem and self-worth that everyone goes
through.''
</P>
<P>
   That universality allowed Madigan and Elwood to examine equally
the likes of Dolly Parton (who endured poverty in the Tennessee
mountains), the Dalai Lama (who played war games with Lhasa monks)
and Salvador Dali' (who forever sought to shake the legacy of a
brother who died 10 months before the artist was born -- and with
whom he shared the same name).
</P>
<P>
   The book is a collection of lists that group batch familiar
subjects with history's most famous names. Chapters include
``Favorite Toys,'' (Truman Capote adored a tricycle shaped like a
red airplane), ``Fears, Phobias and Obsessions,'' (Wolfgang Mozart
was terrified by the sound of a lone trumpet), and ``Loners,'' (A
third-grade Bruce Springsteen was stuffed into a garbage can by a
nun). at his school).
</P>
<P>
   The authors pored for two years through hundreds of anectdotes
and quotes from dozens of biographies and articles in newspapers
and magazines to collect the more than 400 sketches of famous
childhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan could be called a professional list maker. She helped
edit and write the landmark books The People's Almanac and The Book
of Lists with historians Amy and Irving Wallace and David
Wallechinsky. When They Were Kids is an extension of reference
books that she and Elwood wrote for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doing the reference books, we started to notice common themes
of the various childhoods and thought they might make a good book
in list form,'' Madigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Movie titans Steven Spielberg and George Lucas make the most
appearances. (Spielberg had a messy room, was easily spooked by
scary TV shows and had two parakeets he named Schmuck and Schmuck
II. Lucas was an inept speller who loved to read comic books and
build backyard carnivals that featured a six-foot-high
rollercoaster.)
</P>
<P>
   A close third is Palm Beach County's favorite son, Burt
Reynolds, Madigan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a section dedicated
</P>
<P>
   to turning points in each person's life and he had a wonderful
story in his book My Life about how he had been a greaser but
wanted to be a jock,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds didn't like the ``Greaseball'' nickname and instead
wanted to be called ``Buddy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One day, Reynolds was challenged by the jocks to run a foot race
against the best sprinter at Central Junior High in West Palm
Beach. Burt, running barefoot in front of a crowd gathered at the
football field, beat his opponent in the last 5 yards. The result:
He became a football player, lettered in several sports. And
everyone called him Buddy. The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said in the book that while he'd like to think his success
was the result of luck and talent, he said it all might have worked
out differently for him if he hadn't won that foot race,'' Madigan
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's about as deep as the book strays into Freudian analysis.
(Yes, Sigmund Freud is here. He was the golden child of seven
offspring whose mother doted on him.) But Madigan said there are
some obvious personality traits that each notable displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither of us are medically trained, but if I was playing
armchair psychologist, I'd say that all of the people in the book
had a lot of drive and ambition and success and a need to overcome
adversity,'' she said.

   There were two things I always wanted as a child _ a
three-wheeler and shoes that squeaked. I remember how my classmates
had shoes that squeaked as they walked, and I never knew what
caused it, but I liked the sound. I would walk through puddles of
water hoping that would do the trick, but it never did.
</P>
<P>
   I always loved any toy that had wheels, and it was a thrill when
my superintendent's son let me ride his tricycle. My parents were
poor, so I just dreamed about owning one. I never got the squeaky
shoes or the tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   The other day I wore my Nike shoes, and as I was walking to the
trash room, I heard them squeak. I couldn't believe it. After all
these years, I finally had a pair of shoes that squeaked.

   Switching into her ``take charge mode,'' she bought a new suit

Manhattan, reorganized her room there and went to work at a

   When her daughters were 5 and 7, Linda Weil attended a lecture
by a psychologist. The message she took home was that life was
filled with choices, and that a parent's job was to present the
choices on a regular basis as training for adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, as the girls were dressing, Ms. Weil asked if
they wanted pancakes or waffles. There were a few short ``I don't
care'' shrugs, but Ms. Weil was determined to make them choose. She
kept repeating the question. Finally, one of the girls looked up.

   He started screaming as soon as they sat down. Instead of
leaving the car or rolling their eyes, the other passengers gave
advice. One woman suggested turning him around in his harness
(didn't work), a Russian woman came over and bounced him around and
sang (worked for about 40 seconds), and a guy offered what seemed
to be a lot of sympathetic advice (my wife couldn't hear it over
the screaming). Then he gave her a package of earplugs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a homeless man, who gave his ``Ladiesanjennulmun may I
please have yer attention'' speech, even though it was completely
drowned out by the screaming, came over and said ``Don't cry baby!

<P>
   Osteoporosis is a silent disease. Just as a heart attack is
often the first clue to the existence of atherosclerosis, a
fracture is usually the first indication that a person's bones have
become dangerously weakened.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't have to be that way. According to guidelines
issued last week by the National Osteoporosis Foundation, it is now
possible to determine a person's propensity for fracture far in
advance and offer preventive treatments for most people at risk of
developing osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a problem to be dismissed lightly. Osteoporosis is
responsible for about 1.5 million fractures a year that incur
medical costs of $38 million each day.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 28 million Americans have already lost enough bone
to be at great risk of suffering a fracture. Half of all women over
50 and one in eight men over 50 will suffer an osteoporosis-related
fracture in their lifetimes. And when the fracture involves the
hip, as it does in 300,000 people a year, it is fatal in 20 percent
of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is osteoporosis a concern only for the elderly. Bone loss
starts around ages 30 to 35, and in women who do not take hormone
replacement, that loss accelerates rapidly in the first five or six
years after menopause.
</P>
<P>
   By age 65, bones can be so weakened that even the best available
remedies cannot prevent them from breaking. Yet according to a
survey last year of 30,000 Americans, 71 percent of women with
osteoporosis do not know they have it, and 86 percent with the
disease are not being treated.
</P>
<P>
   A bone-density test is the only way to determine the health of
your bones and the way to preserve or improve it.
</P>
<P>
   Who Should Be Tested?
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, all women aged 50 or older and men aged 65 or older
should have their bone health checked. Given current limits to
available medical resources and finances, the National Osteoporosis
Foundation recommends a bone-density test for the following people:
</P>
<P>
   _ All women 65 and older, regardless of other risk factors.
Medicare now reimburses for bone-density testing in eligible women.
</P>
<P>
   _ All women past menopause who have already had a fracture,
including the vertebral fractures that cause a shortening and
hunching of the spine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women past menopause who have any risk factor for suffering an
osteoporotic fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies of many thousands of people, the foundation
lists the leading risk factors as: a personal history of fracture
as an adult, regardless of what caused it; a history of fracture in
a first-degree relative (parent or sibling); current cigarette
smoking; and having a small, thin frame, defined by a body weight
of less than 127 pounds .
</P>
<P>
   There is a much longer list of secondary risk factors, secondary
only in that they may be less common or less well documented. But
they are no less important. They include certain nonmodifiable
factors: being of the Caucasian race, advanced in age, frail or in
poor health or suffering from dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The more modifiable risk factors include having a diet low in
calcium; having an eating disorder (anorexia or bulimia); and being
estrogen-deficient (including having undergone menopause before age
45 or having had more than a year without menstrual periods _ other
than during pregnancy _ before menopause); and for men, having a
low level of testosterone; consuming excessive amounts of alcohol,
and being physically inactive or subject to repeated falls.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines also suggest a bone-density test for women
considering treatment for osteoporosis, if the test will help them
reach a reasoned decision.
</P>
<P>
   They also recommend testing for women who have been on hormone
replacement for many years, a suggestion that may seem strange,
since estrogen after menopause protects the bones. However, Dr.
Robert Lindsay, president of the foundation, explained that ``many
women are inconsistent in their use of hormones _ they periodically
stop taking them _ and doctors should not assume that women on
hormone replacement are not osteoporotic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still other risks include the presence of any one of a long list
of diseases, especially ones that interfere with the consumption or
absorption of calcium or vitamin D, and long-term use of steroids
and other drugs used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, epilepsy,
thyroid deficiency, bipolar disorder (manic depression) and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Do not wait for your doctor to recommend a bone-density test. If
you fall into any of the high-risk categories, talk the matter over
with your health-care provider and, if necessary, ask to have your
bones tested.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis and Treatment
</P>
<P>
   Regular X-rays are not able to detect bone loss until it is well
advanced. The foundation listed five tests that are considered
``good predictors of future fracture risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cadillac of tests is called dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry, better known as Dexa. It can accurately measure
bone-mineral density in the spine, hip or wrist; it takes only a
few minutes (the patient stays clothed and no dyes are injected in
any of the tests); and it involves only a tiny amount of radiation
_ one-tenth of the amount in a standard chest X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dexa is not available in all communities. The other
four recommended tests are single-energy X-ray absorptiometry and
peripheral dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure the bones of
the forearm, finger and sometimes the heel; radiographic
absorptiometry to measure bones in the hand; quantitative computed
tomography commonly used to measure spinal bone; and, the least
precise, ultrasound densitometry to assess bones in the heel, calf,
knee and other peripheral sites.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the patient's bones is defined by comparing their
density with that of a young, normal adult _ usually a 35-year-old
woman. The test results are measured in standard deviations (SDs),
and 1 SD below normal is equivalent to a 10 percent to 12 percent
decrease in bone density.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, within 1 SD of normal, bones are considered healthy;
between 1 and 2.5 SDs below normal, bone mass is low and at serious
risk of becoming osteoporotic, and at 2.5 SDs or more below normal,
the diagnosis is osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   While it is never too late to slow bone loss and even improve
bone density, the sooner preventive treatment is started, the
better. The new guidelines suggest that all men and women,
regardless of current bone density, consume adequate amounts of
calcium and vitamin D (at least 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 400
to 800 international units of vitamin D daily); get regular
weight-bearing exercise like walking, jogging, stair climbing,
dancing and tennis; avoid tobacco use and abuse of alcohol (one or
two drinks a day are OK); and make sure vision is corrected to
reduce the risk of falls.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also recommended drug treatment to improve bone
density in women whose bones are below 2 SDs in the absence of
other risk factors or below 1.5 SDs when other risk factors are
present.
</P>
<P>
   Four drugs are approved to prevent or treat osteoporosis. They
are hormone-replacement therapy (associated with a 50 percent to 80
percent decrease in spinal fractures and a 25 percent decrease in
other fractures with five years of use); alendronate, better known
as Fosamax, which can reduce fractures of the spine, hip and wrist
by 50 percent in patients with osteoporosis; calcitonin, delivered
as an intranasal spray, which may reduce spinal fractures by about
40 percent; and the newest therapy, raloxifene (Evista), which
prevents bone loss and may reduce the risk of spinal fracture by 40
percent to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A final word: Parents now armed with the facts about bone
density should make sure their children consume adequate amounts of
calcium and vitamin D, stay physically active throughout childhood
and into adulthood, and avoid smoking and alcohol abuse. More than
their bones is at stake.

 IRON MEN TARDIGRADES  
 NEW USE FOR OLD TIRES 
OBSERVATORY IS NO MORE 
 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tardigrades are microscopic invertebrates that live among mosses
and lichens, and in lakes and oceans. They are sometimes known as
water bears, for their roly-poly appearance and ambling gait.
</P>
<P>
   But the cuteness is deceiving: Tardigrades are the Iron Men of
the animal kingdom. Scientists have been putting them through their
paces for years, discovering that they can survive temperatures
near absolute zero and above boiling, as well as high vacuum. They
have even been zapped with X-rays, to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest stress test, researchers in Japan have subjected
them to extreme hydrostatic pressure, equal to six times what would
be felt 30,000 feet under the sea. Sure enough, the researchers
report in the journal Nature, the tardigrades pulled through.
</P>
<P>
   The key to their survival is an ability to enter a kind of
suspended animation in which they dry up to about one-third their
former size. Once the pressure is reduced, the tardigrades return
to normal and waddle off, as if nothing had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Used tires are an environmental nuisance, and with a
quarter-billion being added each year in the United States, the
problem is getting worse. Much research has gone into reclaiming
oils and gases from them. But researchers at the University of
Illinois and the state's geological survey have suggested a new
use, as a pollution scrubber.
</P>
<P>
   They have turned old tires into activated carbon (carbon black's
being a major component of tire rubber) and tested its ability to
remove mercury and other contaminants from smokestack emissions. It
has generally performed as well as activated carbon from other
sources, notably coal. And the researchers note that, with all
those old tires around, tire-based activated carbon should be
inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Greenwich Observatory, Britain's oldest scientific
institution, closed on Oct. 31, the victim of budget cuts. It was
founded in 1675 by Charles II to aid navigation. In recent years
its focus shifted to providing technical support for astronomers.
Its location shifted too, first to Sussex and then, in 1990, to
Cambridge.
