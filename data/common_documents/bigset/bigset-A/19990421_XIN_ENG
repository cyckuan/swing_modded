<HEADLINE> Japan Agrees to Help Develop Egypt's Metallurgical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Japan signed here on
Tuesday a memorandum of understanding on cooperation in developing
and modernizing Egypt's metallurgical technology.
</P>
<P>
The memo was signed between the Egyptian Metallurgical Research
Center, representing the Egyptian government, and the official
Japanese International Cooperation Agency, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Adel Nofal, head of the center, told reporters after the
signing ceremony that the memo stipulates that Japan will transfer
advanced technology in forming, cutting and welding metals to
Egypt's small and medium industries.
</P>
<P>
The small and medium enterprises, which account for 99.7
percent of Egypt's non-agricultural private businesses, provide 80
percent of the value produced annually by the private sector and
employ 75 percent of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
Of the 550,000 new jobs that Egypt hopes to create each year
until 2017, according to a government document, "Egypt in the 21st
Century," the country's small and medium enterprises are supposed
to come up with 325,000.
</P>
<P>
Under the memo, Japan will provide training opportunities to
young researchers of the Egyptian center at its research centers
and plants, Nofal said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese metallurgical experts will visit Egypt to give
lectures to Egyptian researchers under the memo.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation between the center and the Japanese agency began in
1985 when they set up a department for inspection and welding at
the center, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Council Supports Dialogue to Solve Prevlaka Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Tuesday reiterated its support for the process of negotiations
between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) to
solve their dispute over the Prevlaka Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Council members "regretted that substantial progress so far has
not been achieved, and called upon them to intensify their efforts
in this regard," said France's Alain Dejammet, April president of
the Council, after it met to deal with the matter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Council discussed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's April 9 report on the situation in Prevlaka.
</P>
<P>
Annan said Croatia and the FRY have already put forward their
own initiatives on the resolution of their dispute after four
rounds of bilateral talks since 1996.
</P>
<P>
The latest talks were conducted in Belgrade on March 9 with no
substantial progress achieved.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides have stated their intention to continue
discussions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The assistance of the United Nations in the search for a
peaceful settlement of the issue has yet to be utilized," it
added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has maintained 27 military observers in Prevlaka.
Their mission is due to end on July 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Russian Communist
Party Gennadii Zyuganov said here Tuesday that Russia must help
Yugoslavia in both military and humanitarian fields.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov arrived here earlier Tuesday for a meeting of European
left-wing parties organized by Cyprus' Progressive Party of
Working People (AKEL) on the situation in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov underlined the need for a peaceful settlement to the
Yugoslav crisis considering the possibility that it may prompt
devastating consequences.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for cooperation among the left-wing
parties on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov expressed concern that "NATO (the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization) and the United States have undertaken the
role of international caretakers," noting that this is detrimental
to Europe, which is going through a very crucial period.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov said NATO is preparing to launch a ground campaign in
Yugoslavia and warned that "if they do so then there will be a new
Vietnam."
</P>
<P>
NATO started its massive air strikes against Yugoslavia on
March 24 allegely to punish Belgrade's refusal to sign a
Western-brokered peace deal with independence-seeking Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Leftist parties from Germany, Italy and Greece will also
participate in the two-day meeting to be held on April 21-22.

<HEADLINE> Sweden to Finance Tanzanian Power Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Sweden Tuesday
signed a 8.6-million-U.S. dollar agreement in which the latter
will finance rehabilitation of the Ubungo Power Sub-station in
Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Swedish Ambassador to Tanzania Sten
Rylander and the Permanent Secretary in Tanzania's Ministry of
Energy and Minerals, Patrick Rutabanzibwa.
</P>
<P>
The improvement work of the substation will include
rehabilitation and expansion of the high voltage parts and key
components of the switchyard to secure availability, reliability
and safety of the sub-station, Rutabanzibwa said.
</P>
<P>
He said the rehabilitation of the 33-kilovolt switchyard will
also ensure the best utilization of the two gas turbines and
capacitor banks previously installed at Ubungo with Swedish
government's assistance.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation is envisaged to be finalized by the end of
next year, said the permanent secretary.
</P>
<P>
"The sub-station at Ubungo is considered to be the most
critical point in the whole electrical network of Tanzania," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, the electric power demand in Dar es Salaam
and Zanzibar has grown considerably without much increase in the
capacity of the Ubungo sub-station, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Operational problems with outdated equipment at Ubungo have
caused a number of power outage and failures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary said that the Swedish contribution to
the energy sector has been immense over the last 30 years,
amounting to 140 billion shillings (about two million U.S. dollars
at current prices). Sweden's total assistance to Tanzania stand
at 1,615 billion shillings.
</P>
<P>
Sweden financed the Kidatu Hydro-power Station in 1970 and has
subsequently assisted in funding several other hydro-electrical
power projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Rylander reiterated his country's commitment to
remaining as a strong and reliable partner of Tanzania in the
energy sector.

ATHENS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Former Greek Prime Minister
Constantine Mitsotakis Tuesday criticized the West for apparently
taking sides in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Tuesday, Mitsotakis, who was
Greece's premier in 1990-1993, said that the West must be an
objective observer which impartially defended peace and human
rights and did not become the ally of one side.

The danger of a generalized war the Balkan region was facing
now were grounded in the Rambouillet talks when Western forces
bowed to separatism and added terms that no sovereign country
could have accepted, he said, adding that their rejection by
Belgrade was the pretext for the bombing to begin.
</P>
<P>
He said that the support of an armed struggle by an illegal
separatist group was a particularly dangerous development for the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The former premier also urged Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis to seize the opportunity at the NATO summit in Washington
to appeal for another chance at a political settlement of the
conflict in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt Refuses To Withdraw Tobacco Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Finance Minister
Herbert Murerwa Tuesday said the government will not immediately
withdraw the five percent tobacco levy charged on growers and
buyers but will review it in the 2000 budget statement to be
announced in October.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa's announcement at the official launch of the tobacco
selling season which sets off Wednesday in Harare came in the wake
of an outcry by tobacco farmers for an immediate reprieve from
levy.
</P>
<P>
The farmers citing already high production costs had threatened
to withhold delivery of their crop until the levy introduced
through a 1996 statutory instrument was removed.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was not possible for him to unilaterally
announce a reprieve insisting that he had to make his
recommendations to parliament which would approve.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Association Richard Tate said
farmers were disappointed because Murerwa's statement was not
strong enough.
</P>
<P>
He said the intended boycott would not take place, but there
would be a slow movement in the sales.
</P>
<P>
"After this statement, we will see a reduction in production
for the next season," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai, who will launch
the selling season, said the total exports for 1999 are expected
to be approximately 180,000 tons with a value of about 550 million
U.S. dollars compared with some 176,000 tons exported last year.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner.

<P>
ATHENS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece had not decided whether it
would allow NATO troops to cross its territory for possible ground
operations against Yugoslavia, Greek government spokesman Nikos
Athanassakis said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Greece hoped that this issue would not be one it had to deal
with, the spokesman said at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He also denied reports of plans for NATO war games in Greece,
saying that the only NATO exercise which related to Greece was a
scheduled geographical exercise for 52 officers.
</P>
<P>
So far, Greece, both member of NATO and the European Union
(EU), has refused to participate in NATO's airstrikes against
Yugoslavia and has repeatedly said that it would not send troops
to take part in NATO's possible land operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Most of Greeks oppose the NATO bombing raids on Yugoslavia and
they have protested in different forms against NATO's military
actions.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, some 42 members of a Greek trade union movement
said that they would go to Serbia this week to participate in
"human shields" the Yugoslav people are forming around hospitals
and bridges to protect them from NATO bombings.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Needs Foreign Help in Fight Against Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Uganda needs technical and
logistics help from foreign countries in its fight against drug
abuse and smuggling, a senior police officer told Xinhua Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Johnson Ayela, Director of Uganda's Anti-Narcotics Unit, said
that his unit is far from enough to completely stop drug abuse and
smuggling in this country because more and more drug traffickers
are using Uganda as a transit.
</P>
<P>
"We already got some help from Britain, Egypt, the United
States, Germany and the United Nations Drug Control Program," the
superintendent said. "But we are still short of hands and
technology to effectively check the drug trafficking activities."
</P>
<P>
The anti-narcotics unit, established in 1986, has only roughly
100 officers deployed at the major airports and border points, he
added.
</P>
<P>
There are many marijuana plantations in the forests in remote
areas in Uganda, he acknowledged. But he said his unit could not
establish the precise location of the plantations because they do
not have helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Poor conditions of infrastructures in these areas also hamper
their efforts against marijuana growing.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan police impounded four kilograms of cocaine in 1996, 1.6
 kilograms in 1997 and no cocaine was seized in 1998. A total of
17 kilograms of heroin and 1,000 tons of marijuana have been
seized over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Ayela said the destinations of the cocaine and heroin are
mostly Europe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
To better coordinate their efforts in this field,
anti-narcotics police from Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania have met
every six months since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon, Israel Run Into New Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon and its long-time
neighboring rival Israel are getting bogged down in a new dispute
over the village Arnoun in south Lebanon, worsening the already
fragile situation in the border area.
</P>
<P>
The row began when Israel first captured and fenced off Arnoun
with barbed wire in February, claiming it had been used by
Lebanese guerrillas for bombing attacks against Israeli troops
manning the outpost in the Crusader-era Beaufor Castle on the edge
of the Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Some Israeli soldiers were killed or wounded in and around the
village. And just three days ago, an Israeli solider was killed in
a Hezbollah roadside bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of angry university students tore down the barbed wire
fence with their bare hands eight days later after the first
capture.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, a 20-man Israeli infantry team and Israel's
militia ally South Lebanon Army (SLA) descended on Arnoun from a
hilltop base at the Beaufort Castle.
</P>
<P>
They set up sandbagged checkpoints, erected earth mounds and
fortifications, and ringed the village with a three-kilometer
barbed-wire fence, effectively re-annexing Arnoun into the
occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the self-styled security zone in 1985 with the
claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since been spearheading a
guerrilla war to drive the Israeli occupation troops and SLA out
of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel's re-capture of Arnoun, where there are only 70
remaining residents, mostly the elderly and children, provoked
strong reaction from Lebanon. Prime Minister Salim Hoss appealed
to the U.N., the U.S. and France to intervene against Israel's
expansion of its occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government has filed a complaint to the
five-nation monitoring committee, which consists of
representatives from U.S., France, Syria, Israel and Lebanon,
demanding that the Jewish state return the village immediately.
</P>
<P>
But, the committee has so far failed to reach an agreement on
whether Israel's occupation of Arnoun constituted a violation of a
1996 cease-fire understanding.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered truce pact after a 16-day Israeli blitz on
Lebanon in April, 1996, prohibits Israel and Hezbollah from
launching any attacks on civilian targets or from civilian areas
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Israel has reportedly offered to Lebanon through the U.S. that
it will withdraw from Arnoun on the condition that Lebanese army
must be deployed into the village.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud flatly rejected the offer,
saying he will never to let the Lebanese army serve as a guard of
occupation.
</P>
<P>
"(Israeli Prime Minister) Benjamin Netanyahu is trying to drag
Lebanon into security arrangements for the entire occupied zone,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Israel suggested that if Beirut agreed with
negotiated security arrangements, it would withdraw from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its ally Syria rejected the proposal, asking the
Jewish state to leave the country unconditionally in line with
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said Lebanon was not willing to throw its army into a
direct confrontation with the Israeli enemy in Arnoun because that
will involve risks Lebanon can not take.
</P>
<P>
When Lebanon's diplomatic efforts seem to lose its momentum,
Lebanese students are considering to stage another mass march in
the village to repeat their February feat.
</P>
<P>
But, Israel has warned that any civil actions will "be met with
a very firm response."

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Russia to Discuss Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Tuesday that his upcoming talks with Russian
counterpart Igor Ivanov will tackle the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov is scheduled to arrive in Cairo on Friday for a working
visit as part of a regional tour, which will also take him to
Syria, Lebanon, the Palestinian self-rule areas and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that they will discuss the Palestinian
plan to declare an independent state and the stalemate in the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat previously announced that he
would declare an independent Palestinian state on May 4 when the
five-year Palestinian interim autonomy enshrined in the Oslo
Accord signed with Israel in 1993 expires.
</P>
<P>
But many countries have advised Arafat to put off the plan so
as to avoid further complicating the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a Russian initiative calling for postponement of
the Palestinian plan for six months, Moussa said that he will
listen to the Russian view in this regard.
</P>
<P>
He added the talks will also dwell on the ongoing airstrikes
against Yugoslavia launched by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization on March 24.
</P>
<P>
NATO unleashed an intensive campaign to punish Belgrade's
refusal to accept an agreement with independence-seeking Kosovo
Albanians which will allow NATO troops into the Serbian province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed confidence that Russia could play a vital
political role in helping solve the Kosovo issue in the light of
its distinguished relations with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the importance of the international efforts to
seek a solution to the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Study: Broad Beans Might Help Prevent Bowel Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Broad bean might help protect
against bowel cancer, the second most common cause of deaths for
cancer in the developed world, British scientists said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Hammersmith Hospital and the Imperial College
of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, found that a
substance contained in broad bean was able to halt or even reverse
the bowel cancer process.
</P>
<P>
Their study, published in the British journal Gut, has assessed
the effects of dietary lectins on the behavior of cancer cells in
the colon.
</P>
<P>
Lectins, the proteins found in many plant foods including broad
beans, can attach themselves to carbohydrate molecules, which are
then absorbed by the cells lining the bowel during digestion.
</P>
<P>
The new findings showed that broad bean and mushroom lectins
were able to increase differentiations in cancer cells, indicating
that the cancer process was either halted or reversed.
</P>
<P>
The lectins also seemed to inhibit cell multiplication, another
hallmark of cancer cells, the researchers discovered.
</P>
<P>
"It is well known that diets high in fruits and vegetables
protect against many types of cancer, including bowel cancer. The
lectin effect may be one of the reasons why," said Professor
Calam, who led the research.

them are at extra risk of developing leukaemia, British scientists
suggested Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A report published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community
Health showed that coastal areas in Britain, where there is a lot
of boating activity, have a higher number of leukaemia cases than
other regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
The study, carried out by the Institute of Public Health at
Cambridge University, is similar to those of earlier studies which
showed that people who live near river estuaries were more prone
to develop leukaemia.
</P>
<P>
But unlike the previous research which attributed the cancers
to heavy metals found in the estuaries, the Cambridge team
believed that the level of maritime activity might be to blame.
</P>
<P>
Boat building and repair are important sources of employment in
the coastal regions in Britain for both recreational and
occupational purposes, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
"Such activity would involve potential exposure to resins,
solvents and petroleum products, all of which have been linked to
the development of acute leukaemia," they wrote in the report.

<HEADLINE> IMF Predicts 2.3 percent Growth Rate for World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) predicted a 2.3 percent growth rate for the world
economy this year and 3.4 percent for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Since the end of 1998 some significant positive developments
in the world economy have been broadly balanced by some important
setbacks, so that the global outlook is little changed," said the
latest "World Economic Outlook" (WEO) which was issued by the IMF
here Tuesday. The world economic growth rate stood at 2.5 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the IMF sees the prospects for a recovery in Asia and
some limits on growth-dampening damage from other regional
contagion effects, although the balance of global economic risks
still appears to be tilted toward the downside.
</P>
<P>
"After the deep output contractions in Asia's crisis-afflicted
economies, activity has recently turned around in Korea and seems
to have bottomed out in Malaysia and Thailand," the IMF said in
the WEO, which was released in advance of its annual spring
meetings.
</P>
<P>
On the positive side of the world economy, the IMF said,
"Investor sentiment toward many emerging market economies has
rallied. Conditions in Mature financial markets also have
improved."
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the euro has proceeded smoothly," the IMF
said. "Most of the advanced economies of North America and Europe,
and also Australia, have proved resilient to the crisis in
emerging markets. Particularly notable has been the continued
strong growth of the U.S. economy."
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, inflation has generally remained subdued, the IMF
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IMF expressed its concerns over the setbacks
affecting the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The crisis in Brazil has imparted a new contractionary impulse
to the global economy while the financial sector fragilities in
several emerging market economies add to the risks of continued
turbulence, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, the delay in adopting coherent policies to promote
stabilization and reform has postponed improvements.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economy remains weak, and resumption of self-sustaining
growth is not yet clearly in sight, said the IMF, adding that
global trade imbalance may give rise to destabilizing movements in
exchange rates and may also increase protectionist pressures.
</P>
<P>
The IMF predicted that the growth rate for advanced countries
will be 2.0 percent in 1999 and for the developing countries 3.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
For the United States, the IMF predicted that its growth will
slow down from last year's 3.9 percent rate to 3.3 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
Japan's economic growth rate will be minus 1.4 percent this
year, the IMF said.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Government Summarizes One-Year Rule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Prime Minister Radu
Vasile hoped that the country will register the first signs of its
renewal at the dawn of a new millennium.
</P>
<P>
According to the national Rompres news agency, Vasile expressed
his hope in the governent's White Book -- one year of rule --
issued Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Radu Vasile stressed at the beginning of the
volume, "The present Government will stay firm as concerns the
continuation of the structural reform, even though it affects its
popularity."
</P>
<P>
"Our bad lack is that we are forced to take harsh measures,
compulsory for the rehabilitation of the economy, under extremely
unfavorable international circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
The volume counts six chapters, the first of them presenting
several points of the government's program in 1998-2000 and the
program of priority measures in 1998, presented by the prime
minister when he took office in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
The other chapters cover the macro-economic policy, policies of
economy restructuring, social policy, policies of the reform civil
society and other fields of national interest, and foreign policy.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Invent Smart Antenna for Mobile Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Britain's Surrey
University have invented a smart antenna which can boost mobile
phone's coverage and cut its radiation.
</P>
<P>
The antenna, developed by the university's Center for
Communication Systems Research, "could be in use by 2002 in the
next generation of mobile phones," Surrey University said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The new invention consists of four antennas twisted around each
other to form a helix, together with some smart circuitry, which
senses the signals received and combines them for best results.
</P>
<P>
It permits reception inside buildings where signals are too
weak to be picked up by standard antennas.
</P>
<P>
In tests, the antenna was also found to reduce the power
necessary to achieve a given signal quality by approximately 10
times, depending on the configuration of buildings and trees
around the user.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the new invention, in the future global coverage can
be provided by both terrestrial and satellite mobile systems using
a single antenna, the researchers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Trade Deficit Hits New High in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit jumped
to a record 19.4 billion U.S. dollars in February as the global
financial crisis depressed U.S. exports for a fourth straight
month and booming consumer demand pushed imports to an all-time
high, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
February's deficit was 15.6 percent higher than the previous
record of 16.8 billion dollars set in January.
</P>
<P>
In February, U.S. exports edged down 0.6 percent to 76.6
billion dollars, led by a loss of 927 million dollars in sales of
commercial aircraft. Imports increased 2.3 percent to an all-time
high of 96 billion dollars as demand for foreign cars, clothing,
toys, televisions and stereos soared.
</P>
<P>
With back-to-back records, the trade deficit so far this year
is running at an annual rate of 215 billion dollars, far
surpassing last year's all-time high of 169 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect the U.S. trade deficit to continue rising as
long as the U.S. economy remains strong and many of America's
major export markets remain in recessions caused by the steep
plunge in financial markets that began in Asia in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country's trade deficit in goods area increased to a record
26.2 billion dollars, which was partly offset by the record
surplus of 6.7 billion dollars in services.
</P>
<P>
For February, the deficit with Japan shot up 13.1 percent to
5.3 billion dollars from 4.7 billion dollars in January, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
America's deficit with Mexico climbed to a record 1.8 billion
dollars in February as imports outpaced an increase in U.S.
exports to Mexico. The deficit with Canada fell to 2.4 billion
dollars from 2.5 billion dollars in January. The gap with Western
Europe rose to 2.2 billion dollars in February from 1.4 billion
dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. surplus with South and Central America narrowed to 316
million dollars in February from 671 million dollars in January.
The U.S. exports to Brazil, which became the latest victim of the
global currency turmoil in January, dropped to 910 million dollars
in February, the lowest level since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition to commercial aircraft, manufactured exports of
telecommunications equipment and electric generators also dropped
in February. Farm exports dropped 130 million dollars to 3.6
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the import side, foreign shipments of autos and automotive
parts rose to a record 14.6 billion dollars, up 710 million
dollars for the month. Other increases included computer
accessories, up 449 million dollars; clothing, up 202 million
dollars; toys, up 156 million dollars; and televisions and VCRs,
up 150 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Meligeni Beats Henman; Becker Quits for His father's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- British No. 1 Tim Henman failed to
enter the second round at the Monte Carlo Open Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Fernando Meligeni won the match 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 7-5
in two hours, 38 minutes over Henman.
</P>
<P>
Henman, the top British player and the No. 3 seed, missed his
big opportunity when he was leading 5-4 in the final set, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
A day after his victory over French No. 1 Cedric Pioline, Boris
Becker withdrew from the event after the death of his father, Karl-
Heinz, from stomach cancer.
</P>
<P>
"I am very, very sad. I admired my father and I owe him a lot,"
the 31-year-old German said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"In this difficult situation I have to and want to be close to
my family. Especially my mother needs me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Becker was due to play Frenchman Jerome Golmard in the second
round of the event.
</P>
<P>
In early play Tuesday, three-time Monte Carlo champion Thomas
Muster downed No. 16 seed Thomas Johansson 6-3, 6-4, in a first-
round match.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Austrian, a winner of a record 40 titles on
clay, stormed to a 5-1 lead in the second set.
</P>
<P>
But Johansson pulled back to 4-5 and Muster had to cling on to
victory.
</P>
<P>
Key Biscayne finalist Sebastien Grosjean advanced to the second
round with a convincing 6-4, 6-0 win against Argentine qualifier
Sebastian Prieto.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman will play No. 14 seed Tommy Haas in one of the
highlights of the second round.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay's Ramon Delgado, who beat Pete Sampras at last year's
French Open, defeated experienced Swede Jonas Bjorkman, 7-6 (7-5),
0-6, 6-4, to set up a second-round contest with No. 5 seed Mark
Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
No. 10 seed Albert Costa and No. 12 seed Thomas Enqvist beat
Mariano Zabaleta and Dominik Hrbaty respectively, moving into the

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Syria Combat Illegal Immigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus and Syria have signed a
memorandum aimed at combating illegal immigration, Cypriot
Interior Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said Tuesday on his
return from Syria.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said the Syrian government will take back Syrian
citizens who illegally arrive in Cypriot ports and illegal Syrian
workers who came to Cyprus in the capacity of tourists.
</P>
<P>
Damascus will also take back nationals of third countries, who
leave Syria's ports or airports and arrive in Cyprus illegally, or
whose last visas were issued by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said that all the circumstances apply to Cypriot
nationals who enter Syria illegally.
</P>
<P>
He said the Syrian government has provided that only
businessmen, people with scientific specializations, students and
Syrians belonging to high income groups will be allowed to visit
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou said that the work permits for some 1,500 Syrians
living in Cyprus had expired by the end of 1998 and dozens more
are estimated working illegally in the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the total number of illegal immigrants of
different nationalities in Cyprus, he said "they are estimated at
3,000 to 5,000."

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Crisis Top on Agenda of NATO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- NATO's bombing in Yugoslavia
has changed the schedule of its summit which is due to be held
here this weekend and the crisis will be focused at the meeting,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Albright told a special White House briefing that NATO's
bombing "will continue until this crisis ends on just and durable
terms."
</P>
<P>
She reiterated that Yugoslavia must stop military operations,
withdraw forces from Kosovo, allow all refugees to return and
permit the deployment of an international security presence.
</P>
<P>
As NATO's bombing failed after it lasted one month, the
summit to commemorate the alliance's 50th anniversary has been
clouded by the crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, Albright said that NATO leaders will talk about the
alliance's expansion and revise its strategic concept.
</P>
<P>
"The summit schedule includes consultations with the leaders of
those nations through the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. And
NATO will welcome new members and affirm that the door to the
alliance remains open," she added.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will announce a practical plan to help potential
new members meet NATO's high standards. The summit will be
attended by leaders from 19 NATO members and NATO's 25 so-called
partners.
</P>
<P>
NATO, or the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), decided
to accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic last year. The
three countries will sign protocols to formally join the alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Our leaders will unveil a revised strategic concept for the
alliance and will take into account the new missions it may need
to undertake or, as in Kosovo and Bosnia, is already performing,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
"The summit will also commit NATO to developing military forces
that can perform the full spectrum of alliance missions, and we
will support the strengthening of the European pillar of our
alliance to help build a Europe more able to act effectively,
while maintaining its strong links to NATO," Albright said.

Mwenze Kongolo, a special envoy sent by DRC President Kabila to
Zimbabwe told the Zimbabwe News Agency in Harare that Kagame was
invited to Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo briefed Robert Mugabe on the deal and that a meeting
was being organized for Lusaka, Zambia, where the deal could be
worked further by all countries involved in the conflict in DRC.
</P>
<P>
"There is also another meeting in Italy on April 30 where the
deal will be finalized," said Kongolo.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said Zimbabwe had been
aware of the signing which took the whole world by surprise as its
preparations were secretive, true to Gaddafi's style of scheming.
</P>
<P>
"President Mugabe is very happy because this is what we have
always wanted. He emphasized that it will be appropriate to have
a summit before the deal can be implemented by officials," said
Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
Kognolo did not have information from the war front but he and
Mudenge agreed that nothing was expected to change until the deal
is implemented.
</P>
<P>
Kongolo was also scheduled to travel to Namibia and Zambia on
the same mission.

<HEADLINE> Africa Ranks First in Refugee Origin Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Africa, which takes six of
the 10 major refugee countries of origin in the world, tops the
number of refugee origin countries in the world, according to the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The top six African refugee countries of origin are: Sierra
Leone 440, 000, Somalia 419,000, Sudan 374,000, Eritrea 320,000,
Burundi 300,000 and Angola 255,000.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said, the top four refugee hosting countries in Africa
are Guinea 470, 000, Sudan 390,000, Tanzania 330,000 and Ethiopia
317,000.
</P>
<P>
However, the top two refugee hosting countries worldwide are
Iran 1,980, 000 and Pakistan 1,200,000.
</P>
<P>
There were 7.2 million people covered by UNHCR in Africa, out
of an estimated 22.3 million worldwide, as of January 1998, UNHCR
said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics provided recently by the UNHCR, the
Africa figure includes 3.5 million refugees, 1.5 million
internally displaced and 2.2 million former refugees who have
recently returned home.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Social Funds to Be Developmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Social funds, often taken as
emergency funds, will yield better results if they are used by
development organizations with long term objectives, a World Bank
representative said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Azedine Ouerghi of the World Bank told participants to the
four-day African Social Investment Funds Network seminar in Harare
that social funds were perceived in some circles as responding to
crisis situations only.
</P>
<P>
"The effectiveness of social funds is realized by ability to
motivate developing social infrastructure and giving support to
the private sector," he said, adding that a long term objective
had to be in place.
</P>
<P>
He noted that recommendations were made at the International
Conference of Social Funds held in Washington two years ago.
</P>
<P>
They included the need to seek integration of social
development within the national macro-economic policies and
strategies for the reduction of poverty.
</P>
<P>
It was important for social funds, he said, to systematically
measure their innovations, capacity building and techniques
throughout the public sector.
</P>
<P>
Participants of this meeting were from Lesotho, Zimbabwe,
Zambia, Malawi and some European countries.
</P>
<P>
The seminar aims to bring together stakeholders in Social
Investment Funds to discuss how Social Funds can be used
productively for poverty alleviation.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States cannot be the
world's policeman nor can they serve as mercenaries for nations
which refuse to assume their military responsibilities, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before being present at the joint meeting of the Lower House
foreign affairs and defense committees, Dini said that the
European Union had to "give itself a political personality for the
areas where it is most lacking: diplomacy and defense."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot always leave it up to the United States to intervene
to defend our interests and to continue to maintain peace on the
Old Continent through its old outposts," he added.
</P>
<P>
Looking at the European Union, Dini observed that the war in
Kosovo "has all at once shown how fragile a house which is just
built on the economy and a united currency, and never more than
today has there been a need for a united Europe."
</P>
<P>
Dini explained that in the Kosovo crisis Italy had always "done
its duty and fulfilled its commitments to the Alliance, but this
does not mean Italy can ignore the voices of its conscience and
reason."

<HEADLINE> EBRD Calls on East Europe to Speed up Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) ended its eighth annual
meeting here on Tuesday with a call for Eastern Europe to
accelerate the pace of economic reform, despite the twin crises of
Russia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
EBRD President Horst Koehler told ministers and central bankers
there could be no turning back, saying "There must be no wavering
or backtracking in reforms and what is needed now is
acceleration."
</P>
<P>
Russia's financial meltdown pitched the region into an
unexpected economic decline last year with aggregate output in
the EBRD's 26 countries of operation sliding 1.3 percent. Now
conflict in Kosovo threatens to destabilize economies in the
Balkans and beyond.
</P>
<P>
"1999 will be a further difficult and challenging year,"
Koehler said in a closing statement.
</P>
<P>
Koehler said the bank remained committed to Russia but future
lending would depend on Moscow taking "decisive and credible
actions to take the reforms forward and improve the investment
climate".
</P>
<P>
Russian first Deputy Finance Minister and chief debt
negotiator, Mikhail Kasyanov, referring to the aftershocks of
Russia's financial collapse last August, said on Tuesday the
country would not be able to repay 1.6 billion U.S. dollars in
bond principal and interest due in May.
</P>
<P>
The non-payment raises the prospect of domino-style
cross-default on a program of 11 billion dollars of Russian
dollar-denominated debt.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to find the way, the understanding with
creditors how to address this problem," Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo crisis overshadowed the meeting, with Albania
appealing for some 800 million dollars to cope with a tide of
refugees and other countries close to Yugoslavia hastily revising
downwards their growth projections.
</P>
<P>
Koehler said the EBRD was prepared to take on further projects
in the Balkans within the limits of its mandate. On the sidelines
of the annual meeting, international financial institutions
including the EBRD, IMF, World Bank and the U.S. Treasury met to
discuss ways to coordinate future Balkan aid.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Keen on Sustaining Human Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid said Tuesday that the pan-Arab organization is keen
on sustaining the human development effort it started nearly two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid made the remark in a speech to the 15th Arab
annual conference opened here Tuesday on the development of human
resources. Daw Sweidan, Abdel-Meguid's assistant, read the speech
on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
The league chief underlined the importance of providing Arabs
with quality education and good health in an effort to help
promote the human development drive.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the Arab countries endorsed a strategy for joint Arab
economic action and attached special importance to the problem of
Arab housing as a pillar of the human development process.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, held under the auspices of the Arab
League in cooperation with Egypt's Ministry of Higher Education,
will seek solution to the problems facing the development of human
resources in the Arab countries, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It will discuss the non-governmental organizations' role in
enhancing the human development process and the strategy that they
could come up with in this respect.
</P>
<P>
It will probe the possibility that international and regional
funding institutions may play a role in boosting human development
activities, with an emphasis on the private sector and
businessmen.

<HEADLINE> IMF Speaks Highly of China's Fiscal Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Tuesday spoke highly of the active fiscal policy taken
by the Chinese government in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The fiscal stimulus supplied by the Chinese government last
year and this year has been very substantial," said Michael Mussa,
IMF Economic Counselor and Director of Research Department, at a
press conference in advance of the IMF annual Spring meetings.
</P>
<P>
He said because of its strong policy stimulus and significant
easing of monetary policy, China was able to sustain nearly
eight percent growth rate when the rest of Asia was encountering
"severe difficulties".
</P>
<P>
"That was very important positive contribution of Chinese
economic policy not only to China but also to avoiding a deep
downturn in the rest of Asia," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform process in China has not stopped by any
means and important steps have been taken to restructure the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, in its latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), said
that growth appears to have been well-maintained in 1998 in
China, helped by large increases in public investment outlays
and cautious reductions in interest rates, but a moderate
further slowing is projected for 1999.
</P>
<P>
The current account remains in significant surplus, and
China's external vulnerability is limited also by its very large
foreign exchange reserves, moderate foreign debt, and
regulations of capital movements, said the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"These factors, together with the recent strengthening of
regional currencies, have helped maintain the stability of the
Renminbi against the U.S. dollar, and this is making an
important contribution to the restoration of financial stability
in the Asian region," it said.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Move Faster to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba Tuesday urged the African countries to move faster to
solve the eight-month conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
Chiluba called for a quick process toward peace in the vast
central African country when meeting Albert Allen Peters, visiting
regional director for the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees (UNHCR ), at the State House.
</P>
<P>
The president said that African countries need to move faster
and find a lasting solution to the conflict because they have very
little resources.
</P>
<P>
Africa would gain nothing by prolonging the conflicts in the
continent, he pointed out, adding that Zambia appreciates the
efforts made by other countries to find a lasting solution to the
conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba noted that there is need for a coordinated approach so
that peace can be restored in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that a cease-fire would be signed soon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chiluba appealed for support from the international
community to help Zambia tackle the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 20,000 refugees have flooded into
Zambia, fleeing the conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
With Europe's involvement in Kosovo, very little attention
would be paid to the conflicts in Africa by the international
community, the Zambian president added.
</P>
<P>
Peters assured the president that the UNHCR would do everything
possible to help Zambia look after the refugees.
</P>
<P>
Peters also called for the resolving of conflicts in Africa if
the problem of refugees is to be eradicated.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) is to deploy observer missions to its member
states holding elections this year to assist in the conduct of
free, fair and transparent elections.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released here Tuesday by the regional
organization, the first two observer missions would go to Malawi
and South Africa this month to monitor elections in the two
countries to be held on May 25 and June 2 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The observer missions selected from representatives of SADC
members and the civil society would be used as a capacity-building
mechanism for electoral commissions in the countries holding
elections, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that other missions would be deployed in Mozambique,
Botswana and Namibia in time for elections this year.
</P>
<P>
Electoral experts from different SADC countries were also
helping the South African independent electoral commission to
prepare for the 1999 elections as part of a program to strengthen
the electoral administration capacity of the electoral commissions
within the SADC.

<HEADLINE> War-Hit Balkan Nations Complain at EBRD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The annual meeting of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has heard a chorus
of Eastern European countries pleading for international help to
weather the fallout from the conflict in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, which ended here on Tuesday, has been
overshadowed by the mounting cost of the Kosovo crisis on some of
Europe's most fragile economies.
</P>
<P>
Country after country came up with their different stories on
how hard the Kosovo crisis is biting in strained resources, lost
exports and faltering investment.
</P>
<P>
Neven Tomic, vice-chairman of Bosnia's Council of Ministers,
told bankers and potential investors the country was struggling to
cope with 40,000 refugees, sheltered in transit centres set up to
help resettle hundreds of thousands of displaced Bosnians.
</P>
<P>
"This year had been a year of return for our own refugees. Now
we have a new wave of refugees," he said. "We hope the
international community will support Bosnia and Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
Tomic said it was too early to put hard figures on the economic
impact on Bosnia, but the balance of payments would certainly be
hard hit as exports to Yugoslavia were blocked.
</P>
<P>
Albania said it needed more than 800 million U.S. dollars to
cope with an estimated 365,000 refugees, who have swollen its
population by 10 to 15 percent. Economic growth was likely to slow
to five or six percent in 1999 against an original eight percent
target.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia, also flooded by refugees, said its mainly
agricultural exports were piling up unsold as the key transport
route across Yugoslavia was cut off.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Bozhkov said the
country was losing 1.0-1.5 million dollars a day in exports.
Foreign direct investment was likely to be less than half the $1.0
billion envisioned for 1999 and GDP growth would fall short of the
forecast of 3.7-4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's economy may shrink as much as one percent this year
as a result of the drop in tourism revenues, which could also
widen the current account deficit by 450-500 million dollars,
National Bank Governor Marko Skreb said.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Finance Minister Zsigmond Jarai said growth in 1999
might fall below the government's four percent target if the
conflict persisted, although its impact was limited so far
</P>
<P>
Officials from the EBRD, the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, the International Finance Corp, the European
Commission, the U.S. Treasury, the European Investment Bank and
the Council of Europe's Social Development Fund met on Sunday on
the EBRD sidelines to swap notes on the region's likely needs,
according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
EBRD President Horst Koehler said on Tuesday the bank was
preparing to join the international effort, drawing on its
experience with both infrastructure projects and small business.
</P>
<P>
"We already have some access to the region and some experience
there, and we do think this experience is helpful in this
particularly difficult situation," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But amid the calls for foreign aid, some countries showed how
outsiders can sometimes be more of a hindrance than a help. Tomic
said foreign-funded projects in Bosnia were grinding to a halt
because officials were cancelling flights to the country as a
result of NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
And Macedonia's ambassador to Britain, Stevo Crvenkovski, said
some aid agencies were flying in extra food for refugees while
local produce went to waste.
</P>
<P>
"We have an enormous surplus of food, yet sometimes Skopje
airport is virtually blocked by flights bringing in supplies," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Military Team to Escort S. Leone Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. military team flew from
Freetown of Sierra Leone to Monrovia of Liberia Tuesday to escort
rebel leaders of Sierra Leone for peace talks, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a U.N. statement as saying that a 14-member
delegation of the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) will be
travelling to Monrovia from Sierra Leone and as soon as they
arrive in Monrovia they would be put on board a U.N. aircraft and
flown off to Togo.
</P>
<P>
The rebel delegation was reported to include RUF battlefield
commander Sam Bockarie and Jonny Paul Koroma who led a military
junta which ruled the country from May 1997 to February 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. statement, the Liberian government, which
has close ties with the Sierra Leone rebels, is providing an
escort for the RUF members from wherever they are arriving from
inside Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The rebel leaders are due to meet their jailed leader, Foday
Sankoh who was flown from prison in Freetown to Togolese capital
Lome Sunday, for consultations intended to lead to peace talks
with the Sierra Leone government on ending the prolonged conflict
in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are expected to be held in Kara, the birth
place of President Gnassingbe Eyadema, current chairman of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who is to host
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Attorney-General Solomon Berewa was quoted as
saying that the peace talks between the government and the rebels
will begin this week and the government is ready and waiting to go
to Togo.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Tejan Kabbah came under pressure from
donors and regional allies to make peace after the RUF and its
allies invaded the capital of Freetown last January.
</P>
<P>
The need for peace talks became more urgent after Nigeria, the
backbone of the West African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG
supporting the Kabbah government, has already announced it would
withdraw its troops from Sierra Leone later this year.
</P>
<P>
In a separate development, Libyan Deputy Foreign Minister Ali
Triki has arrived in Togolese capital of Lome to take part in the
forthcoming peace talks to try to end the nine-year war in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor, a former rebel leader who
has historic links to both Libya and the Sierra Leone arrived on
Sunday in Libya which has close contacts with both sides in the
Sierra Leone conflict.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials, Togolese government ministers and ECOWAS
chairman are currently engaged in intense negotiations in Lome to
bring the two sides in the civil war together.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Gives Alert on Israeli Flower Seeds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Agricultural Research
Institute Tuesday issued an alert to flower growers over rose
stocks from Israel, saying that they may be infected with an agro
bacterium disease.
</P>
<P>
Director of the institute Cyrus Ndiritu confirmed that the
disease, which causes potato-like tumors on the roots and stems
which gradually strangle their output, has threatened to wipe out
flowers in about 20 local farms in east and central Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these rose stocks originated from Havered Beit Shearim
 Nurseries of Israel," said Ndiritu.
</P>
<P>
The financial damage is estimated at one billion shillings
(about 15.6 million U.S. dollars) in terms of investment in green
houses, chemicals, fertilizer, income from sales in Europe and
fees paid for the rose stocks.
</P>
<P>
Ndiritu warned that there could be more unsuspecting growers
who have had the disease introduced through continued imports of
the rose stocks.
</P>
<P>
The director revealed that the disease, which reduces the life
span of the infected roses from seven years to two, was first
detected in Kenya in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Flower exports earn Kenya over five billion shillings (about 78
million dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that rose exports of the east African
country rose from 1,000 tons in 1990 to 18,000 tons in 1994
compared with its major rival Israel's slow climb from 19, 000 to
25,000 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Kenya now is ranked the third in supply of roses to the Dutch
flower auctions, only after the Netherlands and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Official: NATO Bombing May Lead Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The NATO's bombing in
Yugoslavia could lead to a confrontation between the United States
and Russia, a Russian parliament official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Arbatov, deputy head of the Russian parliament's defense
affairs committee said the conflict in the Balkans is the "worst,
most acute, dangerous crisis since the early 1960s" when the U.S.
and Russia involved missile crisis in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) holds 50th
anniversary celebrations this weekend in Washington. Moscow will
be unlikely to attend the meeting although it was invited.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Atlantic Council, Arbatov said the longer NATO
continues bombing, the more pressure will mount on Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to intervene by providing arms and
volunteer fighters to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"If the bombing campaign continues, and if ground operations
start, then the flood of (Russian) volunteers to Yugoslavia to
fight would reach tens of thousands," Arbatov said.
</P>
<P>
"Fatalities would be horrifying, and Russia would be drawn into
war," he added.
</P>
<P>
The anti-NATO and anti-American sentiments have mounted in
Russia to unprecedented levels since the bombing began, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the allied bombing campaign has failed, but it has put
relations between Moscow and Washington into a deep freeze.
</P>
<P>
The bombing has killed the START II treaty, he said. "The
partnership between NATO and Russia is frozen, potential
cooperation on ballistic missile defenses is not a subject of
serious debate and willingness to cooperate on nonproliferation
(of mass-destruction weapons) is as low as it has ever been."
</P>
<P>
The Senate has ratified START II, a nuclear arms reduction
treaty, but the Russian Duma has delayed action repeatedly.

leave open the option of sending a ground force into Kosovo if
NATO's airstrikes against Yugoslavia fail in its aim of forcing
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to bend down to the Western
alliance's demands.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we keep updated all the assessments we have for all
the good range of options that we may have. All options are open,
but at this point the strategy that we have is to maintain the air
campaign with determination," said the chief of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Solana said NATO's demands remained that Milosevic pull his
forces out of Kosovo and let in foreign troops to help ethnic
Albanian refugees return home and feel safe, and that agree to a
peace deal based on the Rambouillet accord he refused to sign.
</P>
<P>
More and more British politicians said in recent days that it
was impossible for Milosevic to sign on the Rambouillet agreement
and that NATO should stop bombing firstly to form a base for
political negotiation to end the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Budget Pushes UK Inflation Above Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Britain rose above
the Government's target in March as the effects of the budget
kicked in, according to official figures released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said underlying inflation in
March was 2.7 percent compared to 2.4 percent the previous month,
breaching the Government's 2.5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
The rise, due to Budget increases in tobacco, petrol and
vehicle excise duties, had been expected and it is thought the
rate will fall back again next month.
</P>
<P>
However, it is believed here the rise could still deter the
Bank of England from cutting interest rates again from their
current level of 5.25 percent when it meets early next month.
</P>
<P>
Shadow Chancellor Francis Maude said: "These Budget tax rises
will mean that interest rates could now be higher for longer than
they would otherwise have been."
</P>
<P>
Some economic analysts said the underlying inflation in March
should not stop the Bank of England cutting interest rates one
more time.

So far, no serious epidemic diseases have broken out in Jilin
or Heilongjiang provinces or in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region, the sites of last year's serious flooding and infectious
diseases have been brought under control.

However, the incidence of certain infectious diseases like
dysentery is climbing and there could be breakouts of some
diseases, doctors warn.
</P>
<P>
The prevention tasks are still serious and the many dead animal
carcasses that froze last year are a big health threat, he said,
asking local governments to take steps as soon as possible to deal
with these carcasses.
</P>
<P>
Li warned that regional officials in charge of the work will be
dealt with seriously if big problems occur and he asked local

<HEADLINE> Zou Jiahua Stresses Protection of Land Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China must adopt a scientific and
economical policy to protect the land resources and ecological
environment, said Zou Jiahua, vice-chairman of the National
People's Congress Standing Committee, here before the World Earth
Day on April 22.
</P>
<P>
Zou told a symposium that the basic state policies of
population, resources and environment have great bearings on the
development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
China's world leading population, insufficient per capita
resources and deteriorating environment have become the pressing
issues restricting the social and economic developments, said Zou.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the exploitation of natural resources should
be in a proper way, with the long-term interests taken into
consideration.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the state has required local governments to
protect the arable land, solve the problem of lack of water and
control environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration of environment must be basically controlled
by 2010, and the air quality in large cities must be greatly
improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that geological disasters have brought large damages
to social and economic developments in some areas in recent years.
Efforts should be made to cut the losses resulted from geological
disasters by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than half of the geological disasters
are the result of human activities. Scientific research and
technological development should be strengthened to protect the
geological environment, said Zou.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Outlines Plan to Fight Food Insecurity, Malnutrition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian government outlined
its Action Plan Wednesday to fight the food insecurity and
malnutrition in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia held its first National Seminar on Food Security and
Nutrition on Tuesday and Wednesday to address the very crucial
issues facing the government and to draw up the plan to overcome
them.
</P>
<P>
The food security seminar, which concluded Wednesday with
recommendations for action, was presided over by Prime Minister
Hun Sen and attended by representatives from government
ministries, universities and some national and international
agencies, including the World Food Program and the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen stressed at the seminar that it is the basic human
right to have enough food to eat.
</P>
<P>
"Despite a surplus in rice production over the past years, a
majority of the Cambodian people still faces food insecurity and
malnutrition," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies revealed that nearly four out of ten Cambodians
are living below the poverty line and more than 55 percent of
Cambodian children under age five show signs of severe
malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The causes of food insecurity and malnutrition are manifold,
but the most important causes in Cambodia, Hun Sen maintained,
were poverty and lack of purchasing power, rapid population
growth, insecure land title, low basic education and lack of
adequate health services.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce poverty and improve the welfare of the
people, the government will give high priority to the development
of the agricultural sector as well as health and education
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen stressed that the development of the agricultural
sector will ensure food security and achieve growth in other
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The royal government has planed to invest 150 million U.S.
dollars in the agricultural sector in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the government also planed to improve irrigation
systems, reform the land-titling system to give more families land
to farm and encourage small loans to help families start
businesses and increase their income.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he called for giving high priority to education
through propaganda to let families know that children need not
only rice and meat, but vegetables and a varied diet.

<HEADLINE> Bugalski Takes Catalunya Rally in Two-wheel Drive Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippe Bugalski of France with
his two-wheel drive Citroen won over the powerful four-wheel drive
machinery of his major rivals in the Catalunya Rally on Wednesday
in Lloret Dd Mar, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Bugalski's time was 31.8 seconds faster than his compatriot
Didier Auriol as he won two of the final three stages to take full
advantage of technical regulations which favored his car in the
event, reports said reaching here.
</P>
<P>
But Auriol was unhappy with the rules which helped Bugalski to
his victory.
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy for Philippe and for Citroen," Auriol was
quoted as saying. "However, the rules are not fair and should be
changed. It is not right that people who are committed to the
sport should be penalised by those who are not."
</P>
<P>
Citroen are not taking part in the manufacturers championship
and are selecting specific races in which to enter.
</P>
<P>
They cannot take points off their manufacturer rivals but their
drivers earn the points for whichever position they finish in, in
effect depriving Auriol of winner's points.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, which allowed Bugalski's car to be 270 kg
lighter than his rivals and gave him a power-to-weight advantage,
helped him become the first-ever F2 winner of a world championship
rally.
</P>
<P>
Auriol, in a Toyota, won the final stage of the third leg but
was unable to make any headway on the overnight leader.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champion Tommi Makinen, driving a Mitsubishi,
maintained his lead in the championship by claiming third place.
</P>
<P>
The Finn won two of the day's five stages to move up from fifth
position overnight to finish more than two minutes behind Bugalski.
He leads the championship by three points.

SINGAPORE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The first Singapore's satellite
for non-commercial purpose was launched in Baikonur, Kazhakstan,
at 11 a.m. local time Wednesday, Singapore media reported.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, codenamed as UoSAT-12 which will allow studies to

<HEADLINE> Arafat Slams Netanyahu for Blocking Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat Wednesday slammed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
for blocking the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's failure to carry out the agreements signed with the
Palestinians drove the peace talks between the two sides to a
standstill, Arafat said at a press conference after meeting with
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Israel shelved in December the Wye peace accord, signed last
October in Washington, after implementing the first of the
three-phased withdrawal from another 13 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Tuesday evening after a tour to North
African Arab countries, stressed that realization of peace in the
Middle East is "an Israeli, Arab and international demand as much
as a Palestinian one."
</P>
<P>
He said that he will brief the Palestinian Central Council next
Tuesday on the outcome of his recent global tour aimed at drumming
up international support for a his plan to declare Palestinian
state.
</P>

He has traveled to influential countries in the world to rally

<P>
LUANDA, April 21 (Xinhua) --Angola needs at least 500 million
U.S. dollars to restore its power industry infrastructures ruined
in the civil war, a senior official has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the sub-committee of electricity of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Lius Filipe da
Silva, Minister of Energy, said that Angola is a country rich in
energy resources like water and oil, but the civil war has
destroyed most of the country's power facilities, with only 12
percent of its people have the access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
The average electricity consumption in the country is only
about 100 kwh per capita each year, only about one percent of its
hydro-power capacity, he said.
</P>
<P>
Silva urged SADC members to support Angola's legitimate
government to realize peace and stability in the southern African
country as soon as possible, saying that "any delay in the
development of my country would mean a delay in the region," the
Angola Daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC electricity sub-committee meeting is focusing on
searching ways of cooperation to tap the potential of personnel,
technical and natural resources, so as to boost the economical
development in the region.

<HEADLINE> Apache Helicopters Expected to Arrive in Tirana Wednesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RINAS AIRPORT, Tirana, April 21 (Xinhua) -- About 24 U.S.
Apache helicopters are expected to arrive at Tirana's Rinas
Airport at around 15:00 local time (1300 GMT) Wednesday from NATO
bases in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Reporters were told by U.S. Air Force Public Affairs Officer 1
st Lt. Gina Jackson that "anyone interested in seeing the Apaches
can come by 3 p.m. We were told by the Army that something would
happen by then or soon after that," she told reporters gathering
at the gate of the airport waiting for permission to enter.
</P>
<P>
The runway, which had been occupied by helicopters engaging in
humanitarian operations over the past few days, has been cleared
and U.S. military photographers and video cameramen were waiting
as were reporters from around the world.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military spokesman told reporters earlier Wednesday that
interviews might be conducted with Apache pilots, but they should
not be identified in any way for the sake of operational secrecy.
</P>
<P>
The heavily-armed helicopters are said to be one of the world's
effective weapons against armor.
</P>
<P>
The low-flying aircraft is being deployed to increase NATO's
ability to attack Yugoslav tanks in Kosovo which, along with other
parts of Yugoslavia, have been under attack by NATO since March 24.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said Monday that the helicopters, which are
vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire, would be operational in a week.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, the small airport in Tirana has been
equipped by the U.S. Army with lighting and an air traffic control
system for 24-hour operations.
</P>
<P>
A package of 2,500 U.S. troops, armored personnel carriers and
protective M39 ground-to-ground guided missiles and radar have
been installed at the air base.
</P>
<P>
Each Apache helicopter is armed with a 30 mm cannon, 70 mm
rockets and 16 Hellfire missiles.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the Apache helicopters would mean the first
direct involvement of U.S. Army forces in the Allied Force
operation and a step many see moving closer to sending ground
forces into Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Russia Boycotts NATO Birthday Celebration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Russia will shrug off NATO's 50th
birthday celebration this weekend in Washington due to the
alliance's airstrikes on Yugoslavia, President Boris Yeltsin
confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry statement said Yeltsin had decided Russia
could not be present at the gathering because of the "blatant
violation" of international charters perpetrated by NATO over
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"President Boris Yeltsin decided Russian representatives would
not take part in the sessions of the Russia-NATO Joint Permanent
Council and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council convened for the
anniversary summit of NATO in Washington on April 23-25," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The motives of this move are obvious. The military action of
NATO against a sovereign European nation -- Yugoslavia -- is a
blatant violation of the U.N. Charter" and other collective
security agreements, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Russia planned to attend the celebration a month ago, but the
alliance's bombing of Yugoslavia prompted Russian leaders to sever
ties with NATO.
</P>
<P>
"The military action of NATO has dealt a blow to the U.N.
system as a whole and to further cooperation in creating a new
collective security system in Europe," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In these circumstances, Russia has no choice but to freeze
relations with the North Atlantic bloc. We have no other choice.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to return to the times of the Cold War and do
not intend to get drawn into confrontation with the West. But
Russia will not encourage the arbitrariness of force by keeping
silent."

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Conflict Batters Romanian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo crisis has worsened
Romania's sluggish economy, which is a result of an international
embargo imposed on Yugoslavia years ago, the Rompres news agency
said Wednesday, citing a report by the Romanian Ministry of Trade
and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian metallurgical sector posted losses of about 30
million U.S. dollars, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
With a bilateral aviation collaboration program brought to a
halt, several Romanian firms have accrued losses of more than six
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Volume of exports carried on the River Danube will decrease
by a monthly average of five million U.S. dollars. Further losses
will reportedly accrue after railroads take over the
transportation of commodities, another five million U.S. dollars
in all.
</P>
<P>
According the report, the consumer goods industry racked up 10
million dollars in losses after deliveries to Yugoslavia were
brought to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of cement to Austria and Germany were also stopped,
and delay penalties have been claimed. Romania lost cash paid in
advance for commodities that cannot now be supplied, since its
Yugoslav producers were put out of business by NATO air raids.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Romanian-Yugoslav trade figure in
1998 came third in Romania's overall commercial relations with
Central and Eastern states, outperformed by trade with Hungary and
the Republic of Moldova.
</P>
<P>
Profits from business with Yugoslavia in 1998 were in excess of
179 million dollars, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Common metals contributd 32 percent of Romania's exports to
Yugoslavia, mineral products 26 percent, vehicles and transport
equipment over 14 percent. Its imports from this country include
primarily mineral products, 41 percent; chemical products, 17
percent; transport equipment, 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav investments in Romania totaled 17 million U.S. dollars
at the end of 1998, five times more than that of the previous year.
The figure placed Yugoslavia in the 29th position among foreign
investors in Romania.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines posted a budget
deficit of 33.463 billion pesos (836.6 million U.S. dollars) for
the first quarter 1999, 11 billion pesos (275 million U.S.
dollars) higher than programmed, a government report said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Bureau of Treasury (BT) said that for the first
three months this year, revenue collections amounted to only
105.122 billion pesos (2.63 billion U.S. dollars) as against
expenditures of 138.585 billion pesos (3.46 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total revenues collection, the Bureau of Internal
Revenue collected 75.968 billion pesos (1.90 billion U.S. dollars)
while the Bureau of Customs collected 16.939 billion pesos (423.48
million U.S. dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
The BT contributed 4.927 billion pesos (123.18 million U.S.
dollars) to the revenue intake while other government agencies
brought in an additional 7.288 billion pesos (182.2 million U.S.
dollars), the report said.
</P>
<P>
Due to this revenue collection performance, the government
would be forced either to cut its expenditures or resort to
borrowings to finance the deficit, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
If the government cuts its expenditures, however, its
pump-priming efforts would be curtailed, they said.

The first shipment of the 1999 model Vectras already arrived in
Shanghai earlier this month. GM China announced here today that
the cars will be available in various parts of China soon.
</P>
<P>
The Vectras are aimed at the growing private automotive market

become one of the most competitive brands of imported cars in
China this year.
</P>
<P>
GM already has a 1.5-billion-US-dollar joint venture plant in
Shanghai that produces Buick cars intended mainly for
institutional customers. In recent years, GM has been looking for
ways to start producing family cars in China.
</P>
<P>
The parts for the Vectra have been adapted to Chinese
conditions and emission controls. The cars were designed by Opel
and produced at an Opel plant in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
GM already showed the Vectra at China's annual international
automotive shows in 1997 and 1998. The Opel, GM's largest European
subsidiary, is one of the most popular cars in Europe.

<P>
After talks with Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze in
Tbilissi and Azerbaijan's Heydar Aliyev in Baku, Chernomyrdin
arrived in Kiev Tuesday and met with Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma twice to discuss the Yugoslav situation.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Kiev for Moscow, Chernomyrdin told the press
that Russia and the three republics had achieved a unified
approach to the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
The positions of Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Georgia on a peaceful
settlement coincided, he said, noting that Yugoslavia is
unseparable and refugees must return home.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Yugoslavia has reached an impasse and the
Kosovo crisis may escalate at any time, he said, adding that this
could not be allowed to happen.
</P>
<P>
Calling on both conflicting parties to compromise, Chernomyrdin
also believed efforts should be made to prevent NATO ground troops
from entering Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin also stressed the danger brought about by
separatism. Separatism exists in some 100 countries in the world
and following separatism are wars, he said.
</P>
<P>
He believed mechanisms should be set up to curb the separatist
trend.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma said his two meetings with
Chernomyrdin were "fruitful" and that the two sides will further
coordinate their political and diplomatic efforts concerning the
Kosovo issue.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Kicks off Historical Visit to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein left Amman Wednesday for a two-day official visit to
Syria for talks with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on bilateral
ties and the stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Abdullah's departure, Jordanian Information Minister
Nasser Lawzi hailed the trip as a historical visit marking a new
phase in the Jordanian-Syrian relations in all fields.
</P>
<P>
The visit was aimed at further mending Jordan's ties with
Syria, which were strained by Jordan and Israel signed a peace
treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Assad had been at odds with late Jordanian King Hussein over
the treaty until Hussein died of cancer on February 7.
</P>
<P>
However, Assad declared a three-day mourning for Hussein and
paid a visit in years to Amman to attend the funeral of Hussein
on February 8.
</P>
<P>
Assad's good-will gestures met with positive responses from
the Jordanian government, which has expressed support for
Syria's stands to resume peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Damascus insisted its peace talks with Israel, suspended since
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu came to power in 1996,
should be resumed from where it was suspended prior to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government said the peace talks should be
restarted on fairly new grounds, a stance blamed by Syria as
unwilling to carry out the land-for-peace arrangements outlined
by the former Israeli Labor government.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah's visit to Syria was part of his regional tour in
April to rally support for the stagnant economy of his desert
kingdom and to coordinate Arab stands on the deadlocked Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The tour has already taken him to Saudi Arabia, Oman, the
United Arab Emirates and Libya.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Two heavily armed young men stormed a suburban Denver high
school at midday Tuesday and, in a shooting rampage on a scale
unprecedented in an American school, killed as many as 25 students
and faculty members.
</P>
<P>
-- While NATO warplanes have flown thousands of missions over
Yugoslavia in the course of a four-week bombing campaign, about 80
percent of alliance airstrikes have been at sites targeted at
least once before, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The government of Rwanda is proposing a process for the
judging of 125,000 people, almost all Hutu, who are still in jail
and accused of massacres and other crimes during the mass killings
of 500,000 or more people, mostly Tutsi, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
-- NATO and Pentagon officials said Serbian forces had begun
expelling ethnic Albanians from villages in Montenegro, possibly
signaling a widening of the Yugoslav conflict, but some American
officials who were closely monitoring the situation said that they
could not substantiate the reports.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO leaders will consider planning for a ground assault in
Yugoslavia as Britain's Guardian newspaper said British Prime
Minister Tony Blair will push hard to persuade President Bill
Clinton at the weekend NATO summit in Washington to send ground
troops.
</P>
<P>

declaration of statehood in return for U.S. endorsement of

<HEADLINE> Zambia Sets New Strategies to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia, which is expected to
become a major tourist destination in southern Africa, has drawn
up a five-year program to increase tourists arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Under the new marketing strategy which was issued earlier this
month, the country is expected to attract 660,000 tourists in 2004
from 362,000 in 1998, with an annual increase of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cletus Chanda, marketing manager of Zambia National Tourist
Board, explained that the government is going to attract more
tourists with publicity programs on major tourist attractions so
as to improve Zambia's profile in this sector.
</P>
<P>
Chanda told Xinhua that his country have many favorable factors
to boost toursim, which include political stability, vast wild
life reserves and lodges, the prestigious Victoria Falls and the
friendly Zambian people.
</P>
<P>
The board has set up a web site to provide tourist information
of the country for foreign tourists, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board will publish a tourist guide on
accommodation, attraction sites, pleasure resorts as well as the
general information about the Zambian people, their culture and
traditional ceremonies, Chanda said.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian national tourist administration would establish
closer relations with the media by inviting foreign journalists to
tour the country's major resorts.
</P>
<P>
"We are considering repositioning the Victoria Falls on the
international market. It is certainly one of Africa's best tourism
attractions and we can not just let its image remain as it is,"
Chanda said.
</P>
<P>
For a long time the Victoria falls in Livingstone, Southern
Province, has not been given the attention it deserves and that it
was high time a right picture was portrayed.
</P>
<P>
The government is projecting to earn 97 million U.S. Dollars
from tourism this year compared to last year when the country only
earned 74 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Opportunity Africa, produced in London by Charles
Barker publishing on behalf of the UK Department of Trade and
Industry, has indicated that Zambia's tourism earnings are
projected to reach 103 million dollars by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Introduces Special Treasury Bills to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Nigeria has
introduced the sale of Special Treasury Bills (STB) to banks for
the purpose of liquidity management in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank which began selling the bills Monday explained
that the sale of the bill was due to the recent unprecedented
surge in base money which has seriously exacerbated the prevailing
liquidity overhung in the banking system, the Daily Times reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following a recent government directive under which its
parastatals are now free to withdraw their money and lodge them in
commercial banks of their choice, the sum of 100 billion naira
(about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) was withdrawn from the bank.
</P>
<P>
According to Vincent Omoike, director of banking operations of
the Central Bank, the introduction of the bills would assist the
monetary authorities in reducing the liquidity in the system to a
level consistent with the achievement of macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new arrangement shall entail the mandatory
sale of the Treasury Bills to banks which participate in the
foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Under this initiative, explained the bank official, the
purchase of foreign exchange by banks shall be contingent on the
purchase of specified amounts of the Bills.
</P>
<P>
These bills, he said, shall not be eligible for discounting or
trading until after a minimum period of three months from the date
of purchase.

<TEXT>
<P>
Peng today asked the governments at all levels to put greater
emphasis on blood donations and a major campaign across China to
educate people about the importance of blood donations.
</P>
<P>
Officials at all levels of government should draw up plans to
implement the law, she said, and there should be strong measures
against illegal activities like dealing in other people's blood.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, officials, servicemen, and students have
answered the call to donate blood and in large and medium-sized
cities like Qingdao, Shenzhen, Xiamen and Xuzhou there has been
much progress, according to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
In Qingdao in Shandong province, some 80 percent of the
government officials have donated blood, and college students, who
account for only 0.5 percent of the city's population, have
donated 10 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Medical personnel have also helped by setting up mobile blood
banks and the city has China's first volunteer blood donor
association.

<HEADLINE> WFP Launches Emergency Aid to Displaced Eritreans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
will launch a 15.4-million-U.S. dollar emergency aid operation
this month to feed approximately 268,000 displaced Eritreans in
three southern provinces, the WFP Nairobi office announced here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The operation, in response to a request made by the Eritrean
government, is expected to provide rations to the displaced
through the end of this year, said Russ Ulrey, WFP's regional
logistics officer.
</P>
<P>
The recipients of WFP food aid will include about 246,500
displaced, mostly women and children, and some 21,500 returnees
who were deported from Ethiopia, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
The border conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia which began in
May of 1998 escalated once again in February this year, forcing
thousands of Eritreans living along the border to flee further
north in the country.
</P>
<P>
The majority of them are now living out in the open or under
makeshift tents in the dry mountainous regions of Debub,
Gash-Barka and South Sea provinces.
</P>
<P>
To work closely with the Eritrean Relief and Refugees
Commission, said Ulrey, WFP will provide monthly rations of
cereals, pulses, oil and salt to recipients at rural distribution
centers in the three provinces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, WFP's U.N. partners will address problems of clean
water, shelter and severe malnutrition, Ulrey added.
</P>
<P>
WFP is now appealing to donors to fund the 15.4-million-dollar
operation.
</P>
<P>
"With all cries in eastern and central Africa, our regional
food stocks are already stretched. We are depending on the
generosity of donors more than ever to ensure we are able to
provide for these displaced Eritreans," Ulrey said.

<HEADLINE> New Round of Price Cuts for Color TVs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen-based Konka Group,
China's major TV producer, today announced the introduction of a
sharp price cut in response to increasing challenges presented by
its chief rival, the Changhong Group.
</P>
<P>
Early this April, The Sichuan-based Changhong Group, China's
largest TV producer, slashed prices in early April to promote
sales, with the maximum reduction hitting 1,000 yuan (120 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Konka has responded by slashing prices by between 100 yuan and
1,500 yuan. The company held the largest market share in China's
large and medium-sized cities during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Konka General Manager Chen Weirong said the price cut will help
his Group accelerate the capital turnover rate and increase sales.
He said the resulting profit gap will be filled by raising prices
for hi-tech and patented products.
</P>
<P>
Chen added that price cuts will apply only to newly
manufactured units.
</P>
<P>
China witnessed a similar 1996 price cut initiated by the
Changhong Group. As a result, major domestic TV producers,
including Changhong, Konka and Panda, increased their market share
by a wide margin and substantially reduced the sales volume for
imported units.

<P>
Tang Kaiguo, director of the Changhong Group's Beijing Branch,
said it is normal for TV producers to cut prices during sluggish
periods in order to increase sales.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 100 new TV brands were introduced last year alone.
Tang said Changhong will sharpen its competitiveness by focusing
on the development of hi-tech products and further increasing its
market share to resist cut-throat competition.
</P>
<P>
Various other domestic TV producers are also seeking effective
measures for ensuring their survival, with a number of related
ventures joining the price war by offering discounts.
</P>
<P>
TV sales for Beijing's large department stores have surged over
the past few days, with the daily sales volume for Changhong TVs
rising my almost 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Price competition is an important aspect of overall enterprise
competition and is quite simply a normal market phenomenon," said
Zheng Xinli, spokesman for the State Development Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The government hopes to avoid vicious competition and strongly
opposes sales of products at prices below the average level of
production costs," he added.
</P>
<P>
China's TV sales hit 21.6 million units during 1998, up 27
percent from 1997. Experts estimate that China's sales will
continue to grow at a double-digit rate annually over the next few
years.

KUNMING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
reported an import-export volume of 371 million U.S. dollars for
the first quarter of the year, up 13.2 percent on the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the first three months show that Yunnan exported
a total of 226 million dollars of goods, up 5.8 percent on the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Marked growth was reported for main exports such as chemicals,
mining products and nonferrous metals, as well as electronic,
pharmaceutical and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The province's import volume jumped 27 percent to 145 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming World Horticulture Expo scheduled for Kunming
has sparked a construction boom and increased the demands for
imported raw materials, equipment and machinery, according to
local officials.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis which erupted in 1997 has adversely
impacted the province's foreign trade sector which focuses on
Southeast Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
However, the province reversed the declining trend last year
and reported a 1.1 percent rise which ended the period at 2.03
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> WTO Expects 1999 Export to Grow at Around 3.5 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Export growth in 1999 is expected
to match that of 1998 at around 3.5 percent, the World Trade
Organization (WTO) predicted in its outlook for 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, the WTO stated that for the above projection to be
realized, trade growth will have to accelerate during the course
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
"This projection also assumes that slowing output growth in the
United States and Western Europe will be offset somewhat by
recovery in Asia," said the WTO in its latest report to be
published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"A faster than expected slowdown in the United States or
Western Europe, or slower recovery in Asia, would clearly imply
export volume growth below 3.5 percent in 1999," the world trade
watchdog said.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea and Thailand,
which were most immediately affected by financial crisis, the WTO
said, the sharp contraction of output and trade appears to have
bottomed out and a moderate recovery is likely in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO report, the slowdown of world trade and
output growth had not been reversed by the end of 1998. "While
Japan's GDP continued to shrink in the fourth quarter of 1998 and
many West European countries recorded a weakening in their
economic performance, the U.S. economy accelerated," it said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO noted that significantly slower GDP growth in Brazil in
1998 and contraction in Russia will negatively affect the growth
of neighboring economies with whom they have extensive trade ties.

<HEADLINE> China's Telecoms Sector Facing Fiercer Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China's telecommunications sector
is focusing on service to compete better with foreign companies in
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Telecom, a branch of China Telecom, announced today
that on May 1 it will cut the amount of time needed to get a
telephone installed or moved and it will try to response more
quickly to customer requests.
</P>
<P>
The deputy-director of Beijing Telecom, Jia Yong, says that
China's telecommunications sector is set to open to foreign
operators and that China Telecom's management which developed over
a long period of monopoly operations will not survive market
competition and needs to improve service and quality to keep its
customers.
</P>
<P>
China Telecom still has a monopoly in local telephones, but,
according to Beijing Telecom, the company has had an increasing
number of instances of failing to provide quality service and the
amount of compensation it has had to give customers has been
growing each year.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the U.S.'s AT&AMP;T obtained approval for
Internet-related operations in China and, in response, Beijing
Telecom added new Internet services. It promises that customers
can get a dedicated line for data transmission within a month of
registering and can get dial-in Internet service within 48 hours
of making their first payment.
</P>
<P>
The company also promises to compensate customers if it fails
to meet the time limit.
</P>
<P>
Jia says that Chinese operators lag far behind foreign
operators in service. The average time it takes Chinese operator
to install a new telephone line is 20 days, but it's only 3-7 days
for foreign operators.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese operators are trying to streamline management and
improve efficiency to reduce this gap and Beijing Telecom has
already laid off a number of employees who have not met efficiency
standards.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Hopes to Meet Russian Peace Envoy Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Wednesday that he wanted Russia to play a part in
resolving the Kosovo crisis and hoped to meet Kremlin peace envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin soon.
</P>
<P>
"The appointment of Mr. Chernomyrdin is a sign that Russia
wants to and can play a part in resolving this issue and I very
much hope he is able to play a part in this," a Reuters report
quoted Blair as saying in an interview to be broadcast later on
Wednesday with Russian NTV television.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see Mr. Chernomyrdin as soon as possible,"
Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin, former Russian prime minister, was recently
appointed Kosovo peace envoy by President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Blair said he believed Russia had a big part to play in Kosovo,
including talks on an international force to secure a peaceful
returning home for refugees.
</P>
<P>
"That is why we have all made such efforts to keep open the
lines of communication. Russia is a hugely respected country in
the world. We understand entirely its position in respect of this
conflict and we hope Russia can play a part in securing the basic
aim of justice for people in Kosovo," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has fiercely opposed NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official Says Chinese Businesses Should Bid More On U.N. Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.N. procurement officer
said here on Wednesday that Chinese businesses should participate
more in bidding on U.N. procurement jobs.
</P>
<P>
Martin Halland, vice-chairman of the U.N. Inter-Agency
Procurement Working Group, said at a meeting on "Doing Business
with the U.N. System" here that China can provide many products
and services because of their competitiveness. These include
foodstuff, textiles, farm machinery, and other basic products that
the U.N. needs both for development and humanitarian projects.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. buys over three billion U.S. dollars worth of products
and services each year. When government spending and loans from
international lending institutions are added, the value of
business opportunities in the U.N. system could approach 25
billion U.S. dollars annually, Halland says. But, developing
nations account for only about 40 percent of this.
</P>
<P>
U.N. got 15 million U.S. dollars worth of goods from China in
1996, and that grew to 34 million U.S. dollars worth in 1997. The
products were mostly foodstuff, contraceptives, water-supply
equipment, farm machinery, construction materials, and machine
tools and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.N. and China consider the figure too low, Halland
stressed and explained that one of the main reasons is that
Chinese businesses don't know the procurement market, but that new
technology, especially the Internet, could increase the
opportunities and give China a bigger share of the U.N. business.
</P>
<P>
This is a global market, he said, and it is necessary to be the
most competitive, but there are many suppliers in China that are
the best in the world, so they could win contracts with the U.N.

<HEADLINE> Higher Deficit Blocks Philippines Completing IMF Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Following the announcement of the
higher-than-expected budget deficit for the first quarter of the
year, the Philippines failed to complete its fourth IMF review,
government sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A shortfall in revenue collections has again caused the
government to incur a much higher budget deficit for the first
quarter of the year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu was quoted as saying that
the Philippine penal has asked the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to send another team in May to look over the revenue figures
once the April figures have been finalized.
</P>
<P>
The government incurred a budget deficit of 33.463 billion
pesos (836.6 million U.S. dollars) from January to March this
year, 11 billion pesos (275 million U.S. dollars) higher than
programmed, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A visiting IMF review mission has expressed dismay at the low
revenue collection which has forced the government to cut down its
expenditure, part of the pump-priming program, they said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government would have to convince the IMF that
the excess deficit of 11 billion pesos could still be recovered
this year, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government is still sticking to its budget deficit target
this year of 68.4 billion pesos (1.71 billion U.S. dollars), the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
But in order to do so, the government may have to reduce its
pump-priming if it is not able to raise additional revenue, they
said.

<P>
SINGAPORE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Lee Hsien Loong has urged for a strong ties between Europe and
Asia for the benefits of both regions, Television Corporation of
Singapore broadcast Wednesday in a report from Germany.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the point in his speech delivered to a forum in
Hamburg, Germany, while on a two-week European tour which has
taken him to the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Lee said Asia and Europe should not let their strategic
relationship become more distant as strong ties between Asia and
Europe remained vital to both regions.
</P>
<P>
For Asia, Lee underlined, Europe is both a key support market
and a source of capital and technology.
</P>
<P>
While for Europe, he said, Asia rivals the United States in
terms of market size, adding in 1997 Asia overtook the United
States as Europe's largest trading partner.
</P>
<P>
He drew attention to the fact that Euro-Asia trade accounted for
some three million jobs in Europe and held that an economic
recovery in Asia would contribute significantly to Europe's
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Lee said, Asia needed a strong Europe to ensure a
global environment that is conducive to recovery.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both Asia and Europe have been pre-occupied with
developments in their own regions over the last two years with
Asian countries focusing on fixing their economies while European
countries adapting to the launch of the single European currency
plus the crisis in Kosovo, he urged European companies to take a
long-term view over Asia and help Asia out of crisis through
investment.

TIRANA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO has begun to deploy military
equipment in northern Albania along Yugoslavia's Kosovo province
border and is to soon start evacuating Kosovo refugees from that
area, reportedly in preparation for ground operations, the
Albanian newspaper Koha Jone said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper, the country's top daily, quoted "reliable
sources" with the Albanian Public Order Ministry as saying that
NATO deployed an unspecified number of anti-air missiles along
borders in Albania's Kukes and Tropoja districts in the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, dozens of NATO tanks and armored vehicles, as well
as several hundred NATO troops, headed toward northern Albania
after being transported to Rinasi Airport in Tirana. At the same
time, the first group of NATO's Apache attack helicopters arrived
in Albania. They are stationed for the time being at Kucove
military base, 50 kilometers south of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said NATO has ordered the use of hundreds of
large military helicopters for the evacuation of Kosovo refugees
from Kukes to prepare for ground campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Local government official in Kukes Vladimir Shehu said the
district could only shelter 20,000 refugees at most. Reports say

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Alliance Claim to Capture Bamyan City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Northern Alliance
Wednesday claimed to have captured Bamyan city, capital of central
Bamyan province, from the Taliban militia following fierce
overnight fighting.
</P>
<P>
The claim was denied by the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Fighting for Bamyan has been intense in recent days with
hundreds of refugees fleeing the region for the safety of Kabul,
the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces entered Bamyan from the south,'' said Abdullah, a
spokesman for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Forces loyal to Hezb-e-Wahadat and Harrakat-i-Islami, two of
groups of the opposition alliance, launched their offensive late
on Tuesday night until they broke through Taliban defense lines
and into the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports suggested that around 50 people from the
two sides were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
So far about 100 Taliban soldiers were reported to be captured
by the opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
But Abdul Hai Muttmain, the Taliban spokesman, contacted in
southern Afghan city of Kandahar, denied losing the Shiite Muslim
dominated town.
</P>
<P>
Fighting is still going on in the districts of Daree Shekari
and Shashpool in Bamyan province, some 10 kilometers from the
city, Saad Mohseni from Harrakat-e-Islami said in his message from
Tashkent, capital of Uzbekistan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Sterilization Device Tried in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A new sterilization procedure is
set to revolutionize permanent contraception for women around the
globe following the success of world-first clinical trials in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth and Ashford Community hospitals in Adelaide,
capital of South Australia state, are the first in the world to
hold clinical trials into the use of a new device, which does not
require any incisions or general anaesthetic, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The device, known as STOP, is a small coil less than one mm in
diameter and about 2.5 cm long made of a space-age metal.
</P>
<P>
Developed by an American company, it is inserted into the
opening of a woman's fallopian tubes using a small telescope
called a hysteroscope passed through the cervix at the top of the
vagina.
</P>
<P>
Some local anaesthetic is applied to the cervix and the patient
may be sedated if she wishes.
</P>
<P>
Patients can watch the irreversible procedure, which takes
about 10 to 15 minutes, on a monitor and, after a one-hour
observation period, can go home.
</P>
<P>
The procedure has been kept a secret for 17 months but early
results were so encouraging the company that makes the device,
United States-based Conceptus Inc, is setting up two new study
centers, one in the U.S. and one in the Netherlands, the AAP said.
</P>
<P>
The first physician in the world to try the new device, John
Kerin, said the metal used in the device did not react with the
tissues in any way.
</P>
<P>
The same type of device had been used to block leaking blood
vessels in the human brain and heart.
</P>
<P>
He said he could not say exactly how the device worked but it
was logical that it blocked sperm from meeting the egg in the
fallopian tubes, where fertilization normally takes place.
</P>
<P>
Kerin said STOP was 50 times smaller than an intra uterine
device (IUD) and was not placed in the uterus which, because of
its muscular nature and menstruation, could cramp and be irritated
by IUDs.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
softer Wednesday but off its session lows as the unit found
support from participants.
</P>
<P>
Traders said there was two way action in the market, with
buyers happy to prop up the currency whenever it appeared to slip.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed in Sydney at 64.88 U.S. cents from
Tuesday's finish of 65.03 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
During local dealings Wednesday it hit a high of 64.95 U.S.
cents and marked a low of 64.59 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
According to Arab Bank's Scott Young, overseas interest in the
Australian dollar will continue as reports confirm that Asia is
beginning to emerge from its financial crisis, while market
perceptions about the safety of the local currency will continue
to lure more buyers.
</P>
<P>
At the close in Sydney, the Australian dollar was buying 0.6109
euro from 0.60101 euro and 76.96 Japanese yen from 76.79 yen at
Tuesday's close, while the euro was trading at 1.0627 U.S. dollars

LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) - Firms ranging from a manufacturer
of propellers to a maker of natural history films are among 101
British companies granted a prestigious Queen's Award here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The recipients are from a wide spread of industrial and
commercial activity and size of company. Firms from Scotland,
Wales, Northern Ireland and all regions of England were
represented at the occasion.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of companies applying for the Queen's Award
for Export Achievement plunged to its lowest level in the awards'
33-year history.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 1,300 British companies applied to win a Queen's Award
for exports. Last year the number fell to 864 and this year to
just 520.
</P>
<P>
Analysts interpreted this year's figures as graphic evidence of
the damage from the strong pound and last year's collapse in Asian
markets.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman from the Confederation of British Industry said: "
It is hardly surprising that the numbers are down, as exporters
have had a tough time."
</P>
<P>
"It shows the combined effects of the difficulties in South-
east Asia and Eastern Europe as well as the strength of sterling
throughout last year," he added.

The China Wildlife Conservation Association has joined wildlife
protection departments from Beijing and Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei
provinces for the activities, which will last until May. This
year's theme is "Let birds share the sky with people".
</P>
<P>
In Shanxi, 10 brown-eared pheasants that were raised in
captivity were released to the wild on April 13. China has 1,256
species of birds, 50 of which are either rare or unique to China.
</P>
<P>
With the increase in population size and economic development,
the birds' environment has deteriorated. In recent years, the
country has made an effort to protect the birds through rules and
regulations and by setting up nature reserves and increasing
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
There have been some good results in this. The number of brown-
eared pheasants has increased to more than 5,000 from some 2,000 a
decade ago. Recently, they were sighted in Shaanxi Province in
northwest China for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Customs Union Accord Unlikely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, Aprilinue working beyond
April to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an unnamed official from the union as saying
Tuesday that much agreement had already been achieved on an
alternative formula of sharing customs revenue and on the
institutional framework to govern the accord.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of a revenue-sharing formula, "further work" was
needed on how to deal practically with the excise duties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Finding an acceptable formula has always been a sensitive issue
given the fact that South Africa's partners depend largely on
trade tax for government revenue.
</P>
<P>
The SACU comprises South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and
 Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
The official also said work had been done on the institutional
set-up that would manage the union's common external tariff
system.
</P>
<P>
The official, who said the talks on the institutional system
had reached a delicate stage, indicated that a report would soon
be drafted for consideration by ministers.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, which manages the union at present, is skeptical
of establishing a large and costly institutional dispensation,
whereas its partners want a more meaningful say in the running of
the new agreement.
</P>
<P>
The official said there was recognition of the need for a
broadly run customs union. However, this would have to be an
efficient union capable of delivery.

Asked if she would be the next prime minister, she said that
the question was premature and the decision would be taken when

<HEADLINE> China Launches Charity Drive for Cancer Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China's major charity
organization plans to launch a national rehabilitation and fund-
raising campaign to help cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the campaign, sponsored by the China Charity
Federation (CCF), is to provide financial aid to poor patients and
fund the establishment of a national center for cancer
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Cancer, which hits some 1.6 million Chinese people and claims 1.
3 million lives each year, ranks as the No.1 cause of death among
urban Chinese and the third greatest health problem in rural areas.
The incidence rate for cancers continues to rise due to aging
population, industrialization and high-risk lifestyles, according
to the Anti-Cancer Association of China which is participating in
the project.
</P>
<P>
The high mortality rate for the disease and high cost of
medical care leave most patients with feelings of depression,
helplessness and desperation.
</P>
<P>
One cancer rehabilitation expert that cancer patients should
have access to surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as
comprehensive treatment which focuses on psychological counseling,
nutrition, exercise and healthy lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
"However, China's rehabilitation services fail to meet current
demand in spite of rehabilitation organizations established in 50-
plus cities," according to Zhang Zongwei with the Beijing Tumor
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The charity campaign will enable experts to seek better
rehabilitation methods with Chinese characteristics, including the
introduction of traditional herbal medicine and qigong, a system
featuring deep breathing exercises, said Zhang.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A new clause in China's clinical
use of morphine is expected to help provide relief to two million
cancer sufferers for their pain.
</P>
<P>
Drug Administration officials say that a new pharmacopoeia will
come out in 2000 with a clause on not restricting morphine dosages
for cancer patients, meaning that doctors can decide on the amount
of morphine needed for a particular patient.
</P>
<P>
The pain of cancer patients has been called a global problem by
the WHO (World Health Organization). Scientists say that the pain
puts patients in a depressed state, causing a large number of
treatments to fail.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 percent of China's 2 million-plus cancer patients
suffer from various degrees of pain and a third of them still get
no relief even on their deathbed.
</P>
<P>
China's old pharmacopoeia limited the dosage of morphine, But
Doctor Zhang Heping of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science's
Tumor Hospital points out that many sufferers need much more than
the limit to get relief from their pain.
</P>
<P>
The State Drug Administration allowed hospitals to disregard
the dosage limit in 1998, but, apart from Beijing's tumor
hospitals, it has not been applied in most Chinese hospitals.
</P>
<P>
A Drug Administration official says that many doctors and
patients are afraid of morphine addition but he points out that
few patients will become addicted and he adds that drug
administration departments have strict procedures for morphine
usage.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt Urged to Take Y2K Problem Seriously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has been
advised to be more serious about the Year 2000 millenium problem.
</P>
<P>
Augustine Bushayija, coordinator of the Y2K millenium problem,
told Rwanda News Agency (RNA) that the Rwandan government is not
taking the problem seriously compared to Uganda, Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The Rwandan government set aside a very small percentage of
the budget for the Y2K problem, yet Rwanda has to employ
expatriates since there are few local qualified personnel,"
Bushayija highlighted.
</P>
<P>
"Top government officials are not actively involved in the Y2K
committee as in other countries", he added.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government paid only 25 percent of money requested
for secretarial services.
</P>
<P>
There remained only 226 days, last Friday when they held their
two-day seminar but, top government lawmakers did not turn up, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I call upon the Rwandan government, to inject in more
resources even though it is very expensive, as 1st January 2000 is
drawing nearer," Bushayija indicated.
</P>
<P>
According to Gerald Mpyisi, the coordinator of the Y2K
Millenium bug in Rwanda, crucial departments will be affected if
they are not Y2K compliant. These include air transport,
ELECTROGAZ, Rwandatel, Hospitals, Insurances, ministries,
government account department pay rolls, banking and finance.
</P>
<P>
If by 2000 such important departments are not Y2K compliant, it
will have negative economic impacts to the Rwandan government;
national business and computerized services will all be affected,
Mpyisi underscored.
</P>
<P>
Samson Goloba Y2K Millenium officer in Rwanda told Rwanda News
Agency that reports from Washington revealed that, in July 1998,
IBM Computer Manufacturing Company in USA Manufactured 60 percent
Y2K compliant and 40 percent non compliant computers.
</P>
<P>
He advised Rwandans to purchase Y2K compliant computers to curb
the prevailing problem.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and U.S. negotiators are
set to resume talks on China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on Thursday morning, according to the Ministry

Cassidy is expected to arrive in Beijing this evening and is
scheduled to stay in the Chinese capital until Sunday and possibly

S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Topics scheduled for discussion include the legal terms for

<HEADLINE> Israelis Mark Independence Day Amid Tight Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 21 (Xinhua) - The Israelis went to prayer
services, picnics, music and dances Wednesday to celebrate the
51st anniversary of the establishment of the Jewish state amid
tight security measures against possible terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide radio broadcast to mark the Independence Day,
President Ezer Weizman said he is full of hope and confidence that
Israel will reach peace with all its Arab neighbors in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
Noting there has been a sharp decline in terror attacks against
Israelis in the last two years, Weizman praised the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) for its actions on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Israel has to resume peace talks with the Palestinians quickly
no matter who will become the next prime minister, he
said. Israelis go to poll on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, citing alleged Palestinian
violations, has frozen the implementation of the Wye agreement he
signed with PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat last October.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip
since Monday night, warning that terrorist groups might kidnap
soldiers or stage terror attacks during the holiday.
</P>
<P>
Heavy forces of police have been deployed in parks, shopping
malls and other "sensitive areas."
</P>
<P>
The State of Israel was proclaimed on May 14, 1948, but the
Independence Day was marked according to Jewish calendar.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Urge Ground Assault in Kosovo: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) - British Prime Minister Tony Blair
has forged an outline agreement with key NATO partners to "impose
a solution" on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic by sending
ground troops into Kosovo, the Guardian said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Blair will fly to Washington tonight in a determined effort
to persuade President Clinton that a ground assault can be
launched sooner rather than later," the British newspaper said in
its front-page report.
</P>
<P>
"Accompanied by General Sir Charles Guthrie, his chief of
defense staff, the prime minister will tell Mr Clinton that a move
to a ground offensive is the only credible option for NATO if the
alliance is to achieve its objectives within a timescale
acceptable to political and public opinion," said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian said the three countries providing most of the
firepower in NATO's air campaign -- Britain, the United States and
France -- had accepted that "they should formally begin planning
the deployment of NATO ground troops before any settlement with
Belgrade."
</P>
<P>
Blair had decided to "put his personal prestige with Mr Clinton
on the line in an effort to strengthen the military assault on
Yugoslavia and to persuade him that Serb forces will have been
sufficiently 'degraded' that a land assault would not amount to a
full-scale war," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, Blair repeatedly ruled out the use of British
ground troops in the conflict with Yugoslavia, saying they would
be sent into Kosovo only as part of an agreed international
peacekeeping force and only when they are not opposed.

<HEADLINE> France Insists on NATO Air Operation to Drop Food to Kosovars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 21 (Xinhua) -- France insisted Wednesday that NATO
carry out air dropping operations over Kosovo to send food and
medicines to the displaced people there, despite high risks for
such operations.
</P>
<P>
France made the appeal at a meeting of NATO Council gathering
ambassadors of its member countries in Brussels, said French
officials.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac proposed last Friday that NATO
air drop humanitarian materials to Kosovars who are still
remaining in the Yugoslav province or are on their way to the
borders.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Cooperation Charles Josselin, who is in
charge of humanitarian action, recognized on Tuesday that the task
of air dropping materials over Kosovo would be very complicated.
</P>
<P>
He said that many Kosovars driven from their homes are now
hiding in mountains in separate groups.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, NATO pilots will have to fly their planes very slowly
over Kosovo when carrying out air dropping operations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Subsidence Reported in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese environmentalists reported
today that extensive coal mining activities have caused varying
degrees of subsidence over a 10 sq.km. area in Urumqi, the capital
of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Subsidence ranging from 1-3 centimeters deep and 10-50 meters
wide has affected approximately one sixth of Urumqi's total urban
area, according to Senior Engineer Sun Xiaoming, leader of a
recent subsidence survey team.
</P>
<P>
The most serious subsidence covers a belt over one kilometer
wide, according to comments Sun made during a Wednesday seminar
marking the World Earth Day.
</P>
<P>
He added that subsidence not only claimed the lives of 17 coal
miners in February 1995, but has also hindered normal industrial
and agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Urumqi, the political, economic and cultural center in Xinjiang,
has a population of over 1.4 million. The city is located in the
heart of the Junggar Coal Field. The field has 10 billion tons of
verified coal reserves, with current annual production of some
three million tons.

<HEADLINE> Warring Parties in E. Timor Sign Agreement to End Hostilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Warring factions of the
pro-independence and pro-integration groups Wednesday signed an
agreement to end hostilities in Indonesia's troubled province of
East Timor, according to Antara News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The "Agreement to End Hostilities and Create Peace in East
Timor" was signed in Dili, capital of East Timor, by provincial
legislator Domingos MD Soares and commander of a pro-integration
group Joao Tavares, representing the pro-integration camp, and the
National Council of Resistance of East Timor leaders Leandro Isaak
and Manuel Carrascalao, representing the pro-independence camp.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto, who is also Defense
Minister, signed the agreement as a witness.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto expressed hope that the East Timorese could now live in
peace.
</P>
<P>
"I highly appreciate the (efforts of) people who have made
contributions to this agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the East Timor issue is not only a national but an
international issue as well.
</P>
<P>
"I invite all parties to stop the fighting. We shall start a
new life by creating a secure situation for the people," he was
quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
East Timor Governor Abilio Jose Osorio Soares welcomed the
signing of the agreement to cease all hostilities in the province.
</P>
<P>
"This (the signing of the agreement) is our wish. We have been
dreaming about this," Abilio said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975
and became an Indonesian province in 1976, but the U.N. never
recognized the move.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government announced in January that it is ready
to release East Timor if the alternative to provide wider autonomy
is refused by the people in the region and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Violence in the territory escalated early this month after
jailed East Timor pro-independence leader Xanana Gusmao made arms
call on April 5.
</P>
<P>
Last week, attacks by pro-integration militiamen claimed at
least 20 lives. The spate of violence has raised fears that it
would put the peaceful efforts in danger.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas would present
the government's final autonomy proposal during his two-day
meeting with his Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama in New York on
April 22.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Despite the Asian financial
upheaval, about 679,000 additional workers were employed in
January 1999 in the Philippines, a government news release said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of employed persons rose to 28.37 million in January
from 27.69 million in the same month of 1998, representing a
year-on-year increase of 2.4 percent or of 679,000 jobs, the news
release said.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate could be attributed to improvements in the
agricultural and financial sectors, which were badly hit by the
prolonged drought and the Asian financial crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural, fishery and forestry sector is leading the
employment growth as more Filipino workers found jobs in 1999 than
in 1998, it added.
</P>
<P>
Following the agricultural and financial fields are the
transportation and communications sector, which offered 5.8
percent more jobs in January, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
The largest employment increment was recorded in metro Manila,
which had some 134,000 new jobs, it said.
</P>
<P>
Metro Manila was followed by southern Luzon with 89,000 new
jobs and central Luzon with 88,000, it said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film Director Says No To Cannes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese director Zhang Yimou
has written to David Cronenberg, the president of the Cannes Film
Festival jury, to inform him that he has decided to withdraw his
two movies from this year's competition.
</P>
<P>
Zhang wrote to Beijing Youth Daily to say that he decided to
withdraw his two movies Not One Less and My Parents from the
festival because of the criteria but that he is "deeply sorry"
about it.
</P>
<P>
The president of the jury said in public that he dislikes
Zhang's two candidates because they are Chinese government
propaganda even though he did not deny their artistic value.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Zhang explained that the theme of both movies is
love, a universal feeling, and that he could not understand their
being criticized for "political" reasons and that that is no doubt
a political or cultural prejudice.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yimou is one of China's few world class directors and won
a Golden Palm Award at Cannes in 1995 for his movie To Live. He
has also won movie awards in Venice, Berlin, New York, and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
What he can't accept, he says, is that Western critics have
long had 'political' readings of Chinese movies and stereotype
them as either 'anti-government' or 'government propaganda', which
is childish and one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes to reduce this discrimination against Chinese
movies because it is unfair not only to him but to all Chinese
directors, including the new generation of directors.

<HEADLINE> World Trade Growth Slower in 1998: WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of the volume of
world merchandise exports slowed down to 3.5 percent in 1998 from
over 10 percent in 1997, according to the World Trade Organization
(WTO).
</P>
<P>
"Trade contraction in Asia has been the biggest factor in the
global trade slowdown," the WTO said in its latest report to be
published on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the report, there has been a marked
slowdown in global export expansion throughout 1998, reflected in
the performance of all major regions.
</P>
<P>
Trade performance measured in volume terms differed widely
among regions in 1998, particularly on the import side, said the
WTO report.
</P>
<P>
Imports into Asia fell by 8.5 percent, stagnated or fell
slightly in Africa and the Middle East, and expanded by 7.5
percent in Western Europe and by some 10 percent in North America,
Latin America and the transition economies.
</P>
<P>
Export volume growth was the strongest in the transition
economies and Latin America, at 10 percent and 6.5 percent
respectively, and increased marginally in Asia with one percent.
Western Europe's export growth was slightly above the global
average, at 4.5 percent, and that of North America was below the
average, at three percent.
</P>
<P>
In value terms, exports of merchandise and commercial services
amounted to 6.5 trillion U.S. dollars in 1998. Merchandise exports
amounted to 5.2 trillion dollars and commercial services to 1.3
trillion.
</P>
<P>
"This represents a fall of almost two percent in dollar terms
over exports in 1997, but still exceeds the level attained in 1996,
" WTO pointed out. "This is the strongest decrease since 1982."
</P>
<P>
WTO also noted that exports of commercial services recorded the
first annual decline in value terms since comprehensive statistics
became available in the mid-1980s.

She said that the UNHCR does not have the capacity to lead the
humanitarian operation for hundreds of thousands of Kosovo
refugees, unless NATO countries provide "an extra contribution."
</P>
<P>
"Nobody, I say nobody, has ever foreseen that expulsions of
such a massive scale could take place. I have never found a person
who could have imagined such a catastrophe," she said.

LONDON, April 21 (Xinhua) - British Defense Secretary George

</P>
<P>
"We still remain convinced that the arguments against a forced

Robertson told the Sky television.
</P>
<P>
"But we are certainly looking, with all of our allies, at how

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Wednesday accused the
U.S. and Britain of blocking Iraq's contracts to buy oil spare
parts to upgrade its dilapidated oil facilities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency, an Oil
Ministry spokesman reaffirmed "the U.S. and Britain have gone
further deep in their aggressive endeavor by depriving the Iraqi
oil sector of its basic and necessary needs for equipment."
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee had
suspended a large number of Iraqi contracts without any
justification since the implementation of the fourth phase of the
oil-for-food program last June, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The suspended contracts accounted for 79 percent of all the
contracts signed between foreign companies and Iraqi oil companies
located in the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said 24 and 17 contracts respectively pertaining to the
Southern Oil Refineries and South Oil Company had been suspended.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq has been
allowed to import 300 million U.S. dollar worth of oil spare parts
in six months to increase its oil production and export
capacities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and Britain of putting on hold
its contracts on purchasing oil spare parts under various flimsy
pretexts.

MACAO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A total of 87 buildings were
completed in Macao in 1998, 21 fewer than in 1997, latest figures
from the Macao Census and Statistics Department show.
</P>
<P>
Among the buildings, 59.8 percent are residential apartments
and the rest are to be used as offices, stores and workshops.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 12,776 housing units were sold, 59.1 percent of which
were in newly-constructed buildings and 40.9 percent in old
buildings. The number of transactions dropped 10.7 percent from
that in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Macao has been suffering from an economic slowdown since the
mid-1990s due to the adverse economic circumstances in the
surrounding areas and a bad economic structure in Macao.
</P>

Many people predict that the upcoming handover will boost the
local economy and that the first chief executive of the future
Macao Special Administrative Region will be able to help usher in

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebel Leader Vows to Fight on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean Pierre Bemba, a rebel faction leader, said here Tuesday
that the agreement would not affect his fighting in the front, the
New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both the rebels in the DRC and their main ally Rwanda played
down the agreement, saying any deal was meaningless without the
participation of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Rally for
Democracy, reaffirmed their position that they want to talk
directly with Kabila before resolving the issue peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Bemba, who has been visiting senior officials here for a week,
said Uganda is trying to guarantee the security of its borders,
but he is "fighting against Kabila's dictatorship."
</P>
<P>
Uganda is the main backer of Bemba's rebel force, the Congolese
 Liberation Movement. Last year, Kampala gave Bemba military
training and has since provided his force with massive logistical
and military support.
</P>
<P>
A rebellion against Kabila in early August of 1998 has grown
into a regional war sucking in the armies of Angola, Zimbabwe,
Chad and Namibia on the side of Kabila's beleaguered government
forces.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, backed by Uganda and Rwanda, have demanded direct
talks with Kabila, a request which has never been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged and expensive war forced Kabila, who has to pay
for the foreign troops fighting on his side, to seek to end the
armed conflict very soon.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's Information Minister Didier Mumengi said earlier that
the various factions in the conflict would meet in Rome from April
30 for talks mediated by Italy's Roman Catholic Sant'Egidio
Community.

HONG KONG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong and the mainland of
China signed a memorandum on long-term technical cooperation in
aviation meteorological services here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The document was inked by Lam Hung-kwan, director of the Hong
Kong Observatory (HKO), and Li Huibin, director of the
Meteorological Division of the Air Traffic Management Bureau (ATMB)
of the Civil Aviation Administration of China.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation covers a wide range of areas such as
meteorological communications, information exchanges,
meteorological instrumentation and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
On the exchange of meteorological information, the two sides
will hold regular discussions to explore new communication links
and to improve communication methods so as to increase the data
throughput and the types of information exchanged.
</P>
<P>
In this way, aviation forecasters and air traffic controllers
of both sides can have a better understanding of the weather
situation and provide better services to aircraft and airlines.
</P>
<P>
With respect to meteorological instrumentation, the two parties
will exchange technical information on meteorological equipment
which will facilitate improvement of the meteorological facilities
of airports in the mainland and in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the memorandum, visits will be arranged more
frequently through which staff members of both places will learn
from each other in technology and operation.
</P>
<P>
Airports in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhuhai are near
to one another and the two sides agreed that the signing of the
memorandum will surely help promote the development of aviation
meteorological services, improve services and enhance aviation
safety and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Lam said at the signing ceremony that it will lay a sound
foundation for further cooperation in future, adding that he has
full confidence in such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said that owing to the proximity of airports in the Pearl
River estuary area and the overlap of their air spaces, there
should be close coordination of air traffic control among these
airports.
</P>
<P>
"Air traffic control will be more difficult during complicated
weather situations at all nearby airports and their air spaces.
The memorandum would help coordinate air traffic and thus enhance
flight safety and efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also present on the occasion were representatives from five
regional meteorological divisions under ATMB.

<HEADLINE> Depositors of Uganda's Closed Bank Not to Be Paid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Depositors of the Uganda's
Greenland Bank Limited, which was closed by Bank of Uganda on
April 1, will not be paid before June, when the bank audit is
expected to be completed.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Bank of Uganda Governor Charles Kigonyogo
when he met with the depositors's steering committee Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a New Vision report Wednesday, the governor
promised that all bank depositors will be paid all their money,
adding that he could not, at present, give a specific date for the
repayment.
</P>
<P>
He described the Greenland Bank depositors as lucky because, he
asserted, depositors in Kenya and Tanzania and many other
countries could only get no more than the insured maximum if a
bank collapses.
</P>
<P>
Under the Financial Institutions Statute of 1993, only insured
deposits (a maximum of 30 percent) is supposed to be paid once a
bank closes.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda, the country's central bank, closed the
Greenland Bank for mismanagement and huge inside lending on April
1, just before the long Easter holiday.
</P>
<P>
The Greenland Bank has about 120,000 depositors. Both the Bank
of Uganda governor and President Yoweri Museveni have, on several
occasions, assured the depositors of the safety of their money.
</P>
<P>
The Greenland Bank is the fourth bank the Bank of Uganda closed
within seven months, sending another wave of panic among the
depositors and exposing more problems in the country's banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
There is now a loud outcry for the central bank to strictly
supervise the operations of commercial banks and to close them
before they become insolvent.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Help Chinese Companies Gain Overseas Listings (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Lord Mayor of London Peter Levene
said here today that Great Britain plans to offer various forms of
assistance to help Chinese companies obtain overseas listings.
</P>
<P>
London, one of the world's major financial centers, is home to
numerous prestigious financial practitioners and well-established
institutions which are willing and able to help Chinese businesses
gain overseas listings, according to Levene, who is visiting China
as guest of the Beijing Municipal Government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Levene
expressed great appreciation for the Chinese government's decision
to ease controls on overseas listings for domestic companies.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that overseas listing will help China to draw
additional foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
"China's long-term economic development will require more
foreign capital," said Levene.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), met with Levene on Monday and stressed that any
Chinese company fulfilling requirements will receive approval to
seek listings on overseas stock markets. He noted that approvals
will be free of restrictions in terms of scale and number of
companies.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will build
houses for 400,000 people in Gauteng, a province where cities of
Johannesburg and Pretoria are situated, a senior official has
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 176,240 housing units, to be built mostly by black
developers, would be erected across the entire province, Dan
Mofokeng, top official responsible for housing and land affairs in
the province, said Tuesday at the signing of a public declaration.
</P>
<P>
The development project will cost 960 million rand or 160
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng Province led the country by building 103,700 housing
units, which had already benefited about 400,000 people by March
this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the provincial government has provided about
80,000 people with water and sanitation over the past five years,
Mofeng said.
</P>
<P>
Gauteng is the smallest but the most densely populated province
in South Africa. It was estimated that about 40,000 people,

<TEXT>
<P>
Levene noted that many Chinese officials in charge of finance
and practitioners in the field are highly professional, and added
that their assistance and supervision will help Chinese
enterprises gain overseas listings.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged Chinese enterprises seeking overseas listings
to make ample preparations by acquainting themselves with rules
and regulations governing international securities markets.
</P>
<P>
Levene expressed understanding and support for the Chinese
government's policy of gradually opening financial and insurance
markets. He also noted the importance of the government's decision
to continue the opening effort.
</P>
<P>
The Lord Mayor of London voiced pleasure at seeing the sound
development of Sino-British relations in recent years, and noted
that last year's exchange of visits by Prime Minister Tony Blair
and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji strengthened bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, sound bilateral ties have provided a solid
foundation for exchanges and cooperation in the trade, economic
and financial sectors, said Levene.
</P>
<P>
Levene recounted his visit to Beijing three years ago at a time
when many British insurance companies were attempting to gain
operating licenses in China. He also expressed great pleasure that
two British companies have since succeeded in their efforts.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen foreign insurance companies have received approval to
operate in China, including the Royal Sun Alliance Insurance Group
and Prudential Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The city of London, Britain's major financial and business
center, is home to the headquarters operations of several nations'
largest banks and insurance companies. A total of 540 foreign
banks, including the Bank of China, have established branches in
the city.

<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Li Zhengshu, a Beijing factory
worker, bought a color TV, a refrigerator, a washing machine, an
air conditioner, and electric appliances worth more than 50,000
yuan (some 6,000 U.S. dollars), by making a 20,000-yuan down
payment at Parkson Shopping Center.
</P>
<P>
Li was one of the first Chinese to benefit from the consumer
credit business launched by Chinese banks in early March. Beijing
Commercial Bank paid off the rest of the 30,000 yuan that Li owed
and she will make monthly payments to the bank on the principal
and interest.
</P>
<P>
In early March, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China's
central bank, gave the go-ahead to commercial banks on consumer
credit and issued guidelines on the business. A PBOC spokesman
says that this will help promote consumer spending, boost market
demand, and push forward the steady development of the nation's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks can help businesses and housing and motor
vehicle purchases. The central bank's decision has been met with
enthusiasm by commercial banks, which have opened credit lines for
motor vehicle, housing, and consumer goods purchases and even for
weddings, college tuition, and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The loans range in size from 2,000 yuan to as much as 100,000
yuan.

<HEADLINE> China To Increase Housing Sales Through Financial Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to commercialize
the housing business by setting up banks, funds, loans, and
mortgages for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
According to Xie Jiajing, a senior Construction Ministry
official, China is still suffering from slack housing sales, with
50 million sq.m. of housing lying idle, and the lack of ability to
purchase housing and the high housing prices account for it.
</P>
<P>
So, to promote the housing business and carry out the new
housing reforms, finance departments have already reduced the
number of unreasonable taxes in housing construction and sales and
the country is setting up banks on a trial basis in a number of
cities that are expected to provide financial guarantees, loans,
and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
Public housing funds now exceed 130 billion yuan and Shanghai,
which was the first city to introduce a public housing fund, has
15 billion yuan in public housing fund.

<HEADLINE> 1st Quarter Quiet for Industrial Action in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The loss of 25,000 man-days
to strikes in the first quarter of the year was the lowest in the
past eight years in South Africa, The Citizen daily Wednesday
quoted a labor relations consultancy official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Compared to 288,000 man-days lost to industrial action in the
first quarter of 1998, 78,000 in 1997, and 175,000 in 1996, the
first quarter of this year could be considered quiet.
</P>
<P>
However, increased industrial action is expected later this
year as the bulk of wage negotiations began in the second half, an
official from Andrew Levy and Associates said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As this will coincide with the election period, it may have
the effect of raising worker expectations," said the official.
</P>
<P>
It anticipated that wages would again form the major strike
trigger in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"There is additional pressure on wage earners as formal sector
job losses continue at alarming rates and inflation and high
interest rates erode workers' purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
"Employers, on the other hand, are expected to push for lower
(wage) increases based on trading figures for the previous 12
months.
</P>
<P>
"This scenario is likely to produce some hard bargaining during
1999 which will test the resolve of both sides," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
Wage settlements had continued to fall, from an average
increase of 8.6 percent in 1998 to eight percent in March this
year.
</P>
<P>
With inflation expected to average between seven and eight
percent this year, wage settlements are expected to fall within
this range this year, it said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Credit Expected to Breathe Life into China's Markets (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new decision has been embraced by consumers as well. In the
past month, department stores in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and
other big cities have seen a surge in the credit business.
</P>
<P>
Sources at China Industrial and Commercial Bank (CICB) say that
in Tianjin and Shanghai the bank handled more than 600 consumer
credit deals worth more than 7 million yuan in one month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that when the credit business is fully developed
it will be a powerful force in the nation's economy. But, they add,
because of the Chinese tendency to save money, it will take time
to get them to change their traditional ways and spend more.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xiao Zhuoji of Beijing University says that, based on
international experience, consumer credit business is a
significant step in stimulating consumer spending, improving
banks' credit structure, and holding financial risks to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
He says that the most pressing problem now is to cultivate more
open mentality among consumers, and come up with credit-oriented
policies and systems.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that a credit system should be established as
early as possible, with credit records, credit appraisals, and
credit risk controls.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Wang Wei of the State Council's Development and Research
Center says that banks should use bank cards more fully to develop
consumer credit. China's commercial banks have issued more than 50
million credit cards and the card holders are an important part of
the business.
</P>
<P>
The success in the credit business has encouraged commercial
banks, which have announced plans to expand the business. CICB has
extended its consumer credit business to 41 large and medium-sized
cities, and the Bank of China plans to make consumer credit
account for 10 percent of its new loans.

<HEADLINE> ICBC Pledges Strengthened Support for Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), one of the country's four state banks, today
pledged to improve financial services for small- and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC plans to offer various financial services, including

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams British-Dutch Draft Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 21 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi daily on Wednesday
lashed out at the British-Dutch draft resolution to the U.N.
Security Council on the Iraqi issue, describing it as very bad and
aims at restricting its hands.
</P>
<P>
Al-Thawra daily, organ of the Arab Baath Socialist Party, said
in an article that Iraq had repeatedly confirmed that lifting the
embargo was a legal right and it was not a gift or reward from the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Netherlands proposed last Friday to abolish the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction with an enlarged body to carry out
more intrusive inspections of Iraq's banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
They also proposed to ease sanctions against Iraq, including
lifting the ceiling by which Iraq could sell its oil to buy food,
medicines and other necessities for its people.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper article said that Paragraph 22 of the Security
Council resolution 687 is very clear and it binds the Council to
fulfil its reciprocal obligations vis-a-vis Iraq by lifting the
embargo since Iraq had honored all its commitments.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that any new draft designed to delay the lifting of
embargo off Iraq was unacceptable and futile.
</P>
<P>
"Any party that wants positive and constructive relations
between Iraq and the Security Council should be aware that the
Council must fulfil its obligations toward Iraq..." said the
article.
</P>
<P>
Russia last Friday also proposed a new plan to the Council in a
bid to break the Council's impasse on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In its plan, Russia recommended to lift all the economic
sanctions against Iraq except an arms embargo in stages.
</P>
<P>
U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq have been suspended since last
December's U.S.-British airstrikes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has ever since announced that UNSCOM is dead and it will
not allow weapons inspections to resume. Instead, Iraq demands the
U.N. to lift the nine-year sanctions imposed on it following its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Senior Iranian Cleric Put Behind Bars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian cleric was
sentenced to 18 months in prison for defaming the Islamic regime,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Kadivar was put behind bars by the special clergy court,
said the agency, quoting Kadivar's lawyer Seyed Hussein Musavi
Tabrizi as saying the sentence can be appealed and he will
protest to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said he will disclose the details of the sentence
later. However, the Iranian judiciary has not announced the
verdict against Kadivar.
</P>
<P>
Kadivar, a famous seminary lecturer and brother-in-law of the
Iranian moderate Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance
Ataollah Muhajerani, has been jailed since February 27 on charges
of "dissemination of lies" and "disturbing public opinion"
through his speeches and press interviews.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian special clergy court put him on an open trial on
April 14. Kadivar denied the charges and termed his arrest as a
politically-motivated move by the conservatives against the
moderates.
</P>
<P>
Kadivar said the special clergy court has no jurisdiction to
deal with political or press cases and his case should be
investigated by an ordinary court or the press court, which is
responsible for dealing with press offenses.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers said the verdict has poised a
serious challenge to the policy of Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami for freedom of speech.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Conservatives to Impeach Culture Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A group of 31 Iranian
conservative Majlis (parliament) deputies on Wednesday submitted
an impeachment motion on the moderate Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani.
</P>
<P>
The motion was read out at the end of the Majlis open session
Wednesday morning, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move came after the conservatives lodged sharp attacks on
Mohajerani's policy on press freedom, which was advocated by
President Mohammad Khatami during his presidential elections
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani is the second minister of Khatami's cabinet who was
targeted by the powerful conservatives, which still dominate the
country's most important organs, such as the judiciary, the
parliament and the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Last June, former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, another
close ally of President Khatami, was impeached by the Majlis on
charge of "creating tensions in the society, issuing provocative
statements and using inexperienced persons for the managerial
posts at the interior ministry."
</P>
<P>
Under the Majlis regulations, Mohajerani should appear before
the Majlis within 10 days to explain himself after the proposed
impeachment motion was presented.
</P>
<P>
Rumors on Mohajerani's possible impeachment have been widely
spreading since the Iranian new year (started on March 21). And many
moderate figures have warned that the conservatives have planned a
series of offensives to elbow the moderates out of the Iranian
political arena.

WASHINGTON -- As many as 25 people were killed Tuesday as two
heavily armed young men opened fire at a high school southwest of
Denver, capital of the Colorado State of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, believed to be former students at Columbine High
School, were found dead at the library after the shooting. They,
wearing black trench coats and masks, moved calmly through the
school library and giggled as they shot at students at lunch time.
Some witnesses said the gunmen, armed with automatic weapons and
explosives, appeared to have two particular targets -- minority
students and popular athletes, apparently taking revenge at the
school with 1,800 students. (US-School-Shooting)

UNITED NATIONS -- A senior Yugoslav diplomat Tuesday called on

<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations,
said that NATO, by bombing Yugoslavia, has challenged the
authority of the United Nations and the norm of international law.
Under the UN Charter, any military action against a sovereign and
independent country should first seek the approval of the UN
Security Council, which has the primary responsibility for the
maintenance of peace and security in the world. (UN-Yugoslavia-

BUCHAREST -- Romania's largest opposition party, the Social

unlimited" access to Romania's sky, noting NATO's military action
on Yugoslavia has worsened the tragic situation there.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting between SDP Chairman Ion
Iliescu, also former Romanian president, and President Emil
Constantinescu, the party said the Romanian parliament had already
clarified Romania's principled stand on the Kosovo crisis in a
resolution on March 30, in which Romania recognizes Yugoslavia's
territorial integrity and sovereignty and appeals for respect for
the legitimate rights of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. It noted
that under an agreement reached last October, Romania permits NATO
airplanes to enter its sky only under "urgent and unexpected
circumstances." The agreement is still effective and any new
decision on this matter by the authority should not go beyond it,
it added. (Romania-NATO-Opposition)

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Power Sector Reform on Course: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Minister of Mines and
Energy Fred Ohene-Kena has reiterated his government's commitment
to the power sector reforms, saying its implementation is on
course.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that in line with this commitment, the
government has come out with a power sector development policy,
which sets out the nature, scope and timing of the reforms, to be
implemented over three years, beginning this year, the Ghana News
Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
 At a press briefing in Accra, capital of Ghana, Ohene-Kena
said the main thrust of the reform is to transform Ghana into a
middle-income country within one generation and ensure that
Ghanaians have universal access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
It is also to sustain the transition to an open and liberal
market economy, shifting from the hitherto state administration of
the sector to private investment which will in turn support the
development of human resources and basic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Giving an overview of the policy, Ohene-Kena said it covers
policy framework, power sector reform and setting of priorities
over the three-year period.
</P>
<P>
He said the on-going structural and regulatory reforms and the
proposed divestiture of state-owned utilities are part of efforts
to promote private participation in the development of
infrastructure and services.
</P>
<P>
It will ensure that the existing state-owned entities transform
 themselves through public-private partnerships and joint ventures
into commercially viable Ghanaian power utilities and in turn,
assume leadership role in the development of the proposed West
Africa Power Pool.
</P>
<P>
"This is to ensure that electricity supply is made more
reliable, economically efficient and equitable so as to
effectively support the socio- economic development of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it would enable the sector to attract investment from
Ghanaians and foreign institutional investors, and also from other
private capital sources, including the Ghana Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the reform suffered a jolt during the power
crisis that hit the country between December 1997 and the last
quarter of 1998 but an emergency power supply expansion plan had
to be formulated to contain it within a short time frame.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform, government has since last year created
certain agencies to monitor and advise it on activities of players
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
They include the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission, to
regulate the setting of tariffs for, and enforcement of customer
service obligations of all public utilities, and the Energy
Commission which advises on strategies and policies toward
efficient and safe supply of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Some Independent Power Producers have also been licensed to
build, operate and transmit power.
</P>
<P>
They include Aggreko Plc and Cummins Power Generation Plc of
United Kingdom and KMR Power and Marathon Power, both of United
States.
</P>
<P>
Ohene-Kena said future legislation would have to be passed by
parliament to set up of other relevant agencies that will play a
key role in the reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the government hopes to create awareness on the reform
policy, details of which would be available in the local media and
on the Internet, to enable the public participate fully in its
progress.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry Exhausts Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Foreign Ministry used
up 391 million Zimbabwean dollars (10.2 million U.S.dollars)
allocated in the 1999 budget, after only three months into the
financial year, but the situation has improved after it got fresh
funds from the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Although some items on the vote still had funds by the end of
last month, the overall budget had already been exceeded,
prompting the ministry to freeze expenditure while it sought
supplementary funds from Treasury, the daily Herald quoted
ministry officials as saying in a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This poor financial position has caused the ministry to pay its
workers' salaries three days late last month, and the national
airline, Air Zimbabwe, has imposed an embargo on the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic bags that the ministry depends on to send documents
to the country's foreign missions and chanceries were not
delivered last month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge confirmed the financial
difficulties Tuesday. He blamed the exhaustion of the budget on
budgetary under- provisions, the removal of the equalization fund
from the current budget and the depreciation of the local currency
against major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who spoke to The Herald in the presence of his
deputy Nicholas Goche, said the situation returned to normal a few
weeks ago when the Ministry of Finance gave his ministry a
supplementary budget. However, he did not disclose how much he
had got from the Finance Ministry.

NICOSIA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen detainees in Cyprus'
southern Larnaca town Tuesday went on a hunger strike to protest
against their continued detention for illegal immigration, the
Cyprus Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Larnaca Police Chief Savvas Lardis and UNHCR Head of Liaison
Office Sharon Bernard confirmed the report.
</P>
<P>
The hunger-strikers say they are tired of being held as common
criminals without being convicted of any offense.

One of the detainees, who identified himself only as Siraf,
said, "We need a solution."
</P>

Bernard confirmed that Siraf had tried to commit suicide and he

</P>
<P>
Reports say there are 24 alleged illegal immigrants under
virtual house arrest in a hotel in the southwestern Limassol town
since last June.
</P>
<P>
They were among the 113 illegal migrants rescued from a leaky
fishing boat in Cyprus waters last year. Most of them have been
deported.

Another 68 are being held on the British Base in Cyprus,
following their landing on the shores of the Base last autumn.

<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. wholesale chain Costco is
hoping to get licensed to expand its operations in China.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi here this
morning, James Dennis Sinegal, the CEO of Costco, said he expects
to get Costco operating in China as soon as possible. He is in
Beijing with a delegation of senior Costco officials to push for
greater cooperation with their Chinese partner Normart, a retail
company.
</P>
<P>
Wu told Sinegal that China is opening up its retail sector
gradually, but said she welcomes Costco and that their application
has been submitted to the State Council for final approval. The
Chinese government has approved a total of 20 joint retail-sales
ventures.
</P>
<P>
Sinegal said that Costco is ready to establish long-term
cooperative relations with China and pledged to share management
ideas with the Chinese partners and to help train personnel.
Costco will also consider exporting more Chinese products to other
countries through its global warehouse network.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that the group will go to Japan for an opening
ceremony for a new Costco warehouse. The company has nearly 300
warehouses in the United States, Canada, Britain, Mexico, Japan,
the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Taiwan, with total annual sales
of 26 billion U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Israel Agrees to Provide Jordan with Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel have solved a
water dispute after Israel promised to provide Jordan with full
water share as stipulated in the 1994 peace treaty, the
semi-official Jordan Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Israel, during a joint water committee meeting last
week, reached an agreement under which Jordan will receive 55
million cubic meters of water from the Jewish state in 1999, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The new arrangement is a solution to the water dispute between
the two countries which erupted last month when Israel proposed to
cut its water supplies to Jordan by over 40 percent this summer
due to a severe drought that hit both countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan lodged a strong protest against the Israeli proposal to
cut water supplies, and stressed the water clauses were the key
elements in the 1994 peace treaty between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The water dispute posed a most serious threat to
Jordanian-Israeli ties in years, and more than 15 Jordanian
parliamentarians proposed to scrap the whole peace treaty if
Israel failed to carry out its water clauses.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has a Mediterranean weather and relies mainly on
rainwater to meet its water needs in winter, but will depend
largely on water supplies from Israel in summer when it has fewer
raindrops.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1999, Jordan needs some 283 million cubic
meters of water to meet its domestic demands, but its water
capacity only provides 254 million cubic meters, or a 10
percent deficit.

<HEADLINE> Most Ethiopia's State-owned Firms at Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Out of the 163 state-owned
development enterprises in Ethiopia, 114 are operating profitably,
according to Assefa Abraha, an official in charge of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Assefa was quoted by Wednesday's Ethiopian Herald newspaper as
saying that the 114 enterprises made pre-tax profits totalling
about 227 million U. S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the remaining 49 organizations, some of which
are textile factories, incurred a loss of nearly 34 million
dollars in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Major efforts have been underway to ensure that members of the
administrations assigned to these enterprises are drawn from
various professional fields, said the official, adding that a
total of 596 experts including legal, management and engineering
staff are needed for the job at the moment.

<HEADLINE> Experts Cite Importance of Nutritious Breakfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Nutritionists are urging most
Chinese to change their diets and suggest that the breakfast menu
should include milk and eggs rather than junk foods.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a large number of Chinese citizens pay little
attention to breakfast has resulted in increasing malnutrition in
spite of comparatively high living standards, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese people consume an adequate level of calories, but
nonetheless fall short in terms of nutrition. Therefore, milk and
eggs are a good choice for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
Song Chungang, chairman of the Dairy Industry Association,
noted that the average per capita consumption of milk in China
stands at only 6.6 kg, far short of the worldwide average was 102
kg and the 300 kg level in developed countries 300 kg.
</P>
<P>
The average cost for a bottle of milk stands at one yuan, with
one kilogram eggs costing six yuan, according to Song.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jianping, deputy director of the National Food and
Nutrition Council, recently suggested the initiation of a
nationwide campaign to increase the milk intake for children who
run the risk of contracting diseases related to insufficient
consumption of dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Recent surveys show that a large number of Chinese children
suffer from rickets and osteoporosis due to inadequate milk
consumption.
</P>
<P>
A nationwide campaign launched in 1996 to promote the
consumption of soybean milk has proved highly effective. The
Ministry of Agriculture, the State Administration of Light
Industry and ministries of Education and Health have also launched
related programs.
</P>
<P>
The incidence rate of anemia for male and female students
attending 22 schools in 10 provinces dropped by 7.9 and 8.5
percentage points respectively following the introduction of
soybean milk as a regular breakfast item, said Jiang.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM Urges Prudent Use of Natural Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 21 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny
Shipley Wednesday called for using natural resources in "a prudent
and
sustainable manner."
</P>
<P>
While signing a UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific
and
Cultural Organization) Oceans Charter at the parliament building
here
Wednesday, Shipley said New Zealand already has the fourth largest

exclusive economic zone in the world which covers about 4 million
square
kilometers of ocean.
</P>
<P>
"This could be extended by a further 2.4 million square
kilometers,
giving us access to resources that could be worth trillions of
dollars,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, New

Zealand has until 2006 to claim an extension of the ocean floor
under its
jurisdiction. The extension will mean more than 6 million square
kilometers of ocean floor or about 1 percent of the earth's
surface would
come under New Zealand's control.
</P>
<P>
The stuff below the sea holds "an enormous amount of wealth
that will
be the new economic frontier of the future," Shipley said.
</P>
<P>
But she warned that with the opportunities come
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"We have been fortunate to inherit a vast ocean region that is
rich in
resources. But we must manage these resources in a prudent and
sustainable manner to preserve our wider ecosystem and the
interests of
future generations," she said.
</P>
<P>
The UNESCO Oceans Charter is aimed at promoting awareness of
the
ocean environment and its importance to society.

<P>
ANKARA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cumhuriyet (Republic):
</P>
<P>
-- A western diplomat here said that the Nationalist Movement
Party (MHP), the second political party elected in Sunday's local
and parliamentary elections, will not help the Turkish foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat added that a nationalist foreign policy of Turkey
may increase tension on Turkish-Greek ties.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):
</P>
<P>
-- Some people from the Motherland Party (ANAP) and the
True Path Party (DYP) hoped that ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz and
DYP Chairwoman Tansu Ciller, the losers in Sunday's elections,
should unify their parties.
</P>
<P>
Due to the long discord between the two central-right parties,
the ANAP and DYP got less support from the people by winning only
over 13 percent and over 12 percent of the votes in the elections,
descending to the fourth and fifth parties separately from the
second and third parties in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel went to the United States
to attend the summit on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of
the establishment of the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that the NATO has been the "backbone for the peace
and security in Europe" for the past 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Budget Deficit Falls in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's budget deficit over
expenditure fell to 36.2 percent in the first quarter this year,
compared with 41.5 percent in the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Finance, government expenditure
declined to 1.01 billion U.S. dollars in the first three
months of this year against 1.16 billion dollars in the same
period last year, a drop of 148.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Revenues, however, fell to 644 million dollars from 678
million dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit figure for the first quarter just fell within
the 40 percent target set in the overdue 1999 budget bill
endorsed by the cabinet two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The bill introduced a hefty tax increase in car gasoline and
customs duties in an effort to raise more government revenues and
bring down huge budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit finished at 43 percent of expenditures in
1998, equal to around 14 percent of gross domestic product(GDP),
from 24 percent of GDP in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said revenues will start improving once
Parliament had approved the budget bill before mid-June.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Needs Foreign Help in Fight Against Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda needs technical and
logistics help from foreign countries in its fight against drug
abuse and smuggling, a senior police officer told Xinhua Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Johnson Ayela, Director of Uganda's Anti-Narcotics Unit, said
that his unit is far from enough to completely stop drug abuse and
smuggling in this country because more and more drug traffickers
are using Uganda as a transit.
</P>
<P>
"We already got some help from Britain, Egypt, the United
States, Germany and the United Nations Drug Control Program," the
superintendent said. "But we are still short of hands and
technology to effectively check the drug trafficking activities."
</P>
<P>
The anti-narcotics unit, established in 1986, has only roughly
100 officers deployed at the major airports and border points, he
added.
</P>
<P>
There are many marijuana plantations in the forests in remote
areas in Uganda, he acknowledged. But he said his unit could not
establish the precise location of the plantations because they do
not have helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Poor conditions of infrastructures in these areas also hamper
their efforts against marijuana growing.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan police impounded four kilograms of cocaine in 1996, 1.6
kilograms in 1997 and no cocaine was seized in 1998. A total of
17 kilograms of heroin and 1,000 tons of marijuana have been
seized over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Ayela said the destinations of the cocaine and heroin are
mostly Europe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
To better coordinate their efforts in this field,
anti-narcotics police from Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania have met
every six months since 1996.

</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that in line with this commitment, the
government has come out with a power sector development policy,
which sets out the nature, scope and timing of the reforms, to be
implemented over three years, beginning this year, the Ghana News
Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
 At a press briefing in Accra, capital of Ghana, Ohene-Kena
said the main thrust of the reform is to transform Ghana into a
middle-income country within one generation and ensure that
Ghanaians have universal access to electriation of
the sector to private investment which will in turn support the
development of human resources and basic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Giving an overview of the policy, Ohene-Kena said it covers
policy framework, power sector reform and setting of priorities
over the three-year period.
</P>
<P>
He said the on-going structural and regulatory reforms and the
proposed divestiture of state-owned utilities are part of efforts
to promote private participation in the development of
infrastructure and services.
</P>
<P>
It will ensure that the existing state-owned entities transform
 themselves through public-private partnerships and joint ventures
into commercially viable Ghanaian power utilities and in turn,
assume leadership role in the development of the proposed West
Africa Power Pool.
</P>
<P>
"This is to ensure that electricity supply is made more
reliable, economically efficient and equitable so as to
effectively support the socio- economic development of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it would enable the sector to attract investment from
Ghanaians and foreign institutional investors, and also from other
private capital sources, including the Ghana Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the reform suffered a jolt during the power
crisis that hit the country between December 1997 and the last
quarter of 1998 but an emergency power supply expansion plan had
to be formulated to contain it within a short time frame.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform, government has since last year created
certain agencies to monitor and advise it onlicensed to
build, operate and transmit power.
</P>
<P>
They include Aggreko Plc and Cummins Power Generation Plc of
Unitessed by
parliament to set up of other relevant agencies that will play a
key role in the reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the govnet, to enable the public participate fully in its
progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Minister of Mines and
Energy Fred Ohene-Kena has reiterated his government's commitment
to the power sector reforms, saying its implementation is on
course.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that in line with this commitment, the
government has come out with a power sector development policy,

said the main thrust of the reform is to transform Ghana into a
middle-income country within one generation and ensure that
Ghanaians have universal access to electricity.
</P>
<P>
It is also to sustain the transition to an open and liberal
market economy, shifting from the hitherto state administration of
the sector to private investment which will in turn support the
development of human resources and basic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Giving an overview of the policy, Ohene-Kena said it covers
policy framework, power sector reform and setting of priorities
over the three-year period.

</P>
<P>
As part of the reform, government has since last year created
certain agencies to monitor and advise it on activities of players
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
They include the Public Utilities Regulatory Commission, to
regulate the setting of tariffs for, and enforcement of customer
service obligations of all public utilities, and the Energy
Commission which advises on strategies and policies toward
efficient and safe supply of electricity.
</P>
<P>
Some Independent Power Producers have also been licensed to
build, operate and transmit power.
</P>
<P>
They include Aggreko Plc and Cummins Power Generation Plc of

<P>
Ohene-Kena said future legislation would have to be passed by

key role in the reforms.
</P>

He said the government hopes to create awareness on the reform
policy, details of which would be available in the local media and

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry Exhausts Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Foreign Ministry used
up 391 million Zimbabwean dollars (10.2 million U.S.dollars)
allocated in the 1999 budget, after only three months into the
financial year, but the situation has improved after it got fresh
funds from the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Although some items on the vote still had funds by the end of
last month, the overall budget had already been exceeded,
prompting the ministry to freeze expenditure while it sought
supplementary funds from Treasury, the daily Herald quoted
ministry officials as saying in a report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This poor financial position has caused the ministry to pay its
workers' salaries three days late last month, and the national
airline, Air Zimbabwe, has imposed an embargo on the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic bags that the ministry depends on to send documents
to the country's foreign missions and chanceries were not
delivered last month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge confirmed the financial
difficulties Tuesday. He blamed the exhaustion of the budget on
budgetary under- provisions, the removal of the equalization fund
from the current budget and the depreciation of the local currency
against major currencies.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who spoke to The Herald in the presence of his
deputy Nicholas Goche, said the situation returned to normal a few
weeks ago when the Ministry of Finance gave his ministry a
supplementary budget. However, he did not disclose how much he
had got from the Finance Ministry.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
committed 60 million Sterling pounds (about 100 million U.S.

claims 2.7 million lives annually, mostly in African countries.
</P>
<P>

Major efforts have been underway to ensure that members of the
administrations assigned to these enterprises are drawn from
various professional fields, said the official, adding that a
total of 596 experts including legal, management and engineering
staff are needed for the job at the moment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Electronics Firms Eying Overseas Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China's largest machinery and
electronics enterprises are investing overseas to tap into the
international market to increase exports and promote economic
growth, according to Wu Kesong, the vice-chairman of the Haier
Group, China's big electric appliance manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Haier has investments in Indonesia, the Philippines, Malaysia,
and Yugoslavia and is planning to set up new plants in the Middle
East and America this year, Wu says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chunlan Group in Jiangsu Province has signed an
agreement with a large state-owned Russian company to put
technology and equipment in Russia to produce 200,000 air
conditioners a year.
</P>
<P>
Chunlan already has air conditioner and motorcycle factories in
Spain, Russia, Tunisia, Argentina, and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Many other well-known Chinese companies like the Meiling and
Changhong groups have plans to set up plants in the Middle East
and Africa. Analysts say that the rush to invest abroad represents
the latest official effort to increase exports of high value-added
goods like machinery and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Yang Gengchen, a Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation official, says that the Chinese Government is
encouraging the processing and assembly of products using
materials supplied by overseas companies. He says that the
ministry will select 50 powerful appliance and textile producers
to set up plants in Africa, Central Asia, the Middle East, Eastern
Europe, and South America this year and will give them
preferential treatment in capital allocation, taxes, use of
foreign exchange, and other areas.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China exported 66.54 billion US
dollars worth of machinery and electronics goods last year, up 12.
2 percent from 1997, in sharp contrast to the 0.5 percent growth
in total exports.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, machinery and electronics
goods exports were worth 16.47 billion US dollars, a jump of 39
percent from the same period of last year. China plans to export
71.5 billion US dollars worth of machinery and electronics goods
this year.
</P>
<P>
Initial figures show machinery and electronics goods accounting
for 35.9 percent of the turnover at the 85th China Export
Commodities Fair in the capital of Guangdong Province that began
on April 15 and will last through the end of the month.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Needs Foreign Help in Fight Against Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda needs technical and
logistics help from foreign countries in its fight against drug
abuse and smuggling, a senior police officer told Xinhua Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Johnson Ayela, Director of Uganda's Anti-Narcotics Unit, said
that his unit is far from enough to completely stop drug abuse and
smuggling in this country because more and more drug traffickers
are using Uganda as a transit.
</P>
<P>
"We already got some help from Britain, Egypt, the United
States, Germany and the United Nations Drug Control Program," the
superintendent said. "But we are still short of hands and
technology to effectively check the drug trafficking activities."
</P>
<P>
The anti-narcotics unit, established in 1986, has only roughly
100 officers deployed at the major airports and border points, he
added.
</P>
<P>
There are many marijuana plantations in the forests in remote
areas in Uganda, he acknowledged. But he said his unit could not
establish the precise location of the plantations because they do
not have helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Poor conditions of infrastructures in these areas also hamper
their efforts against marijuana growing.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan police impounded four kilograms of cocaine in 1996, 1.6
kilograms in 1997 and no cocaine was seized in 1998. A total of
17 kilograms of heroin and 1,000 tons of marijuana have been
seized over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Ayela said the destinations of the cocaine and heroin are
mostly Europe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
To better coordinate their efforts in this field,
anti-narcotics police from Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania have met
every six months since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall Sharply in Tokyo on IMF Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell sharply in Tokyo
Wednesday after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) revised
downward its forecast for Japan's economic growth, with the key
Nikkei index closing below 16,500 for the first time in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined by 202.09 points, or
1.21 percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 16,495.02.
</P>
<P>
Market players had expected share prices to rise, helped by
Tuesday's upturn on Wall Street, but the IMF's report dampened
market sentiment, stirring stock selling, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said Tuesday it forecasts Japan's economy to shrink by
1.4 percent this year, down from its projection four months
earlier and following the economy's 2.8 percent contraction the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 17.14 points or 1.29 percent to 1,311.
76.
</P>

Turnover on the major section declined to 492.44 million shares

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Power Sector Reform on Course: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Minister of Mines and
Energy Fred Ohene-Kena has reiterated his government's commitment
to the power sector reforms, saying its implementation is on
course.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that in line with this commitment, the
government has come out with a power sector development policy,
which sets out the nature, scope and timing of the reforms, to be
implemented over three years, beginning this year, the Ghana News
Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
 At a press briefing in Accra, capital of Ghana, Ohene-Kena
said the main thrust of the reform is to transform Ghana into a
middle-income country within one generation and ensure that
Ghanaians have universal access to electriation of
the sector to private investment which will in turn support the
development of human resources and basic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Giving an overview of the policy, Ohene-Kena said it covers
policy framework, power sector reform and setting of priorities
over the three-year period.
</P>
<P>
He said the on-going structural and regulatory reforms and the
proposed divestiture of state-owned utilities are part of efforts
to promote private participation in the development of
infrastructure and services.
</P>
<P>
It will ensure that the existing state-owned entities transform
 themselves through public-private partnerships and joint ventures
into commercially viable Ghanaian power utilities and in turn,
assume leadership role in the development of the proposed West
Africa Power Pool.
</P>
<P>
"This is to ensure that electricity supply is made more
reliable, economically efficient and equitable so as to
effectively support the socio- economic development of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it would enable the sector to attract investment from
Ghanaians and foreign institutional investors, and also from other
private capital sources, including the Ghana Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the reform suffered a jolt during the power
crisis that hit the country between December 1997 and the last
quarter of 1998 but an emergency power supply expansion plan had
to be formulated to contain it within a short time frame.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform, government has since last year created
certain agencies to monitor and advise it onlicensed to
build, operate and transmit power.
</P>
<P>
They include Aggreko Plc and Cummins Power Generation Plc of
Unitessed by
parliament to set up of other relevant agencies that will play a
key role in the reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the govnet, to enable the public participate fully in its
progress.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's exports of tea and coffee
to Egypt top 6.5 billion shillings (100 million U.S. dollars)
annually, a senior Kenyan official has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper Wednesday quoted Permanent Secretary
F. Awuor of Kenyan Trade Ministry as saying that trade between
the two countries was in favor of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Awuor told a trade delegation from Egypt that Kenya played an
active role in Egypt's entry into the Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) recently.
</P>
<P>
Awuor urged Egyptian business community to identify investment
areas in Kenya or seek joint ventures with Kenyans now that Kenya
has liberalized and opened up its economy.

Egyptian Ambassador to Kenya Mohammed Ibrahim said although
Egyptian exports to Kenya totalled only six million U.S. dollars,
the two countries should increase the trade volume rather than
correcting trade imbalances.
</P>
<P>
He said nowadays Egypt imports large quantity of tea from Kenya
and won't reduce the quantity just because Kenya imports less.

bankruptcy at the end of last year, making Gitic China's first
financial institution allowed to go bankrupt. This is the first

KAMPALA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Uganda needs technical and
logistics help from foreign countries in its fight against drug
abuse and smuggling, a senior police officer told Xinhua Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Johnson Ayela, Director of Uganda's Anti-Narcotics Unit, said
that his unit is far from enough to completely stop drug abuse and
smuggling in this country because more and more drug traffickers
are using Uganda as a transit.
</P>
<P>
"We already got some help from Britain, Egypt, the United
States, Germany and the United Nations Drug Control Program," the
superintendent said. "But we are still short of hands and
technology to effectively check the drug trafficking activities."
</P>
<P>
The anti-narcotics unit, established in 1986, has only roughlysts in remote
areas in Uganda, he acknowledged. But he said his unit could not
establish the precise location of the plantations because they do
not have helicopters.
</P>
<P>
Poor conditions of infrastructures in these areas also hamper
their efforts against marijuana growing.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Shaanxi Builds Environmental Protects with Foreign Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi Province
has used 170 million U.S. dollars in loans and donations from
abroad to create seven key environmental protection projects over
the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The largest of these is a comprehensive pollution control
project in Xi'an, the provincial capital, and the cities of
Xianyang and Tongchuan. The Asian Development Bank offered 156
million U.S. dollars to build a steam power-generating system in
these three cities, replacing coal with natural gas as the fuel in
urban districts, and to treat dust generated by a cement plant,
said Yang Jianjun, an official with the Shaanxi Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Other projects include the establishment of an automatic air-
monitoring system in Xi'an and Weinan, a Sino-Japanese venture to
control air pollution in developing countries, a program for
protecting natural resources in the Qinling Mountain range, and a
training course for environmental planning, management, and
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi is one of the most heavily polluted areas in China as
coal serves as 75 percent of the fuel in the province, and the
provincial capital of Xi'an is listed as one of the 10 most
polluted cities in the world. Tongchuan, a coal and building
material production center, is enveloped in smog all year round
and cannot be identified easily from satellite.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Power Sector Reform on Course: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian Minister of Mines and
Energy Fred Ohene-Kena has reiterated his government's commitment
to the power sector reforms, saying its implementation is on
course.
</P>
<P>
He said Tuesday that in line with this commitment, the
government has come out with a power sector development policy,
which sets out the nature, scope and timing of the reforms, to be
implemented over three years, beginning this year, the Ghana News
Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
 At a press briefin-Kena said it covers
policy framework, power sector reform and setting of priorities
over the three-year period.
</P>
<P>
He said the on-going structural and regulatory reforms and the
proposed divestiture of state-owned utilities are part oort the socio- economic
development of the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it would enable the sector to attract investment from
Ghanaians and foreign institutional investors, and also from other
private capital sources, including the Ghana Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the reform suffered a jolt during the power
crisis that hit the country between December 1997 and the last
quarter of 1998 but an emergency power supply expansion plan had
to be formulated to contain it within a short time frame.
</P>
<P>
As part of the reform, government has since last year created
certain agencies to monitor and advise it onlicensed to
build, operate and transmit power.
</P>
<P>
They include Aggreko Plc and Cummins Power Generation Plc of
Unitessed by
parliament to set up of other relevant agencies that will play a
key role in the reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said the govnet, to enable the public participate fully in its
progress.

Revenues, however, fell to 644 million dollars from 678

</P>
<P>
The deficit figure for the first quarter just fell within
the 40 percent target set in the overdue 1999 budget bill

The bill introduced a hefty tax increase in car gasoline and

The budget deficit finished at 43 percent of expenditures in
1998, equal to around 14 percent of gross domestic product(GDP),
from 24 percent of GDP in 1997.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Tim Duncan scored 23 of his 36
points in the second half to pace the San Antonio Spurs for an 83-
69 victory over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Duncan also grabbed 10 rebounds for his 30th double-double of

<HEADLINE> Stock Exchange Records 32 Percent First Quarter Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Turnover on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange dropped 32 percent on an annual basis to 156.4 billion
yuan during the first quarter of the year in spite of active
trading in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the plunge in total volume to low-level
investor interest in the days leading up to this year's
traditional Spring Festival on February 16 and the extended
trading break during the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Composite Stock Index (CSI) ended March at 1,158.
05 points, up 14 points on the start of the year. The SSE-30 Index,
based on 30 blue chip shares, finished the first quarter at 2,747
points, down 16 points.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai bourse raised funds totaling 3.1 billion yuan from
eight new stocks listed during the first three months. The 486
companies listed on the Shanghai exchange by the end of March
involved share issues valued at 132.38 billion yuan and market
capitalization of well over 1.1 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly trading volume declined on an annual basis, with
market development trends since the Spring Festival indicating
that strong investor confidence, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
Economists noted that a strong economy during 1999 will provide
the fundamental basis for stable development of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy grew 8.3 percent during the first quarter,
with the economic growth rate for 1998 ending at 7.8 percent and
this year's rate expected to hit seven percent.

treasury bonds hit 18.84 billion yuan and 387.78 billion yuan

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Examines Changes Brought by E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Electronic commerce has
altered and is continuing to significantly change traditional
business philosophies across a broad spectrum of industries,
commerce and finance, according to a Merrill Lynch research report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
E-commerce is a far-reaching business concept, not just a
unique technology, said analysts at Merrill Lynch, one of the
world's leading financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
They examined how the e-commerce is altering the ways of doing
business in different industries from advertising to
telecommunication services. They also discussed e-commerce's
implications for accounting practices as well as government
regulation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The report said the revolutionary changes prompted by e-
commerce could also increase outsourcing and motivate companies in
non-Internet industries to re-engineer themselves in order to take
advantage of the new technology.
</P>
<P>
Information technology which includes e-commerce, the report
said, has shown exponential growth and already contributes
meaningfully to the macroeconomic performance of the United States.
This includes decline of inflation, strong productivity gains and
continued growth in employment.
</P>
<P>
Companies in information-oriented industries such as banking,
brokerage and publishing, already have been profoundly affected by
e-commerce, the study found.
</P>
<P>
Other industries, such as freight forwarding and insurance, are
now re-defining themselves. Still others, such as real estate,
should expect to feel e-commerce's influence as the Internet tends
to "cannibalize" retail sales away from store-based retailers,
reducing in some cases the underlying value of retail real estate,
the study suggested.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Gets Aid Commitments of US$2.04 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has got fresh aid
commitments of 2.04 billion U.S. dollars for the 1999-2000 fiscal
year in the Bangladesh Development Forum Meeting that concluded
Tuesday in Paris, press reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This year's commitment is 104 million dollars more than last
year's 1.9 billion dollars. But, the commitment for last year rose
to 2.22 billion dollars when the donors extended their financial
cooperation in flood rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government sought 2.04 billion dollars from the
donors, who were committed to providing the same amount,
Bangladesh's Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kabria was quoted as saying
in Paris right after the two-day meeting which was earlier known
as the Aid Consortium Meeting.
</P>
<P>
There was no scope of confusion about the commitment of aid,
Kabria said, adding that the donors found the required amount
"reasonable" and "realistic" and subsequently they agreed to
provide it.
</P>
<P>
This year's meeting further strengthened the relations between
the donors and the Bangladeshi government, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Kabria pointed out that like previous years, donors also
underscored the need for accelerating the reform process in
different sectors, including finance and banking, administration,
legal system, education, health and power.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has made significant progress in implementing
reforms but many more challenges are still to be met, Kabria
added.

<HEADLINE> Leading Romanian Opposition Against Opening Sky to NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Romania's largest opposition
party, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), said Tuesday it opposes
giving NATO "unlimited" access to Romania's sky, noting NATO's
military action on Yugoslavia has worsened the tragic situation
there.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a meeting between SDP Chairman Ion
Iliescu, also former Romanian president, and President Emil
Constantinescu, the party said the Romanian parliament had already
clarified Romania's principled stand on the Kosovo crisis in a
resolution on March 30, in which Romania recognizes Yugoslavia's
territorial integrity and sovereignty and appeals for respect for
the legitimate rights of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It noted that under an agreement reached last October, Romania
permits NATO airplanes to enter its sky only under "urgent and
unexpected circumstances." The agreement is still effective and
any new decision on this matter by the authority should not go
beyond it, it added.
</P>
<P>
It said if NATO's request for "unlimited" access to Romania's
sky is to facilitate its military attacks on Yugoslavia, Romania's
meeting the request would mean unilaterally violating its
friendship, good-neighborliness and cooperation treaty with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The treaty stipulates that either side must not provide any
support for a third party attacking the other, still less open its
territory and sky to the third party.
</P>
<P>
The SDP appealed to the parliament and government to work
actively for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Supreme Council of Romanian Defense decided to
meet NATO's request for "unlimited" access to Romania's sky.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that President Constantinescu consulted with
leaders of the ruling coalition and opposition before the decision.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Star Sprinter Will be Cleared: Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's top woman sprinter
Susanthika Jayasinghe has very good reasons to be acquitted of all
doping charges by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (
IAAF) at the hearing in Monaco this week, said her lawyer Daya
Perera.
</P>
<P>
"We are all confident that justice will be done to Susanthika
at this hearing," Perera told The Island newspaper published on
Wednesday, adding that if by chance the IAAF penalizes her they
are ready to appeal to even a higher body.
</P>
<P>
Susanthika's lawyer said the main point at the inquiry will be
the questionable and the highly irregular manner in which her off
season drug test was conducted last March.
</P>
<P>
"There are certain rules and all those had been simply violated
by the Sri Lankan authorities who conducted the test," he said.
</P>
<P>
Susanthika, a 200 meters silver medallist at the World Athletic
Championships in Athens, is Sri Lanka's only athlete ever to win a
medal at the world class events.
</P>
<P>
She was suspended in April after testing positive for the
steroid nandrolone but had her ban lifted by the Sri Lankan
athletics authorities.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF Doping Commission has recommended a two-year ban but a
final decision on whether to implement it, reduce it or exonerate
the athlete depends on the arbitration panel's decision, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe left Sri Lanka in January to train in the United
States to prepare for the World Athletic Championships to be held
in Spain in July.

The ministry attributed the rise, which has gained for two

about 416.6 billion dollars) in the fiscal of 1998, while imports

marking the first decline in five fiscal years, the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls For Actions to Prevent Financial Crises in Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday urged the international community to take steps to
strengthen the global financial system in a bid to prevent
financial crises from reaching catastrophic stages in the future.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his top economic advisers, Clinton said the
United States would work with finance ministers from the world's
major economies, meeting in Washington this weekend, to build
support for his financial proposals before a June summit in
Germany of leaders of the major industrial economies.
</P>
<P>
"Some economies once in crisis are beginning to turn the corner,
but substantial risks and challenges remain," Clinton said. "This
is not a moment for complacency. It's a moment to act to prevent
financial crises from reaching catastrophic stages in the future."
</P>
<P>
Urging people to think about what the world has been through in
the last two years because of the problems in the global financial
system, Clinton stressed that "there are few more important things
for leaders to be doing than working on building a stable
financial architecture for the new century."
</P>
<P>
Outlining his agenda of financial reforms, the president said "
we industrial countries should take steps to reduce the entire
financial system's vulnerability to rapid capital flows and excess
leverage."
</P>
<P>
He said that the private sector should assume an appropriate
share of responsibility for responding to the financial crises.
</P>
<P>
"Developing countries should take more responsibility as well
by strengthening financial regulation and bank supervision and
developing sustainable debt management policies, thus avoiding
excessive reliance on short-term debt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also urged the international financial institutions to
focus their efforts on encouraging developing countries to adopt
sustainable exchange rate regimes and the macroeconomic policies
necessary to support them.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the most vulnerable citizens do not bear the
brunt of the financial crises, the president said the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank must "pay more
attention to social safety nets, working with countries to lay
strong foundations during good times and to maintain adequate
protections during bad times."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also called on rich creditors to provide assistance to
the poorest countries because these nations are burdened with
unsustainable levels of debt.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin is to give
more details on the proposals on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Twenty-five Killed in Colorado School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- As many as 25 people were
killed Tuesday as two heavily armed young men opened fire at a
high school southwest of Denver, capital of the Colorado State of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The gunmen, believed to be former students at Columbine High
School, were found dead at the library after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
They, wearing black trench coats and masks, moved calmly
through the school library and giggled as they shot at students at
lunch time.
</P>
<P>
"They were just shooting. They don't care who they shot at,"
one witness said.
</P>
<P>
However, some witnesses said the gunmen, armed with automatic
weapons and explosives, appeared to have two particular targets --
minority students and popular athletes, apparently taking revenge
at the school with 1,800 students.
</P>
<P>
Some students said the killers might have been members of a
group of eight to ten students who wear black trench coats every
day and are known as the "Trench Coat Mafia".
</P>
<P>
The social tensions between the school athletes and the "Trench
Coat Mafia" may have been one factor in the attack, which was
considered the worst mass shooting in the U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 others were hospitalized, some in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
Deploring the mass slaying of students, President Bill Clinton
said the federal government will provide any assistance needed to
deal with the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know yet all the how's and why's of this tragedy," he
told reporters in the briefing room of the White House.
</P>
<P>
"The prayers of the American people are with you," the
president told the victims and survivors.
</P>
<P>
A series of school shootings since 1997 shocked the nation and
led to calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of
troubled students.
</P>
<P>
Two were killed at a school in Pearl, Mississippi, three at
West Paducah, Kansas, five at Jonesboro, Arkansas, and two at a
school in Springfield, Oregon.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by U.S. Department of
Education last year, attacks with weapons accounted for almost 11,
000 incidents in public schools during the 1996-97 school year.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Japan's merchandise trade surplus
increased to 14,096.9 billion yen (about 118.8 billion dollars) in
the fiscal year of 1998, up 23.1 percent from the previous year,
the Finance Ministry said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise, which has gained for two
fiscal years in a row, to a plunge in imports.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports dropped 3.8 percent to 49,450.7 billion yen (
about 416.6 billion dollars) in the fiscal of 1998, while imports
totaled 35,353.8 billion yen (about 297.8 billion dollars), both
marking the first decline in five fiscal years, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States stood at 6,687.2 billion yen (56.3 billion dollars), up 23.
5 percent for the second straight year-on-year rise, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Trade surplus with Asian neighbors plunged 36.3 percent to 3,
803.8 billion yen (about 32.1 billion dollars), with Japan's
exports dropping 18.0 percent and imports dipping 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the 15-member European Union (EU), Japan's trade surplus
soared 42.5 percent to a record high of 4,265.4 billion yen (about
35.9 billion dollars), the ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Premier Zhu Winds up Successful Visit to Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji left
Vancouver, British Columbia, Tuesday afternoon for Beijing,
winding up his successful visit to Canada.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, overseas Chinese in Vancouver held a
grand farewell banquet in his honor with an attendance of more
than 1,000 guests.
</P>
<P>
During his seven-day stay in Canada, Zhu held talks with
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on bilateral relations and
international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The talks produced a number of agreements for cooperation in
various fields between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also made significant progress on China's entry
into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the banquet, hosted by Vancouver's Overseas Chinese
Welcoming Committee, Zhu said his visit to Canada has achieved
great success, not only in having reached the business and trade
agreements, but also in promoting contacts, expanding consensus
and strengthening friendship between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Zhu visited six cities from the Atlantic coast
to the Pacific, including St. John's, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary,
Victoria and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Zhu stressed that every success he made during his stay in
Canada was the logical result of following the guideline of
nurturing the Sino-Canadian comprehensive and cooperative
partnership and bringing it into the next century, set in 1997 by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Chretien.
</P>
<P>
Credit for the success should also be given to Canadian friends
and overseas Chinese, Zhu said. Their persistent efforts for the
exchanges and cooperation between the two countries deserved the
Chinese government and Chinese people's respect and gratitude, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China is becoming increasingly stronger thanks to the 20 years
of reforms now still under way, which have helped it tide over
financial crisis in Asia and the unprecedented wild flooding
across the country, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
China has now a very healthy economy, which is opening up an
even wider market and more opportunities for foreign investors in
various fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
That also was an ingredient for the success of the visit, he
said, calling on overseas Chinese and Canadian entrepreneurs to
explore more opportunities in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also took the occasion to refute the cliche of so-call "
independent Taiwan," reaffirming the Chinese government's
determination to reunify Taiwan with the motherland.
</P>
<P>
He said Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China in
history and that those advocate "independence of Taiwan" have
deliberately ignored the fact and betrayed their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
China seeks peaceful settlement for the reunification of Taiwan
with the motherland, but would not renounce the use of force when
necessary, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was sure that those advocating "independence of
Taiwan" will be doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Minister of Fisheries and Oceans David Anderson and
Premier of British Columbia Glen Clark were invited to the banquet.
In their enthusiastic remarks, they expressed their
congratulations to Zhu's successful visit.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (44) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 44 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the financial institutions in the MSAR be able to conduct
financial businesses freely? Will Renminbi become a legal tender
in the MSAR?
</P>
<P>
Owing to the small size of Macao's economy and some other
factors, the financial sector in Macao was not developed until a
banking act was promulgated in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Many private banks or money-lockers registered as banks one
after another and banks in Hong Kong and other overseas banks
started to set up branches in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The banking industry has entered a new stage of development
since 1982 when Macao promulgated a new banking act. A number of
influential overseas banks such as the Banque National de Paris of
France, the Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank were permitted to
set up branches in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Financial companies and investment centers have also been set
up and the deposit and loan business has expanded rapidly.
</P>
<P>
At present, the financial sector in Macao is controlled by
banks, which are the main channels of financing for companies,
enterprises and residents.
</P>
<P>
So far, Macao has no stock exchange of its own, no standard
securities companies nor listed companies. The amount of gold and
stocks traded on behalf of clients by financial institutions that
are also engaged in securities business is limited.
</P>
<P>
In Macao, foreign exchange is freely convertible, the
Government does not exercise any control on foreign exchange, and
there is no developed foreign exchange market. In short, the
financial industry in Macao is still in its infant stage and has
great potential for growth.
</P>
<P>
To protect the financial industry in Macao and facilitate its
steady growth, the Basic Law stipulates that the monetary and
financial systems of the MSAR shall be prescribed by law, that the
Government of the MSAR shall, on its own, formulate monetary and
financial policies, safeguard the free operation of
financial markets and all kinds of financial institutions, and
regulate and supervise them in accordance with law, after the
return of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The residents of Macao, including those residing overseas, may
continue to be freely engaged in financial activities such as
obtaining bank loans, insurance, foreign exchange transactions,
property mortgage, investment in gold and securities, etc.
</P>
<P>
A legal tender is a currency whose circulation in a country or
region is made compulsory by the country or region through
enacting a law.
</P>
<P>
The currencies that are in circulation in Macao are the Macao
Pataca and Hong Kong dollars, but the Macao Pataca is the only
currency that has the status of a legal tender.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Ultramarine, a Portuguese-funded bank in
Macao, had since 1905 been authorized by the Portuguese Macao
Government to issue the Macao Pataca.
</P>
<P>
On October 16, 1995, the Chinese and Portuguese sides agreed
through consultation that the Bank of China in Macao may also
issue the Macao Pataca.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the MSAR enjoy a high degree of autonomy in the
financial field, Article 108 of the Basic Law makes the following
provisions:
</P>
<P>
The Macao Pataca, as the legal tender in the MSAR, shall
continue to circulate.
</P>
<P>
The authority to issue the Macao Pataca shall be vested in the
Government of the MSAR which may authorize designated banks to
perform or continue to perform the function of its agents in the
issuance of Macao Pataca.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Pataca shall be freely convertible.
</P>
<P>
It is clear from these provisions that Renminbi will not be the
legal tender in the MSAR. The banks that are previously
authorized to issue the Macao Pataca shall continue to do so,
provided that they are authorized by the Government of the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Pataca that the Macao residents have can be converted
into various foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
The issuance of the Macao Pataca has been backed by a 100
percent reserve fund. Large business transactions in Macao are
usually settled in Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
As Macao is small in area and the circulation and issue of
Macao Pataca is not on a large scale, it is further provided in
Article 108 of the Basic Law that the issue of the Macao Pataca
must be backed by a 100 percent reserve fund.
</P>
<P>
This is what the government finance can afford and is conducive
to the stability of the Macao Pataca and to its role of leverage
in the economy of the Region.

<HEADLINE> Banana Exporting Countries Look for New Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The Banana Exporting
Countries Union (BECU) is looking for new markets in China and the
Middle East, a high official of the organization said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tax restrictions imposed by the European Union on the Central
American countries forced BECU members to turn to the gigantic
Asian market, Beatriz Garcia, coordinator of the Inter American
Agriculture Institute with the Banana Union, said.
</P>
<P>
Describing China as a very successful market, he added, "If
each of the 1.2 billion Chinese citizens ate just one banana
produced by the BECU countries, the problem of the search for new
markets would be resolved."
</P>
<P>
With respect to the Middle East markets, she said although they
are unstable, the banana producers are seeking an opening.
</P>
<P>
The banana producing countries are awaiting the implementation
of the tariff resolution by the World Trade Organization (WTO)
against the European Union countries for their restrictions placed
in 1989 on banana importation from Latin America.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March, the WTO ruled in favor of the U.S.
companies which operated in the region and had requested the
opening of the markets.
</P>
<P>
A panel of WTO arbitrators earlier this month gave the United
States the go-ahead in principle for 191.4 million dollars per
year of trade sanctions against the EU, while ruling in a separate
report that the EU's import policy for bananas was not in
compliance with WTO rules.
</P>
<P>
But the ruling is still not being carried out due to EU's red
tape and it will be a long trial process before it takes proper
effect, Garcia noted.

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Confident of Formal Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana expressed confidence that the peace talks resumed
on Tuesday will lead to formal negotiations between the government
and guerrillas before May 7.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said he was sure that the meeting would get the two
sides back to the negotiation table before May 7, the date on
which the demilitarized zone agreement runs out.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government resumed peace negotiations Tuesday in
a southern territory that was demilitarized last year with the
largest guerrilla group of the country, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
The demilitarized zone was part of FARC's precondition for the
talks last year. When it unilaterally suspended the talks in
January for the alleged government slackness in fighting rightist
paramilitary forces, Pastrana extended the deadline for bringing
the demilitarized zone under government control from January 7 to
May 7 to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana said that the most important thing for the time being
was to look for mechanisms to reach an agenda on the start of
formal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The list of topics proposed by both parties include fighting
against the paramilitary troops and elimination of illegal crops
in the zones controlled by the FARC.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Pastrana requested the second largest
guerrilla group of the country, the National Liberation Army (ELN),
to unconditionally release the 32 passengers of a commercial
airline they hijacked last week before the talks were opened.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana reportedly said Tuesday he might agree to the ELN's
demand for its own demilitarized zone in the north in order to
further peace talks with the guerrilla group, but stressed that
the move depended on the release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
The armed conflicts in Colombia, which have lasted for nearly
five decades, are the most protracted in Latin America, claiming
more than 35,000 lives in the last ten years alone.

BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Pinghu oil and gas field, the
first of its kind in the East China Sea, began operation today and
will provide 400,000 cubic meters of gas to nearby Shanghai daily
in its initial stage.
</P>
<P>
The newly established offshore oil and gas field is funded by

</P>
<P>
He added that the Pinghu oil and gas field is rich in gas

<HEADLINE> Survey of Job Seekers' Preferences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Computer-related jobs have become
the No 1 choice among young Chinese under 25, when they rate the
occupation they would prefer, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Preferences do not seem to be determined by salary, promotion
opportunities and social status, according to a survey conducted
by the Beijing-based Sunsway Information Company, which analyzed
questionnaires collected from 1,542 job seeks.
</P>
<P>
The average age of those who want to do clerical work, computer-
related jobs and advertising work is below 25.
</P>
<P>
Computer science, a fast changing industry with great
development potential and high income, is especially suitable for
young Chinese who are quick to accept new ideas, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Secretarial work does not require high academic achievement or
deep experience. However, it asks for adaptability and insight,
qualities found in young people.
</P>
<P>
The advertising industry, which also demands insights and
activity, is appreciated by those who enjoy challenges.
</P>
<P>
More mature people favors jobs with professional skills and
experience. Those people who seek jobs in the finance sector,
management, real estate and law firms are mostly above 27 years
old.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that most people engaged in business
management and the real estate industry are over 30.
</P>
<P>
When people gain more experience, they tend to choose jobs that
require high degrees of professionalism. They appreciate not only
challenges but also stability, according to the survey.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Encouraged to Get Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- More preferential policies and
better management are needed to develop "senior citizens'
universities, today's China Daily quotes an expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guohou, vice-president of the China National Committee on
Aging said that China intends to offer its constantly expanding
aged population more opportunities for higher education.
</P>
<P>
The country is encouraging the development of education for
senior citizens, according to a law on the protection of the
rights and interests of the elderly, which took effect in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Such encouragement should be reflected in concrete policies,"
Yu said.
</P>
<P>
Sponsors should be found to support these universities, he said.
These could include individually and collectively owned
enterprises, privately firms and joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Most senior citizens' universities in China are now run by
administrative departments such as local committees for elderly
people.
</P>
<P>
Yu called on all sectors of society to contribute more funding
for such universities.
</P>
<P>
"Education for the elderly should be listed in the national
education development program and receive State funding," Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of senior citizens universities depends largely
on how such a program is managed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The teaching staff in these universities consists predominately
of retired teachers.
</P>
<P>
Since the first of these universities was set up in Shandong
Province in 1983, China has witnessed a boom in the sector. There
are now more than 13,000 senior citizens' universities with 1.01
million students, according to association statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, people attending these universities account for less
than one percent of the country's elderly population.
</P>
<P>
Yu estimated that this figure would climb to two to three
percent in the first decade or two of the next century, the paper
says.

<HEADLINE> Study: El Nino May Help Slow Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- New study suggests that El
Nino may help slow the global warming, though it has been blamed
for many climate disorders such as floods and droughts, according
to a report published in the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The report said Richard A. Feely and his colleagues at the U.S.
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration have found that
from 1991 to 1994, when El Nino was said to contribute to the
warming of the Pacific, the carbon dioxide the ocean released was
in fact 30 percent to 80 percent less than usual.
</P>
<P>
The study believed that because carbon dioxide is one of the
primary greenhouse gases contributing to the warming of the planet,
the decrease of this greenhouse gas may therefore help slow the
global warming.

<HEADLINE> China Should Step up Fiscal System Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government should
enhance its financial strength and change its means of economic
management in developing a market economy.
</P>
<P>
The government has played a vital role in promoting China's
economic reform in the past two decades. However, it has also
failed to fulfill its duty in some aspects of economic management
and has led with an unduly heavy hand in other areas.
</P>
<P>
To propel an overall market-oriented development of the
national economy, the State should reform its investment and
financial systems, according to an article by Guo Shuqing, vice-
governor of southwestern Guizhou Province, published in today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Under a new investment system, industries should be opened to
various investors and competition introduced to monopoly
industries through reorganization, stock listings and public bids.
</P>
<P>
Financial methods should be diversified, in particular, direct
financing such as the issuance of stocks and bonds should be
emphasized. The government should control investment activities
indirectly through adjusting fiscal, monetary and tax policies.
</P>
<P>
The State should also further commercialize State-owned banks
while encouraging the development of local or regional commercial
banks to facilitate competition between banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank should apply asset-liability ratio criteria in
their management of commercial banks. And the State should also
make great efforts to develop capital markets.
</P>
<P>
Other tasks the government needs to complete include monetizing
income distribution, stepping up urbanization and opening wider to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
However, currently, reforms of the State-owned enterprises,
State-owned banks, the social security system and government
institutions are all impeded by unfinished fiscal reform.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, a more imperative task China faces in the coming
years is establishing a stronger and standardized fiscal system,
which is crucial for the realization of the government's role in
developing a market economy.

NANNING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- A rhesus monkey festival opened

playing with these wild creature.
</P>
<P>
The Longhu Mountain Nature Reserve's 1,000 hectares is almost
completely covered with forest, preserving 215 varieties of wild
animals and over 1,200 plant species. The reserve is also home to
2,500 rhesus monkeys, making it China's largest breeding center

they hope will develop a sense of wildlife protection.
</P>
<P>
The festival, the first of its kind in Guangxi, was scheduled
for the breeding season of the rhesus monkey, when tourists can
have the pleasure of watching the sporting of the animal.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thai Economic Growth Projected at 4 Percent for 2000 </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangkok Bank's research
department has projected that Thailand's economic growth could
reach 4 to 5 percent next year, higher than the government's
projection of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nimit Nontapunthawat, the bank's executive vice president who
oversees the research department was quoted Wednesday by The
Nation as saying the economy could grow beyond 3 percent on the
back of the 110-billion-baht (2.97 billion U.S. dollars) budget
deficit in next fiscal year, or 2 percent of the gross domestic
product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
However, the achievement of the growth target will depend on
how efficiently the government distributes the budget to related
units, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the research department has also revised its economic
forecast for this year from a contraction of 0.4 percent to a
growth of 1 percent. The revision was due to the changing economic
environment.
</P>
<P>
he said the economic stimulus package announced by the Thai
government on March 30 will help boost the country's economy this
year. Moreover, commercial banks are showing some progress in
their recaptalization and the trend of non-performing loans is
also showing a downward drift.
</P>
<P>
According to Nimit, there should be an improvement in the
economic conditions of Asian countries in the year 2000 after
their economies bottom out this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Many weapons left by the Japanese
army during its invasion of China more than six decades ago were
discovered recently at one old garrison in Dongning County in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The weapons include over 800 shells, landmines, anti-tank
grenades, revolvers, guns, swords, and more than 20 bombs, one
weighing more than 100 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Military expert Tian Penghan confirmed after an investigation
that one of the bombs contained bacteriological material, and five
of the shells were filled with toxic gas. Experts said this was
the first time bio-chemical weapons have ever been found at the
Dongning garrisons.
</P>
<P>
The old Dongning garrisons are located along the Sino-Russian
border, and extend for 20 kilometers. They served as a rear
supply base for the Japanese army during its aggression in China,
and six of these former underground garrisons have been discovered,
each covering an area of about 10,000 square meters.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Envoy: Halt to NATO Strikes "Precondition" for Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NATO "should stop its aggression (of Yugoslavia), (and) this is
the pre-condition for everything", Jovanoic said in an exclusive
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We are not a country opposing a political settlement. Just
opposite, we are a country endorsing the political settlement," he
said. "We are open to the political settlement."
</P>
<P>
In response to peace initiatives recently proposed by Germany,
Italy and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Jovanovic, former
foreign minister of Yugoslavia, said that the political solution "
should be based on the full respect of the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and
the guarantee of equal rights for all citizens and all national
communities living in the province."
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Yugoslavia rejected the key elements of Annan's
Kosovo initiative, saying an international military force in
Yugoslavia is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
A political solution can only be achieved "in direct talks
between our government and ethnic Albanians" in Kosovo, where
ethnic Albanians make up some 90 percent of the province's
population of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
"The international representatives will be invited (to the
talks) only as witnesses, not as mediators," he said, "because our
bad experience told us that these international mediators will
impose solutions on us."
</P>
<P>
In the fruitless peace talks in France, Western powers have
insisted Belgrade accept the military presence in Kosovo. NATO is
bombing Yugoslavia in intention to force the Yugoslav Government
to admit foreign troops into the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
"What NATO is doing is to put the only remaining part of the
Balkan under its direct military control, that's the real policy
of NATO," said Jovanovic, who earlier slammed the ongoing NATO
bombardment as a move to pave the way for NATO's eastward
expansion and its new strategy in the coming new century.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has set a very bad and dangerous precedent in the world,
and that is the omen for the future development" at the turn of
century, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO, without the authorization of the U.N. Security Council,
began its military attacks against Yugoslavia on March 24, a
sovereign and independent member of the UN, thus violating the UN
Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
So far, 600 civilians have been killed and 5,000 wounded, some
of them in critical conditions, Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, NATO's strikes have also created a large exodus of
refugees and serious humanitarian crisis in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Delay Communications Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will delay the
liberalization of its telecommunications industry by a year,
Wednesday's Bangkok Post reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT)
as saying the legal framework allowing a free telecommunications
market is unlikely to be in place before October next year, 12
months behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
The industry could not be fully liberalized this year, but
would be so by the end of next year, said Withu Rukswanichpongs,
the TOT's senior executive vice-president.
</P>
<P>
He said legislation had made much slower progress than
expected.
</P>
<P>
Responsible for domestic services, the TOT owns 41 percent of
the installed telephone lines nationwide and 51 percent of those
that have been connected.
</P>
<P>
It also grants concessions to two fixed-line operators,
TelecomAsia (TA) and Thai Telephone &AMP; Telecommunications (TT&AMP;T).
</P>
<P>
The TOT and the Communications Authority of Thailand (CAT),
which runs international networks, are due to be privatized soon
as part of a liberalization move of the Thai telecommunications
market.
</P>
<P>
Under this process, originally slated for the third quarter of
this year, the concession system agreed with TA, TT&AMP;T and other
license holders will be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
Withu said it was still unclear how the concession system would
be converted, but added that it would either be transformed into
shares or markets could be split up on a geographical basis.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Calls for Help to End NATO Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Yugoslav diplomat
Tuesday called on the international community to help bring an end
to the ongoing NATO bombing in order to restore peace and security
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Vladislav Jovanovic,
charge d'affaires of the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations,
said that NATO, by bombing Yugoslavia, has challenged the
authority of the United Nations and the norm of international law.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, any military action against a sovereign
and independent country should first seek the approval of the U.N.
Security Council, which has the primary responsibility for the
maintenance of peace and security in the world.
</P>
<P>
The unilateral NATO military action has put the international
law and order, built since the end of World War II, at stake, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO bombing "is an omen for the future development." If it
cannot be stopped, "the whole world will enter a dark age," the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia rejects any idea of foreign military or police
presence in the Serbian province of Kosovo, but civilian presence
can be negotiated, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The civilian presence in Kosovo should exclude those from NATO
countries, because aggressors can't be peace makers," he said.
</P>
<P>
China, Russia, India, Latin America and black Africa are
welcome to send their representatives to help the peace process in
Kosovo when the NATO aggression ends, he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the announced peace efforts by U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, Jovanovic said his country "welcomes the move,
" but progress can be made only if Annan "acts on his own,
independent from the United States and NATO."
</P>
<P>
Annan Monday announced his plan to visit Germany and Russia
April 26-29 to seek a political solution to the Kosovo problem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.N. chief put forward a five-point initiative,
calling upon Belgrade to immediately end expulsions of ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo, withdraw forces from the province and allow
an international peace-keeping force in the region.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he would urge NATO to suspend its airstrikes if
Yugoslavia complies.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia last Friday rejected the key element of Annan's
initiative, disallowing an international military presence in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said Belgrade's invitation to Annan to visit Kosovo
made last year is still open. "So he can get first-hand
information on what is really going on there."

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 21 (Xinhua) -- NATO jets early Wednesday bombed
the Belgrade headquarters of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party (SPS) and left the high-rise
building in flames.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade's civil defense chief Gragan Covic told a local
television station after the attack that the raid "certainly
caused casualties."
</P>
<P>
Several missiles hit the building, known as the Business
Center Usce, at 03:15 a.m. local time. The building is located in
the heart of Novi Belgrade, just opposite the Hyatt hotel where
many foreign reporters stay.
</P>
<P>
The top floor and the first three floors of the 25-storey
building were on fire when fire engines and other emergency
vehicles arrived at site.
</P>
<P>
Police have blocked access to the building, which also houses
several private radio and television stations, including Kosava,
which belongs to Milosevic's daughter Marija, and the popular
channel Pink.

<HEADLINE> About 208 Million Chinese Rise from Poverty in Past 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua)-- China has made giant strides in
its efforts to relieve poverty in the country, with the number of
people living under poverty line reduced to 42 million last year
from 250 million two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1978, the number of Chinese living below the subsistence
line accounted for one-fourth of the world's total; this
percentage is now one-tenth.
</P>
<P>
Poverty relief gained momentum after 1986 when China
systematically launched campaigns to help the poor who had no
access to electricity and clean drinking water in mountainous
areas.
</P>
<P>
During the 1986-1998 period, the central government invested
over 110 billion yuan in industrial projects aimed at raising the
income of the poor. At the same time, people from every segment of
society began donating more than three billion yuan in cash and
commodities every year.
</P>
<P>
Much effort has been given to improving the quality of the
infrastructure in impoverished regions, as well. The central
government employs local people to build highways, reservoirs, and
power plants, and has paid out some 25 billion yuan worth of grain,
edible oil, clothing and other articles of daily use.
</P>
<P>
China has also actively called on the richer coastal areas to
invest in the western regions, where a majority of the poor live.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the average annual income for poor farmers
rose to more than 1,200 yuan last year, from only 206 yuan in 1986.

<HEADLINE> Many Administrative Departments Lose Lawsuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- About one-quarter of Beijing's
administrative departments have lost lawsuits brought against them
by ordinary employees since China's courts began accepting such
litigation a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, local courts at various levels in Beijing
accepted 3,190 lawsuits lodged by Chinese workers against their
employing administrative organizations, and 3,002 of these cases
were seen through to their conclusions, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
The administrative lawsuit tribunals of the various courts in
China's capital also accepted 6,179 non-litigation cases involving
administrative misconduct, and completed 5,840 of them.
</P>
<P>
The Administrative Procedure Law was adopted at the second
plenary session of the Seventh National People's Congress (NPC) on
April 4, 1989, and became effective on October 1, 1990.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of this law has been widely heralded as an
important step made by China toward building socialist democratic
politics, as the law gives common people a powerful legal tool
with which to seek justice from their employing administrative
organizations.

<HEADLINE> NATO Has to Talk with Milosevic in End of Kosovo War: Dini </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini Tuesday warned that the NATO alliance may find it has to
negotiate with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in the end of
the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
In a testimony to a joint session of the Senate's foreign and
defense committees, he said that "in the end of the crisis, we
cannot rule out having to negotiate with Milosevic."
</P>
<P>
Dini said the next step in the crisis could be a UN Security
Council resolution which repeats the conditions for an end to the
bombing, but also assigns "various tasks, including security
guarantees to the various international organizations."
</P>
<P>
According to Dini, the NATO summit in Washington at the weekend
should make it possible to find an agreement on possible steps in
a negotiating process.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit would agree to still stronger forms of
military action short of the deployment of surface troops in
Kosovo, adding that as far as he knew, sending troops into Kosovo
has not been taken into consideration "at the moment".
</P>
<P>
Dini also confirmed that Italy "plans to keep its embassy in
Belgrade open and maintain diplomatic relations with Belgrade
unless it becomes impossible."

<HEADLINE> Lithuanians to Face Italians in Euro League Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zalgiris Kaunas of Lithuania upset
Greeks Olympiakos 87-71 on Tuesday to join holders Kinder Bologna
of Italy in the EuroLeague basketball final.
</P>
<P>
It was the first appearance for Kaunas in a Final Four
tournament who will meet the Italians after the holders beat city
rivals Teamsystem 62-57 in another semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Olympiakos, winners in 1997, could do little to counter the
Lithuanian champions who were anchored by former NBA player
Anthony Bowie with accurate shots and Czech center Jiri Zidek with
numerous rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Kaunas, which nurses Arvydas Sabonis for the Portland Trail
Blazers in NBA, led from start to finish and were 48-33 ahead at
halftime, stayed firmly in the second half as Bowie scored the
most of 19 points.
</P>
<P>
"We've had great games but this was really our best game of the
year," Bowie said.
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal, Kinder started perfectly to lead 20-9
after 11 minutes before Teamsystem, in a Final Four for the first
time, fought back to 32-34 at halftime through gunfires from
Carlton Myers, top scorer with 18 points.
</P>
<P>
Two points and a free throw from guard Marko Jaric put
Teamsystem to move ahead for the first time with a 35-34 lead one
minute into the second half, but Kinder, helped by centre Radoslav
Nesterovic, were soon back in command.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Approves Budget for Fiscal 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet approved on
Tuesday an 860-billion-baht (23.2 billion U.S. dollars) budget for
fiscal 2000 beginning October 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The draft -- a 4.2 percent increase from last fiscal year --
will carry a 110-billion-baht (2.97 billion dollars) deficit based
on the government's capability to generate a revenue of only 750
billion baht (20.2 billion dollars) from tax collection.
</P>
<P>
Next year's budget allocations are aimed largely at toning down
the adverse effects of the crisis on the social front, improving
the state administrative system, increasing the potential of
manpower and society for sustainable development and restructuring
the economy to hasten recovery, the Finance Ministry's Budget
Bureau was quoted Wednesday by the Bangkok Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Expenses for development projects have been set at 483.105
billion baht (13.05 billion dollars), up 1.4 percent from this
fiscal year and is 56.2 percent of next year's budget total, the
bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The largest chunk of the fund, or 222,401 million baht (6.01
billion dollars), will go to education-related causes.
</P>
<P>
The bureau estimated that the economy in 2000 would pick up
but growth would be small averaging 2-3 percent.

MANILA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' economic
activities in the first two months of the year were still weak,
signified by the sustained contraction in bank credit, the

contraction of 3.77 percent recorded in January this year, the

the country's demand, said the latest issue of the local Myanmar
Business Magazine.
</P>
<P>
The three fertilizer plants are Kyun Chaung, Salay and Kyaw
Swar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar needs about 800,000 tons of chemical fertilizer
including 700,000 tons of urea per year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the Myanmar government procured a large
amount of fertilizer locally and from abroad, it distributed less
to its farmers in fiscal 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
According to an official report on the country's agriculture in
the year, of the 394,000 tons of fertilizer obtained by the
state-run Myanmar Agriculture Service (MAS) and other
organizations, 289,000 tons were distributed, a decrease of 35,000
tons over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was attributed to the inability of farmers to buy
the fertilizer because of rising prices.
</P>
<P>
In fiscal 1997-98, the MAS distributed 117,000 tons of
fertilizer and 63.9 percent of the total amount was sold to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar produced 112,087 tons
of urea and imported 34 million U.S. dollars worth of it in 1998,
13 million less than the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Invite Foreign Tennis Coaches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 21 (Xinhua) -- With a sports science and
technology approach to improving national coaches' skills, the
Indonesian Tennis Association (Pelti) will invite a foreign expert
to hold two-month-long coaching clinics and workshops.
</P>
<P>
Association deputy secretary-general Benny Mailili said that
Pelti would request either Austrian Gebhard Gritsch or American
Dough McCurdy.
</P>
<P>
"Gritsch was considered the successful man who brought
Indonesia to a clean sweep in the 1997 Southeast Asian (SEA) Games
women's tennis events here," he was quoted by The Jakarta Post
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
During a five-month stint, Gritsch coached Indonesian women's
players Wynne Prakusya, Wukirasih Sawondari, Liza Andriyani and
Irawati Moerid Iskandar for the SEA Games. Indonesia won three
golds in the women's singles, doubles and the team titles by
beating top seeded Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Benny said Pelti's coach commission chief Atet Wijono also
asked McCurdy, director of development of the United States Tennis
Association, for help.
</P>
<P>
"McCurdy asked in his letter about what kind of help we need,"
he said. He described McCurdy, a former development director of
the International Tennis Federation, as a good friend of Atet.
</P>
<P>
Benny said Pelti would offer a monthly payment of 5,000 U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We have prioritized Gritsch after considering his success
earlier," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the association has lost track of Gritsch after he
relocated to Hamilton, New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"The phone number he gave us before leaving Indonesia was not
registered under his name. Maybe he rented the house. We'll try
to track him down by calling Austria's tennis association," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Benny said the association's 50 million rupiah (5,814 U.S.
dollars) to finance the program was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
"We need about 150 million rupiah but we'll ask our sponsors to
help us financially," he added.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Chicken Export Increases in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
External sales over the period from January to March reached
154,722 tons with a value of 188.2 million U.S. dollars, said
Claudio Martins, director of the Brazilian Association of Chicken
Exporters (BACE), according to a local newspaper on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The volume increased 7 percent over the first quarter compared
with the same period last year and the value rose by 13 percent
even with the devaluation of almost 30 percent of the Brazilian
currency against the dollar, according to BACE.
</P>
<P>
The positive results were due to the action of BACE, which
requested its members not to reduce prices drastically for the
exchange parity, said Martins.
</P>
<P>
Chicken exports to Cuba, the Middle East, Hong Kong and Japan
went up. They are traditional buyers of the product, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chicken exports to Argentina, Brazil's main commercial partner,
contracted 15 percent during the period.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin's
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin said Tuesday that Russia will only act
as an mediator in solving the ongoing Yugoslavia crisis.
</P>
<P>
The current Balkan conflict has great bearing not only on
Russia but also the entire world since it is a dangerous precedent
to all countries, Chernomyrdin was quoted by Itar-Tass as telling
Azeri President Geidar Aliyev in the Azeri capital of Baku.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslavia crisis has already entered a "dead-end" and
NATO's intensive bombardment could only worsen the situation
rather than provide a settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said NATO's destructive military attacks in the
region must be halted and safe returns of Kosovo refugees be
facilitated.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to work together for
a peaceful solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
After his stay in Azerbaijan, Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin's envoy to
seek a peaceful settlement for the Balkan crisis, will travel to
Ukraine to continue his three-nation tour which has already taken
him to Georgia.

MEXICO CITY, April 20 (Xinhua) -- The rebound in Mexico's oil

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Steel Quality to Ensure Construction Projects Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- China is taking stringent
measures to prevent low-quality steel products from entering the
market as a bid to guarantee the safety of construction projects,
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision and the
State Administration of Metallurgical Industry have jointly issued
a regulation, which requires all steel products for construction
use to conform to the set quality standards.
</P>
<P>
The regulation demands that all producers, sales agencies and
involved units follow the regulation strictly. Violation of the
regulation will incur severe punishment including withdrawal of
sales licenses and possible law suits.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that steel manufacturers must acquire
production licenses issued by the metallurgical bureau. In
addition, all products have to be carefully examined before
leaving the factory and have a quality certificate.
</P>
<P>
Factories without the required technology, equipment and
examination facilities will not be granted a license, said the
regulation.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted government officials as saying that steel used
in dams and state-level key projects must be re-inspected by a
third party.
</P>
<P>
There have been in recent years an apparent increase of
accidents involving inferior construction, which has called for
government attention.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs of Macao SAR Basic Law (43) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 21 (Xinhua) -- Following is part 43 of a
question and answer series on the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (MSAR).
</P>
<P>
Will the MSAR maintain the low tax system previously pursued in
Macao?
</P>
<P>
Macao has all along pursued the low tax policy. Its tax rates
are generally lower than those of other countries or regions
around it, except for tax for franchised businesses.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the income tax is 15 percent to 17 percent in
Hong Kong while that in Macao is only between 2 percent and 15
percent, much lower than 22 percent in Taiwan, 39 percent in
Thailand, 40 percent in Singapore, 52 percent in Japan and 54
percent in the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Low tax in Macao is compatible with its export-oriented economy.
It helps attract foreign investment, develop its economy and
improve the living standards of its people.
</P>
<P>
To maintain Macao's economic competitiveness and enable its
people to lead a better life along with the growth of its economy,
the Basic Law provides that the MSAR shall institute an
independent taxation system and independently enact laws
concerning taxes brackets, tax rates, tax reductions, and other
tax-related matters by drawing upon the low tax policy previously
pursued in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Parma Book UEFA Cup Final Berth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Parma defeated Atletico Madrid 2-1
on Tuesday for a 5-2 aggregate triumph, securing their place in
the UEFA Cup final against Olympique Marseille in Moscow next
month.
</P>
<P>
As goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon dived for several fine saves,
Abel Balbo scored the opener in the first half and Enrico Chiesa
netted in the winner for the Italians who established a 3-1 lead
from the first leg in Spain two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards tried hard for an early strike, but all their
efforts were blocked by Buffon who saved David Tevenet's header
and two long-range shots by Oscar Mena.
</P>
<P>
And it was Parma who eventually fired home first when Juan
Veron sliced through Atletico's midfield, rushed along the left
and slid a perfect pass for Balbo who scored with an angled shot
on the run.
</P>
<P>
After the interval, Roberto rose at the near post to head a 64
th-minute corner from Oscar Mena past Buffon.
</P>
<P>
Parma, winners of the UEFA Cup in 1995, regained their lead
with eight minutes to go when Chiesa connected a pass 15 meters
from Balbo and slammed home with his left foot.

<P>
ROME, April 20 (Xinhua) -- With four minutes to go, captain
Laurent Blanc scored a penalty against Bologna on Tuesday, taking
Olympique Marseille into the UEFA Cup final against Parma in
Moscow on May 12.
</P>
<P>
The penalty kick, which resulted in a brawl on and off the
pitch, prevented an otherwise all-Italian UEFA final as Bologna,
who drew 0-0 in Marseille, were leading 1-0 after 86 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Bologna goalkeeper Francesco Antonioli pulled down striker
Florian Maurice in the box just as the Italians seemed destined to
reach the first European final in their 90-year-history.
</P>
<P>
Blanc was forced to take his spot kick twice and his second
shot took the 1993 European champions through to their first UEFA
Cup final on away goals.
</P>
<P>
Two minutes later, Bologna had its Giancarlo Marocchi fired for
a crude challenge on striker Aboubacar Camara.
</P>
<P>
After the final whistle, riots erupted as a Bologna player
punched Blanc on his way to the dressing room, which lasted for
minutes before riot police intervened.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Wants to Pay Less to Buy Half of Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan wants to pay
less than the 80 million US dollars asking price for half of the
Hornets, according to a local report here today.
</P>
<P>
There isn't a conflict between Jordan and Hornets owner George
Shinn about the price, the number is negotiable and talks have
been friendly. Jordan argued in part because he believes his name
alone would probably increase the team's value.
</P>
<P>
Shin values the Hornets at 160 million dollars and Jordan
doesn't want to pay as much as half of that for a 50-percent stake.
He thought he could push the team's value even higher.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's prestige also could be a key element in lobbing for a
new downtown basketball arena.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Jordan made 33 million dollars playing for the Bulls.
It has been estimated that endorsement deals pay about 40 million
dollars annually.

<HEADLINE> "California Fuel Cell Partnership" Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, April 20 (Xinhua) -- In an important step forward
for fuel cell electric vehicles, a collaboration between the U.S.
state of California, energy companies and automobile manufacturers
was announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the "California Fuel Cell Partnership" at a press
conference in Sacramento, California Governor Gray Davis said that
fuel cell vehicles will soon be appearing on the state's streets
and freeways.
</P>
<P>
For the first time ever in the United States, automobile
companies and fuel suppliers have joined the government to
demonstrate fuel cell vehicles under real day to day driving
conditions. Partners include auto manufacturers DaimlerChrysler
and Ford, oil companies ARCO, Shell and Texaco, and fuel cell
company Ballard Power Systems.
</P>
<P>
The partnership will place about 50 fuel cell vehicles -- cars
and buses -- on the road between 2000 and 2003.
</P>
<P>
Fuel cells create their own electricity through a chemical
reaction between hydrogen and oxygen. Fuel cell vehicles have the
potential to compete with conventional cars in passenger space,
performance, driving range, safety and cost. In addition they will
provide good fuel efficiency and lower noise, vibration and air
emissions than vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.
This combination makes fuel cell the most likely alternative
technology to power the vehicles of the next century, according to
California Air Resources Board.
</P>
<P>
In addition to testing the vehicles, the partnership will also
identify fuel infrastructure issues and prepare the California
market for this new technology. Initial demonstration vehicles
will run on hydrogen, directly from tanks on board the vehicles.
Subsequent demonstration vehicles are likely to run on methanol
fuel. Technology for other liquid fuels such as cleaner form of
gasoline will be evaluated. A key goal of the partnership is to
determine the best fuel infrastructure for the market entry of
fuel cell vehicles, which could emerge as soon as 2004.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Debt to be Reduced or Rescheduled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 20 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Finance Minister Edith
Nawakwi said here Tuesday that most of donor countries are willing
to either reschedule or reduce a major part of her country's debt
stock due.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Paris Club which met in France last week
favorably considered Zambia's case, notably the options of either
writting off 67 percent of debt due or rescheduling the payment
of debt over a longer period of time.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi, who returned here Tuesday from the Paris Club meeting
said that the effect of the agreement reached at the meeting means
that her country's due debt of 2.3 billion U.S. dollars will be
reduced to about one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
She said the Zambian government will implement the enhanced
structural adjustment facility program as the only alternative to
the revitalization of its economy.
</P>
<P>
The successful implementation of the program will qualify
Zambia to access the highly indebted poor countries initiative
(HIPC) resulting in a substantial reduction of its 6.5
billion-dollar foreign debt, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank
will consider Zambia's request to access the HIPC initiative by
December this year.
</P>
<P>
She said her country is spending 35 percent of its budget to
service debt and urged the donor community to consider giving
debt relief so that the surplus could be ploughed back in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The minister said her country will maintain a tight fiscal and
monetary economic policy to foster economic growth and qualify for
debt relief by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Exports Below Its Needs, Says U.N. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 20 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations Official
said on Tuesday that the new estimates of Iraqi oil exports for
the current phase will be still below the U.N. permitted figure
and enadequate to meet many of the needs of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Benon Sevan, Executive Director of the U.N. Office of the Iraq
Program which oversees Iraq's oil exports, said the new
estimates based on the price of 14 U.S. dollars a barrel, are more
than 1.7 billion dollars below the U.N. authorized 5.2 billion
dollars for the phase from 26 November 1998 - 24 May 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in the previous and current phases "has
been far worse creating an overall humanitarian deficit" of more
than 2.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
So far in the current phase, Iraq has exported 269.7 million
barrels of crude oil for an average price of 10.09 dollars.
</P>
<P>
At current production rates and assuming the recent rise in the
oil price is sustained, it appears likely that the revenue in the
phase could reach 3.4 billion dollars, the latest U.N. report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Oil-for-Food program started to be implemented in 1996.
Since February last year, the Security Council raised the ceiling
of Iraqi oil exports revenue to 5.2 billion dollars for a phase of
180 days.
</P>
<P>
However, due to its dilapidated oil industry as a result of
economic sanctions and low oil prices, Iraq has been able only to
fetch an export revenue of less than 3 billion dollars in the last
phases.

WASHINGTON, April 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were
wounded as two young men in black trench coats and masks opened
fire Tuesday at a high school southwest of Denver, capital of the
Colorado State of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Three men in black have been detained so far, and unconfirmed
reports said the men are friends of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The injured were taken to the nearby hospitals. Local
television reported that one female student got nine gunshots in
the chest.
</P>
<P>
Explosions also were heard inside the Columbine High School.
Witnesses said the gunmen tossed an explosive device.
</P>
<P>
The shootings took place at the lunch time around the school,
including the cafeteria and library. The Columbine High School
has an enrollment of 1800 students.
</P>
<P>
"They were just shooting. They don't care who they shot,"
said one eyewitness.
</P>
<P>
About 100 to 200 law enforcement officers rushed to the scene
and the area was cordoned off.
</P>
<P>
All the nearby schools were also closed for the safety of the
students.
</P>
<P>
A series of school shootings since 1997 shocked the nation and
led to calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of troubled
students.
</P>
<P>
Two were killed at a school in Pearl, Mississipi, three at West
Paducah, Kansas, five at Jonesboro, Arkansas, and two at a school in
Springfield, Oregon.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by U.S. Department of Education
last year, attacks with weapons accounted for almost 11,000
incidents in public schools during the 1996-97 school year.
