<HEADLINE> Farmers Face Lower Crop Prices / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Maria and Ted Bobola grow sweet corn.  
</P>
<P>
	But with little corn to harvest because of a plant-withering  
drought, the Bobolas were forced to buy corn from Georgia to supply 
their produce and flower shop just outside Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	And most years, the strawberry picking season runs three to five  
weeks, but not this year, store manager Dee Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so hot and dry that even though we irrigated, we had  
only two weeks in the season,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not recoup $70,000 they paid for strawberry plants last  
year in this year's harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a hard growing season.''  
</P>
<P>
	Similar stories are being told by farmers across the Delmarva  
peninsula this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought and record high temperatures in late June and early  
July in the mid-Atlantic region has lowered the yields of corn and 
soybean -- the two most important field crops in Delmarva. 
Meanwhile, farmers in the Midwest and the South are enjoying a 
bumper crop. The plentiful supply has lowered prices across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating low prices, many Delmarva farmers switched this  
year to fruits and vegetables such as watermelons, cantaloupes, 
tomatoes, potatoes, peas, beans. That also has turned out to be a 
bad move, farmers and agricultural officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually warm temperatures have sped the growing season in  
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, so the Delmarva market is 
experiencing a glut. Translation: Rock-bottom prices for local 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to lose farmers to bankruptcy; there's no way  
else to say it,'' says Turp Garrett, the agricultural extension 
agent for Worcester County, Md. ``It's not very pretty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if bankruptcy doesn't do them in, many farmers will likely  
quit because the financial stress is simply too much, he said. This 
is the second year in a row that Delmarva farmers are experiencing 
a less-than-stellar growing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers most likely will not see lower prices in the grocery  
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not being passed on to the consumer by any means. The  
middleman always makes money in these situations,'' said Francis 
Breeding of the University of Maryland's Cooperative Extension 
Office in Queen Anne's County, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the growing season is staggered along the Eastern  
seaboard, which helps stabilize prices and supply, Breeding said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, ideal weather in the South led to longer growing and  
harvesting seasons and unusually warm weather ushered in the season 
earlier up north, Breeding said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delmarva farmers are finding themselves squeezed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the absolute worst year in history. There's absolute  
nothing ... that's making the economics work out,'' said Ray Wolf, 
who owns the 70-acre Cornerstone Farm in Hurlock, Md. ``At today's 
grain prices ... somebody's going to go hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How bad are the grain prices? Growers normally need about $2 per  
dozen ears of corn to break even, but this year they'd be lucky if 
they could they could get $1.10 per dozen from grocery stores, Wolf 
said. At his own stand, he was able to sell a dozen ears of corn 
for $3 in previous years, but is charging only $2 this season to 
stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruits and vegetables are faring no better. A 20-pound  
watermelon usually fetches about $2 wholesale, but now the same 
fruit is going for about 60 cents, Breeding said.

<HEADLINE> Bessette Family Joins in Vigil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- The Bessette family enjoyed a relatively  
quiet life before Carolyn Bessette married into America's most 
famous family. Now the Bessettes are in seclusion as they await 
further word on their two beautiful daughters and their son-in-law 
-- all presumed dead in a plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette gathered  
Sunday at a Mass in the town where the young women grew up, 
offering condolences and memories of women who they say were 
captivating long before they joined the Kennedy clan. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said they were praying for a miracle. Others simply prayed  
for strength -- for two families. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the Kennedys, it's more than any family should have to  
bear. And for the Bessettes, I feel so sorry for this family who 
are waiting for two daughters to come home,'' said Olive Curran, 
who knelt in the front pew of St. Michael's Church in Greenwich and 
said a special rosary for both families. 
</P>
<P>
	Curran, a native of Ireland, said she became friends with JFK  
Jr.'s aunt, Jean Kennedy Smith, during Kennedy Smith's 1993-98 
stint as ambassador to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr., 38; his wife, Bessette Kennedy, 33; and her  
sister, Lauren Bessette, 35, have been missing since Friday evening 
when Kennedy's plane left Fairfield, N.J., for Cape Cod, Mass., for 
a Kennedy cousin's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities conceded late Sunday, after two days of searching  
waters off Martha's Vineyard, that the three were presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just tragic,'' said Debbie Lamoureux, who attended St.  
Mary High School with the former Carolyn Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Cardini, who attended middle school with Carolyn, hasn't  
seen her in nearly 20 years. He and another childhood friend 
stopped by St. Michael's on Sunday to drop off two bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to let her know we're thinking about her,'' he said.  
``She was a great kid. She was always smiling -- a beautiful girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flowers were placed in front of three white candles lit for  
Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Michael Moynihan, pastor of St. Michael's, gathered a  
group of about 40 children by the altar to explain what had 
happened. He told them that some of their parents went to St. Mary 
High School with Carolyn Bessette. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pray in a very special way today for three people who were  
in a plane accident,'' Moynihan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bessette family stayed inside their home Sunday as a steady  
stream of visitors came and went. Greenwich police stationed 
cruisers outside the modest cape house and at the end of the 
private road that leads to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolyn and her twin sisters, Lauren and Lisa, were raised by  
their mother, Ann Freeman, a teacher and administrator in the New 
York public schools, and their stepfather, orthopedic surgeon 
Richard Freeman. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, 18 months older than Carolyn, graduated from  
Greenwich High School in 1982. She worked as an investment banker 
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York City; a card from that 
company bearing her name was found attached to luggage that washed 
ashore off Martha's Vineyard on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bessette Kennedy, 33, married Kennedy in September 1996. When  
she graduated from St. Mary's in 1983, she was voted ``The Ultimate 
Beautiful Person'' by her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamoureux said the award was given to her because she ``was  
beautiful inside and out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the entire class loved her,'' she said. ``We kind  
of knew she was really in a different realm than the rest of us.''

	Authorities Say Kennedy Likely Dead  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Authorities conceded late Sunday that  
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister likely were dead. ``We 
are going to shift, and I say shift very purposefully, from our 
focus on search and rescue to search and recovery,'' Coast Guard 
Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee, the head of the search operation, 
said at a news conference. Larrabee noted that it would be 
difficult for a person to survive more than 18 hours in the area's 
68-degree waters. He also said the search for Kennedy's missing 
plane, which has covered almost 9,000 square miles, on Sunday 
produced no major finds but authorities were focusing on ``a couple 
of targets.'' 

</P>
<P>
	News Media Seize on Kennedy Tragedy  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cable and broadcast news shows focused on the  
fate of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 
and his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette, who were feared dead after 
their plane went down off the Massachusetts coast Friday night. 
Sunday's newspapers devoted page after page to coverage of the 
search. While The New York Times placed the story on the left-hand, 
secondary spot on its front page, The Washington Post ran the 
banner headline ``JFK Jr. Feared Dead in Plane Crash,'' and the New 
York Post cried, ``MORE TEARS.''

	Dissidents Say They Killed 4 Iraqis  
</P>
<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- An Iraqi opposition group claimed Sunday  
that its guerrillas in southern Iraq killed four security officials 
and wounded two others in an attack on a checkpoint. The Islamic 
Action Organization, or IAO, a Shiite Muslim group based in Syria, 
said the attack was carried out Saturday after locals complained 
about ``despicable behavior'' by the security officials at the 
checkpoint. The claim could not be independently verified. The 
Iraqi government does not respond to reports by opposition groups.

	China May Use Force Against Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- President Jiang Zemin told President Clinton  
Sunday that China has not ruled out using force against Taiwan if 
the island tries to split from the mainland, according to the 
official Xinhua News Agency. The report was the highest-level 
threat yet in an eight-day-old Chinese war of words against the 
island, which Beijing regards as a renegade province. Jiang made 
the comment in a telephone call to Clinton, Xinhua said. China and 
Taiwan have been ruled separately since a civil war 50 years ago. 
Both say they are part of the same country. China's comments came 
hours after Taiwan dismissed reports that China was preparing 
military action.

	1,000 Kosovo Refugees Leave Germany  
</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- More than 1,000 of some 15,000 Kosovo refugees  
taken in by Germany have returned home, with more volunteering to 
return next week, the Interior Ministry said Sunday. Two flights 
bearing a total of 220 more refugees are due to leave the 
northwestern town of Muenster tomorrow and Tuesday to fly to the 
Macedonian capital of Skopje, the ministry said. From Skopje, the 
refugees will be taken by bus into Kosovo, the ministry said in a 
statement.

	U.S. Crime Numbers on Decline  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans were victims of about 8.1 million  
violent crimes last year, a 7 percent drop from 1997 and the lowest 
number reported since the Justice Department began tracking the 
figure in 1973. A report released Sunday called the one-year drop 
``marginally significant,'' driven by a small but significant 
decline in aggravated assault rates. Attorney General Janet Reno 
said several Clinton administration policies, including more police 
officers on the streets, tougher sentences, more prosecutions, 
better prevention programs and a healthy economy led to the 
decline.

	Tokyo Stocks Rise in Midday Trading

Japanese government may consider a supplementary budget. The Nikkei 
rose 178.40 points to finish the morning session at 18,426.70. In 
New York on Friday, the Dow rose 23.43 points to 11,209.84.

	Yanks' Cone Pitches Perfect Game  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone dazzled the Montreal Expos with a  
wide assortment of pitches, throwing the 14th perfect game in 
modern history to lead the Yankees to a 6-0 victory. After getting 
Orlando Cabrera to hit a popup for the final out, Cone dropped to 
his knees, grabbed his head in disbelief and was mobbed by his 
joyous teammates. It was replay of the scene from last year when 
David Wells pitched the only other regular-season perfect game in 
Yankees' history.

<HEADLINE>  Seattle Signs Its No. 1 Draft Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners on Sunday announced they  
signed high school catcher Ryan Christianson, their first-round 
pick and the 11th overall selection in last month's baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianson, 18, from Arlington High School in Riverside,  
Calif., will report to the Mariners' rookie league team in Peoria, 
Ariz. If he plays well there, he could be elevated to Class A 
Everett of the Northwest League in ``a couple of weeks,'' said 
Frank Mattox, the team's director of scouting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to get him going in Peoria,'' Mattox said at a  
news conference. ``The main thing now is to get him playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Reynolds, Christianson's agent, said his client signed a  
standard minor-league contract with a signing bonus, but neither he 
nor Mattox would reveal its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``After three years hopefully, he'll be good enough where the  
Mariners want to put him on their 40-man roster,'' Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianson is a 6-foot-2, 210-pounder who is a right-handed  
hitter. He batted .514 (38-for-74) with eight homers and 40 RBIs in 
his senior high school season, helping his team post a 29-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll be a little bit disappointed if I'm not up here  
in at least four years,'' Christianson said.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Search Dominates World News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr. after his  
plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean grabbed headlines across the 
world on Sunday as people waited for the search's results. 
</P>
<P>
	British newspapers were dominated by news of the search for  
Kennedy, his wife and her sister, many of the stories focusing on 
the history of tragedy that has plagued America's most famous 
political family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inexplicable curse of the Kennedys,'' The Sunday Telegraph  
newspaper said in a headline for a story that ran over three pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was traveling with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,  
and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, to a family wedding when their 
plane disappeared Friday night on its way to Martha's Vineyard, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, the British Broadcasting Corp. led its early morning  
radio news Sunday with a report of the plane's disappearance, while 
the BBC's Internet site said the Kennedy family ``could be facing 
another tragedy, the latest in a long history which has become 
known as the curse of the Kennedys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In France, ``Le Journal du Dimanche'' devoted its front page to  
Kennedy, with the headline: ``The Kennedy Tragedy.'' The paper 
filled two full pages with stories and photos about the late 
president's son and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	The reaction was similar in Hong Kong. ``The Kennedy family  
again meets the vicious curse,'' ran the headline of the 
Chinese-language daily Oriental Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, the state-run Liberation Daily newspaper of Shanghai  
said Kennedy's disappearance further covers the Kennedy family 
``with a mysterious shade of tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's acting prime minister, Tim Fischer, sent a message  
of sympathy to the Kennedy family. 
</P>
<P>
	Cambodians, however, were far more concerned with the murder of  
one of their own national icons, actress Piseth Peaklica. More than 
10,000 people packed her funeral Sunday, some spending their life 
savings to get there. 
</P>
<P>
	Kong Korm, a senator, said that ``politicians might hear about  
the crash, but I doubt regular Cambodians are interested because it 
is too far from them to care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Italian state TV led with the Kennedy story, using the  
well-known 1963 photograph of ``John-John,'' as Kennedy is known, 
saluting his father's coffin. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine on Sunday featured the same  
photo on its front page with a headline: ``Tragedy without end: 
John F. Kennedy Jr. Crashes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Russia, the independent NTV television carried news of the  
search, accompanied by footage of Kennedy meeting President 
Clinton.

<HEADLINE>  Cuban Players Apparently Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Four Cuban basketball players may  
have defected during an Olympic qualifying tournament, the 
organizing committee said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information we have is that there are at least two of them  
and possibly more,'' said Salvador Villela, president of the 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba had only eight players in uniform Sunday for its 88-52 loss  
to the United States that eliminated the Cubans from advancing to 
the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	The team arrived at the arena without three of its four leading  
scorers: Lazaro Borrell, a 26-year-old center; Roberto Herrera, 24, 
a guard; and Angel Cabellero, 28, a guard. A fourth player, 
23-year-old center Hector Pino, also was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera is the son of Cuban Basketball Federation president  
Ruperto Herrera. His brother, Ruperto Jr., defected in Argentina in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if they defected or if they are with some Puerto  
Rican women,'' coach Miguel Calderon said. ``What I can say is that 
they are not in the arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in  
Washington said she had no information on any Cuban defections in 
San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell was averaging 21.3 points in the tournament, and Herrera  
and Cabellero were the third- and fourth-leading scorers for Cuba. 
Pino had not played in Cuba's first three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the players) have not told us anything,'' Calderon said.  
``Until they tell us something, we cannot make statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Cuban players would comment before the game. One of  
them, center Amiel Vega, drew his finger across his mouth when 
asked what had happened. Two other Cuban players walked away when 
approached by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan American basketball federation confirmed four missing  
players. No one could immediately say for certain they had indeed 
defected. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Tomas Herrera, president of the Cuban delegation: ``It  
would be a disgrace if we talk about these players as defectors and 
then they appear. When they appear, then a statement will be 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans lost all four of their games in the 10-nation  
tournament. They did not play Saturday following their loss to 
Argentina on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two teams advance to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,  
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defections make you think about how lucky we are to live  
the way we live while members of the opposite team are trying to 
leave their country,'' U.S. forward Tom Gugliotta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has a history of defections at sports events, especially in  
baseball and often in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, basketball player Andres Guibert defected at a  
tournament in Ponce. He later played briefly for the Minnesota 
Timberwolves. He now plays in Europe and is attending the 
qualifying games in San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't surprised that they defected, but I was surprised at  
the players who defected,'' Guibert said, referring to Borrell and 
Caballero. ``They seemed to me like very disciplined guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Cuban basketball players defected during the 1994  
world championships in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent baseball defector is Orlando ``El Duque''  
Hernandez, who fled Cuba in December 1997 and signed with the New 
York Yankees. There was also Hernandez' half-brother, Livan 
Hernandez of the Florida Marlins and major leaguers Rene Arocha, 
Osvaldo Fernandez, Rey Ordonez, Ariel Prieto and Rolando Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Cuban baseball coach Rigoberto Betancourt Herrera  
defected to the United States during the national team's visit to 
Baltimore for an exhibition game against the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, three Cuban swimmers left training camp on the  
north coast of Puerto Rico and defected with the help of Cuban 
exiles on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Perez defected after winning the bronze medal in the  
400-meter hurdles at a San Juan meet in 1997. In 1993, 43 Cuban 
athletes defected during the Central American and Caribbean Games 
in Ponce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't condemn what they are doing, but the solution is not  
to flee to the north or south, but to work in Cuba for the 
transformation to democracy,'' said Angel Padilla, editor of 
Disidente, a magazine for Cuban exiles in Puerto Rico.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans were victims of about 8.1 million  
violent crimes last year, a 7 percent drop from 1997 and the lowest 
number reported since the Justice Department began tracking the 
figure in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Sunday called the one-year drop ``marginally  
significant,'' driven by a small but significant decline in 
aggravated assault rates. 
</P>
<P>
	``From 1997 to 1998, no significant changes in rates of rape or  
sexual assault, robbery or simple assault occurred,'' said this 
year's National Crime Victimization Survey. There were slight 
declines in robbery and simple assault, but rape and sexual assault 
actually rose slightly, from 311,000 in 1997 to 333,000 in 1998. 
Rape and sexual assault were the only two crimes to show an 
increase during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	The general 1998 decline continued a downward trend that began  
in 1994, the survey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said there is no one reason for the  
drop. But she gave Clinton administration policies credit for 
combining the effects of several strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's because of more police officers on the streets, tougher  
sentences, more prosecutions, better prevention programs, a healthy 
economy and a new approach to crime fighting that involves a closer 
working relationship between communities and federal, state and 
local law enforcement,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said they are relieved over the decline but  
warn that crime rates remain unacceptably high. They also have 
pointed to passage of anti-crime legislation since the GOP took 
majority control of Congress in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's report said that from 1993 to 1998, rates of violent  
crime -- rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault and 
simple assault -- fell 27 percent, from 50 per 1,000 Americans age 
12 or older to 37 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every major type of crime measured, rape or sexual assault,  
robbery, aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, theft and 
motor vehicle theft decreased significantly between 1993 and 
1998,'' the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual survey of American households excludes killings,  
because it asks individuals about their own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report said preliminary figures released separately by  
the FBI have shown that the number of murders dropped about 8 
percent between 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year the victimization survey analyzes data on nonfatal  
violent crimes reported to police and those not reported to police. 
``In 1998 approximately 43,000 households and 80,000 people age 12 
or older were interviewed,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, attackers used a weapon in about a  
fourth of violent offenses in 1998. ``About 40 percent of robbery 
victims faced a weapon, as did 9 percent of rape or sexual assault 
victims,'' the Justice Department said in a written statement. 
``Eight percent of all violent victimizations were committed by 
offenders armed with a firearm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About half of all victims of violent crimes knew their  
assailants, Justice officials said. More than 70 percent of rape 
and sexual assault victims knew their attackers, and 50 percent of 
aggravated assault victims did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost half of all violent victimizations and about one-third  
of all property crimes were reported to police each year from 1993 
to 1998,'' the statement said. ``Females and blacks were more 
likely to report violent crimes than males and whites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also revealed a 12 percent drop in property crimes --  
burglary, motor vehicle theft and household theft last year and a 
32 percent drop since 1993. Personal thefts, which include pocket 
picking and purse snatching, remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Motor vehicle thefts fell 22 percent from 1997 to 1998 because  
of a 20 percent drop in ``completed motor vehicle theft'' and a 27 
percent decline in attempted vehicle theft. 
</P>
<P>
	Violent crimes against blacks fell from 49 victimizations per  
1,000 people to 42 per 1,000, the report said. Rates for Hispanics 
fell from 43 per 1,000 to 33 per 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks still had a marginally higher overall violent crime  
victimization rate than whites and significantly higher rates than 
people of other races last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks and whites did not differ significantly in the rates of  
victimization by robbery, simple assault, rape and sexual assault, 
however.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard News Briefing Excerpts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee's  
statement at a news conference at Otis Air Force Base on 
Massachusetts' Cape Cod. 

</P>
<P>
	``We know that this case is now 48 hours old. We know that the  
water temperatures of about 68 degrees, with the statistics that we 
have, indicate that survivability is not going to be much greater 
than 12 hours, and certainly no more than 18 hours in the water. We 
know that the aircraft was not equipped with any survival equipment 
-- life rafts, life jackets -- anything of that nature. 
</P>
<P>
	And I think that based on all of our search and all of our  
calculations -- when we do searches, we do them with a probability 
of detection for what we're looking for -- the probability of 
detection in this case has now gotten to as close to 100 percent in 
the areas that we feel confident about, as we can do it. 
</P>
<P>
	The last factor that I want to talk about briefly is a little  
bit of information shared to me by the NTSB this afternoon, and 
that deals with the fact that in cases like this in their history -- 
and they have some real experts when it comes to survivability -- 
that they could not be too optimistic about survival. 
</P>
<P>
	I have spent some very painful moments with the families  
tonight. They have been very understanding all along and very 
appreciative of what we have been trying to do, and it was very 
difficult for me to share this information with them, but I think 
they understood it. 
</P>
<P>
	So at this point, I'd like to tell you that we are going to  
shift, and I say shift very purposefully, from our focus on search 
and rescue, to search and recovery and supporting the NTSB in their 
efforts to determine the cause of this.''

<HEADLINE>  Cuban Players Apparently Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Four Cuban basketball players may  
have defected during an Olympic qualifying tournament, the 
organizing committee said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information we have is that there are at least two of them  
and possibly more,'' said Salvador Villela, president of the 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba had only eight players in uniform Sunday for its 88-52 loss  
to the United States that eliminated the Cubans from advancing to 
the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	The team arrived at the arena without three of its four leading  
scorers: Lazaro Borrell, a 26-year-old center; Roberto Herrera, 24, 
a guard; and Angel Cabellero, 28, a guard. A fourth player, 
23-year-old center Hector Pino, also was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera is the son of Cuban Basketball Federation president  
Ruperto Herrera. His brother, Ruperto Jr., defected in Argentina in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if they defected or if they are with some Puerto  
Rican women,'' coach Miguel Calderon said. ``What I can say is that 
they are not in the arena.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in  
Washington said she had no information on any Cuban defections in 
San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell was averaging 21.3 points in the tournament, and Herrera  
and Cabellero were the third- and fourth-leading scorers for Cuba. 
Pino had not played in Cuba's first three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the players) have not told us anything,'' Calderon said.  
``Until they tell us something, we cannot make statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Cuban players would comment before the game. One of  
them, center Amiel Vega, drew his finger across his mouth when 
asked what had happened. Two other Cuban players walked away when 
approached by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan American basketball federation confirmed four missing  
players. No one could immediately say for certain they had indeed 
defected. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Tomas Herrera, president of the Cuban delegation: ``It  
would be a disgrace if we talk about these players as defectors and 
then they appear. When they appear, then a statement will be 
made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubans lost all four of their games in the 10-nation  
tournament. They did not play Saturday following their loss to 
Argentina on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two teams advance to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,  
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defections make you think about how lucky we are to live  
the way we live while members of the opposite team are trying to 
leave their country,'' U.S. forward Tom Gugliotta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has a history of defections at sports events, especially in  
baseball and often in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, basketball player Andres Guibert defected at a  
tournament in Ponce. He later played briefly for the Minnesota 
Timberwolves. He now plays in Europe and is attending the 
qualifying games in San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't surprised that they defected, but I was surprised at  
the players who defected,'' Guibert said, referring to Borrell and 
Caballero. ``They seemed to me like very disciplined guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Cuban basketball players defected during the 1994  
world championships in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent baseball defector is Orlando ``El Duque''  
Hernandez, who fled Cuba in December 1997 and signed with the New 
York Yankees. There was also Hernandez' half-brother, Livan 
Hernandez of the Florida Marlins and major leaguers Rene Arocha, 
Osvaldo Fernandez, Rey Ordonez, Ariel Prieto and Rolando Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Cuban baseball coach Rigoberto Betancourt Herrera  
defected to the United States during the national team's visit to 
Baltimore for an exhibition game against the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, three Cuban swimmers left training camp on the  
north coast of Puerto Rico and defected with the help of Cuban 
exiles on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Perez defected after winning the bronze medal in the  
400-meter hurdles at a San Juan meet in 1997. In 1993, 43 Cuban 
athletes defected during the Central American and Caribbean Games 
in Ponce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't condemn what they are doing, but the solution is not  
to flee to the north or south, but to work in Cuba for the 
transformation to democracy,'' said Angel Padilla, editor of 
Disidente, a magazine for Cuban exiles in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Barry White Talks to TV Guide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barry White says spending six months in jail for  
stealing tires in 1960 helped him stay away from a life of violence 
and turn toward a life of music. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to make a decision about whether I was going to continue  
fighting and all this other stuff, or try to do something positive 
with my life,'' White told TV Guide in its July 24 issue. 
</P>
<P>
	White said it was an Elvis Presley song, ``It's Now or Never,''  
that helped him decide. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I knew something about was music and that's the  
way I went,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the set of Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' where he recently had a  
recurring role, he was asked for his autograph more than 60 times. 
</P>
<P>
	White is best known for his soul seduction songs of the 1970s,  
including ``Love's Theme,'' ``I've Got So Much to Give,'' and 
``Can't Get Enough of Your Love, Babe.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Maintain Cycling Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-GAUDENS, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong remained in command  
of the Tour de France on Sunday, with Russia's Dimitri Konyshev 
winning the 14th stage as riders reached the foothills of the 
Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong finished in 61st place but retained the yellow jersey  
he has worn the past week. He leads cycling's most famous race by 7 
minutes, 44 second. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, riding for U.S. Postal Service, won the Tour's  
prologue July 3, a time trial and a grueling mountain stage in the 
Alps. The Texan has staged a remarkable recovery from testicular 
cancer and is the overwhelming favorite to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Konyshev, riding for Mercatone, was followed by two Italians --  
Gianni Faresin of the Mapei team and Massimilliano Lelli of 
Cofidis. 
</P>
<P>
	The race followed the pattern of the previous three days, with  
the overall leaders some 15 minutes behind, economizing their 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The results had no impact on the top of the overall standings  
since none of the top three stage winners was among the top 30 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The 124-mile stage between Castres and Saint-Gaudens marked the  
final day of relatively flat racing before next week's potentially 
decisive climbs in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage began in hot, muggy weather but showers midway through  
brought some relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday is the second rest day of the race. The Tour de France  
ends July 25 in Paris on the famed Champs-Elysees.

<HEADLINE> Tragedy Marks White House Dinner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House dinner for Israeli Prime  
Minister Ehud Barak was marked by optimistic talk Sunday night of 
peace in the Middle East, but a tragedy of another kind cast a 
cloud that no one could ignore. 
</P>
<P>
	``This a good day for affirming the eternal friendship between  
Israel and the United States,'' said President Clinton to the 400 
guests. ``It is also a hard day for those of use who are 
Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton spoke, U.S. Coast Guard officials were confirming  
what almost everyone feared -- that in all likelihood John F. 
Kennedy Jr., his wife and his sister-in-law perished when their 
small plane apparently crashed into the waters near Martha 
Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reminded again that life and its possibilities are  
fleeting, that we mortals are obliged to be humble and grateful for 
every day and to make the most of every day,'' said Clinton, 
alluding to the loss of Kennedy in the prime of his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share America's sorrow tonight,'' said Barak.  
</P>
<P>
	Although not an official state dinner, it was among the biggest  
for a visiting dignitary, twice as large a normal state dinner. The 
400 guests took 2 1/2 hours to snake through the receiving line. Mrs. 
Clinton, aware that many of the guests were from New York where she 
is likely to pursue a Senate campaign, kept her smile throughout. 
She knew many of the guests personally and greeted them 
emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the size of the guest list, the dinner was held in a  
massive tent on the South Lawn. As Clinton and Barak began their 
toasts, the president told the guests to ``relax because our 
speeches will be only half a long as the receiving line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The guests included Leah Rabin, the widow of the late Israeli  
prime minister who was killed by an assassin. Clinton gave her a 
big embrace, as did Barak as she went through the line. 
</P>
<P>
	It was about an hour into the line, when Henry Kissinger, the  
former secretary of state, flanked in front by Sen. Patrick Leahy, 
D-Vt., and in back by Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., made it to the 
president and prime minister. And an additional 30 minutes passed 
before Colin Powell, former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, 
appeared. 
</P>
<P>
	The receiving line went into brief disarray with the appearance  
of political consultant James Carville, a close friend of the 
president's and one of his staunchest defenders, and also a 
political adviser to Barak during his recent successful electoral 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Carville motioned Stanley Greenberg, another veteran Democratic  
consultant who also worked for Barak, to come forward as did Mary 
Matalin, Carville's wife who also is a prominent Republican 
political consultant. Clinton grabbed Matalin and mugged for the 
television cameras. ``Here I am with Mary Matalin,'' he quipped, 
aware of her strong Republican ties. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a moment of frivolity in what had become a long,  
strenuous receiving line. 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list had a large contingent of New Yorkers, reflecting  
the large Jewish population in New York City, but not totally 
unrelated to the fact that Mrs. Clinton is well on her way to 
seeking a Senate seat from the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional guests from New York ranged from Republican  
Rep. Benjamin Gilman to Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who gave up her 
plans to run for the Senate in 2000, deferring to the first lady.

<HEADLINE>  Cone Wanted Solitude at Perfect Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone just wanted to be alone. He walked  
off the mound and straight to the clubhouse after each inning. 
</P>
<P>
	No high-fives, no pep talks, no pats on his back.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, perfection is nothing to be trifled with.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I talked to David today, was before the game  
when we went over the hitters,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``We 
talked about the pitch selection and I didn't say another word the 
rest of the day. Nobody was brave enough to joke with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone stayed away from his teammates for the first two outs of  
each inning, every time changing his T-shirt that was soaked with 
sweat because of the near 100-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre found Cone in his clubhouse office  
after the sixth inning. Neither had much to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We walked past each other,'' Torre said. ``I just told him he  
could use my office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the pair met for the next three innings, under the exact  
same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every inning after that, I made a point of doing it again,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cone was on the bench just before retaking the mound each  
inning, his teammates completely ignored him, in keeping with 
baseball superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of them had been through this when David Wells pitched his  
perfect game last season for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been spoiled by a couple perfect games, and I think that  
helped the mood,'' Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder and designated hitter Chili Davis was the only one  
who tried to lighten things up. 
</P>
<P>
	He was catching Cone during warmups in the eighth inning and  
told Cone to throw the ball faster. 
</P>
<P>
	`''You can throw the ball as hard as you want. I caught in the  
minors,''' Davis told Cone. ``Even something like that, which 
wasn't very funny, broke the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After completing the perfect game and being mobbed by his  
teammates, Cone eventually found himself back at his hideout in 
Torre's office, where he got a congratulatory call from Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who saved the no-hitter  
with a backhanded grab in the eighth inning, enjoyed Cone's 
perfection more than Wells'. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was more exciting for me,'' Knoblauch said. ``The guy is  
the ultimate teammate and for him to be able to pull this off was 
amazing. Equally amazing was the fact that this happened on Yogi 
Berra Day and we actually had Don Larsen here.''

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Honor Yogi Berra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone had the best audience of all for his  
perfect game Sunday -- Don Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen, who pitched a perfect game in the World Series 43 years  
ago was on hand for ceremonies honoring Yogi Berra, who caught 
Larsen's perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone made Larsen the more suitable honoree.  
</P>
<P>
	Berra's day symbolized his reconciliation with the Yankees after  
14 seasons, or since he was fired as manager in 1985 by owner 
George Steinbrenner. Larsen threw out the first ball and Berra 
caught it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Cone went out and did what Larsen did to the Brooklyn  
Dodgers on Oct. 8, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just thinking about my day. I'm sure David will think  
about this every day of his life,'' said Larsen, who clapped 
quietly from stands at the final out as fans in front of him leaped 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recreated our game before the game,'' Berra said. ``He did  
it in the real. I'm glad we were both here for the this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra had already reconciled last January with Steinbrenner.  
Sunday's ceremony was staged to symbolize that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of broke down a little bit,'' Berra said after the  
ceremony. ``I heard a lot of pros and cons about whether I should 
come back. I'm glad we made up.'' Berra had been back at Yankee 
Stadium this year to throw out the first pitch at the home opener, 
take part in Joe DiMaggio Day and watch other games. On Sunday, 
Berra was the focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra was showered with gifts from the Yankees and applause from  
the fans. He was given a trip to Italy -- and a meeting with the 
Pope -- a 1998 World Series ring, a collection of rings from his 10 
championships as a player. He also received a framed jersey, the 
original 1951 World Series banner and $100,000 for his baseball 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best part for Berra was seeing former teammates like  
Bobby Brown, Jerry Coleman, Whitey Ford, Larsen, Gil McDougald, 
Phil Rizzuto, Joe Pepitone and Bobby Richardson and former players 
like Mel Stottlemyre, Don Mattingly and Willie Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was touching to see all the guys,'' Berra said. ``They  
didn't tell me who was coming. It was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After DiMaggio's death in March, Berra gained the unofficial  
title of the greatest living Yankee and was the biggest link to the 
team's dynasty in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was always the main stay at Old-Timers' Day and  
those events,'' said Bobby Richardson, who played with Berra and 
for him. ``Yogi has taken over that role now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 14 years, Berra had stayed away from the team he spent 17  
years with a player, then managed twice and coached. The whole 
thing started when Steinbrenner dispatched general manager Clyde 
King to fire Berra after a 6-10 start in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the home opener in April, the man who coined the phrase  
``it ain't over 'til it's over'' had stayed away from Yankee 
Stadium for any official event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been fired three times and twice was told by the owner,''  
Berra said. ``One time I wasn't. A manager is hired to be fired. I 
just wanted to hear it from the owner, not someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra and Steinbrenner reconciled in January and Berra is once  
again a prominent part of the Yankees. He visited the team in 
spring training and drops in on Yankees manager Joe Torre and the 
coaching staff just to talk baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he hadn't been away for so long it wouldn't be Yogi Berra  
Day,'' Torre said. ``Every day would have been Yogi Berra Day. Yogi 
is a major part of what this team is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his time away from the Yankees, Berra coached for the  
Houston Astros, built his museum and occasionally showed up at 
Yankee Stadium early in the day -- before he could be noticed -- to 
visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what uniform you would see him in, he was always in  
a Yankee in my view,'' said Don Mattingly, who played for Berra in 
1984-85. ``I'm glad that he has settled his issues because this is 
where he belongs.''

<HEADLINE>  Yankees Honor Yogi Berra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone had the best audience of all for his  
perfect game Sunday -- Don Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen, who pitched a perfect game in the World Series 43 years  
ago was on hand for ceremonies honoring Yogi Berra, who caught 
Larsen's perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone made Larsen the more suitable honoree.  
</P>
<P>
	Berra's day symbolized his reconciliation with the Yankees after  
14 seasons, or since he was fired as manager in 1985 by owner 
George Steinbrenner. Larsen threw out the first ball and Berra 
caught it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Cone went out and did what Larsen did to the Brooklyn  
Dodgers on Oct. 8, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just thinking about my day. I'm sure David will think  
about this every day of his life,'' said Larsen, who clapped 
quietly from stands at the final out as fans in front of him leaped 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recreated our game before the game,'' Berra said. ``He did  
it in the real. I'm glad we were both here for the this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra had already reconciled last January with Steinbrenner.  
Sunday's ceremony was staged to symbolize that.

<HEADLINE> World Reacts to JFK Disappearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The presumed death of John F. Kennedy Jr. grabbed  
international headlines for a second day today as newspapers 
recounted his life in the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers in Britain ran lengthy obituaries and accounts of the  
string of tragedies that have befallen America's most famous 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, the largest selling daily in Britain, led Page One with  
the headline ``Rest in peace'' and a photo of Kennedy as a toddler 
with his father in the White House's Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grief and disbelief as U.S. mourns strange death of favorite  
son,'' said the front-page headline in The Independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Some papers played up Kennedy's relative lack of flight  
experience and his tendency to take chances. ``Last fatal risk of a 
daredevil,'' said the headline in The Express. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was traveling with his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy,  
and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, to a family wedding when their 
plane disappeared over the ocean on its way to Martha's Vineyard, 
Mass. Searchers said it was unlikely they would be found alive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ireland, the home of Kennedy's ancestors, state TV and radio  
channel RTE sent its Washington correspondent to Massachusetts to 
cover what it described as a tragedy for ``the Irish-American 
political dynasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of Japan's major daily newspapers ran items today on the  
search, most accompanied by photos, including the famous image of 
the boy Kennedy saluting at his father's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong ran the Kennedy story  
under the banner headline ``U.S. prays for Kennedy miracle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy himself was not well known in all parts of the world,  
but most know the fabled Kennedy name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad how despite all the fame and riches, that one  
family can be followed by so much bad luck,'' said Giesela Braun, a 
resident of Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Firman, 49, a London nurse, said she was not nearly as  
affected by the loss of Kennedy as she was by the 1997 death of 
Princess Diana in a Paris car crash. ``Mostly because I didn't know 
him as well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Kennedy's disappearance was the top story on all  
radio and television reports and headlined most of Sunday's daily 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Channel 2 TV station interviewed a former schoolmate of  
Kennedy when he was at private school in New York in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He insisted on being an ordinary kid. Every day, we took the  
bus from Fifth Avenue to the West Side and he insisted on taking 
the bus with us,'' said Daniel Diker. ``He was a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II, vacationing in the Italian Alps, said he was  
praying for the whole Kennedy clan. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's acting prime minister, Tim Fischer, sent a message  
of sympathy to the Kennedy family. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also expressed his ``sorrow for  
the loss of John Kennedy Jr.'' He went on to castigate U.S. 
authorities for their failure so far to locate the lost plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance was the main story on the front page of  
most major Mexican newspapers. La Cronica carried photos of Kennedy 
with his mother and father and a chronology of other tragedies to 
hit the family.

<HEADLINE> New Apple Laptop Has Fans in Frenzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. has yet to reveal its  
mysterious new laptop computer, let alone start to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	But judging from the anticipation in the Mac community, Apple's  
latest surprise promises to be another sales splash -- extending the 
company's comeback and shaking up portable design just as its iMac 
personal computer prompted the industry to rethink the clunky beige 
desktop. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have another blockbuster on their hands,'' said Tim  
Bajarin, an industry consultant who heads Creative Strategies 
Research International, in Campbell, Calif. ``There is an amazing 
amount of anticipation and excitement around this machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are obstacles to another Apple best seller, including  
potential production problems and a worldwide shortage of 
flat-panel screens, which could drive up Apple's costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry buzz over the laptop's expected design, price and  
performance is accelerating ahead of a keynote speech on Wednesday 
by Apple co-founder and acting chief executive Steve Jobs, at the 
MacWorld trade show in New York. Jobs is expected to unveil the 
computer during his address. 
</P>
<P>
	While Apple is keeping a characteristic tight lid on details  
prior to the show, industry watchers and customers expect the 
machine to make a strong design statement that borrows generously 
from the enormously popular iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	The jellybean-shaped desktop was introduced by Apple last August  
and comes in five colors. Strong sales led the company last week to 
report its seventh straight quarterly profit, and have pushed up 
Apple's share of retail desktop sales to 6.7 percent in May, double 
that of a year ago, according to the ZD Infobeads research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the iMac, the Apple laptop is expected to use translucent  
plastic so the user can faintly see the machine's inner circuitry. 
Less certain is whether it will come in several colors, or whether 
the edges will be rounded in subtle homage to the iMac's casing, 
which sports a built-in monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the laptop promises to break convention with rival machines,  
which generally look like thin boxes and are used mostly by 
traveling professionals. If priced affordably, a snazzy portable 
could potentially become a status symbol among students and 
everyday desktop users, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be a design that will bring wolf whistles of  
appreciation from men and women,'' said Richard Doherty, who heads 
The Envisioneering Group industry consultancy, based in Seaford, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the laptop is expected to be priced hundreds of dollars  
less than Apple's PowerBook laptop for professionals, introduced 
this past spring starting at $2,000. Apple doesn't currently sell a 
laptop aimed at consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaper laptops are available elsewhere at under $1,000, but  
they are mostly off-brands that use outdated technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Some major Mac purchasers already are concerned about potential  
supply shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth College, for example, has contacted Apple salespeople  
to see if its roughly 1,200 freshman can get first dibs on the 
laptop when it comes out. iMacs were a big seller this past year at 
the Ivy League school, which requires incoming students to have a 
computer and gives them discounts on purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's widely rumored that Apple will sell out their product  
line'' of laptops, said Larry Levine, Dartmouth's director of 
computing. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new portable takes off, it could help Apple crack a new  
technology market -- people who are intrigued by laptops, but are 
reluctant to buy them because of the price and stodgy design. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 37 percent of laptops owned in the United States are used  
in homes, with the rest used in workplaces, according to ZD 
Infobeads. That compares to about half of all desktops used in the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Apple has yet to reclaim its glory of the 1980s,  
when one out of every four desktops sold was a Mac, it continues to 
have great influence in the PC industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing's certain. While Apple has shown a knack for using  
design to lure newcomers to technology, the laptop offers a bigger 
hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, problems with Apple production led its laptops  
to overheat during use, costing the company money and credibility. 
Modifying the traditional design of the computer casing could prove 
difficult, since squeezing components into such a small space is a 
challenge in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a worldwide shortage of flat-panel screens, which  
use liquid crystal instead of electron beams to show text and 
images, could drive up component costs and hurt Apple's ability to 
make money on a low-priced laptop.

<HEADLINE> US Tried To Sub Sampras for Martin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- For a guy who didn't even want to play,  
Todd Martin did pretty well. 
</P>
<P>
	And for a guy who lost the decisive game in the United States'  
Davis Cup quarterfinal against Australia, Martin has a right to be 
proud. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid speculation that the United States was looking for an  
excuse to play Pete Sampras -- something he could do only if someone 
else was injured -- Martin tried to pull out of Sunday's singles 
match against Patrick Rafter, claiming heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	But when a neutral doctor refused to send Martin to sick bay, he  
simply went out and took Rafter to the edge of defeat before the 
Australian won 4-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. The victory clinched the 
Davis Cup quarterfinal for the Aussies and set up a semifinal match 
against Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious (now) that I was fit to play, but I also felt  
like I was putting myself at a fair bit of risk,'' Martin said. ``I 
didn't know that I was really fit to play the whole match until 
near the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a gutsy performance, Martin won the first four games en route  
to a two set lead before Rafter came back to force a fifth set. 
Martin broke Rafter twice in the fifth to go up 3-0 and 4-2, but 
lost six of the last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my life I have been taught that pride is a sin. So I am  
not necessarily proud,'' Martin said. ``I am pleased that I had the 
courage to go out and play and play well. But I am very 
disappointed that I lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he was feeling fine Saturday night and again Sunday  
morning. But after just 30 minutes of practice about two hours 
before the match, he didn't think he could play again in the 
100-plus degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt exactly the way I felt when I walked off the court  
against Lleyton (Hewitt),'' he said of Friday's singles match, when 
he wilted after playing for nearly three hours and lost the final 
set 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I walked in the locker room, I didn't have my bearings.  
... Unfortunately, I was sitting right in front of a mirror and saw 
how I looked. I didn't like that and I didn't like the way I 
felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin talked to the U.S. team doctors, who agreed that he  
didn't look right. The predicament posed two problems: 
</P>
<P>
	First, with all of the speculation that the United States would  
try to get Sampras back on the court, everyone was already 
skeptical about a potential Martin injury. And Davis Cup rules 
insist that a neutral doctor must sign off on any injury 
substitutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, when captain Tom Gullikson sent for him, Sampras was  
nowhere to be found. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was starting to get a little panicked, because I knew Pete  
wasn't here yet,'' Martin said. ``And we only had about a half an 
hour until Tom had to put in a lineup for the day. Gully called 
Pete and had him race over here to try to get us as prepared as 
possible to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Gullikson asked Sampras to warm up, ``He said, 'You're  
joking!' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'No, Pete. I'm dead serious.'''  
</P>
<P>
	Sampras joined the team late and said he would play only doubles  
out of respect for those who had played all along. But the 
Australians doubted all along the United States wouldn't leave him 
on the sidelines for such a crucial match. 
</P>
<P>
	Even after Thursday's draw supposedly set the pairings,  
Australian captain John Newcombe said he expected Sampras to be 
playing in reverse singles. And Gullikson signaled a change was 
coming when he said Saturday night, without consulting his player, 
that Martin wasn't feeling 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was upset at the implication that he wasn't good enough  
to beat Rafter. So when he turned up sick on Sunday, he wanted to 
assure his opponents that there was no trickery involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was waiting outside the Australian locker room to try to  
talk to Newc and tell him it is just simply my word that I didn't 
feel like I could compete,'' he said. But he never got to see 
Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, referee Stefan Fransson summoned Dr. Rich Paul,  
a member at the Longwood Cricket Club. His verdict: Martin would 
have to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that he wasn't feeling well. I think that's an honest  
point,'' Fransson said. ``To take that to a situation where he's 
unfit to play is different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the match less than 30 minutes away, Martin took  
intravenous fluids and went out to the court. Even though he won 
the first two sets, he said he was so concerned about his health 
that he couldn't concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was more distracted and probably that helped. I just went  
out and reacted to the ball,'' he said. ``I sort of came in and out 
and I was focused for moments and distracted for moments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, just as he did in Friday's singles, Martin couldn't keep it  
going for the full match. Rafter commended his opponent's effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are not going to find a better sportsman than Todd and I  
have a lot of respect for Todd. I never once saw Todd trying to 
pull something over on me,'' Rafter said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him on the court and he didn't look great. He looked  
very pale in the very beginning but as the match got along he 
became more and more into it. Then I knew I was in trouble.''

<HEADLINE> News Media Seize on Kennedy Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TV stuck with a story that for many anxious  
hours yielded few new facts -- then, Sunday evening, gave up its 
tragic outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	At a briefing shortly after 9:30 p.m. EST, Coast Guard Rear Adm.  
Richard Larrabee left no hope for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette, 
whose plane went down off the Massachusetts coast Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, said Larrabee in a  
grim voice, ``could not be too optimistic about survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the nation's three newsweeklies had busted deadlines  
and remade their issues to put John F. Kennedy Jr. on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Time, U.S. News and World Report, and Newsweek were due on  
newsstands Monday after scrambling to focus on the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pretty much redid the whole edition,'' said Newsweek  
spokesman Roy Brunett. Of its 55 editorial pages, 29 were devoted 
to the cover package of stories, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	People magazine, which in 1988 anointed Kennedy ``The Sexiest  
Man Alive,'' also gave him the cover in its next issue, out this 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, John F. Kennedy Jr. is extremely popular with our  
readers, so we'll give this the attention it deserves,'' 
spokeswoman Susan Ollinick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday newspapers devoted page after page to coverage of the  
search. While The New York Times placed the story on the left-hand, 
secondary spot on its front page, The Washington Post ran the 
banner headline ``JFK Jr. Feared Dead in Plane Crash,'' and the New 
York Post cried, ``MORE TEARS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TV news stuck with a story Sunday that initially yielded few new  
facts. 
</P>
<P>
	While the nation was watching, listening and reading, many also  
spoke up. On Sunday afternoon, America Online logged one message 
posted every second concerning the Kennedy disappearance. That's 
comparable to the response after Princess Diana's death in 1997, 
said spokeswoman Regina Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are mostly well-wishers and prayers and  
I-remember-when,'' Lewis said from AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va. 
``Not everyone has a newspaper column, and as people are digesting 
this, they want to say something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox all concentrated on the Kennedy tragedy  
Sunday morning, and cable's CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stuck 
with the story throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's Martin Savidge, reporting from the Kennedy compound at  
Hyannis Port, Mass., acknowledged, ``The answers may not be 
forthcoming quickly, which means the anguished hours could be drawn 
out now for days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result largely amounted to recycled information, recapped  
family history and what often sounded like eulogies. 
</P>
<P>
	On CBS' ``Sunday Morning,'' John H. Davis, a cousin of  
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, lamented that ``no one will carry on 
the name of John F. Kennedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others seemed to struggle with how to refer to the missing -- in  
the present tense, or in the past tense. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes a real point of introducing himself,'' said ABC's  
George Stephanopolous, praising Kennedy in the present tense as a 
regular guy. But a few moments later, Stephanopolous sadly spoke of 
sister Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg: ``Now she's lost her entire 
immediate family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But CNN and ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Christiane Amanpour  
refused to give up. In a ``60 Minutes'' interview taped Sunday 
morning, she spoke of a close friendship with Kennedy stretching 
back to their college days as housemates. She insisted on referring 
to him in the present tense. 
</P>
<P>
	``To know him is really to love him,'' she said, red-eyed but  
smiling, still holding out hope. 
</P>
<P>
	From hovering helicopters, the networks beamed pictures of Coast  
Guard search efforts off Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks also relied on their news archives, which chronicle  
the man called ``the nation's favorite son'' all the way back to a 
1960 newsreel of him leaving the hospital at 13 days old with his 
mother and president-elect father. 
</P>
<P>
	Other footage showed Kennedy and his wife of slightly less than  
three years, a golden couple who commanded the world's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV vigil seemed eerily familiar to Bob Schieffer, anchor of  
CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every so often,'' he said, ``almost as if on schedule,  
something happens to the Kennedys and we gather around our 
television sets to watch them deal with yet another unspeakable 
grief.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Basketball Players Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Four Cuban basketball players  
apparently defected during an Olympic qualifying tournament, the 
organizing committee said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information we have is that there are at least two of them  
and possibly more,'' said Salvador Villela, president of the 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba played the United States late Sunday afternoon and arrived  
at the arena about an hour before gametime. Cuba had only eight 
players in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing were three of the team's four leading scorers: Lazaro  
Borrell, a 26-year-old center; Roberto Herrera, 24, a guard; and 
Angel Cabellero, 28, a guard. A fourth player, 23-year-old center 
Hector Pino, also was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Herrera is the son of Cuban Basketball Federation president  
Ruperto Herrera. His brother, Ruperto Jr., defected in Argentina in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know if they defected or if they are with some Puerto  
Rican women. What I can say is that they are not in the arena,'' 
coach Miguel Calderon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They (the players) have not told us anything. Until they tell  
us something, we cannot make statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell was averaging 21.3 points in the tournament, and Herrera  
and Cabellero were the third- and fourth-leading scorers for Cuba. 
Pino had not played in Cuba's first three games. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the Cuban players would comment. One of them,  
22-year-old center Amiel Vega, drew his finger across his mouth 
when asked for comment. Two other Cuban players walked away when 
approached by a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan American basketball federation was discussing the  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has lost all three of its games in the 10-nation tournament  
and was set to be eliminated with a loss to the United States. The 
Cubans did not play Saturday following their loss to Argentina on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two teams advance to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,  
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has a history of defections at sports events, especially in  
baseball and often in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The most prominent baseball defector is Orlando ``El Duque''  
Hernandez, who fled by raft in December 1997 and signed with the 
New York Yankees. There was also Hernandez' half-brother, Livan 
Hernandez of the Florida Marlins and major leaguers Rene Arocha, 
Osvaldo Fernandez, Rey Ordonez, Ariel Prieto and Rolando Arrojo. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Cuban baseball coach Rigoberto Betancourt Herrera  
defected to the United States during the national team's visit to 
Baltimore for an exhibition game against the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, three Cuban swimmers left training camp on the  
north coast of Puerto Rico and defected with the help of Cuban 
exiles on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Perez defected after winning the bronze medal in the  
400-meter hurdles at a San Juan meet in 1997. In 1993, 43 Cuban 
athletes defected during the Central American and Caribbean Games 
in Ponce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't condemn what they are doing, but the solution is not  
to flee to the north or south, but to work in Cuba for the 
transformation to democracy,'' said Angel Padilla, editor of 
Disidente, a magazine for Cuban exiles in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Powerful Telescope Set for Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The world's heftiest, mightiest,  
priciest X-ray telescope is about to embark on a five-year voyage 
to stare deep into the hearts of galaxies and search for signs of 
black holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chandra X-ray Observatory, a 4 1/2-story colossus stuffed into  
space shuttle Columbia and due to lift off Tuesday, is 10 to 100 
times more powerful than any of the dozen or so X-ray telescopes 
previously placed in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	If words glimmered in X-rays, Chandra could read a newspaper  
from a half-mile away or make out the letters of a stop sign from 
12 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can make Superman jealous, I guess, with our X-ray  
vision,'' NASA manager Ken Ledbetter says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts, led by NASA's first female space shuttle  
commander, Eileen Collins, will release Chandra with the flick of a 
switch seven hours after launch. It will be another month before 
the telescope's eagerly awaited observations begin. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays are produced by quasars, galaxies, remnants of exploded  
stars and other celestial objects, but are invisible to 
ground-based telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
	They would go right through flat mirrors, like those used to  
focus light on the Hubble Space Telescope, or the lenses used in 
many smaller telescopes, so Chandra uses conical mirrors. The 
X-rays will glance off the sloping glass at a shallow angle like 
pebbles skipping across a pond. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an age that we live in where superlatives are used in  
everything from sports to politics, probably a little bit too 
much,'' says Martin Weisskopf, a NASA scientist who has been 
working on the project for two decades. ``But I can't help but use 
those superlatives with this observatory. They are really well 
based.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope, built by TRW Inc., cost $1.5 billion to develop.  
Throw in the shuttle ride and five years of orbital operations, and 
the price jumps to $2.8 billion, making it one of NASA's most 
expensive science projects ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra -- named for the late astrophysicist who won a Nobel  
Prize -- is the third of NASA's four so-called Great Observatories. 
The first was Hubble and the second was the Compton Gamma Ray 
Observatory, launched in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chandra's help, astronomers hope to learn how much  
so-called dark matter is out there and where it is, and more about 
the matter swirling into black holes and the high-energy jets of 
matter shooting away from them. They also hope to better calculate 
the distance to celestial objects, useful in estimating the size 
and age of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra should have flown last summer, but was sidelined by bad  
circuit boards and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Also causing heartburn for NASA in recent months has been the  
rocket motor that's attached to Chandra, because it is similar to 
one that malfunctioned on an Air Force satellite in April and left 
that spacecraft in a worthless orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The solid-rocket motor is needed to propel Chandra from the  
relatively low altitude of the shuttle into a lopsided orbit with a 
low point of 6,200 miles and a high point of 87,000 miles -- 
one-third of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, the rocket motor and support gear together weigh 50,000  
pounds, making it the heaviest shuttle payload ever. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials say they're confident the thoroughly checked  
motor -- and the telescope itself -- will work. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubble was launched in 1990 with a flawed mirror that blurred  
its vision. It took millions of dollars and a daring space shuttle 
mission to correct Hubble's eyesight, now the envy of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigorous testing of Chandra's fully assembled optics uncovered  
no flaws, says NASA's top space scientist, Ed Weiler. 
</P>
<P>
	Still not satisfied, Weiler just a few months ago asked a favor  
of the director of the Chandra X-ray Observatory Center in 
Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come up with the grossest, most outlandish problems that you  
can think of and then make a list and go look at them and make sure 
that they're not there,'' Weiler asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the initial embarrassment over Hubble, the Chandra  
team is reluctant to brag too much or applaud too soon. Says NASA's 
Ledbetter: ``We'll get really excited when we see it up there 
working.''

<HEADLINE> Search for JFK Jr. Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Searchers looking for John F. Kennedy  
Jr.'s plane zeroed in on a spot at the bottom of the sea after 
picking up an automatic emergency signal Sunday, while Americans 
grieved over the almost certain deaths of Kennedy, his wife and her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	A sonar-equipped ship was sent to the spot off Martha's Vineyard  
where debris from the plane was found earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy family spent a second anguished day awaiting word  
along with the rest of the nation, as federal authorities set up a 
top-level command center to oversee the search. 
</P>
<P>
	The glamorous, 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy, 33, and her older sister Lauren Bessette were feared dead 
after the single-engine plane he was piloting went down in the 
waters off Martha's Vineyard on Friday night en route to his cousin 
Rory's wedding. The Saturday wedding was postponed, and the family 
held Mass to pray for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton offered the prayers of a  
nation, saying the Kennedys ``have suffered much and given more'' 
as a family over the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this difficult moment, we hope the families of these three  
fine young people will feel the strength of God, the love of their 
friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 300 people, including Coast Guardsmen and members of  
the Air Force and National Guard, concentrated on a 600-square-mile 
area off Gay Head, on the southwestern edge of Martha's Vineyard, 
using ships, helicopters, planes and all-terrain vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee said searchers heard  
an underwater signal Sunday from an emergency locator transmitter 
near where debris from the plane was found. It wasn't certain 
whether the signal -- detected by an Air Force plane -- came from 
Kennedy's aircraft, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would caution you that this was only one transmission,''  
Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	A sonar-equipped National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  
ship, the Rude (pronounced ``Rudy''), was dispatched to the place 
where the beacon was heard about 4 1/2 miles southwest of Gay Head, in 
about 80 to 100 feet of water, said Lt. Gary Jones, a Coast Guard 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	If the beacon did come from Kennedy's plane, it would be the  
first time searchers have heard it. 
</P>
<P>
	An ELT can be triggered manually or automatically upon a crash  
and emits signals that can be detected by satellites and aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, searchers found little more than the  
fragment of a headrest and some insulation. Saturday's search had 
yielded a wheel, a headrest, part of a plane support, a 
prescription bottle belonging to Kennedy's wife and a piece of 
baggage belonging to his sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedys stayed close to the Hyannis Port compound that has  
been the family's gathering point in so many times of triumph and 
tragedy. Some walked the beach. In the afternoon, Ethel Kennedy, 
the widow of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, and other family members went 
boating. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy, whose whereabouts had been  
unclear since the accident, awaited word on New York's Long Island. 
It was not known why she did not attend the wedding or join the 
family in Hyannis Port. She and her family were said to have just 
returned from a Western rafting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Medeiros, a family baby sitter, said there were a lot of  
tears inside the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	At Our Lady of Victory Church near Hyannis Port, where several  
Kennedys have been married, the Rev. Stephen Dawber told 
churchgoers to pray for young Kennedy and his passengers, ``that 
God give them peace and comfort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columnist Rowland Evans, at the compound for the wedding, told  
CNN that on Saturday morning, ``It was going from a little piece of 
heaven into the shadowy depths. Everybody felt the heavy weight, 
the burden of real sorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody had, I think, great hopes even then,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Some experienced pilots said that a relatively new pilot like  
Kennedy may have been ill-advised to fly at night, while others 
said it was routine. A source who is friendly with the Kennedy 
family told The Associated Press that Kennedy had intended to fly 
earlier in the day, but his sister-in-law, an investment banker, 
had to work late. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it wasn't clear that the crash was necessarily due to  
pilot error or inexperience, as opposed to mechanical failure or 
other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee called Sunday's operation a ``search and rescue'' but  
conceded that the normal survival time in 68-degree waters -- about 
12 hours -- had long passed. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of the son of the 35th president brought forth  
the kind of emotion stirred two years ago by the death of Princess 
Diana, with the TV networks devoting all-day coverage and 
newspapers rolling out extras on the movie-star handsome lawyer and 
magazine publisher whose life had been untarnished by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners left flowers at the Brookline, Mass., birthplace of his  
father, at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston and on 
the steps of John and Carolyn Kennedy's apartment building in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday happened to be the 30th anniversary of another family  
trial -- Chappaquiddick, in which Sen. Edward Kennedy's car went off 
a bridge on an island next to Martha's Vineyard, killing passenger 
Mary Jo Kopechne and ending any hope Kennedy had of becoming 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board,  
flew to Cape Cod to set up a command post at Otis Air Force base. 
It will coordinate the work of the Coast Guard, Navy, NTSB, 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Federal Aviation 
Administration, Massachusetts state police and other state 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall said Sunday the crash investigation could take six to nine  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Jule Miller, a spokeswoman for the FBI, said, ``The FBI is not  
currently investigating the crash but, if asked, we would offer 
assistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its second day, the air search was occasionally hampered by  
hazy skies, and the sea search was slowed by confusing sonar images 
produced by rocks on the ocean floor, whose depth varies from 20 to 
200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of it's boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.  
There's been a lot of civilians flying around the island who 
shouldn't be. We almost got hit three times,'' one pilot, Richard 
DeFrancesco, said before the FAA restricted 20 miles of air space 
to the official searchers only. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy had recently acquired the single-engine, six-seat Piper  
Saratoga II HP and was a relatively inexperienced pilot. Newspaper 
reports said he had 100 to 200 hours of flying time. 
</P>
<P>
	He had obtained his pilot's license in April 1998 but was not  
licensed to fly on instruments alone, the way experienced pilots do 
in bad weather.

<HEADLINE> Conable Sums Up 20 years in House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDER, N.Y. (AP) -- Even as a rookie on the powerful Ways and  
Means Committee in 1967, Barber B. Conable Jr. knew raising a 
million dollars was easier than falling out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
	When a lobbyist came dangling a fat check from a shoe  
manufacturer, Conable made an on-the-spot pledge and shed forever 
his discomfort over donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Well, thank you very much, that's a very kind offer,  
but there's a problem: I've decided I'm going to accept no more 
than $50 from anybody,''' he recalls with relish. 
</P>
<P>
	The lobbyist slammed the door on the way out. Conable stuck with  
the pledge for the remaining 18 of 20 years spent in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I gave rise to a canard that I could be bought cheaper than  
anybody else!'' he exclaims, his deep-barreled laugh echoing 
through his yellow, Palladian-style converted farmhouse in western 
New York's dairy country. 
</P>
<P>
	Observing the bulging campaign war chests of modern campaigns,  
Conable says with a sigh of resignation that overhauling campaign 
finance rules will always be uphill work. ``Policy is made by 
incumbents, incumbents want to stay there and they're the ones who 
get the big money,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Not one to wallow in the past, Conable nonetheless delights in  
summoning up his days in public life -- from casting his lot with 
Gerald Ford in their ascent through Republican Party ranks through 
a long friendship with George Bush that soured over Conable's rocky 
stewardship of the World Bank from 1986 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Conable almost doubled the bank's capital budget and  
sharpened its focus on combating poverty and bolstering primary 
education, President Bush ``thought I should be supporting an 
American agenda,'' he says, ``I thought I was there to help the 
poor people. So I got the reputation of not being a team player, 
and that was the one thing George wouldn't stand for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conable always had his own standards to meet. He was that rarest  
of political breeds: a conservative with a socially libertarian 
streak, a deep thinker with a pragmatic flair. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislating was more important to him than partisanship, so it  
was no surprise when both parties judged him the ``most respected'' 
member of the House his final two years in office. ``There never 
has been a better congressman,'' columnist George Will wrote of 
Conable's departure in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet Conable, who rose to become his party's standard bearer  
on taxes, trade and Social Security, knows he'd get little respect 
in today's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, many members of my party would consider me a loathsome  
liberal,'' he says with equal parts distaste and disbelief. ``They 
would not accept me as a leader in the current Congress because I'm 
too independent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A tall, hearty man with a stentorian voice, erudite yet  
plain-spoken, Conable is happily getting on with his semiprivate 
life. At 76, he has a legacy as a woodlander to work on. 
</P>
<P>
	He's converted his 250-acre backyard from marginal farmland into  
an arboretum dense with 160 tree varieties he collected on world 
travels. Coyote and deer find shelter here. Beavers have 
commandeered a pond. 
</P>
<P>
	Although slowed by heart and knee-replacement surgery, Conable  
says he stays lively enough so ``I won't completely fray at the 
collar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is more selective than before -- serving on the Smithsonian  
Institution board beats joining an ex-Members of Congress club -- 
but still hungers for challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	As host of a weekly public-television talk show called  
``Speaking of Rochester,'' he can revel in familiar terrain: local 
history, anthropology and politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can put things in perspective in a way few people can,''  
says WXXI-TV's president, Norm Silverstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone appreciated Conable's perspective. His last  
election foe, Democrat Bill Benet in 1982, thinks he did lasting 
harm to the economy -- and bore partial responsibility for huge 
federal deficits -- by shepherding President Reagan's 25 percent 
income tax cut through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conable carried the day for the Reagan tax cuts and the Reagan  
spending cuts and for the buildup of the military budget,'' he 
says. ``...Look at what has happened in this country in terms of 
the shift of wealth away from middle-class people and the fact that 
people are having to work two and three jobs to make ends meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conable ``was a very decent gentleman, and he did think very  
deeply about the issues,'' Benet adds. ``I just think he was 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conable spent his career in the minority, negotiating skillfully  
behind the scenes for scraps from a Democratic Congress, which 
invited criticism that he wasn't as tough as he was fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's probably justified,'' he says, a wry, lopsided smile  
pleating his left cheek. ``I was not way out there voting for the 
most extreme, egregious, ridiculous position in the world. 
Compromise is the way things get done in Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were bitter disappointments, none greater than the  
betrayal of Watergate after years of loyally backing President 
Nixon's policies. Conable later refused to answer Nixon's letters 
or attend his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	He counts among the high points his helping force through the  
revenue sharing law in 1972, which made the federal government 
share more money with state and local governments, and the Trade 
Reform Act of 1974, which cleared the way for U.S. negotiations on 
lowering tariff barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps his enduring triumph was winning 10 straight elections  
on a virtual shoestring. The most he ever spent was $76,000 in a 
tight, post-Watergate race. 
</P>
<P>
	If he were still in Congress, where the limit on individual  
contributions is $1,000 in each election, Conable's $50 barrier 
would likely be breached. 
</P>
<P>
	Deadpans Harry Nicholas, his longtime administrative assistant,  
``He might make it $100 now.''

<HEADLINE> Shriver Book Discusses Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As the nation's most famously tragedy-torn  
family grapples with the presumed death of John Kennedy Jr., a 
fast-selling book by Maria Shriver is advising thousands of 
children on coping with death. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``What's Heaven?,'' published in March, Ms. Shriver drew on  
her own experience handling the death of one uncle, President 
Kennedy, when she was 8, and the death of another, Robert F. 
Kennedy, at 12. The NBC correspondent wrote the book after her own 
children began asking about the 1995 death of family matriarch Rose 
Fitzgerald Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, a fictional conversation between a girl named Kate and  
her mother, offers a nondenominational view of heaven in which 
angels escort the soul to the clouds and the body remains behind.

	``It's hard to say goodbye to someone you love, but it's also  
important to know that the sadness won't last forever,'' Kate says. 
</P>
<P>
	The book joined a John Grisham thriller on The New York Times'  
best-seller list, becoming the first children's book to crack the 
top 10 since Dr. Seuss in the 1960s. It was on the best-seller list 
for seven weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you associate Maria Shriver's name with it, you don't  
know what's going to happen,'' said Sandra Speidel, a Petaluma, 
Calif., artist who illustrated the book. 
</P>
<P>
	The book was intended as an adult gift book, Ms. Speidel said,  
but has become best known as a children's title. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea was not to make it too literal but to convey that  
sense of what a child might imagine heaven to look like or what we 
imagine it to look like,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Shriver, 43, said in a Good Housekeeping magazine interview  
published in March that she was trying to answer questions that 
might be asked by her four children: Katherine, 9; Christina, 7; 
Patrick, 5; and Christopher, 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was growing up, there was a lot of loss around,'' she  
said. ``I also grew up at a time when you didn't talk about it. I'd 
think, I know somebody just died, but nobody's talking about it, so 
I better not talk about it either. Even though I knew the whole 
world was talking about it. ... This was a motivation for me to 
write the book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book includes hints of how Ms. Shriver has dealt with her  
family's repeated brushes with tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kate's mother tells her: ``No one who goes to heaven is  
forgotten. Their friends and family always remember them. So, in a 
way, they live in all of us.''

	Coast Guard Says Kennedy Likely Dead  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- After two days of searching, authorities  
conceded late Sunday that John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her 
sister likely were dead. ``We are going to shift, and I say shift 
very purposefully, from our focus on search and rescue to search 
and recovery,'' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee, the head 
of the search operation, said at a news conference. Larrabee noted 
that it would be difficult for a person to survive more than 18 
hours in the area's 68-degree waters. He also said the search for 
Kennedy's missing plane, which has covered almost 9,000 square 
miles, on Sunday produced no major finds but authorities were 
focusing on ``a couple of targets.''

	World Reacts to JFK Disappearance  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The presumed death of John F. Kennedy Jr. grabbed  
international headlines for a second day Monday as newspapers 
recounted his life in the public eye. Newspapers in Britain ran 
lengthy obituaries and accounts of the string of tragedies that 
have befallen America's most famous family. In Ireland state TV and 
radio channel RTE sent its Washington correspondent to 
Massachusetts to cover what it described as a tragedy for ``the 
Irish-American political dynasty.'' All of Japan's major daily 
newspapers ran items Monday on the search, most accompanied by 
photos, including the famous image of the boy Kennedy saluting at 
his father's funeral. The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong ran 
the Kennedy story under the banner headline ``U.S. prays for 
Kennedy miracle.''

	UN Seeks More Protection for Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Revenge attacks on Kosovo's  
remaining Serbs have prompted a U.N. representative to ask for more 
international help to protect civilians. NATO has struggled to 
prevent returning ethnic Albanian refugees from seeking revenge 
against Kosovo's Serbian minority since Serbian forces pulled out 
of the province and alliance troops began moving in last month 
under a peace accord. U.N. representative Bernard Kouchner's 
comments after talks Sunday with Kosovo Serb politician Momcilo 
Trajkovic and Orthodox Bishop Artemije appeared to signal concern 
about the Serbs' fate.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Sunday night Israeli  
Prime Minister Ehud Barak has made it ``very clear that Israel will 
keep its commitments'' for peace in the Middle East and ``America 
will do its part.'' Clinton and Barak exchanged toasts at a dinner 
attended by 400 guests including Leah Rabin, widow of the late 
Israeli prime minister. Earlier, Barak called the United States 
``maybe the best ally we have'' and pledged to get a peace accord 
with the Arabs in 15 months.

	Dissidents Say They Killed 4 Iraqis  
</P>
<P>
	DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- An Iraqi opposition group claimed Sunday  
that its guerrillas in southern Iraq killed four security officials 
and wounded two others in an attack on a checkpoint. The Islamic 
Action Organization, or IAO, a Shiite Muslim group based in Syria, 
said the attack was carried out Saturday after locals complained 
about ``despicable behavior'' by the security officials at the 
checkpoint. The claim could not be independently verified. The 
Iraqi government does not respond to reports by opposition groups.

	China May Use Force Against Taiwan  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- President Jiang Zemin told President Clinton  
Sunday that China has not ruled out using force against Taiwan if 
the island tries to split from the mainland, according to the 
official Xinhua News Agency. The report was the highest-level 
threat yet in an eight-day-old Chinese war of words against the 
island, which Beijing regards as a renegade province. Jiang made 
the comment in a telephone call to Clinton, Xinhua said. China and 
Taiwan have been ruled separately since a civil war 50 years ago. 
Both say they are part of the same country.

	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Mike Morgan won for the fourth time in  
five decisions, becoming Texas' first 10-game winner of the season 
as the Rangers beat the San Francisco Giants 5-4 Sunday night. 
Morgan allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 1-3 innings, struck 
out two and walked one. John Wetteland pitched the ninth for his 
27th save in 34 opportunities.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Rickey Henderson hit a leadoff homer and former  
Orioles closer Armando Benitez sealed Masato Yoshii's first win in 
a month as the New York Mets ended Baltimore's five-game winning 
streak, 8-6 Sunday night. New York led 8-1 but let Baltimore close 
within two runs before bringing in Benitez, who entered in the 
ninth to a chorus of boos from those left in the crowd of 47,480.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Even where they hardly knew the man, they were  
mystified by ``the curse,'' as people around the world heard the 
news of the disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest tragedy in the United States' most famous political  
clan dominated headlines Sunday in world papers, many of which ran 
the famed 1963 photo of ``John-John'' saluting the coffin of his 
slain father, President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inexplicable curse of the Kennedys,'' London's The Sunday  
Telegraph said in a headline for a story that ran over three pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tragedy without end: John F. Kennedy Jr. Crashes,'' ran the  
headline in the Sunday edition of Frankfurter Allgemeine. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr. was traveling with his wife, Carolyn  
Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, to a family 
wedding when their plane disappeared over the ocean on its way to 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ireland, the home of Kennedy ancestors, state TV and radio  
channel, RTE, sent its Washington correspondent to Massachusetts to 
cover what it described as a tragedy for ``the Irish-American 
political dynasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance became the main lead item in most of  
Ireland's Sunday newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. is not well known in all European countries, but most  
know the fabled Kennedy name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad how despite all the fame and riches, that one  
family can be followed by so much bad luck,'' said Giesela Braun, a 
resident of Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Firman, 49, a London nurse, said she was not nearly as  
affected by the loss of Kennedy as she was by the 1997 death of 
Princess Diana in a Paris car crash. ``Mostly because I didn't know 
him as well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Kennedy's disappearance led all the radio and  
television reports and headlined most of Sunday's daily newspapers, 
which included pictures of the family and ``family trees'' of 
Kennedys who died young. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Channel 2 TV station interviewed a former schoolmate of  
Kennedy when he was at private school in New York in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He insisted on being an ordinary kid. Every day we took the  
bus from 5th Avenue to the West Side and he insisted on taking the 
bus with us,'' said Daniel Diker. ``He was a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II, vacationing in the Italian Alps, said he was  
praying for the whole Kennedy clan. ``This is only the latest 
tragedy that family has suffered,'' said spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro-Valls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kennedy curse strikes again'', said the Sunday Times of  
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kennedy family again meets the vicious curse,'' opined  
Hong Kong's Chinese-language daily Oriental Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's acting prime minister, Tim Fischer, sent a message  
of sympathy to the Kennedy family. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also expressed his ``sorrow for  
the loss of John Kennedy Jr.'' He went on to castigate U.S. 
authorities for failing so far to locate the lost plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance was the main story on the front page of  
most major Mexican newspapers. The tabloid La Cronica carried 
photos of Kennedy with his mother and father, and a front-page 
chronology of other tragedies to hit the family. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cambodians were mourning one of their own national icons,  
actress Piseth Peaklica, gunned down July 6. More than 10,000 
people packed her funeral Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians might hear about the crash, but I doubt regular  
Cambodians are interested because it is too far from them to 
care,'' said Kong Korm, a senator.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Basketball Players Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Four Cuban basketball players  
apparently defected during an Olympic qualifying tournament, the 
organizing committee said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information we have is that there are at least two of them  
and possibly more,'' said Salvador Villela, president of the 
organizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuban basketball officials did not immediately comment. The team  
played the United States on Sunday and arrived at the arena about 
an hour before gametime. Cuba had only eight players in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing were the team's four leading scorers: Lazaro Borrell and  
Angel, both 26-year-old centers; Roberto Herrera, 24, a guard; and 
Angel Cabellero, 28, a guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Borrell was averaging 21.3 points in the tournament and Nunez  
was averaging 21.0. Herrera and Cabellero were the third- and 
fourth-leading scorers for Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan American basketball federation was discussing the  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has lost all three of its games in the 10-nation tournament  
and was set to be eliminated with a loss to the United States. The 
Cubans did not play Saturday following their loss to Argentina on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The top two teams advance to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney,  
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has a history of defections at sports events, particularly  
in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Cuban baseball coach Rigoberto Betancourt Herrera  
defected to the United States during the national team's visit to 
Baltimore for an exhibition game against the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, three Cuban swimmers fled a training camp in  
northern Puerto Rico and defected with the help of Cuban exiles on 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Perez defected after winning the bronze medal in the  
400-meter hurdles at a San Juan meet in 1997. In 1993, 43 Cuban 
athletes defected during the Central American and Caribbean Games 
in Ponce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't condemn what they are doing, but the solution is not  
to flee to the north or south, but to work in Cuba for the 
transformation to democracy,'' said Angel Padilla, editor of 
Disidente, a magazine for Cuban exiles in Puerto Rico.

<HEADLINE> Report: Holland May Nix Minn. Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The men's athletic director for the  
University of Minnesota said he will consider other replacements 
for basketball coach Clem Haskins after leading candidate Terry 
Holland announced he was leaning against taking the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Dienhart said he talked Sunday with Holland, the University  
of Virginia's athletic director, and that Holland assured him of 
his continued interest in the position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both concluded, however, that as he continues to evaluate  
the possibility of returning to the coaching profession, that I 
needed to move ahead with our search process,'' Dienhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, I will continue to identify and interview other  
potential candidates for the position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland said he hopes the Golden Gophers find someone else to  
take over their program, The Daily Progress reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm intrigued ... but I see nothing that says this is what  
Terry Holland should do,'' Holland told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say it's a long shot that I'd leave, but I'm not going to  
flat out tell them no,'' he said. ``But I do hope they find 
somebody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holland was in Greensboro, N.C., for Atlantic Coast Conference  
meetings and did not return a phone message left at his room 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been the Cavaliers' athletic director since 1995 and has  
been offered a seven-year contract worth up to $1 million a year by 
Minnesota. But he said he has been working with Virginia on a new 
five-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland makes about $250,000 annually and said he hasn't used  
Minnesota's pursuit as a bargaining chip with Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland has a 326-173 coaching record in 16 seasons at Virginia.  
He is the school leader in career victories, last coaching in the 
1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the timing of the offer has been a major issue. The  
Golden Gophers are to tour Europe next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be honest, if this was May, I would be more interested,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old athletic director said he would prefer having a  
few months to review tapes of the team before being thrust back 
into coaching. 
</P>
<P>
	Holland said he could change his mind under certain  
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody I wanted called and said they wanted to be my  
assistant coach, that this is an overwhelming opportunity, then I 
might see that as a sign,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers are at the scholarship limit for next season,  
meaning the new coach will have a full roster. 
</P>
<P>
	They lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament last season  
and could face NCAA sanctions because of an academic fraud scandal 
that caused coach Clem Haskins' departure.

	Coast Guard Searches for JFK Jr. Plane  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Coast Guard cutters using bright lights  
and a sonar-equipped submersible continued the search early today 
for John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister. A daylong search 
yesterday -- after Kennedy's plane was reported missing off the 
coast of Martha's Vineyard -- yielded plane fragments, a 
prescription bottle belonging to his wife and a piece of baggage 
belonging to his sister-in-law, but no signs of life. A visual 
aerial search suspended late yesterday due to darkness and hazy 
conditions was to resume at first light today with additional 
boats, planes and helicopters.

	Wedding Postponed, Kennedys Pray  
</P>
<P>
	HYANNIS PORT, Mass. (AP) -- The wedding of Rory Kennedy, daughter  
of late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was postponed indefinitely 
yesterday as word spread that John Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn 
Bessette Kennedy and her sister, Lauren Bessette were reported 
missing aboard a plane en route to the celebration. The 
bride-to-be's life has been marked by a string of tragedies. Her 
father, the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, was assassinated before 
she was born and she was the one who cradled her dying brother, 
Michael, after a skiing accident in 1997. Some 275 guests were 
expected for the private 6 p.m. wedding ceremony.

	War Prosecutor Advises Rehabilitation  
</P>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Local courts in the former  
Yugoslavia must be rehabilitated so that they eventually can help 
handle some of the growing caseload, the chief prosecutor for the 
international war crimes tribunal said yesterday. Louise Arbour is 
on her last tour of the region before leaving her post in The 
Hague, Netherlands. ``I think that it's critical that we 
participate and assist in full rehabilitation of domestic courts so 
that they can undertake a significant share of prosecuting war 
criminals,'' she said.

	Pinochet Denies Human Rights Abuses

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet has  
denied direct involvement in human rights abuses, The Sunday 
Telegraph reported. ``I didn't have time to control what others 
were doing,'' the newspaper quoted Pinochet as saying. Instead, 
Pinochet said he concentrated on turning the country away from the 
Marxist path charted by democratically elected President Salvador 
Allende, whom he helped overthrow in a 1973 coup. Spain is seeking 
to extradite Pinochet, who was arrested Oct. 16 in London on 
charges he ordered the torture of opponents during his 17-year 
rule.

	Dole Pushes Farm Relief Package

	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole  
yesterday demanded a farm disaster relief package larger than the 
$6 billion approved by Congress last year. Opening her latest 
campaign swing, Mrs. Dole became the latest candidate to focus on a 
struggling farm economy that's important in Iowa, where precinct 
caucuses launch the presidential nominating season. While most 
sectors of the economy have been humming along well and the stock 
market has soared, farmers have been struggling with historically 
low commodity prices.

	GOP Rep. Forbes Joining Democrats  
</P>
<P>
	QUOGUE, N.Y. (AP) -- Republican lawmaker Michael Forbes switched  
allegiance to the Democrats yesterday, the first such defection 
since the GOP took control of Congress five years ago. He drew 
praise from President Clinton for having the ``courage to change'' 
and scorn from the GOP for placing ``ego ahead of principle.'' 
Forbes, who represents the eastern tip of New York's Long Island, 
told reporters at his home that the Republican Party ``has become 
an angry, narrow-minded, intolerant and uncaring majority, 
incapable of governing at all, much less from the center, and 
tone-deaf to the concerns of a vast majority of Americans.''

Vargas kept his record perfect, winning his 17th straight fight, 
but had to go past the seventh round for the first time in his 
career. Referee Joe Cortez stopped the fight 2:00 into the 11th 
round as Vargas pounded Marquez along the ropes. Vargas, 21, a 1996 
U.S. Olympian from Oxnard, Calif., opened cuts around both of 
Marquez's eyes in making his second successful defense of the 
154-pound title he captured last December.

	Sampras and O'Brien Stop Sweep  
</P>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Pete Sampras and Alex O'Brien rescued  
their despondent Davis Cup teammates yesterday, stopping an 
Australian sweep and giving the United States hope going into the 
final singles matches. Sampras and O'Brien persevered through 
nearly 3 1/2 hours to stave off elimination in the quarterfinals with 
a 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory. Now it's up to Todd Martin in a 
match tomorrow against Patrick Rafter, and Jim Courier in the 
second match against Lleyton Hewitt, to see if they can pull off a 
comeback from 0-2 in the best-of-5 duel.

<HEADLINE> Marlins OF Bautista Hit in Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Florida Marlins left fielder Danny Bautista left  
Sunday's game against the Boston Red Sox after a Pedro Martinez 
pitch hit him behind the left ear. 
</P>
<P>
	Bautista left the game after the second-inning beaning. X-rays  
taken at Children's Hospital were negative, and Martinez called him 
in the Florida clubhouse after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's sorry,'' Bautista said. ``I knew he didn't try to  
hit me. I saw the pitch a little bit. I tried to protect myself. 
The ball just ran in on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little dizzy. It's normal. I hope to be able to play  
(Monday against Boston),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bautista stayed on the ground for about two minutes while being  
examined, then walked slowly to his dugout.

<HEADLINE> Fitzgerald Crew Gets Fond Farewell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABOARD THE CUTTER MACKINAW (AP) -- The bell rang 29 times in a  
belated farewell to the crew of the Edmund Fitzgerald, at the spot 
where the 729-foot freighter plunged to the bottom of Lake Superior 
nearly a quarter-century ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now they can rest in peace,'' said Ruth Hudson of North  
Olmsted, Ohio, whose son Bruce Hudson perished in the Nov. 10, 
1975, disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The sun shone brilliantly and a slight breeze stirred the lake  
Saturday as the Coast Guard cutter Mackinaw bore about 200 mourners 
to a consecration service at the wreck site 17 miles northwest of 
Whitefish Point. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather was a sharp contrast with the monstrous gale that  
hurled 30-foot waves across the doomed Fitzgerald's decks. 
</P>
<P>
	As the names of the lost sailors were called one by one, a  
relative or mariner tolled the bell and tossed a pink, long-stemmed 
carnation into the icy blue water. 
</P>
<P>
	Two large wreaths were dropped into the lake, one donated by  
singer Gordon Lightfoot, whose ballad ``The Wreck of the Edmund 
Fitzgerald'' enshrined the tragedy in folklore. Lightfoot did not 
attend the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers described the event as a religious exercise, the  
equivalent of a graveside service. 
</P>
<P>
	But the timing arose largely from relatives' growing concern  
that technological advances have made it easier for divers to 
explore the wreckage, which lies 535 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been a half-dozen visits by submarines and robotic  
cameras, and at least one scuba team claims to have reached the 
Fitzgerald briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	The crewmen's bodies are believed entombed inside the ship or on  
the lake bottom, so many relatives insist the wreck site should be 
off-limits. They are lobbying the Canadian government for a legal 
prohibition because the wreckage is on the Canadian side of the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the service establishes a moral -- if not a legal --  
obligation to respect their wishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world should know that this is now a sacred place,'' said  
Robert N. Dunn, a Chicago maritime attorney and head of the 
organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Spengler Jr. of Temperance, Mich., nephew of Fitzgerald  
crewman William J. Spengler, said there was no justification for 
additional expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let them alone,'' he said. ``It's their grave. You just don't  
violate that sort of thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 relatives of Fitzgerald crewmen were aboard the  
Mackinaw on Saturday. Also among the visitors were Great Lakes 
mariners and key players in the Fitzgerald drama, for whom the 
journey evoked vivid memories of the desperate rescue effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have lived with this since it happened,'' said Jimmie  
Hobaugh, retired commander of the Coast Guard cutter Woodrush, 
which rushed across Lake Superior from the safety of Duluth, Minn., 
to join the search. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a question that we'd go. That's what we're  
trained for,'' Hobaugh said. ``Every sailor feels the loss. It's 
like a big family.''

<HEADLINE> 'Eyes Wide Shut' Pulls in $22.8M / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Viewers had eyes and wallets wide open for  
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as Stanley Kubrick's steamy, highbrow 
``Eyes Wide Shut'' debuted atop the box office with $22.8 million, 
according to industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowbrow sex comedy ``American Pie'' fell to second with  
$13.3 million, while Adam Sandler's ``Big Daddy'' remained at third 
with $10.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	There were three other new films over the weekend. The  
mouth-wide-open crocodile flick ``Lake Placid'' opened in fourth 
with $10.2 million. ``The Wood,'' the story of a bridegroom and two 
friends reminiscing about growing up in Inglewood, Calif., debuted 
at sixth with $8.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Muppets From Space,'' featuring Jim Henson's creations  
searching for intelligent life in the cosmos, was 10th with an 
opening weekend of $5.1 million and earning $7 million since it hit 
theaters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ``Wild Wild West'' was fifth with $10 million,  
zeroing in on the $100 million mark after taking in just over $94 
million in 19 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The final film of Kubrick, who died in March, ``Eyes Wide Shut''  
already has grossed roughly half the total box office for Kubrick's 
last two movies, ``Full Metal Jacket'' in 1987 and ``The Shining'' 
in 1980. In one weekend, ``Eyes Wide Shut'' also made more than the 
Kubrick films ``Dr. Strangelove'' and ``Lolita'' combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiercely protective of his work, Kubrick kept details of the  
film under tight wraps. Warner Bros. followed suit after his death 
with a cryptic marketing campaign intended to intrigue viewers 
without telling them anything about the plot. 
</P>
<P>
	Details did leak out about the film's nudity and explicit sex  
scenes, especially a segment where a costumed Cruise crashes a 
ritzy, ritualized orgy. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid an NC-17 rating for the U.S. release, Kubrick digitally  
added images of partygoers to the finished film to hide some 
harder-core sex scenes. The more graphic version will be shown 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The sexual subject matter, the star power of Cruise, Kidman and  
Kubrick, and the fact that it was the director's final film 
virtually guaranteed a good opening weekend for ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
The question now is the staying power for a film that runs nearly 
three hours and is, despite its racy plot, an intellectual study of 
marital fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not your typical summer movie,'' said Paul Dergarabedian,  
president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks box-office 
numbers. ``Warner did tremendous marketing, but the staying power 
totally depends on the word of mouth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise of the weekend was ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a  
horror movie told through videotape shot by three filmmakers who 
disappear in a forest while searching for a legendary witch. ``Star 
Wars''-like crowds lined up at the 27 theaters where ``Blair 
Witch'' was playing, and the movie averaged a whopping $57,407 a 
screen, compared with ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' which played in 2,411 
theaters for an average of $9,457. 
</P>
<P>
	The movie cost just $350,000 to produce and has made $1.6  
million since opening Wednesday. Artisan Entertainment plans to 
release it in 700 to 800 theaters by July 30, said Artisan 
president Amir Malin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a frightening film that just connects,'' Malin said. ``I  
think people are looking for something completely different that 
entertains them and at the same time challenges them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studio executives said it was an eclectic weekend for film  
openings, with something for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew we really had the upscale, sophisticated audience,''  
said Dan Feldman, president of distribution for Warner Bros., which 
released ``Eyes Wide Shut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the action crowd, there was ``Lake Placid,'' starring Bill  
Pullman, Bridget Fonda and Oliver Platt in the ``Jaws''-like story 
of a 30-foot crocodile that churns and chomps its way through the 
waters -- and some of the people -- at a lake in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Wood'' was aimed at a black audience and is described by  
Rob Friedman, vice chairman of Paramount's motion picture group, as 
``'The Big Chill' meets soul food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated grosses for Friday through Sunday at North American  
theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures 
are to be released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' $22.8 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``American Pie,'' $13.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Big Daddy,'' $10.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Lake Placid,'' $10.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Wild Wild West,'' $10 million.  
</P>
<P>
	6. ``The Wood,'' $8.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``Tarzan,'' $7.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace,'' $5.3 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``The General's Daughter,'' $5.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Wright To Have Injury Assessed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Indians starter Jaret Wright, who left Sunday's  
loss to Houston with tightness in his right shoulder blade, is 
being sent to Cleveland to be evaluated, club officials said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Wright will be looked at by team orthopedic doctor  
Louis Keppler. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring 10 of the last 11 hitters he faced Sunday,  
including nine straight, Wright left complaining of stiffness 
between his right shoulder blade and spine. 
</P>
<P>
	He apparently strained a muscle in his back in his last start  
and didn't inform Indians' personnel about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it in my last start before the All-Star break,'' Wright  
said. ``But I thought with the break, I'd be all right. Then it 
started hurting before the game today. It just feels like a knot in 
my shoulder. I don't know how long it will take to heal.''

<HEADLINE>  Authorities Say Kennedy Likely Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- After two days of searching and holding  
out hope of a miraculous survival, authorities conceded late Sunday 
that John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister likely were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement effectively confirmed the worst fears of  
Americans for the son of the fallen president, who had become crown 
prince of America's pre-eminent political dynasty; for his wife, 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, a former fashion publicist who turned 
press-shy after her marriage; and her older sister, Lauren 
Bessette, a rising New York investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to shift, and I say shift very purposefully, from  
our focus on search and rescue to search and recovery,'' Coast 
Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee, the head of the search 
operation, said at news conference at Otis Air Force Base on Cape 
Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee noted that it would be difficult for a person to  
survive more than 18 hours in the area's 68-degree waters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that the aircraft was not equipped with any survival  
equipment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the search for Kennedy's missing plane, which has  
covered almost 9,000 square miles, on Sunday produced no major 
finds but authorities were focusing on ``a couple of targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are simply potential targets and don't necessarily  
represent an aircraft or part of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, almost 48 hours after the plane disappeared  
off radar screens, ended official hopes for the survival of JFK 
Jr., who had been famous since the indelible salute he gave at his 
father's funeral on his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy was piloting a single engine Piper  
Saratoga carrying his wife and sister-in-law when it went down in 
the waters off Martha's Vineyard on Friday night en route to his 
cousin Rory's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	The quintessential media figure, he was shadowed always, in  
college at Brown, on dates with Madonna and Daryl Hannah, at law 
school, and in his courtship and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have failed the bar twice, but he was a Kennedy, not one  
of much known political ambition, but a prince who was once crowned 
``the sexiest man alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers looking for Kennedy's plane had zeroed in earlier in  
the day on a spot at the bottom of the sea after picking up an 
automatic emergency signal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Larrabee said the signal had been discounted and could have  
come from a data marker dropped by the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A sonar-equipped ship was sent to the spot off Martha's Vineyard  
where debris from the plane was found earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said on Monday divers would begin searching possible  
targets in water 60 to 80 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Washington, President Clinton offered the prayers of  
a nation, saying the Kennedys ``have suffered much and given more'' 
as a family over the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this difficult moment, we hope the families of these three  
fine young people will feel the strength of God, the love of their 
friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy and Bessette families spent a second anguished day  
Sunday awaiting word along with the rest of the nation, as federal 
authorities set up a top-level command center to oversee the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent some very painful moments with the families  
tonight,'' Larabee said. ``I think they understood it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy, whose whereabouts had been  
unclear since the accident, had awaited word on New York's Long 
Island. It was not known why she did not attend the wedding or join 
the family in Hyannis Port. She and her family were said to have 
just returned from a Western rafting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experienced pilots said that a relatively new pilot like  
Kennedy may have been ill-advised to fly at night, while others 
said it was routine. A source who is friendly with the Kennedy 
family told The Associated Press that Kennedy had intended to fly 
earlier in the day, but his sister-in-law, an investment banker, 
had to work late. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it wasn't clear that the crash was necessarily due to  
pilot error or inexperience, as opposed to mechanical failure or 
other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy had recently acquired the single-engine, six-seat Piper  
Saratoga II HP. Newspaper reports said he had 100 to 200 hours of 
flying time. 
</P>
<P>
	He had obtained his pilot's license in April 1998 but was not  
licensed to fly on instruments alone, the way experienced pilots do 
in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of the son of the 35th president brought forth  
the kind of emotion stirred two years ago by the death of Princess 
Diana, with the TV networks devoting all-day coverage and 
newspapers rolling out extras on the movie-star handsome lawyer and 
magazine publisher whose life had been untarnished by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners left flowers at the Brookline, Mass., birthplace of his  
father, at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston and on 
the steps of John and Carolyn Kennedy's apartment building in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday happened to be the 30th anniversary of another family  
trial -- Chappaquiddick, in which Sen. Edward Kennedy's car went off 
a bridge on an island next to Martha's Vineyard, killing passenger 
Mary Jo Kopechne and ending any hope Kennedy had of becoming 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., as he became known, has been a reluctant icon. He  
eschewed a political career for publishing, and avoided the 
troubles that plagued many of his cousins. His wildest act, at 
least publicly, may have been getting a small shamrock tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
	His appeal transcended generations. His father was voted into  
the White House by the generation that fought World War II. He was 
born while that generation raised its children and for them he 
would always be that little boy, in a blue coat and shorts, 
saluting his father's casket on his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	To another generation, he was ``the sexiest man alive'' -- a  
title bestowed on him by People magazine. New York's gossip pages 
simply dubbed him ``The Hunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics,  
although he was constantly questioned about a future in the 
political arena and often mentioned as a candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy graduated from Brown University in 1983, turning his  
attention to a variety of pursuits: searching for a sunken pirate 
ship off Cape Cod, visiting India for six months, raising funds for 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, he introduced his uncle, U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
at the Democratic Convention -- and received a two-minute standing 
ovation. A year later, he graduated from New York University with a 
law degree. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Manhattan district attorney's office the next year  
-- but only after failing the bar twice. ``HUNK FLUNKS,'' read a 
tabloid headline after one of those attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he launched the magazine George -- subtitled ``not just  
politics as usual.'' Its trademark became celebrity covers; the 
first issue featured Cindy Crawford dressed as George Washington, 
sporting a bra top, white wig and tight pants. 
</P>
<P>
	The lithe, blonde Bessette Kennedy enjoyed a privileged  
upbringing as the stepdaughter of a surgeon in posh Greenwich, 
Conn. But not even that could prepare her for life in the Kennedy 
clan, a jet-setting existence complete with White House invitations 
and family weekends in Hyannis Port. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, 18 months older than Carolyn, graduated from  
Greenwich High School in 1982. She worked as an investment banker 
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York City; a card from that 
company bearing her name was found attached to luggage that washed 
ashore off Martha's Vineyard on Saturday.

	The quintessential media figure, he was shadowed always, in  
college at Brown, on dates with Madonna and Daryl Hannah, at law 
school, and in his courtship and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have failed the bar twice, but he was a Kennedy, not one  
of much known political ambition, but a prince who was once crowned 
``the sexiest man alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers looking for Kennedy's plane had zeroed in earlier in  
the day on a spot at the bottom of the sea after picking up an 
automatic emergency signal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Larrabee said the signal had been discounted and could have  
come from a data marker dropped by the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A sonar-equipped ship was sent to the spot off Martha's Vineyard  
where debris from the plane was found earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said on Monday divers would begin searching possible  
targets in water 60 to 80 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Washington, President Clinton offered the prayers of  
a nation, saying the Kennedys ``have suffered much and given more'' 
as a family over the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this difficult moment, we hope the families of these three  
fine young people will feel the strength of God, the love of their 
friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy and Bessette families spent a second anguished day  
Sunday awaiting word along with the rest of the nation, as federal 
authorities set up a top-level command center to oversee the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent some very painful moments with the families  
tonight,'' Larabee said. ``I think they understood it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy, whose whereabouts had been  
unclear since the accident, had awaited word on New York's Long 
Island. It was not known why she did not attend the wedding or join 
the family in Hyannis Port. She and her family were said to have 
just returned from a Western rafting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experienced pilots said that a relatively new pilot like  
Kennedy may have been ill-advised to fly at night, while others 
said it was routine. A source who is friendly with the Kennedy 
family told The Associated Press that Kennedy had intended to fly 
earlier in the day, but his sister-in-law, an investment banker, 
had to work late. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it wasn't clear that the crash was necessarily due to  
pilot error or inexperience, as opposed to mechanical failure or 
other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy had recently acquired the single-engine, six-seat Piper  
Saratoga II HP. Newspaper reports said he had 100 to 200 hours of 
flying time. 
</P>
<P>
	He had obtained his pilot's license in April 1998 but was not  
licensed to fly on instruments alone, the way experienced pilots do 
in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of the son of the 35th president brought forth  
the kind of emotion stirred two years ago by the death of Princess 
Diana, with the TV networks devoting all-day coverage and 
newspapers rolling out extras on the movie-star handsome lawyer and 
magazine publisher whose life had been untarnished by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners left flowers at the Brookline, Mass., birthplace of his  
father, at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston and on 
the steps of John and Carolyn Kennedy's apartment building in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday happened to be the 30th anniversary of another family  
trial -- Chappaquiddick, in which Sen. Edward Kennedy's car went off 
a bridge on an island next to Martha's Vineyard, killing passenger 
Mary Jo Kopechne and ending any hope Kennedy had of becoming 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., as he became known, has been a reluctant icon. He  
eschewed a political career for publishing, and avoided the 
troubles that plagued many of his cousins. His wildest act, at 
least publicly, may have been getting a small shamrock tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
	His appeal transcended generations. His father was voted into  
the White House by the generation that fought World War II. He was 
born while that generation raised its children and for them he 
would always be that little boy, in a blue coat and shorts, 
saluting his father's casket on his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	To another generation, he was ``the sexiest man alive'' -- a  
title bestowed on him by People magazine. New York's gossip pages 
simply dubbed him ``The Hunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics,  
although he was constantly questioned about a future in the 
political arena and often mentioned as a candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy graduated from Brown University in 1983, turning his  
attention to a variety of pursuits: searching for a sunken pirate 
ship off Cape Cod, visiting India for six months, raising funds for 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, he introduced his uncle, U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
at the Democratic Convention -- and received a two-minute standing 
ovation. A year later, he graduated from New York University with a 
law degree. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Manhattan district attorney's office the next year  
-- but only after failing the bar twice. ``HUNK FLUNKS,'' read a 
tabloid headline after one of those attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he launched the magazine George -- subtitled ``not just  
politics as usual.'' Its trademark became celebrity covers; the 
first issue featured Cindy Crawford dressed as George Washington, 
sporting a bra top, white wig and tight pants. 
</P>
<P>
	The lithe, blonde Bessette Kennedy enjoyed a privileged  
upbringing as the stepdaughter of a surgeon in posh Greenwich, 
Conn. But not even that could prepare her for life in the Kennedy 
clan, a jet-setting existence complete with White House invitations 
and family weekends in Hyannis Port. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, 18 months older than Carolyn, graduated from  
Greenwich High School in 1982. She worked as an investment banker 
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York City; a card from that 
company bearing her name was found attached to luggage that washed 
ashore off Martha's Vineyard on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Honor Yogi Berra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone had the best audience of all for his  
perfect game Sunday -- Don Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen, who pitched a perfect game in the World Series 43 years  
ago was on hand for ceremonies honoring Yogi Berra, who caught 
Larsen's perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone made Larsen the more suitable honoree.  
</P>
<P>
	Berra's day symbolized his reconciliation with the Yankees after  
14 seasons, or since he was fired as manager in 1985 by owner 
George Steinbrenner. Larsen threw out the first ball and Berra 
caught it. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Cone went out and did what Larsen did to the Brooklyn  
Dodgers on Oct. 8, 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just thinking about my day. I'm sure David will think  
about this every day of his life,'' said Larsen, who clapped 
quietly from stands at the final out as fans in front of him leaped 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recreated our game before the game,'' Berra said. ``He did  
it in the real. I'm glad we were both here for the this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra had already reconciled last January with Steinbrenner.  
Sunday's ceremony was staged to symbolize that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of broke down a little bit,'' Berra said after the  
ceremony. ``I heard a lot of pros and cons about whether I should 
come back. I'm glad we made up.'' Berra had been back at Yankee 
Stadium this year to throw out the first pitch at the home opener, 
take part in Joe DiMaggio Day and watch other games. On Sunday, 
Berra was the focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra was showered with gifts from the Yankees and applause from  
the fans. He was given a trip to Italy -- and a meeting with the 
Pope -- a 1998 World Series ring, a collection of rings from his 10 
championships as a player. He also received a framed jersey, the 
original 1951 World Series banner and $100,000 for his baseball 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best part for Berra was seeing former teammates like  
Bobby Brown, Jerry Coleman, Whitey Ford, Larsen, Gil McDougald, 
Phil Rizzuto, Joe Pepitone and Bobby Richardson and former players 
like Mel Stottlemyre, Don Mattingly and Willie Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was touching to see all the guys,'' Berra said. ``They  
didn't tell me who was coming. It was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After DiMaggio's death in March, Berra gained the unofficial  
title of the greatest living Yankee and was the biggest link to the 
team's dynasty in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was always the main stay at Old-Timers' Day and  
those events,'' said Bobby Richardson, who played with Berra and 
for him. ``Yogi has taken over that role now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 14 years, Berra had stayed away from the team he spent 17  
years with a player, then managed twice and coached. The whole 
thing started when Steinbrenner dispatched general manager Clyde 
King to fire Berra after a 6-10 start in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the home opener in April, the man who coined the phrase  
``it ain't over 'til it's over'' had stayed away from Yankee 
Stadium for any official event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been fired three times and twice was told by the owner,''  
Berra said. ``One time I wasn't. A manager is hired to be fired. I 
just wanted to hear it from the owner, not someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra and Steinbrenner reconciled in January and Berra is once  
again a prominent part of the Yankees. He visited the team in 
spring training and drops in on Yankees manager Joe Torre and the 
coaching staff just to talk baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he hadn't been away for so long it wouldn't be Yogi Berra  
Day,'' Torre said. ``Every day would have been Yogi Berra Day. Yogi 
is a major part of what this team is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his time away from the Yankees, Berra coached for the  
Houston Astros, built his museum and occasionally showed up at 
Yankee Stadium early in the day -- before he could be noticed -- to 
visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what uniform you would see him in, he was always in  
a Yankee in my view,'' said Don Mattingly, who played for Berra in 
1984-85. ``I'm glad that he has settled his issues because this is 
where he belongs.''

<HEADLINE> Larsen Relives Yankees History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pitching a perfect game doesn't mean you've ever  
seen one. So, Don Larsen decided to stick around at Yankee Stadium 
just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	Good call.  
</P>
<P>
	After he recreated his own perfect day before Sunday's game,  
Larsen sat back and watched David Cone pitch the 14th perfect game 
in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see mine,'' Larsen said of his perfect game against  
Brooklyn in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series -- the only one in 
Series history. ``How could I? I was working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen was at Yankee Stadium for Yogi Berra Day and even threw  
out the first pitch to Berra, his catcher for the game in 1956. He 
planned to watch a few innings before heading back to his hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed as soon as he saw Cone pitch.  
</P>
<P>
	``As time went on, it was still a perfect game. I would have had  
to have been silly to leave then,'' Larsen said. ``I'm glad I came 
to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 40 years, Larsen was the only Yankee to pitch a  
perfect game. Now he is linked to the only other two Yankees to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen went to the same high school, Point Loma in San Diego, as  
David Wells, who achieved perfection on May 17, 1998, against 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	And he was the last person to talk to Cone and touch him before  
Cone threw his perfect game against the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shook hands before I threw out the first pitch and I wished  
him good luck,'' Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, they embraced, forever linked in baseball  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pretty smooth,'' Larsen said of Cone. ``He had total  
command of his pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Larsen watched Cone breeze through the Expos lineup, it was  
only natural to reflect back to 1956. He recalled a catch Mickey 
Mantle made in left-center field that would have been a home run in 
any other park, and he remembered Berra leaping into his arms after 
the final out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't woken up since then,'' Larsen said. ``I thought  
about my day a lot. I'm sure David is going to think about this 
every day of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Yankees greats were on hand Sunday, as the team  
relived and later made history. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra was honored after his 14-year feud with owner George  
Steinbrenner ended in January. Also on hand were Phil Rizzuto, 
Whitey Ford, Jerry Coleman and Bobby Richardson, who all played for 
New York in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recreated our game before and he did it for real in the  
game,'' Berra said. ``I'm glad we were all here for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Announcer Bob Wolff, who called Larsen's game on TV, was in the  
press box to watch Cone's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was rising and falling with the waves of the crowd,'' Wolff  
said. ``It was just like 1956.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Working on Y2K Repairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Come New Year's Eve, the Concorde will be  
turned into a time machine, its passengers marking the start of the 
new century in Paris before streaking back across the time zones 
and celebrating midnight again in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Just across the English Channel in London, the planes of Virgin  
Atlantic Airways will be anything but supersonic. Instead, they'll 
be parked on the ramp, grounded as 1999 turns to 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers blistering across the ocean at 1,400 mph, a $10,000  
ticket in hand. Jumbo jets sitting idle and empty on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Those will be the two extremes in the airline industry as the  
Y2K witching hour arrives, bringing with it uncertainty about how 
computers will behave. Such uncertainty is especially troublesome 
in the aviation business, where everything from radar to aircraft 
fueling orders are computerized. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation Administration insists it has fixed its  
``mission-critical'' equipment so it can handle the rollover. Some 
older computers viewed dates in a two-digit format -- ``99'' for 
1999 -- generating concern they will malfunction as the new century 
begins. Unrepaired computers may construe the new ``00'' as 1900 
instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's major airlines say they are 95 percent done with  
their own repairs and will be finished by September. 
</P>
<P>
	To date, only Virgin Atlantic, LOT Polish Airlines, Vietnam  
Airlines and a small British regional carrier have said they will 
not fly on New Year's Eve. Virgin says it's not because of Y2K 
concerns, but so employees can celebrate a unique milestone with 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Qantas, the airline of Australia, has taken a slightly different  
tack. It has ordered its executives not to fly. Airline chief James 
Strong said in April he wanted his decision makers on the ground 
and in the board room that night, ready to deal with any problems 
that might crop up. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be quite the opposite in China. There, the Communist  
government has ordered its airline executives to fly, exhibiting 
confidence that the country has addressed its computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the world's airlines say that, as of now, they will  
be flying as usual for the lull between Christmas and New Year's, 
which means at about 75 percent of their normal capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	British Airways, Virgin Atlantic's bitter rival, says it may  
even be busier than usual thanks to a huge millennium bash in 
London and the city's closeness to Greenwich, England, where 
Greenwich Mean Time is marked. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry has been preparing for it for some time,'' said  
Mary Pat Sullivan, publisher of Leisure Travel News, a weekly trade 
publication. ``Consumer interest was high early, but things are 
starting to tail off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She expects deals on airplane tickets in the near future. One  
special flight is nearly sold out, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Pevsner, a tour operator who has arranged record-breaking  
flights around the world on the Concorde, has chartered one of Air 
France's supersonic jets for perhaps the ultimate New Year's 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	Travelers will party in the hours leading up to midnight at an  
airport hotel and move to the aircraft close to the stroke of 
midnight. A half hour into the new century, their jet will take 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next 3 1/2 hours, they will indulge in a variety of  
champagne and other first-class fare while the in-cabin speedometer 
ticks steadily higher, eventually hitting a top speed of 1,400 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	At a cruise altitude of nearly 60,000 feet -- over 11 miles high,  
or about double the height of standard jetliners -- they will be 
able to see the curvature of the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	After they descend for a landing in New York about 10 p.m. back  
on Dec. 31, private helicopters will whisk them over the traffic 
below and on to Times Square, for their second countdown of the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be the only people seeing in the New Year in  
both Europe and the United States,'' Pevsner said of he and the 
other 99 travelers on his trip. ``They see it as a totally unique 
way to see in the millennium.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Offers Prayers for Kennedys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying the Kennedys ``have suffered much and  
given more'' as a family, a grim-faced President Clinton offered 
the prayers of a nation on Sunday as authorities scanned the ocean 
in hopes of finding the son of the one president Clinton personally 
idolized. 
</P>
<P>
	Arriving at the White House from Camp David, Md., Clinton  
thanked the Coast Guard and other searchers who are trolling the 
coast off Martha's Vineyard, where wreckage from a private plane 
carrying John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and 
sister-in-law Lauren Bessette began washing ashore on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this difficult moment, we hope the families of these three  
fine young people will feel the strength of God, the love of their 
friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke several hours before Coast Guard officials announced  
Sunday evening that the military focus was shifting from a search 
and rescue operation to a search and wreckage recovery operation. 
</P>
<P>
	His words rang with personal loss. The Clintons have spent time  
with the Kennedys during vacations on Martha's Vineyard, sharing 
boating excursions and dinners at a compound once owned by 
Kennedy's late mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	``For more than 40 years now, the Kennedy family has inspired  
Americans to public service, strengthened our faith in the future 
and moved our nation forward,'' Clinton said. ``Through it all, 
they have suffered much and given more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Kennedy and his wife, who were married almost three  
years ago, ``have captured our imagination and won our affection'' 
in recent years. He said he would always be grateful ``for their 
kindnesses to Hillary and Chelsea and me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton stepped off his helicopter with his wife and daughter.  
They locked hands and walked in unison across the lawn, Mrs. 
Clinton sandwiched in the middle. When he finished speaking, 
Clinton swallowed hard and disappeared into the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke just a few feet away from the Rose Garden  
where, as a teen-ager, he met President Kennedy on July 24, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, Clinton was one among several attending Boys Nation.  
When he graduated high school, young Clinton scribbled his name 
below a photograph of himself and Kennedy in the yearbooks of his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is unabashed in his admiration of Kennedy, and weaves  
Kennedy influences into his policies and actions in a variety of 
ways. For example, when Clinton journeyed to Africa last year, he 
made Ghana his first stop because it was the first nation where 
Kennedy's Peace Corps began operating. 
</P>
<P>
	He once said Kennedy's emphasis on public service ``taught me to  
believe in America. ... He made it seem fun and noble and good. The 
best we can do is to keep the torch burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to David Maraniss' 1995 biography, ``First in His  
Class,'' Clinton wrote a letter to his mother while studying at 
Georgetown, telling her that a friend who had worked for Kennedy, 
Tommy Caplan, was preparing to spend time with an especially 
precocious toddler. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Kennedy Jr. is supposed to visit him at Georgetown  
sometime this year,'' Clinton wrote. ``He is only three years old, 
but this boy says he is a really smart boy and just like his 
daddy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an adult, the younger Kennedy found his way back to the White  
House -- on Clinton's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton announced the first woman to command a U.S. space  
shuttle mission, Kennedy was there, in the audience. He brought 
along his wife in February 1998, when Clinton played host to a 
state dinner for British Prime Minister Tony Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy bowed as he greeted Hillary Rodham Clinton and Cherie  
Blair, while Bessette removed her long evening gloves before 
shaking Clinton's hand. 
</P>
<P>
	In Los Angeles, Vice President Al Gore canceled a Sunday brunch  
that was to raise funds for his presidential campaign. He attended 
Mass at the Sacred Heart Church, and told reporters afterward that 
his prayers were with the Kennedy family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Above all, we are reminded of the sacrifices of the Kennedy  
family, and how precious and fragile life is,'' Gore said.

<HEADLINE> Aerial Search for JFK Jr. Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- An aerial search resumed Sunday after  
Coast Guard cutters combing the waters off Martha's Vineyard 
overnight found no signs of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Their plane was reported missing off the shores off the resort  
island early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard Falcon jet took off about 6 a.m. to begin the  
daytime search and assess weather conditions, said Coast Guard 
Chief Petty Officer Dennis Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour earlier, authorities began combing the beach on  
all-terrain vehicles looking for any signs of the plane or its 
passengers that may have washed ashore, said state police Lt. 
Richard Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
	A daylong search Saturday yielded plane fragments, a  
prescription bottle belonging to Kennedy's wife and a piece of 
baggage belonging to his sister-in-law, but no signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard cutters using bright lights and a sonar-equipped  
submersible searched overnight, but three helicopters and an Air 
National Guard C-130 airplane were grounded early Sunday because of 
low haze. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said Sunday that searchers still hope to find the plane's  
passengers alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still consider this a search and rescue effort,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelley said a dive team had been assembled from state police  
divers around the state in case searchers find something. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to exhaust all possibilities,'' Kelley said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33,  
and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, departed Friday night from 
Fairfield, N.J., to Cape Cod for the wedding of his cousin Rory, 
daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, at Hyannis Port. The 
wedding was postponed -- replaced with prayers for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	A family friend said Lauren Bessette was to be dropped off at  
the Vineyard before Kennedy and his wife continued on to Hyannis 
Port. Another friend reported the plane missing to the Coast Guard 
about 2:15 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philbin Beach in Aquinnah -- the portion of the Vineyard  
popularly known as Gay Head -- a wheel, a headrest and part of a 
plane support known as a strut had washed up, said Coast Guard Lt. 
Craig Jaramillo. A black bag with Lauren Bessette's name on it also 
was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA reported the last contact with the plane was at 9:39  
p.m. Friday during its final approach to the airport on the island 
off Cape Cod. Radar records showed the plane's last known location 
was about 17 miles southwest of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	John Fish, a sonar expert with Cape Cod-based American  
Underwater Search and Survey, said water depths range from 84 to 
120 feet in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seabed is flat, sugar sand, fine sand. There are no  
canyons that would hide wreckage,'' Fish said. However, he said 
shadows from boulders and debris from about 20 shipwrecks in the 
area could hinder the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy recently acquired the single-engine, six-seat Piper  
Saratoga II HP -- a plane known in the aviation industry as a 
high-performance airplane with a good safety record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, flying it at night, in a hazy sky and under visual  
flight rules -- the reported conditions Friday night -- is 
challenging. Kennedy had obtained his pilot's license last year, 
but he was not licensed to fly on instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th  
anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident, in which Sen. Edward 
Kennedy's car went off a bridge, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne 
on a tiny island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Universally known as ``John John,'' Kennedy has lived entirely  
in the public eye, from his birth shortly after his father's 
election as the nation's 35th president, to his poignant salute on 
the day of his namesake's funeral, to his romances with Daryl 
Hannah and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	A former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he launched  
his own political magazine, George, in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was wed Sept. 21, 1996, to Bessette Kennedy, a former  
publicist for fashion designer Calvin Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, who is 18 months older than Carolyn, worked as  
an investment banker in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Kennedy, the only other survivor of the young family  
that transfixed the world four decades ago, was on a rafting trip 
out West, CNN reported.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Honor Yogi Berra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After 14 years, it was finally Yogi Berra's day  
at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of broke down a little bit,'' Berra said after the  
ceremony. ``I heard a lot of pros and cons about whether I should 
come back. I'm glad we made up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra's ongoing feud with George Steinbrenner over his firing as  
manager in 1985 kept him away from the Yankees until their 
reconciliation in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra had been back at Yankee Stadium this year to throw out the  
first pitch at the home opener, take part in Joe DiMaggio Day and 
watch other games. On Sunday, Berra was the focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra was showered with gifts from the Yankees and applause from  
the fans. He was given a trip to Italy -- and a meeting with the 
Pope -- a 1998 World Series ring, a collection of rings from his 10 
championships as a player. He also received a framed jersey, the 
original 1951 World Series banner and $100,000 for his baseball 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	But the best part for Berra was seeing former teammates like  
Bobby Brown, Jerry Coleman, Whitey Ford, Don Larsen, Gil McDougald, 
Phil Rizzuto, Joe Pepitone and Bobby Richardson and former players 
like Mel Stottlemyre, Don Mattingly and Willie Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was touching to see all the guys,'' Berra said. ``They  
didn't tell me who was coming. It was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra even caught the ceremonial first pitch from Larsen -- the  
same battery that combined on the only perfect game in World Series 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could have gotten through that game without  
Yogi behind the plate,'' Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	After DiMaggio's death in March, Berra gained the unofficial  
title of the greatest living Yankee and was the biggest link to the 
team's dynasty in the 1940s, 50s and 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was always the main stay at Old-Timers' Day and  
those events,'' said Bobby Richardson, who played with Berra and 
for him. ``Yogi has taken over that role now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 14 years, Berra had stayed away from the team he spent 17  
years with a player, then managed twice and coached. The whole 
thing started when Steinbrenner dispatched general manager Clyde 
King to fire Berra after a 6-10 start in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the home opener in April, the man who coined the phrase  
``it ain't over 'til it's over'' had stayed away from Yankee 
Stadium for any official event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been fired three times and twice was told by the owner,''  
Berra said. ``One time I wasn't. A manager is hired to be fired. I 
just wanted to hear it from the owner, not someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra and Steinbrenner reconciled in January and Berra is once  
again a prominent part of the Yankees. He visited the team in 
spring training and drops in on Yankees manager Joe Torre and the 
coaching staff just to talk baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he hadn't been away for so long it wouldn't be Yogi Berra  
Day,'' Torre said. ``Every day would have been Yogi Berra Day. Yogi 
is a major part of what this team is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his time away from the Yankees, Berra coached for the  
Houston Astros, built his museum and occasionally showed up at 
Yankee Stadium early in the day -- before he could be noticed -- to 
visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what uniform you would see him in, he was always in  
a Yankee in my view,'' said Don Mattingly, who played for Berra in 
1984-85. ``I'm glad that he has settled his issues because this is 
where he belongs.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise in Midday Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks rose Monday morning, bolstered by  
Friday's record closing-high on Wall Street and expectations the 
Japanese government may consider a supplementary budget. The U.S. 
dollar fell against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 178.40 points,  
or 0.98 percent, to finish the morning session at 18,426.70. On 
Friday, the average closed down 183.56 points, or 1.00 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.55 yen at late morning, down 0.37 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo and also below its late Friday New York level 
of 120.95 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started higher after the Dow Jones  
industrial average rose 23.43 points to a record 11,209.84 Friday. 
The Standard and Poor's 500 stock index and high-tech heavy Nasdaq 
Composite Index also closed at record highs. 
</P>
<P>
	A report in Monday's Nihon Keizai financial newspaper quoting  
Economic Planning Agency Director-General Taichi Sakaiya as saying 
Japan may need a supplementary budget of about 5 trillion yen (dlrs 
41 billion) for the current fiscal year was also providing support, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, traders weren't expecting any sharp advances in the  
market ahead of a national holiday in Japan on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to expect the market to go sharply higher in  
the afternoon ahead of the holiday,'' said Hidenori Karaki, general 
manager at Tokyo-Mitsubishi Personal Securities, 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 7.70 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,514.72. The 
TOPIX closed down 4.71 points, or 0.31 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar remained lower as demand for the  
yen was rising amid the Tokyo stock market's gains, traders said. 
The euro's weakness against the yen also indirectly weighed on the 
greenback, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said the dollar's retreat against the Japanese currency  
would be limited on continued fears over possible intervention by 
the Bank of Japan to prevent the yen from rising. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan has intervened to buy the greenback several  
times in recent weeks to keep the yen from rising. A higher yen 
make Japanese exports more expensive abroad and thus less 
competitive, cutting into earnings of export-oriented Japanese 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 121.92 yen, down  
from 123.34 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.7800 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7550 percent, 
driving its price down to 100.17 yen from 100.38 yen.

<HEADLINE> JFK Calamity Recalls Chappaquiddick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The time, July; the place, off Martha's Vineyard; the name,  
Kennedy. All were the same. Only the nature of the calamity was 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a Friday night 30 years ago, July 18, 1969, that a dark  
blue Oldsmobile 98 hurtled off a narrow wooden bridge into a tidal 
pond on the tiny island of Chappaquiddick, adjacent to Martha's 
Vineyard, killing 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne. 
</P>
<P>
	The car's owner and driver was Sen. Edward Kennedy, 37, the last  
of the four Kennedy brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident became another piece of the Kennedy history of  
tragedy and ended any hope Kennedy had of becoming president. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is only a few miles from where a search continued  
Sunday for a private plane carrying the senator's nephew John F. 
Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister 
Lauren Bessette. The plane went down Friday night on a flight from 
New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Martha's Vineyard, an island off Cape Cod, has always been  
important to the Kennedys as a summer playground. On that weekend 
in 1969, Ted Kennedy and 11 other people gathered for a cookout at 
a rented cottage on Chappaquiddick. 
</P>
<P>
	All were Kennedy loyalists: five men employed by or friendly  
with the senator, and six women, ``Boiler Room Girls'' who had 
worked in Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's presidential campaign, cut short 
by his assassination in Los Angeles the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants have always said the party was innocent, even  
though five of the men, including Ted Kennedy, were married and the 
six women were all single. 
</P>
<P>
	All agreed in later testimony that Kennedy and Ms. Kopechne left  
the party shortly before midnight, saying they were tired, to 
return to Edgartown on the Martha's Vineyard side of a 
150-yard-wide channel. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened next has remained in dispute, with an unexplained  
gap of one hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy said he mistakenly turned right onto a gravel road and  
skidded off the bridge, the car landing upside-down in eight feet 
of water. After escaping the car, he tried unsuccessfully to rescue 
Ms. Kopechne, then staggered a mile back to the party cottage, 
where he got his cousin Joseph Gargan and friend Paul Markham to 
return for a second rescue try. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing that, they went to the ferry landing, where, they said,  
Kennedy ``impulsively'' jumped into the water and swam across to 
Edgartown, by his own account ``nearly drowning a second time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gargan and Markham, a former federal prosecutor in Boston, said  
they assumed that Kennedy, once at Edgartown, would contact the 
police, and were stunned the next morning to discover he had not 
done so. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact it was a full nine hours -- and after he learned that the  
submerged car with a body inside had been discovered -- that Kennedy 
reported the accident to police and said he had been the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point the Kennedy clout in Massachusetts kicked in. The  
other partygoers quickly left the island, and Ms. Kopechne's body 
was flown by Kennedy-chartered plane to her hometown of 
Wilkes-Barre, Pa. No autopsy was performed. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy attended the funeral, with a neck brace he was never  
seen wearing again. 
</P>
<P>
	After a week's silence, holed up at the family's Hyannis  
compound with such Kennedy ``brain trust'' figures as Ted Sorenson, 
Robert F. McNamara and Arthur Schlesinger Jr., he told 
Massachusetts voters in a televised speech that he had been 
distraught and confused, wondered if there was a ``curse'' on the 
Kennedy family, and asked them to decide whether he should continue 
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite widespread media criticism -- The New York Times said the  
speech ``raises more questions than it answers'' and criticized 
Massachusetts officials for soft-pedaling the inquiry -- aides to 
Kennedy claimed the public overwhelmingly supported his staying in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	A week after the accident, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the  
scene of an accident and was given a two-month suspended jail 
sentence and a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous investigations by authors and news organizations  
spawned a variety of theories, among them that Ms. Kopechne or 
Gargan was driving the car. But none of these held up under careful 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1975, The Associated Press found numerous points of conflict  
between the sworn testimony of Kennedy and others at a 1970 inquest 
at Edgartown and a court hearing in Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	The partygoers, most of whom did not know at the time exactly  
what had happened, have remained all but silent for three decades. 
Kennedy himself has addressed the subject on occasion without 
adding new information or clarifying unanswered questions.

<HEADLINE> Caroline Kennedy Braces for Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She was the little girl who walked her dad to  
the Oval Office each morning and rode a pony on the White House 
lawn. Grown up now with a family of her own, Caroline Kennedy 
appears to be the last survivor of Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the day after her brother's plane went missing,  
Caroline Kennedy stayed far from the media and far from the rest of 
the Kennedy clan gathering in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	But after two days of searching waters off Martha's Vineyard,  
authorities conceded late Sunday that John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife 
and her sister, likely were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy, husband Edwin Schlossberg and their children aged  
12, 9 and 6 waited out the search at a home they have in 
Bridgehampton on the east end of Long Island, a summer playground 
for the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a characteristically discreet way for a very private  
woman to handle her very public life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy, who had been out West rafting with her family  
before her brother was reported missing, returned to Long Island 
Saturday. She had not planned to attend the wedding of Rory Kennedy 
at Hyannis Port, Mass., but it was not clear why. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., 38, was en route to the wedding when his plane  
disappeared. His wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, 
Lauren Bessette, were also on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy, 41, was extremely close to her brother. They were  
children together in the brief presidency that came to be known as 
Camelot, after the legend of King Arthur, going on 6 and 3 when 
their father was assassinated in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they endured the murder of their uncle, Robert F.  
Kennedy, in 1968, and adjusted when their mother, Jacqueline 
Kennedy, married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis the same 
year. They did well in private schools in New York, avoided drugs 
and scandals -- and were kept far from the rest of the Kennedy clan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jackie had made it a strict rule not to allow Caroline and  
John Jr. to fraternize with their Hickory Hill cousins,'' author 
Jerry Oppenheimer wrote in ``The Other Mrs. Kennedy,'' his book 
about Robert's wife, Ethel. Robert and Ethel Kennedy's homestead in 
Virginia was known as Hickory Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Burke, a former aide to another Kennedy brother, Sen.  
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said in the book that Caroline had 
previously spent time there ``but with all that stuff going on out 
at Hickory Hill -- especially the problems the boys were having -- 
Jackie just didn't want Caroline and John there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As adults, Caroline and John often joined forces, presenting an  
award to preservationists in their mother's honor, and launching 
another award in their father's memory. They allowed an auction 
house to sell off 5,000 items from their mother's estate, and later 
blocked someone else from selling some of their father's diaries. 
</P>
<P>
	But while JFK Jr.'s love life and career as a magazine publisher  
have always been tabloid fodder, Caroline Kennedy, a lawyer, was 
wary of the limelight. Her brother addressed the Democratic 
National Convention in 1988, but she declined to serve as 
convention chairwoman four years later. And while JFK Jr. walked 
out to talk to reporters camped outside the Fifth Avenue building 
where their mother died in May 1994, Caroline Kennedy kept her 
thoughts to herself. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that she shuns the public eye. She rides the subway and  
walks her kids to school. She appears frequently at arts events, 
co-chaired a gala fund-raiser for the American Ballet Theater and 
last spring presented an award to Hillary Rodham Clinton at Lincoln 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, she happily chatted with reporters about the legal  
issues in ``The Right to Privacy,'' a book about privacy law which 
she wrote with a law school classmate. But any question that poked 
into her own privacy was parried with: ``I'm not going to tell 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had earlier abandoned a career as a photojournalist because  
every time she tried to take pictures, someone was taking a picture 
of her. Her tall figure, honey-colored hair and shy smile were 
always bound to attract the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with her brother presumed dead, ``There's a kind of pathos  
of the lonely survivor,'' said Peter Collier, author of ``The 
Kennedys: An American Drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Caroline Kennedy married Schlossberg, a designer of museum  
interiors and exhibits, her brother served as best man, and gave 
this toast: ``All my life there has just been the three of us -- 
Mommy, Caroline and I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there is just the one.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Martin Concert Sells Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Atlanta fans went loco for tickets to Latin  
sensation Ricky Martin's upcoming concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oct. 24 show sold out in 30 minutes. Even at $97 apiece, the  
best of the 15,000 seats at the new Philips Arena, which hasn't 
even opened yet, were the first to go when they went on sale 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a hot show. It's the best sales we could have ever  
expected,'' said concert promoter Amy Helbert of Concert Southern 
Promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta concert is the only one scheduled in the Southeast,  
outside Florida, on a 15-city tour this fall, Ms. Helbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ricky Martin,'' the first English-language CD from the  
27-year-old singer, had the best-ever album debut by a Hispanic 
artist on the mainstream Billboard charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico native Rick Nieves snapped up two tickets for his  
teen-age daughters. He said he watched Martin's career take off 
during the early 1980s in Puerto Rico as the singer climbed to 
heartthrob status with the group Menudo. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was popular then, but now he's exploded with a new sound.  
The Latino influence is catching on,'' Nieves said.

	READING, Vt. (AP) -- Did you know that Anita Pascaret has been  
having back problems? Or that Marjorie Matthews ``has a house full 
of company''? Or that Mr. Wastrom has been ``finishing the back 
wall of the church and then will be doing the schoolhouse''? Or 
that the annual picnic of the Old Stone Church had ``plenty of food 
for all''? 
</P>
<P>
	You would know that and much, much more if you were a faithful  
reader of Eva Gasper's weekly column in the Vermont Standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gasper is 96, and for the past 20 years she has been  
sending the Standard all the news from the town of Reading, in 
southeastern Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
	And that means all the news.  
</P>
<P>
	The Vermont Standard, published 20 miles away in Woodstock, has  
a circulation of 4,500 and is one of several weekly newspapers in 
the state that still place a premium on the most local of news -- 
that generated by someone who knows the community and its people. 
</P>
<P>
	Certainly Mrs. Gasper does. She has lived in Reading since 1909.  
</P>
<P>
	She says Reading, with its population of around 700, is a ``very  
small place so it doesn't have much news.'' But you would never 
know it from reading her column. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past month readers have learned:  
</P>
<P>
	``Anita Pascaret has been in the hospital, suffering with her  
back. She is home now, but can't get out. I was sorry to hear this. 
She is a lovely lady, and sings in our choir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The sixth grade graduation took place last weekend. They went  
to Wells, Maine, on a whale watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Wastrom is here finishing the back wall of the church, and  
then will be doing the schoolhouse. I don't know how much he can 
get done, hopefully two walls. He is a busy man, and has all the 
work he can get done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gasper says some weeks there is too little news to fill a  
column, ``But I have to write a column on something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So tucked throughout are references to residents' birthdays and  
anniversaries and personal notes, such as, ``Bought myself a fan 
and love it'' and, ``Everyone is hoping for rain. It surely is 
needed badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many years when Mrs. Gasper would run out of news, she would  
wind up her column with memories of growing up in Reading at the 
beginning of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	``I carried that for a while, but even that ran out.''  
</P>
<P>
	So occasionally she ventures into the wider world with  
observations such as: ``Wow, so many are running for president of 
the United States... I like the vice president... 
</P>
<P>
	``There are things we all must look for getting the right one to  
run the country, to keep the economy up there, work for all, 
education for all, keep Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. 
One cannot look at party alone, but for the one who can give these 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A column following Memorial Day combined personal memories and  
commentary as she wrote about the two World Wars and the troubles 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	When World War I broke out ``I was a teen-ager then and recall  
so well how grand they all looked in uniform... World War II came 
soon after... It took away all the serenity I remember so well. Now 
another war is on. How many of our boys are going to be taken, 
before peace will be had? What will happen to so many out of homes 
and necessities of life?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of the local columns in the Vermont weeklies are as full  
of personal news and insights as is Mrs. Gasper's. But all provide 
an intimate look into small-town life, telling readers things that 
otherwise might not get around. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a holdover from the past but it has come to be part of  
the paper that sets us apart from other publications,'' says Kevin 
Forrest, 47, the editor of the Standard. ``It makes us truly local. 
It gives us the neighborhood feeling. Plus it is just good 
down-home entertainment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gasper, a small woman with a spirit that makes her seem  
twice her size and half her age, starts work on her column each 
Saturday, sitting in her comfortable chair in the living room, 
telephone in hand, pad and pen at the ready as she works her way 
through a list of people she calls weekly in her hunt for news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't get out much,'' she says. ``I don't drive and I don't  
get to see very much so I have to find out what I can from the 
telephone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She takes notes of her conversations and at the end of the day  
pulls out a typewriter and writes about half of her column. She 
spends most of Sunday at church and Bible study -- ``It's a 
tremendously busy day'' -- but when she gets home finishes the 
column, often dropping in nuggets picked up from church. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gasper isn't in it for the money. There is no regular pay  
for the column. ``We get a bonus at Christmas time that I use to 
buy gifts and we get the paper free and we get to advertise free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She says she loves the task. ``I don't feel any different at 96  
than I did at 50. This keeps me going. I tell Kevin I ought to quit 
and he should get someone younger, but he keeps telling me that 
people like what I write.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the local drama. A few weeks ago the following was  
revealed: 
</P>
<P>
	``On Friday night of this week we went shopping and out for  
pizza. It didn't look so good so Mrs. Pugh tried a little piece of 
it, and afterward was taken with terrible chills, vomiting, cold 
sweats, etc. She thought she was dying. She was too sick to go to 
the hospital. She thinks it could have been the cheese. She is 
feeling some better today, but a ways to go before she can do 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The July 1 edition of the Standard brought this update:  
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Pugh went to see the doctor, and found she has a bladder  
infection. It wasn't the pizza after all.''

<HEADLINE>  David Cone Defines 1990s Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He's glib, he's hip and now he's perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	He's a medical marvel, and at 36, the oldest pitcher to throw a  
perfect game since Cy Young in 1904. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone may be the defining face of this decade's New York  
Yankees, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the type of guy everyone says, ``When is his arm going to  
fall off?' '' Derek Jeter said following Cone's perfect game Sunday 
against Montreal. ``They keep doubting him, but he keeps proving 
them wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Brian Cone overcame an aneurysm in his pitching arm and a  
bone spur in his shoulder to be part of two World Series champions 
and to pitch in two more All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City, Mo., native has been a New Yorker for some time  
now, living in the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan, unlike 
most of his teammates, who prefer the quiet of the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, a taxi hit his car while he was driving to the  
ballpark; he still made batting practice on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing seems to faze him. Whenever there's a stressful moment,  
he's the player teammates turn to for guidance and stability. He's 
a union leader, mentioned as a possible successor to Donald Fehr, 
and a clubhouse leader, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely the guy on the team we all look to,'' Chili  
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the right-hander became a 20-game winner for the  
first time in a decade, the longest gap in baseball history between 
20-win seasons, and now he's 10-4 in 18 starts with a 2.65 ERA, 
second in the American League. A five-time All-Star and 1994 AL Cy 
Young Award winner, Cone is 178-97 in his career with a 3.14 ERA 
and three Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	Still probably short of Hall of Fame numbers, but his worth goes  
beyond stats. It's his grit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He leaves his heart on the mound every time he goes out  
there,'' Chuck Knoblauch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on off day, Cone manages to win or at least keep it close.  
</P>
<P>
	``Think about what he's been through, with the surgeries and the  
aneurysm,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``You look at a handful of 
players in each sport and say that they get the most possible out 
of their ability, David Cone is one of those players. Physically 
and mentally, he's a special player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following last year's World Series sweep of San Diego, the  
Yankees weren't sure whether to re-sign Cone, even after he went 
20-7. Finally, on Nov. 11, he haggled out an $8 million, one-year 
contract that gives him the chance to earn an additional $100,000 
for each start from 17 through 31. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had confidence in his heart, if not his arm.  
</P>
<P>
	``The questions are valid if you look at the MRIs and the  
X-rays,'' Cone said Sunday. ``The MRI and the X-rays only show so 
much. Doctors only tell half the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On May 10, 1996, after missing a start for the first time in  
nine years, Cone was diagnosed with the aneurysm near his right 
armpit, an illness some thought might be life threatening. Doctors 
took a one-inch vein from his left thigh and used it to repair two 
arteries in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than four months later, he made a most amazing return,  
pitching seven no-hit innings at Oakland before manager Joe Torre 
and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre decided 85 pitches were enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe was going to leave the decision to me, I'm going back  
out there and throw caution to the wind,'' Cone said at the time. 
``I think Mel and Joe did the right thing, trying to protect me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees down 2-0 to Atlanta, he turned around the World  
Series by winning Game 3. He went 12-6 in '97 but by October, when 
Cleveland battered him in a playoff start, it was clear he needed 
another operation. 
</P>
<P>
	After an arthroscopic surgery cleaned up the shoulder that  
December, the Yankees babied him in the spring of 1998. Turned out, 
the best of his career was still to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more to pitching than medical history,'' he said.

	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- The U.S. team arrived Sunday for the  
FIFA Confederations Cup, and coach Bruce Arena acknowledged the 
Americans are a longshot.

<HEADLINE> Tribute Held for Flyers Announcer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Hundreds of Philadelphia Flyers fans, as  
well as former and current players, helped eulogize the late hockey 
announcer Gene Hart on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team opened up the First Union Center, the Flyers' home  
arena, for the afternoon service, which included video clips of 
Hart, performances by members of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the 
Opera Company of Philadelphia and eulogies from his family and 
Flyers officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart died Wednesday at the age of 68.  
</P>
<P>
	``Gene Hart was the Flyers' ambassador of hockey,'' team  
chairman Ed Snider said. ``When you think of Gene, you think of the 
Flyers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was remembered as someone who taught the public about  
hockey beginning 32 years ago, a time when few Americans knew much 
about the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had a unique ability to explain and teach without offending  
those who already understood,'' Snider said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hart was also remembered as a classical music enthusiast and a  
language scholar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene Hart was as responsible as anybody for building the  
incredibly loyal fan base that the Philadelphia Flyers enjoy,'' 
Philadelphia Mayor Edward G. Rendell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Hart would always agree to show up at events for civic  
organizations that needed an entertaining celebrity as a public 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the circumstances were, he could make you  
laugh,'' Rendell said. ``It's a rare gift that few of us have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart's love of music, and his amateur opera career, also were  
remembered through music by members of the Philadelphia Orchestra 
and the Opera Company of Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	The family also planned a private funeral service Monday.

<HEADLINE> Search for JFK Jr. Draws Former Foes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- The search for John F. Kennedy Jr. drew  
many helping hands, even those of American Indians who fiercely 
battled his mother over rights to the land he was flying toward 
when his plane vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	As the search stretched into a second day on Sunday, the help  
included three rangers from the Wampanoag Tribe, who had fought 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis over a small plot of land within her 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our nature to help out,'' said William D. Vanderhoop, a  
Wampanoag who has lived in Aquinnah all his 69 years. ``We don't 
have bows and arrows and tomahawks here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, Mrs. Onassis was locked in a dispute with tribal  
members over a 1.5-acre plot of land completely surrounded by her 
365-acre seaside estate. The plot was considered sacred by tribal 
members, who have lived on the island for centuries. Mrs. Onassis 
wanted to buy the land to ensure her privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides battled for 10 years before settling in 1990. The  
Wampanoags agreed to surrender the site for $100,000 and two acres 
closer to the nearest road. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal historian June Manning sat on a bench in front of the Gay  
Head lighthouse Sunday afternoon and faced the Onassis home, which 
John Kennedy Jr. and his sister, Caroline, inherited from their 
mother in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``That shows you we don't hold grudges,'' Manning said. ``It  
shows the humanitarianism in us, which defines us as a tribal 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also volunteering in the huge search for Kennedy and his  
passengers, his wife and sister-in-law, were civilian pilots from 
up to 100 miles away and fishermen with depth-finders and years of 
knowledge about the waters around Aquinnah. 
</P>
<P>
	Herbie Hancock, a lobsterman who skippers the Billy H. out of  
Menemsha Harbor, said he and other fishermen were willing to lend 
their nets and depth-finders but had stayed away so they wouldn't 
interfere with the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Others agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't need people crisscrossing the area, tossing over  
sandwich wrappers. It's just better to let them to do their job,'' 
said a tugboat skipper who would not give his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Official searchers acknowledged that doing their duty this time  
had special poignancy because the object of their search was so 
celebrated and his family so well-known locally. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Don Desfosse, an auxiliary pilot from Hanscom Air Force  
Base in Bedford, Mass., spent Sunday in a small plane patrolling at 
1,500 feet about 20 miles southwest of Aquinnah. 
</P>
<P>
	Every time Desfosse and his crew thought they saw something in  
the water, he said, their hearts would race. And then there would 
be nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame,'' he said. ``Time to press on and find something  
real.''

<HEADLINE> Man Faces Charges in Recker Wreck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURANGO, Colo. (AP) -- A 21-year-old man was charged with at  
least 19 criminal counts in the crash that killed one man and 
injured former Indiana basketball star Luke Recker. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Conley Hardwick, Jr. was charged Friday with vehicular  
homicide, and five counts each of vehicular assault and vehicular 
assault while driving under the influence. He was also charged with 
seven counts of careless driving resulting in bodily injury and 
driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
	State Trooper Mike McGuire said Hardwick's truck drifted across  
the center line at about 70 mph on July 10, sideswiping a pickup 
carrying 11 people and then hitting head-on the car in which Recker 
was riding. 
</P>
<P>
	John A. Hollberg, 23, of Senoia, Ga., was killed. The other four  
passengers riding with Recker were hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker, who transferred to Arizona after last season, was not  
planning to play basketball at Arizona next season. NCAA rules 
require that he sit out the upcoming season.

	Thunderstorms and rain flowed across the upper Midwest on  
Sunday, and scattered thunderstorms also developed across wide 
areas of the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms and locally heavy rain stretched from central  
North Dakota into northeastern South Dakota, most of southern 
Minnesota and northern Iowa during the middle of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The storms moved rapidly eastward, and by late afternoon radar  
showed the heaviest rain falling across the southern half of 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	In the South, scattered thunderstorms developed late in the  
morning near the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	During the heat of the afternoon, those storms rapidly became  
more numerous and spread inland, stretching over coastal Texas and 
expanding across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida, and 
through Georgia into parts of South Carolina. 
</P>

	TORONTO (AP) -- After starting out the season like Superman, Juan  
Montoya is beginning to look a lot more human. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old Colombian rookie crashed out of Sunday's Toronto  
Molson Indy, failing to finish for the second straight race. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who still leads Dario Franchitti, Sunday's winner, by  
seven points in the season standings, won four times and finished 
in the points (the top 12) in eight of the first nine CART FedEx 
Series races he ran. 
</P>
<P>
	The precocious rookie started eighth and was running solidly in  
the top 10 on Sunday until he was penalized to the rear of the 
lead-lap cars for running over Tony Kanaan's air hose in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya was battling back, racing Michel Jourdain Jr. for ninth  
place, when the two came together and crashed on lap 60 of the 
95-lap event in the streets of downtown Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend was a disaster,'' Montoya said. ``We struggled  
with the car on Friday and Saturday, but the race was looking good. 
After I ran over the hose, I was coming back, but I got stuck 
behind Max (Papis). 
</P>
<P>
	``Then I was trying to pass Jourdain on the inside coming into  
the corner. Once we came out of the corner, I didn't see him on the 
left and we touched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jourdain had a slightly different description.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to pass Montoya at the exit of turn three,  
side-by-side. But at the next turn, he didn't allow me to pass, 
squeezing me into the wall. In the process, he touched the front of 
my car and in the rebound, my right rear touched Montoya's left 
rear and we both were unable to continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jourdain was scored 21st and Montoya 22nd, by far his worst CART  
finish. 
</P>

	SUPERSUB IS BACK: Roberto Moreno bounced back from a non-finish  
at Road America to finish fourth Sunday in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The 40-year-old Brazilian earned the nickname ``Supersub'' by  
finishing in the points in his first five races filling in for 
PacWest Motorsports Group driver Mark Blundell. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he came all the way from 17th in the 27-car field to  
match his best PacWest result and make it six points finishes in 
seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't have the fastest car today, but we made the most of  
what we had,'' Moreno said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell broke his collarbone in a crash during testing in  
Madison, Ill., on May 4. He is scheduled to return to the car on 
Aug. 8 in Detroit. Moreno will remain in the car next week for the 
U.S. 500 at Michigan Speedway.

	HAT MAN: CART chief Steward Wally Dallenbach, known for his  
cowboy boots and 10-gallon hat, made good on a bet Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallenbach had a standing offer to Christian Fittipaldi since  
the Brazilian driver joined the Champ Car series in 1995 that he 
would give up his trademark brown Stetson hat with the feathered 
band when Fittipaldi got his first win. 
</P>
<P>
	It took Fittipaldi 71 races to get to that first checkered flag,  
but Dallenbach, as promised, handed over the hat during the prerace 
driver's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Fittipaldi wore it proudly during the postrace press conference  
after finishing third on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	HIT MAN: Greg Moore had a terrible day.  
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian driver started 10th and ran among the leaders until  
Michael Andretti ran into the back of his car on lap 12, sending 
Moore spinning. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the race, he collided with Al Unser Jr. as the two  
battled for position. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Moore retired with a reported cooling system failure on  
lap 67, relegating him to 20th place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like a pinball machine,'' he said. ``I got hit twice.  
The first hit was harder and I think that's what caused the 
mechanical problem that took me out of the race later on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a non-points finish, Moore fell to seventh in the  
standings, trailing Montoya by 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	SPARK PLUGS: Franchitti is the eighth different winner in 11  
CART races this season. Of his four career victories, three have 
come on temporary road circuits. ... Patrick Racing teammates 
Adrian Fernandez and P.J. Jones gained a total of 17 places between 
them in Sunday's race, with Fernandez starting 23rd and finishing 
sixth and Jones starting 20th and finishing 10th. ... Honda drivers 
have won the last 10 CART races on temporary street circuits, 
dating to April of 1998 in Long Beach. ... Al Unser Jr., who 
finished ninth, made his 265th career start, breaking out of a tie 
with retired Bobby Rahal for the most starts in CART history. He is 
the only active driver to have run in all 14 races in Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Seattle Signs Its No. 1 Draft Choice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners on Sunday announced they  
signed high school catcher Ryan Christianson, their first-round 
pick and the 11th overall selection in last month's baseball draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianson, 18, from Arlington High School in Riverside,  
Calif., will report to the Mariners' rookie league team in Peoria, 
Ariz. If he plays well there, he could be elevated to Class A 
Everett of the Northwest League in ``a couple of weeks,'' said 
Frank Mattox, the team's director of scouting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to get him going in Peoria,'' Mattox said at a  
news conference. ``The main thing now is to get him playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Reynolds, Christianson's agent, said his client signed a  
standard minor-league contract with a signing bonus, but neither he 
nor Mattox would reveal its terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``After three years hopefully, he'll be good enough where the  
Mariners want to put him on their 40-man roster,'' Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Christianson is a 6-foot-2, 210-pounder who is a right-handed  
hitter. He batted .514 (38-for-74) with eight homers and 40 RBIs in 
his senior high school season, helping his team post a 29-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll be a little bit disappointed if I'm not up here  
in at least four years,'' Christianson said.

<HEADLINE> Brazil 3, Uruguay 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Brazil repeated as South American  
champion, beating Uruguay 3-0 Sunday on a pair of goals by Rivaldo 
and another by Ronaldo to win the America Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that the others were bad, but Brazil right now is  
superior,'' defender Roberto Carlos said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which last year lost to France in the World Cup final,  
went ahead in the 21st minute when Flavio Conceicao curled in a 
free kick from the left side and Rivaldo headed it past goalkeeper 
Fabian Carini from the near post. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivaldo scored again six minutes later, taking a cross from Ze  
Roberto, trapping the ball, shaking his defender with a dribble and 
gently chipping the ball over Carini. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely a minute into the second half, Rivaldo spotted Ronaldo on  
a breakaway and sent a perfect pass to the forward, who sent a hard 
shot past Carini to make it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an especially happy moment, because it's been a  
difficult year for me,'' said Ronaldo, who was a non-factor when he 
played hurt in the World Cup final, struggled with tendinitis in 
his knees during the Italian League season and broke up with his 
fiance. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronaldo and Rivaldo scored five goals each, tied for the lead in  
the biennial tournament. Brazil, the only four-time World Cup 
champion, outscored opponents 17-2 in winning its sixth South 
American title. Uruguay and Argentina have the most, 14 each. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first phase of our project to prepare for the  
Olympics and the 2002 World Cup,'' Brazil coach Wanderley 
Luxemburgo said. ``We're happy with the win, but our minds are on 
the World Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil plays the United States on July 28 in the FIFA  
Confederations Cup at Guadalajara, Mexico. Ronaldo, a two-time 
world player of the year, is not making the trip for that 
tournament.

	Still No Signs of JFK Jr.  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- A massive aerial search of the sea off  
Martha's Vineyard that resumed today has yet to find any signs of 
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister. Their plane was 
reported missing off the shores off the resort island early 
yesterday. At a news conference, police Capt. Robert Bird appealed 
to the public to turn over any debris that might be related to the 
crash, noting that holding on to such evidence is a criminal 
offense. Yesterday's search yielded plane fragments, a prescription 
bottle belonging to Kennedy's wife and a piece of baggage belonging 
to his sister-in-law, but no signs of life.

	Yugoslav Army Warns Opposition

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav's top general blasted  
increasingly vocal opponents of President Slobodan Milosevic as 
traitors, in remarks published today, amid growing infighting on 
the part of opposition leaders seeking to oust Milosevic. ``Those 
who call for a forceful ouster of the legally elected authorities 
... cannot count on people's support,'' Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, the 
army chief of staff, said in remarks published by the 
pro-government daily Politika. The general is one of five top 
officials, including Milosevic, indicted on war crimes charges by 
an international tribunal for alleged atrocities against ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo.

the Golan Heights would not require the presence of U.S. troops. 
``I believe that within 15 months from now we will know whether we 
have major breakthroughs on the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese 
tracks or not,'' Barak told NBC. Barak said any accord on the Golan 
Heights, captured by Israel in its 1967 war with the Arab states, 
could be monitored by a few dozen U.N. observers.

basis.'' ``According to confessions and information received by the

riots were guided and supported from abroad,'' said IRNA. The 
Intelligence Ministry is controlled by hard-line clerics who were 
the target of the protesters' anger.

four battle zones in Kashmir and said its soldiers would reoccupy

<HEADLINE> David Cone Defines 1990s Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He's glib, he's hip and now he's perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	He's a medical marvel, and at 36, the oldest pitcher to throw a  
perfect game since Cy Young in 1904. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone may be the defining face of this decade's New York  
Yankees, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the type of guy everyone says, ``When is his arm going to  
fall off?' '' Derek Jeter said following Cone's perfect game Sunday 
against Montreal. ``They keep doubting him, but he keeps proving 
them wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Brian Cone overcame an aneurysm in his pitching arm and a  
bone spur in his shoulder to be part of two World Series champions 
and to pitch in two more All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City, Mo., native has been a New Yorker for some time  
now, living in the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan, unlike 
most of his teammates, who prefer the quiet of the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, a taxi hit his car while he was driving to the  
ballpark; he still made batting practice on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing seems to faze him. Whenever there's a stressful moment,  
he's the player teammates turn to for guidance and stability. He's 
a union leader, mentioned as a possible successor to Donald Fehr, 
and a clubhouse leader, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely the guy on the team we all look to,'' Chili  
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the right-hander became a 20-game winner for the  
first time in a decade, the longest gap in baseball history between 
20-win seasons, and now he's 10-4 in 18 starts with a 2.65 ERA, 
second in the American League. A five-time All-Star and 1994 AL Cy 
Young Award winner, Cone is 178-97 in his career with a 3.14 ERA 
and three Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	Still probably short of Hall of Fame numbers, but his worth goes  
beyond stats. It's his grit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He leaves his heart on the mound every time he goes out  
there,'' Chuck Knoblauch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on off day, Cone manages to win or at least keep it close.  
</P>
<P>
	``Think about what he's been through, with the surgeries and the  
aneurysm,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``You look at a handful of 
players in each sport and say that they get the most possible out 
of their ability, David Cone is one of those players. Physically 
and mentally, he's a special player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following last year's World Series sweep of San Diego, the  
Yankees weren't sure whether to re-sign Cone, even after he went 
20-7. Finally, on Nov. 11, he haggled out an $8 million, one-year 
contract that gives him the chance to earn an additional $100,000 
for each start from 17 through 31. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had confidence in his heart, if not his arm.  
</P>
<P>
	``The questions are valid if you look at the MRIs and the  
X-rays,'' Cone said Sunday. ``The MRI and the X-rays only show so 
much. Doctors only tell half the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On May 10, 1996, after missing a start for the first time in  
nine years, Cone was diagnosed with the aneurysm near his right 
armpit, an illness some thought might be life threatening. Doctors 
took a one-inch vein from his left thigh and used it to repair two 
arteries in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than four months later, he made a most amazing return,  
pitching seven no-hit innings at Oakland before manager Joe Torre 
and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre decided 85 pitches were enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe was going to leave the decision to me, I'm going back  
out there and throw caution to the wind,'' Cone said at the time. 
``I think Mel and Joe did the right thing, trying to protect me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees down 2-0 to Atlanta, he turned around the World  
Series by winning Game 3. He went 12-6 in '97 but by October, when 
Cleveland battered him in a playoff start, it was clear he needed 
another operation. 
</P>
<P>
	After an arthroscopic surgery cleaned up the shoulder that  
December, the Yankees babied him in the spring of 1998. Turned out, 
the best of his career was still to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more to pitching than medical history,'' he said.

	Search for JFK Jr. Continues  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Searchers looking for John F. Kennedy  
Jr.'s plane zeroed in on a spot at the bottom of the sea after 
picking up an automatic emergency signal today, while Americans 
grieved over the almost certain deaths of Kennedy, his wife and her 
sister. A sonar-equipped ship was sent to the spot off Martha's 
Vineyard where debris from the plane was found earlier. The 
glamorous, 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 
33, and her older sister Lauren Bessette were feared dead after the 
single-engine plane he was piloting went down in the waters off 
Martha's Vineyard on Friday night en route to a family wedding. 

</P>
<P>
	News Media Seize on Kennedy Tragedy  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cable and broadcast news shows focused on the  
fate of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 
and his sister-in-law Lauren Bessette, who were feared dead after 
their plane went down off the Massachusetts coast Friday night. 
Today's newspapers devoted page after page to coverage of the 
search. While The New York Times placed the story on the left-hand, 
secondary spot on its front page, The Washington Post ran the 
banner headline ``JFK Jr. Feared Dead in Plane Crash,'' and the New 
York Post cried, ``MORE TEARS.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton assured Chinese President  
Jiang Zemin in a telephone call today that the United States is 
committed to its ``one China'' policy despite Taiwan's moves toward 
independence. Clinton spoke with Jiang for a half-hour from the 
presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland. China has promised 
to crush any attempt by Taiwan to break away, after Taiwanese 
President Lee Teng-hui stated July 9 that relations with China 
should be conducted on a ``state-to-state'' basis.

<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Paul Lawrie, 10 strokes behind when  
the final round began today, became the first Scotsman to win the 
British Open in his native land in 68 years -- but only after a 
three-way playoff caused by Jean Van de Velde's triple bogey on the 
72nd hole. Lawrie won the four-hole playoff over Van de Velde and 
Justin Leonard, making birdies on the last two holes to win the 
claret jug before a delirious, shell-shocked gallery at Carnoustie 
Golf Links.

<HEADLINE> Hand Washing for Kids Encouraged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- It may seem obvious, but health  
professionals say there's one easy way to keep children in school 
more days: Encourage them to wash their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Not just once a day, but four times a day.  
</P>
<P>
	And let them sing out while they scrub -- ``Yankee Doodle'' is  
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	After Wood County elementary students were urged to wash their  
hands often, absenteeism fell by 1 percent -- meaning 125 more kids 
a day were in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The county's hand-washing experiment is in its second year. The  
project, started with the help of St. Joseph's Hospital in 
Parkersburg, was tested in two schools and then expanded to the 
county's 20 elementary schools. Plans are to take it to middle and 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Health professionals say hand washing is the ``best preventive  
medicine'' for children and adults. Ailments like diarrhea, colds 
or infections are easily transmitted by hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could just teach children to wash their hands after they  
go to the bathroom or before they eat, it would do a world of 
good,'' said Ester Brannon, a registered nurse epidemiologist with 
the state Bureau for Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, changing behavior takes more than leading children to a  
sink and encouraging them to use soap, said Ray Alvarez. He has 
been promoting clean hands since 1997 as part of Fairmont General 
Hospital's outreach efforts. The hospital has created a Web site on 
the subject that includes a hand washing experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``What makes the experiment come alive for these kids is they  
see there is bacteria on their hands and it reinforces hand 
washing,'' Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, many children and adults do not know how to properly  
wash their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the friction of rubbing your hands together that is the  
most important,'' Brannon said. Rubbing soapy hands for at least 20 
seconds is necessary. Warm water is not required; any soap will do. 
</P>
<P>
	Janis McGinnis, coordinator for health services in Wood County,  
about 80 miles north of Charleston on the Ohio River, said students 
are taught to sing songs while washing to ensure they scrub for the 
correct length of time. ``Yankee Doodle'' is popular. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools also need to make adjustments when adopting hand washing  
promotions. 
</P>
<P>
	Alvarez said the biggest surprise was to find that bathroom  
faucets were relatively germ free, but drinking fountains weren't. 
Also, liquid soap dispensers have to be installed to prevent the 
spread of germs. And, paper towel use goes up. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood County school superintendent Dan Curry said hand washing  
requires extra effort, but the payoff is worth it. The county may 
adopt hand washing requirements under its proposed wellness program 
for faculty and staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you read the literature on hand washing, there's no doubt  
in my mind. It will improve student attendance and adult attendance 
as well,'' Curry said. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- White Sox first baseman Frank Thomas left  
Chicago's game with the Milwaukee Brewers in the first inning 
Sunday after suffering a bruised right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who reached base after being hit by Bill Pulsipher, was  
leading off third base when Brook Fordyce fouled off a pitch. The 
line shot hit Thomas on his foot, and he fell hard to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in the game and later was forced out at the plate, but  
Paul Konerko replaced him at first base to start the bottom of the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was taken to St. Michael Hospital for X-rays, which were  
negative. The team listed him as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is hitting .323 this season with 12 home runs, 25 doubles  
and 57 RBI. He has played in all 89 of Chicago's games, the only 
player to do so.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Face Lower Crop Prices / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOVER, Del. (AP) -- Maria and Ted Bobola grow sweet corn.  
</P>
<P>
	But with little corn to harvest because of a plant-withering  
drought, the Bobolas were forced to buy corn from Georgia to supply 
their produce and flower shop just outside Dover. 
</P>
<P>
	And most years, the strawberry picking season runs three to five  
weeks, but not this year, store manager Dee Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so hot and dry that even though we irrigated, we had  
only two weeks in the season,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	They did not recoup $70,000 they paid for strawberry plants last  
year in this year's harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a hard growing season.''  
</P>
<P>
	Similar stories are being told by farmers across the Delmarva  
peninsula this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought and record high temperatures in late June and early  
July in the mid-Atlantic region has lowered the yields of corn and 
soybean -- the two most important field crops in Delmarva. 
Meanwhile, farmers in the Midwest and the South are enjoying a 
bumper crop. The plentiful supply has lowered prices across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Anticipating low prices, many Delmarva farmers switched this  
year to fruits and vegetables such as watermelons, cantaloupes, 
tomatoes, potatoes, peas, beans. That also has turned out to be a 
bad move, farmers and agricultural officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	The unusually warm temperatures have sped the growing season in  
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York, so the Delmarva market is 
experiencing a glut. Translation: Rock-bottom prices for local 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to lose farmers to bankruptcy; there's no way  
else to say it,'' says Turp Garrett, the agricultural extension 
agent for Worcester County, Md. ``It's not very pretty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if bankruptcy doesn't do them in, many farmers will likely  
quit because the financial stress is simply too much, he said. This 
is the second year in a row that Delmarva farmers are experiencing 
a less-than-stellar growing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers most likely will not see lower prices in the grocery  
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not being passed on to the consumer by any means. The  
middleman always makes money in these situations,'' said Francis 
Breeding of the University of Maryland's Cooperative Extension 
Office in Queen Anne's County, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally, the growing season is staggered along the Eastern  
seaboard, which helps stabilize prices and supply, Breeding said. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, ideal weather in the South led to longer growing and  
harvesting seasons and unusually warm weather ushered in the season 
earlier up north, Breeding said. 
</P>
<P>
	Delmarva farmers are finding themselves squeezed.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the absolute worst year in history. There's absolute  
nothing ... that's making the economics work out,'' said Ray Wolf, 
who owns the 70-acre Cornerstone Farm in Hurlock, Md. ``At today's 
grain prices ... somebody's going to go hungry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How bad are the grain prices? Growers normally need about $2 per  
dozen ears of corn to break even, but this year they'd be lucky if 
they could they could get $1.10 per dozen from grocery stores, Wolf 
said. At his own stand, he was able to sell a dozen ears of corn 
for $3 in previous years, but is charging only $2 this season to 
stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	Fruits and vegetables are faring no better. A 20-pound  
watermelon usually fetches about $2 wholesale, but now the same 
fruit is going for about 60 cents, Breeding said.

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Breaks Breaststroke Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- South African swimmer Penny Heyns set a world  
record in the 100-meter breaststroke Sunday, one day after twice 
breaking the world record in the 200-meter event. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns broke the 100-meter mark with a swim of 1 minute, 6.99  
seconds in the preliminaries of the Janet Evans Invitational at 
USC. She edged the record of 1:07.02, which she set at the 1996 
Olympic finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns, who also holds the world record in the 50-meter  
breaststroke, had a split of 31.73 en route to her mark. 
</P>
<P>
	One day earlier, Heyns set the 100-meter record with a swim of 2  
minutes, 24.69 seconds in the preliminaries. In the finals, she 
lowered the new mark to 2:24.51. 
</P>
<P>
	She broke the record of 2:24.76 set by Australia's Rebecca Brown  
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns won Olympic gold medals in the 100-meter and 200-meter  
breaststroke in the 1996 Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Wells Congratulates David Cone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Minutes after David Cone pitched his perfect  
game, David Wells got his buddy on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got bigger goose bumps than you do,'' yelled Wells, who  
pitched the only other regular-season perfect game for the New York 
Yankees last season. ``I'm glad you did it. Welcome to the club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two chatted for a while before the Toronto Blue Jays pitcher  
handed the phone to another ex-Yankee, Graeme Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells then walked over to a refrigerator and yelled: ``Wow, I'm  
going to have a beer for Cone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Wells pitched his perfect game against Minnesota on May 17,  
1998, Cone sat next to Wells between innings, calming his teammate. 
The two also played together for part of the 1992 season with 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	As Cone was pitching his perfect game, Wells was throwing  
batting practice to his son in the Blue Jay's clubhouse. An 
attendant told him Cone had a perfect game through seven innings 
and Wells saw the final two innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a thing of beauty,'' Wells said. ``He's overcome a  
lot of obstacles in his career and for him to do it in New York, 
where he is well loved -- He is the man of New York City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone appreciated the call from Wells, who had been his closest  
friend on the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he wanted to fly down here and party with me all  
night,'' Cone said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells, however, had to stay in Toronto with his son.  
</P>
<P>
	After Wells pitched his perfect game, New York Mayor Rudy  
Giuliani gave him a key to the city. Wells said he expects Cone to 
get one, too, and that he can't wait to celebrate with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll crawl into every spot we want, if we get into trouble  
we'll unlock ourselves,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also expects to do commercials with Cone.  
</P>
<P>
	``Chicks dig perfect games!'' Wells said.

<HEADLINE> World Reacts to JFK Disappearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Even where they hardly knew the man, they were  
mystified by ``the curse,'' as people around the world heard the 
news of the disappearance of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest tragedy in the United States' most famous political  
clan dominated headlines Sunday and Monday in world papers, many of 
which ran the famed 1963 photo of ``John-John'' saluting the coffin 
of his slain father, President Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan on Monday, all the national newspapers ran items on the  
search, most accompanied by photos. Many papers also emphasized the 
family's tragic history. 
</P>
<P>
	The South China Morning Post in Hong Kong Monday ran the Kennedy  
story on top of the front page. The headline reading: ``US prays 
for Kennedy miracle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reactions in Asia as well as the rest of the world came  
before the Coast Guard announced late Sunday that they likely were 
dead. The Coast Guard said it was shifting from a search and rescue 
operation to one of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Inexplicable curse of the Kennedys,'' London's The Sunday  
Telegraph said in a headline for a story that ran over three pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tragedy without end: John F. Kennedy Jr. Crashes,'' ran the  
headline in the Sunday edition of Frankfurter Allgemeine. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr. was traveling with his wife, Carolyn  
Bessette Kennedy, and sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, to a family 
wedding when their plane disappeared over the ocean on its way to 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	In Ireland, the home of Kennedy ancestors, state TV and radio  
channel, RTE, sent its Washington correspondent to Massachusetts to 
cover what it described as a tragedy for ``the Irish-American 
political dynasty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance became the main lead item in most of  
Ireland's Sunday newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr. is not well known in all European countries, but most  
know the fabled Kennedy name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad how despite all the fame and riches, that one  
family can be followed by so much bad luck,'' said Giesela Braun, a 
resident of Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Firman, 49, a London nurse, said she was not nearly as  
affected by the loss of Kennedy as she was by the 1997 death of 
Princess Diana in a Paris car crash. ``Mostly because I didn't know 
him as well,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Israel, Kennedy's disappearance led all the radio and  
television reports and headlined most of Sunday's daily newspapers, 
which included pictures of the family and ``family trees'' of 
Kennedys who died young. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel's Channel 2 TV station interviewed a former schoolmate of  
Kennedy when he was at private school in New York in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	``He insisted on being an ordinary kid. Every day we took the  
bus from 5th Avenue to the West Side and he insisted on taking the 
bus with us,'' said Daniel Diker. ``He was a nice guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pope John Paul II, vacationing in the Italian Alps, said he was  
praying for the whole Kennedy clan. ``This is only the latest 
tragedy that family has suffered,'' said spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro-Valls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kennedy curse strikes again'', said the Sunday Times of  
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Kennedy family again meets the vicious curse,'' opined  
Hong Kong's Chinese-language daily Oriental Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's acting prime minister, Tim Fischer, sent a message  
of sympathy to the Kennedy family. 
</P>
<P>
	Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also expressed his ``sorrow for  
the loss of John Kennedy Jr.'' He went on to castigate U.S. 
authorities for failing so far to locate the lost plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's disappearance was the main story on the front page of  
most major Mexican newspapers. The tabloid La Cronica carried 
photos of Kennedy with his mother and father, and a front-page 
chronology of other tragedies to hit the family. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cambodians were mourning one of their own national icons,  
actress Piseth Peaklica, gunned down July 6. More than 10,000 
people packed her funeral Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politicians might hear about the crash, but I doubt regular  
Cambodians are interested because it is too far from them to 
care,'' said Kong Korm, a senator.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-GAUDENS, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong remained in command  
of the Tour de France on Sunday, with Russia's Dimitri Konyshev 
winning the 14th stage as riders reached the foothills of the 
Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong finished in 60th place but retained the yellow jersey  
he has worn the past week, leading by 7 minutes, 44 second. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan has made a remarkable recovery from testicular cancer  
and is the overwhelming favorite to win cycling's most famous race. 
Riding for U.S. Postal Service, Armstrong won the Tour's prologue 
July 3, a time trial and a grueling mountain stage in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	He originally was listed at 61st Sunday but moved up a spot  
after the race jury annulled Robbie McEwen's ninth-place finish. 
The Australian was cited for faults during a sprint and was put in 
last place. 
</P>
<P>
	Konyshev, riding for Mercatone, was followed by two Italians --  
Gianni Faresin of the Mapei team and Massimilliano Lelli of 
Cofidis. The three were among a group of six that broke away early 
and was not caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew this was my last chance for a victory since from now on  
it's climbing, and then sprints,'' Konyshev said. ``It's very 
satisfying since last year I had some physical problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His best previous finish in this year's race was second place in  
the 11th stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Konyshev has lived in Italy the last 10 years. He is married to  
an Italian, and they have with a 1-year-old son. He said he is 
almost certain he will stay in Italy permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	The race followed the pattern of the previous three days, with  
the overall leaders some 15 minutes behind, economizing their 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The results had no impact on the top of the overall standings  
since none of the top three stage winners was among the top 30 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The 124-mile stage between Castres and Saint-Gaudens marked the  
final day of relatively flat racing before next week's potentially 
decisive climbs in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage began in hot, muggy weather but showers midway through  
brought some relief. 
</P>
<P>
	With Italians finishing second and third, this was another  
excellent day for Italy. On Saturday, Italians took the top three 
positions, with Salvatore Commesso winning the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday is the second rest day of the race. The Tour de France  
ends July 25 in Paris on the famed Champs-Elysees.

<P>
	SAINT-GAUDENS, France (AP) -- Awaiting the arduous mountain  
climbs of the Pyrenees, Lance Armstrong again conserved strength 
Sunday and remained in command of the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when Russia's Dimitri Konyshev captured the 14th stage  
of cycling's most famous race, Armstrong stuck to a strategy that 
has served him well. 
</P>
<P>
	For four straight days, the 27-year-old Texan has sat back,  
keeping a close eye on his main rivals while lesser names have 
broken away to win the stages. 
</P>
<P>
	The riders chasing Armstrong have adopted the same tactics, with  
the same aim: saving energy leading to potentially decisive stages 
high Tuesday and Wednesday in the Pyrenees on the French-Spanish 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mountains, the leaders will have to attack Armstrong, or  
hope he cracks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need Armstrong to have a bad day, and that's not out of the  
question on the Tour,'' Spain's Abraham Olano, in second place, 
said before Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making a triumphant recovery from testicular cancer,  
is riding for U.S. Postal Service and leads by 7 minutes, 44 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The morale of the Americans is high,'' Olano said. ``They work  
very well together by controlling the breakaways. Armstrong's 
surrounded by his teammates, and, moreover, is showing no signs of 
weakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday's race followed the same pattern as the previous three  
days, with an early breakaway by a handful of riders who barely 
figure in the top 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Konyshev, who rides for Mercatone, was followed by two Italians  
-- Gianni Faresin of the Mapei team and Massimilliano Lelli of 
Cofidis. 
</P>
<P>
	The results did not affect the top overall standings. Armstrong  
finished 60th and Olano was 27th. But since a large pack crossed 
the line in formation, the riders finished with the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 124-mile stage between Castres and Saint-Gaudens was the  
final day of relatively flat racing before the Pyrenees. Monday is 
a rest day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew this was my last chance for a victory since from now on  
it's climbing, and then sprints,'' Konyshev said. ``It's very 
satisfying since last year I had some physical problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His best previous finish in this year's race was second place in  
the 11th stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Konyshev has lived in Italy the last 10 years. He is married to  
an Italian, and they have with a 1-year-old son. He said he is 
almost certain he will stay in Italy permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage began in hot, muggy weather but showers midway through  
brought some relief. 
</P>
<P>
	With Italians finishing second and third, this was another  
excellent day for Italy. On Saturday, Italians took the top three 
positions, with Salvatore Commesso winning the stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday is the second rest day of the race. Riders are to train  
briefly to maintain their rhythm, relax with massages and plot 
strategies for the hills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tour de France ends July 25 in Paris on the famed  
Champs-Elysees.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pushes Election Money Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, a leading proponent of  
campaign finance legislation, said Sunday he intends to use 
``whatever parliamentary avenue that's open'' to force the Senate 
GOP leadership to allow a debate on the issue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, R-Ariz., said he recently urged Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott to agree to an ``orderly'' debate, rather than try to 
prevent it from coming to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., has yet to respond, said McCain, who is pursuing  
the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a television interview, Lott sounded less than willing to  
accommodate his fellow Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to try to encourage him to find some other way to do  
it or wait until the end of the year,'' he said on ``Fox News 
Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, McCain indicated that short of an  
agreement with Lott, he would force the Senate to debate the issue 
by trying to attach it to unrelated legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign finance measure by McCain and Sen. Russell  
Feingold, D-Wis., would ban so-called soft money, the large 
donations that political parties and candidates solicit to finance 
their campaign activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill also would curtail late campaign issue ads, which are  
commercials which customarily attack a candidate without a 
specifically calling for his defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of soft money contributions say they have a corrupting  
influence. But critics of the legislation say curtailing such 
donations would violate the First Amendment's guarantee of free 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, though, Republicans fear that banning soft money  
would amount to political disarmament because labor unions could 
continue spending money on behalf of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we could do something about the fact that unions take union  
members money without their permission. If we could do it in a 
level way, that would be something we could consider,'' Lott said. 
``But the McCain-Feingold bill is not the solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation has failed before in the Senate, and barring a  
breakthrough, the prospect is for gridlock when the issue comes up. 
McCain is one of a handful of Republicans who favors the measure, 
which also has the backing of most if not all of the Senate's 
Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, McCain is unlikely to gain the 60 votes needed to force a  
final vote on his bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates of a similar measure in the House have been trying to  
force a reluctant GOP leadership to bring the issue to the floor 
this summer. Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has pledged a debate 
for September, and advocates of a faster timetable have not been 
able to muster the support votes they need to prevail.

	Still No Signs of JFK Jr.  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- With the Kennedys awaiting word for a  
second anguished day, a brigade of searchers is scouring the sea 
off Martha's Vineyard today for any sign of John F. Kennedy Jr., 
his wife and her sister. Their plane was reported missing off the 
resort island early yesterday. By midday, today's search had 
yielded pieces of foam insulation spread over about a mile of 
shoreline and part of an airplane headrest, a Coast Guard official 
said. Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Gary Jones said statistics suggest 
a person has slim chances of surviving in 68-degree waters for more 
than 36 hours. But he added that each case is unique, and that 
recoveries have been made in worse conditions.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton assured Chinese President  
Jiang Zemin in a telephone call today that the United States is 
committed to its ``one China'' policy despite Taiwan's moves toward 
independence. Clinton spoke with Jiang for a half-hour from the 
presidential retreat at Camp David in Maryland, said White House 
spokesman David Leavy. He said Clinton reiterated U.S. policy with 
regard to China and Taiwan. ``He hoped both sides could maintain a 
dialogue, and the cross-straits issues could be resolved 
peacefully,'' Leavy said. China has promised to crush any attempt 
by Taiwan to break away.

	Experts Destroy Iraqi Chemicals

<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- International experts began the process of  
destroying poisonous chemicals in a U.N. laboratory today after 
four days of negotiations with the Iraqi government. The team of 
five experts finally yielded to an Iraqi demand that the 
destruction be witnessed by French, Russian and Chinese diplomats 
and the U.N. envoy in Baghdad, Prakash Shah. The chemicals and 
samples of biological warfare were left in the laboratory in 
Baghdad last year when U.N. weapons inspectors evacuated Iraq on 
the eve of U.S. and British airstrikes against the country.

<HEADLINE>  Armstrong Maintain Cycling Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAINT-GAUDENS, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong remained in command  
of the Tour de France on Sunday, with Russia's Dimitri Konyshev 
winning the 14th stage as riders reached the foothills of the 
Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong finished in 60th place but retained the yellow jersey  
he has worn the past week, leading by 7 minutes, 44 second. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan has made a remarkable recovery from testicular cancer  
and is the overwhelming favorite to win cycling's most famous race. 
Riding for U.S. Postal Service, Armstrong won the Tour's prologue 
July 3, a time trial and a grueling mountain stage in the Alps. 
</P>
<P>
	He originally was listed at 61st Sunday but moved up a spot  
after the race jury annulled Robbie McEwen's ninth-place finish. 
The Australian was cited for faults during a sprint and was put in 
last place. 
</P>
<P>
	Konyshev, riding for Mercatone, was followed by two Italians --  
Gianni Faresin of the Mapei team and Massimilliano Lelli of 
Cofidis. The three were among a group of six that broke away early 
and was not caught. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew this was my last chance for a victory since from now on  
it's climbing, and then sprints,'' Konyshev said. ``It's very 
satisfying since last year I had some physical problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His best previous finish in this year's race was second place in  
the 11th stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Konyshev has lived in Italy the last 10 years. He is married to  
an Italian, and they have with a 1-year-old son. He said he is 
almost certain he will stay in Italy permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	The race followed the pattern of the previous three days, with  
the overall leaders some 15 minutes behind, economizing their 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
	The results had no impact on the top of the overall standings  
since none of the top three stage winners was among the top 30 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The 124-mile stage between Castres and Saint-Gaudens marked the  
final day of relatively flat racing before next week's potentially 
decisive climbs in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage began in hot, muggy weather but showers midway through  
brought some relief.

<P>
	SAINT-GAUDENS, France (AP) -- Awaiting the arduous mountain  
climbs of the Pyrenees, Lance Armstrong again conserved strength 
Sunday and remained in command of the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when Russia's Dimitri Konyshev captured the 14th stage  
of cycling's most famous race, Armstrong stuck to a strategy that 
has served him well. 
</P>
<P>
	For four straight days, the 27-year-old Texan has sat back,

<HEADLINE> Cone Wanted Solitude at Perfect Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone just wanted to be alone. He walked  
off the mound and straight to the clubhouse after each inning. 
</P>
<P>
	No high-fives, no pep talks, no pats on his back.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, perfection is nothing to be trifled with.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I talked to David today, was before the game  
when we went over the hitters,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``We 
talked about the pitch selection and I didn't say another word the 
rest of the day. Nobody was brave enough to joke with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone stayed away from his teammates for the first two outs of  
each inning, every time changing his T-shirt that was soaked with 
sweat because of the near 100-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre found Cone in his clubhouse office  
after the sixth inning. Neither had much to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We walked past each other,'' Torre said. ``I just told him he  
could use my office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the pair met for the next three innings, under the exact  
same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every inning after that, I made a point of doing it again,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cone was on the bench just before retaking the mound each  
inning, his teammates completely ignored him, in keeping with 
baseball superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of them had been through this when David Wells pitched his  
perfect game last season for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been spoiled by a couple perfect games, and I think that  
helped the mood,'' Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder and designated hitter Chili Davis was the only one  
who tried to lighten things up. 
</P>
<P>
	He was catching Cone during warmups in the eighth inning and  
told Cone to throw the ball faster. 
</P>
<P>
	`''You can throw the ball as hard as you want. I caught in the  
minors,''' Davis told Cone. ``Even something like that, which 
wasn't very funny, broke the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After completing the perfect game and being mobbed by his  
teammates, Cone eventually found himself back at his hideout in 
Torre's office, where he got a congratulatory call from Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who saved the no-hitter  
with a backhanded grab in the eighth inning, enjoyed Cone's 
perfection more than Wells'. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was more exciting for me,'' Knoblauch said. ``The guy is  
the ultimate teammate and for him to be able to pull this off was 
amazing. Equally amazing was the fact that this happened on Yogi 
Berra Day and we actually had Don Larsen here.''

<HEADLINE> 8 Hurt in Roller Coaster Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A roller coaster jumped the tracks at  
the Worlds of Fun amusement park, leaving some of its riders 
dangling at a 90-degree angle until firefighters could free them. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cars carrying four passengers dangled at a 90-degree angle  
about 20 to 30 feet above the ground after the accident, which 
happened about 10 p.m. Saturday night. Crews used chains to secure 
the cars to the track before helping the riders down ladders, a 
fire department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	It took crews from the Kansas City Fire Department about an hour  
to extricate all 18 riders from the Orient Express roller coaster, 
department spokesman Brad Humston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ambulance crews treated some of the injured at the scene, but  
none of the injuries was considered life-threatening. The park 
remained open. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people taken to North Kansas City Hospital were in good and  
fair condition, a nursing supervisor said. Conditions of the others 
being taken to hospitals were not known, Humston said.

<HEADLINE> Plan Proposed To Reduce Blackouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spurred by the recent power blackout in the  
Northeast, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is proposing a six-part 
plan to better ensure Americans will not lose their electricity 
during severe weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is getting worse and in this era of potential  
deregulation in electricity, it is important to protect the 
consumer,'' Richardson said in a telephone interview Sunday from 
Phoenix with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to avert future power crisis, Richardson wants to:  
</P>
<P>
	--Convene a Northeast regional power summit.  
</P>
<P>
	--Investigate power outages.  
</P>
<P>
	--Speed new federal standards for more efficient air  
conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
	--Study the nation's electricity capacity and the ability to meet  
future needs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Cut federal consumption during emergencies.  
</P>
<P>
	--Develop new generation and transmission technologies.  
</P>
<P>
	Richardson intends to outline the strategy in a speech Monday in  
San Francisco to the National Association of Regulatory Utility 
Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government, the nation's biggest consumer of  
electricity, does not have a general plan for reducing consumption 
during power shortages, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson also is promoting the increased use of alternative  
and renewable energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is that some systems are being stretched to the  
limit,'' he says in remarks prepared for delivery Monday. ``Demand 
for electricity continues to grow, while the amount of generating 
and transmission capacity remains stagnant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A heat wave on July 6 resulted in a 19-hour blackout in parts of  
New York City and scattered power losses throughout the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson noted that last year hot weather and capacity  
shortages produced a ``near panic'' in the wholesale market in the 
Midwest, sending power prices to record levels, and that California 
recently experienced record peak demand. 
</P>
<P>
	One pressing problem, he said, is that Washington has not come  
up with legislation to provide federal coordination for the 
deregulation of the electric power industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-four states already have adopted electric restructuring  
programs that provide for more competition and consumer choice. But 
other states have put off decisions about new generation and 
transmission resources because of uncertainty about the future of 
federal rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration in April sent Congress a bill aimed at  
removing federal impediments to competition while protecting 
consumer interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Several key members of Congress, including House Commerce  
Committee chairman Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., and Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee Chairman Sen. Frank Murkowski, 
R-Alaska, are working on deregulation legislation.

	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Always a contender this year, Cat Thief  
finally won a race. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief hooked up with General Challenge in a stretch duel and  
won by a head Sunday in the $500,000 Swaps Stakes for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Cat Thief's first victory since October. He had placed in  
five graded events this year, including seconds in the Fountain of 
Youth and Blue Grass Stakes and thirds in the Kentucky and Florida 
derbies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Pat Day, Cat Thief covered 1 1-8 miles in 1:47.87 and  
paid $7.60 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, 11th in the Kentucky Derby, returned $2.10  
under David Flores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were sitting right where we wanted, it was perfect,''  
Flores said. ``I thought I was going to go by Cat Thief at the 
quarter-pole, but the winner just kept on fighting and just never 
quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walk That Walk and Corey Nakatani were another 11 lengths back  
in third. Desert Hero, 13th in the Kentucky Derby, was fourth under 
first-time rider Jerry Bailey. There was no show wagering on the 
four-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Day sensed something in Cat Thief that the horse hadn't shown  
him in the Fountain of Youth and Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made an excuse for him in the Fountain of Youth because I  
thought maybe he needed the race and had a license to get a little 
tired,'' Day said. ``But in the Florida Derby, when push came to 
shove, he didn't get it done and I felt like there was a little 
more there and he just wasn't giving it to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, he was tenacious. I don't think if we'd have gone  
around two more times the other horse was going to get by us,'' Day 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, who shipped to California from Kentucky in late June,  
prevailed in General Challenge's neighborhood. General Challenge 
came into the race undefeated in five California starts, including 
a 2-for-2 record at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would've thought Cat Thief was going to run like that?''  
said Bob Baffert, trainer of General Challenge, who carried high 
weight of 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer D. Wayne Lukas set a record with his fourth Swaps  
victory. His others were Victory Speech in 1996, Thunder Gulch in 
1995 and Clear Choice in 1986. He had been tied with Gary Jones at 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a horse race. Pat Day rode him to perfection,'' Lukas  
said by phone from Keeneland, where he's attending the yearling 
sale. ``He was hooked every step of the way by a very good horse 
and still had something left to hold off a very good horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, who carried 120 pounds, sprinted to the early lead  
and eventually settled along the rail to set up the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had a real good chance going in,'' Lukas said.  
``General Challenge hadn't been able to beat him before. It was a 
very credible performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge stalked the pace early, put a head in front of  
Cat Thief in midstretch and then continued pressing to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those races where the fans got their money's worth  
and I didn't get mine,'' Baffert said. ``We just got flat outrun. 
We had every chance to get by and we couldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $300,000, increased Cat Thief's career  
earnings to $1.1 million, with three wins in 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Flores later found the winner's circle in the $300,000 Sunset  
Handicap, scoring an upset with Irish-bred Plicck. The winner paid 
$39.60, $14.60 and $6.60 and covered 1 1/2 miles on the turf in 
2:26.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion River Bay was second and paid $4.60 and  
$3.60, while Argentine-bred Lazy Lode was third and returned $4.20 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile Championship, Dixie Union and  
Alex Solis won by 1 1/4 lengths over Exchange Rate in 1:09.95 for six 
furlongs. The winner paid $3.40, $2.20 and $2.10 and is owned by 
Herman Sarkowsky, former co-owner of the Seattle Seahawks and 
Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Love That Red won the $100,000 Answer Do Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths  
over Men's Exclusive. The winner covered 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:15.06 and 
paid $4.80, $2.60 and $2.10.

<HEADLINE> Mafia Turncoat Has New Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Salvatore ``Sammy the Bull'' Gravano, the famed  
New York mob underboss-turned-informer, is making a new life in 
Arizona with no fears that his former Mafia compatriots will come 
seeking revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving the federal witness protection program, Gravano's  
secret life and identity slowly unraveled, partly because Gravano 
is sometimes indiscreet. He has a business, a publicist and a 
lawyer. He tells some people his real name. 
</P>
<P>
	But the confessed killer of 19 doesn't think he's in any real  
danger, The Arizona Republic reported Sunday. In a rare interview, 
Gravano said he feels safe because he's become pals with FBI agents 
and U.S. marshals, who visit and talk by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, the Mafia has been so thoroughly infiltrated the feds  
would know who ordered a hit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not running from the (expletive) Mafia,'' Gravano told the  
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	He lives alone in a modest bungalow with his little dog and a  
punching bag, sharing coffee with neighbors. But most of his 
neighbors don't know this stocky, middle-aged guy once was a 
notorious racketeer whose business interests included robbery, 
loan-sharking, extortion and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Gravano saved himself from a likely life prison sentence by  
turning on his former boss, Gambino family boss John Gotti. His 
often-graphic testimony helped jail 36 mobsters, including Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Gravano, 54, came to Arizona as a federal prison inmate. Upon  
his release in 1995, he was given a new identity and background, 
and he got some plastic surgery on his face. But he left the 
witness protection program after nine months, calling it too 
restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to the construction business, and settled in -- until  
two weeks ago when the newspaper contacted him. To get Gravano to 
talk, the newspaper agreed not to reveal his new name or company. 
</P>
<P>
	Gravano said he wasn't going to run from Arizona, no matter  
what. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a boxer. I know what it's like to get hit. I know what  
it is to fight. And you lose your fear,'' he said. ``I could go to 
Montana and live 20 years in a cabin and be scared to death. Or I 
can live here, where I'm happy, five years. I choose to live 
here.''

<HEADLINE> Panel Says IOC Should Be More Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee  
should be more open and make its financial reports easier to 
understand, a reform panel suggested Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In weekend meetings, the 19-member working group looked at way  
of improving the operations of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	``After two days of meetings, we realized it is important to  
refine, but also reaffirm, the many contributions of the IOC,'' 
said Thomas Bach of Germany, chairman of the working group. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the group proposed the IOC should ``engage in more  
active and transparent communications to explain its work in 
between and leading up to the celebration of the Olympic Games, '' 
an IOC statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Among the suggestions were refining the IOC's educational  
programs, improving the clarity of its financial reports and 
opening the IOC Sessions to the media, as was done for the 109th 
session last month in Seoul,'' it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Members will meet again Aug. 30-31 to finalize its  
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Working Group on the Role of the IOC is part of the  
80-member IOC 2000 Commission, set up following the Salt Lake City 
scandal to overhaul the organization and prevent future 
vote-buying. Six members were expelled and four resigned in the 
Olympic movement's worst ever corruption scandal.

<HEADLINE> Mantegna To Play Chef-Private Eye </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Joe Mantegna: For Hire?  
</P>
<P>
	Mantegna plays good-cooking private investigator Spenser, the  
hero of Robert Parker's detective novels, in a new TV movie, 
``Small Vices,'' an A&AMP;E adaptation of the Parker novel of the same 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, doing Parker is very similar to doing Mamet,''  
Mantegna, 51, said. ``Parker's dialogue is a major ingredient of 
his writing. He's a dialectician.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Small Vices,'' Spenser and his menacing partner Hawk  
attempt to clear a black prison inmate wrongly convicted of killing 
a white female college student. 
</P>
<P>
	The dialogue is more raw and racially charged than the banter in  
``Spenser: For Hire,'' the mid-80s TV series starring Robert Urich 
and Avery Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The banter about race -- it all comes from the novels,''  
Mantegna said. ``It's Parker's way of saying, 'You know what, among 
intelligent people, you can take things (political correctness) too 
far.''

<HEADLINE> Authorities Say Kennedy Likely Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- After two days of searching and holding  
out hope of survivors, authorities conceded late Sunday that John 
F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister likely were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to shift, and I say shift very purposely, from  
our focus on search and rescue to search and recovery,'' said Coast 
Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the search for Kennedy's missing plane on Sunday  
produced no major finds but authorities were focusing on ``a couple 
of targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are simply potential targets and don't necessarily  
represent an aircraft or part of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, not unexpected, put an official signature on  
the death of JFK Jr., who had been famous since the indelible 
salute he gave at his father's funeral on his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy was piloting a single engine plane  
carrying his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her older 
sister Lauren Bessette when it went down in the waters off Martha's 
Vineyard on Friday night en route to his cousin Rory's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	The quintessential media figure, Kennedy's celebrity was due  
largely because of his famous and beloved parents. He was shadowed 
always, in college at Brown, on dates with Daryl Hannah, at law 
school, and in his courtship and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have failed the bar twice, but he was a Kennedy, not one  
of much known political ambition, but a prince who was once crowned 
by People magazine ``the sexiest man alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers looking for Kennedy's plane had zeroed in earlier in  
the day on a spot at the bottom of the sea after picking up an 
automatic emergency signal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Larrabee said the signal had been discounted and could have  
come from a data marker dropped by the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A sonar-equipped ship was sent to the spot off Martha's Vineyard  
where debris from the plane was found earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said on Monday divers would begin searching possible  
targets in water 60 to 80 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy family spent a second anguished day awaiting word  
along with the rest of the nation, as federal authorities set up a 
top-level command center to oversee the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee said searchers heard an underwater signal Sunday from  
what searchers initially believed was an emergency locator 
transmitter near where debris from the plane was found. Hours 
later, Larrabee said the report appeared to be based on ``erroneous 
data'' and that the signal could have come from one of the Coast 
Guard's own devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of the son of the 35th president brought forth  
the kind of emotion stirred two years ago by the death of Princess 
Diana, with the TV networks devoting all-day coverage and 
newspapers rolling out extras on the movie-star handsome lawyer and 
magazine publisher whose life had been untarnished by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners left flowers at the Brookline, Mass., birthplace of his  
father, at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston and on 
the steps of John and Carolyn Kennedy's apartment building in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday happened to be the 30th anniversary of another family  
trial -- Chappaquiddick, in which Sen. Edward Kennedy's car went off 
a bridge on an island next to Martha's Vineyard, killing passenger 
Mary Jo Kopechne and ending any hope Kennedy had of becoming 
president.

<HEADLINE> Thirteen Hurt at Amusement Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A roller coaster derailment that left  
cars dangling from the amusement park ride injured 13 people and 
led to a daring rescue effort by firefighters to bring stranded 
passengers safely back to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Orient Express riders spent 2 1/2 hours Saturday night strapped  
into a car hanging about 40 feet overhead before rescuers could get 
them down. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a pretty hairy rescue,'' Kansas City fire spokesman  
Brad Humston said. ``There were some brave firefighters. The first 
few firefighters attempting the rescue didn't know how secure that 
car was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In dramatic fashion, the stranded girls bearhugged firefighters  
as they were lowered from their precarious spot. The other riders 
were rescued from less dangerous positions. None of the injured 
were seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident at Worlds of Fun, an amusement park where a girl  
died in 1995 after falling from a different roller coaster, was 
being investigated as a mechanical failure. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 22 people on the seven-car train, and four of the  
riders were trapped in dangling cars. Crews secured the cars to the 
track with chains before helping the riders down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were right underneath the ride when we heard a really loud  
noise, then we heard people screaming for help and we saw them 
hanging off the side,'' said Debbie Ruth, 18, of Eudora, Kan.

	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire was out of the St. Louis  
Cardinals' lineup Sunday, a day after he had to leave with back 
spasms after the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	A team spokesman said McGwire, who has missed only four starts,  
was day-to-day. McGwire struck out to end the first inning of 
Saturday night's game, then was replaced at first base by Shawon 
Dunston. Eli Marrero started at first on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had two homers, his 30th and 31st, and had six RBIs on  
Friday night. He was batting .268 with 79 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> America Awaits Word on Kennedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Once again, America was waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, rescuers and investigators looked for a sign -- any  
sign -- of John F. Kennedy Jr.: A fragment of his missing plane. A 
beep from the aircraft's emergency beacon. A piece of luggage 
floating on the light chop of the waters off Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	But the answers didn't come right away. And as the search for  
JFK Jr., his wife and her sister stretched through Saturday, then 
Sunday, the anguish of Americans around the country deepened. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, almost exactly 48 hours since the moment his aircraft  
vanished off radar screens at 9:40 p.m. Friday, a Coast Guard rear 
admiral in starched white uniform confirmed the worst fears of 
Americans: that the son of the fallen president likely was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This incident brings back vivid memories of the wait that we  
were involved in after Bobby was shot that night in Los Angeles,'' 
said Rep. Johnny Ford, D-Alabama, one of Robert F. Kennedy's 
political strategists who witnessed his assassination during the 
1968 presidential campaign.. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most difficult thing for all of us was the wait. That's  
what we're going through again ... The Kennedy Wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It has, for America, become an agonizingly familiar ritual: On  
Nov. 22, 1963, the nation could only watch and wait as President 
John F. Kennedy slipped away after being shot in Dallas. Then, five 
years later, it did the same as the former president's brother died 
from bullet wounds in California. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, across the United States, it was happening again --  
Americans waiting for bitter news about a Kennedy. This time, it 
was about the man who, as America's first son, a three-year-old in 
blue coat and shorts, poignantly saluted his father's casket in 
1963. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all watched him grow up through the TV and when something  
like this happens, it happens to all of us,'' said Frank Lopez, a 
furniture truck driver who came from the New York borough of Queens 
with his mother, Lucy, to leave an American flag and flowers at the 
door to Kennedy's Manhattan apartment block. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedys, he added, ``are part of America, and they show  
Americans what they could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early Sunday, people prayed for Kennedy and his family at Our  
Lady of Victory Church in Hyannis Port, Mass., where the Kennedys 
sometimes worship while staying at their nearby compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Noreen Sacca, on her way home from the beach, stopped at the  
John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston. She found bouquets of 
flowers left on the museum grounds. ``I've been to church twice to 
pray for them all,'' she said.

	More bouquets of red carnations and a votive candle were left on  
the front lawn of the home in Brookline, Mass., where President 
Kennedy was born. A National Park Service ranger repeated words 
written in 1970 for the autobiography of the family's matriarch, 
Rose Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``She says that her children were blessed with many gifts --  
beauty, intelligence, the ability to inspire respect, and make 
friends, but God held one gift back, and that's their length of 
years,'' David F. Kratz said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Kennedy burial plot at Arlington National Cemetery,  
several hundred people endured a heat wave to honor father and son. 
Laurie Krahn, a tourist from Michigan, said Kennedy's disappearance 
was ``very sobering. ... I'm just terribly saddened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When workers arrived Sunday morning at the Dallas museum in the  
building from which President Kennedy was shot, they found a small 
flower arrangement wedged in the doorway. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff West, director of the Sixth Floor Museum in the former  
Texas School Book Depository, looked out a window and saw a woman 
stop her car and lay flowers at the site of the historic marker in 
Dealey Plaza. Another woman walked up with her husband, paused and 
laid cut gladiolas at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's heartbreaking. It gets to you,'' West said.  
</P>
<P>
	Only 50 people live on Cumberland Island, the coastal barrier  
island off Georgia where JFK Jr. wed Carolyn Bessette in 1996, by 
the light of a flashlight inside a small, wood-framed church built 
by the descendents of slaves. 
</P>
<P>
	But the helplessness, sorrow and sense of loss were no less  
felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``For those of us who shared John and Caroline's friendship and  
wedding, we'd like to express our grief and deep sadness,'' said 
Zachary Zoul, manager of the 17-room Greyfield Inn where Kennedy 
reception was held. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will remain in the hearts of all of us on Cumberland  
Island forever.''

<HEADLINE> Commercial Use of Morse Code Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- What God hath wrought, new technology has put  
out of business. Morse code, the old language of dots and dashes, 
has been consumed by the age of bytes. 
</P>
<P>
	Months after the code was abandoned under international  
convention for ships in distress, the only private U.S. network of 
coastal radio stations using Morse has turned off the transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, mariners and Morse practitioners say, a long  
antiquated but eminently reliable form of communication has ended 
in U.S. commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	A final ceremonial message was tapped out last week to  
Washington, where the first such message originated 155 years ago. 
On May 24, 1844, Samuel Morse's question, ``What hath God 
wrought?'' pulsed along 35 miles of steel wire to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple but slow, the telegraph was overtaken generations ago by  
the telephone, by data systems capable of reproducing printed words 
at the receiving end, and by satellite for most forms of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
	But until the newest generation of satellite and computer  
technology took hold, Morse code endured for seafarers, chilling 
all who heard the distress signal put into effect after the sinking 
of the Titanic -- three dots, three dashes and three dots meaning 
SOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Now e-mail is within easy reach for many mariners and modern  
ships have global positioning systems allowing rescuers to zero in 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morse code has finally met its match,'' says Tim Gorman,  
operations director for Globe Wireless, the company that dropped 
the curtain on commercial radiotelegraphy by ceasing transmissions 
at its four stations in Half Moon Bay, Calif., and Slidell, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the World War II-era Liberty ship Jeremiah O'Brien,  
docked in San Francisco harbor, transmitted a Morse farewell to 
President Clinton. ``History is made on this day as we embark on a 
new era of communication,'' it began. 
</P>
<P>
	The message was translated back into English and sent to the  
White House the modern way, via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	It was acknowledged with an automated e-mail response from the  
White House, no hands on deck. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Maritime Organization officially phased out  
Morse code Feb. 1 for ships in peril, replacing it with the 
high-tech Global Maritime Distress and Safety System. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Coast Guard ceased Morse operations several years ago  
and no longer monitors radio frequencies used for the code, 
spokesman Ed Brady said. But it will respond if it happens to hear 
that infamous, now archaic, SOS. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no government facility listening,'' he said. And now  
with the loss of the radio stations, there is ``nobody privately 
listening,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morse experts say the stations, KFS, KPH, WCC and WNU, were the  
last commercial radiotelegraph operations in North America. They 
continue to beam shipping information, news and weather to ships at 
sea as part of the larger Globe Wireless network using satellites 
and high-frequency radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology now considered a tortoise was an astonishing hare  
in its time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Information will be literally winged with the rapidity of  
lightning,'' the Baltimore weekly Niles National Register reported 
after Samuel Morse made his historic transmission. Space and time 
were ``annihilated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The invention eventually ended the age of news dissemination by  
pony express, steamer and courier pigeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press, formed four years after Morse's  
demonstration, rose on the strength of the expanding telegraph as 
information that once took days or weeks to go from city to city 
sped to its destination in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports from the Civil War, greetings between distant relatives,  
dispatches on market prices in far-off places -- all could be sent 
in the time it took to reach the telegraph office. At first it 
consisted of clicks; later, tones. An international Morse code was 
developed that was more suitable for foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
	With the advent of radio, the electronic Morse signals sent by  
cable also could be transmitted over the airwaves. One hundred 
years ago, a radio message set off the first known Morse-inspired 
rescue at sea when a lightship saw the steamer Elbe run aground off 
Dover, England. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiotelegraphy penetrated the wildest tempests.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen and heard reports that when a ship gets into a  
bad storm and gets into trouble, the first thing to go is satellite 
communications,'' said Kevin Layton of the Canadian Coast Guard in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia, which monitors busy North Atlantic sea lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morse code was right there 'til the ship flipped under the  
water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morse continues to be used in poorer parts of the world and is  
popular with ham radio enthusiasts. U.S. naval ships seeking silent 
communication still use the code with flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Another vestige remains, although those who practice it are  
surely oblivious. 
</P>
<P>
	The rhythmic beat by fans in sports arenas -- dum-dum,  
dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum-dum, dum-dum -- is Morse code for the 
numbers 7 and 3. By telegraphers' shorthand, 73 means best wishes.

<HEADLINE>  David Cone Defines 1990s Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He's glib, he's hip and now he's perfect.  
</P>
<P>
	He's a medical marvel, and at 36, the oldest pitcher to throw a  
perfect game since Cy Young in 1904. 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone may be the defining face of this decade's New York  
Yankees, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the type of guy everyone says, ``When is his arm going to  
fall off?' '' Derek Jeter said following Cone's perfect game Sunday 
against Montreal. ``They keep doubting him, but he keeps proving 
them wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Brian Cone overcame an aneurysm in his pitching arm and a  
bone spur in his shoulder to be part of two World Series champions 
and to pitch in two more All-Star games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City, Mo., native has been a New Yorker for some time  
now, living in the hustle and bustle of midtown Manhattan, unlike 
most of his teammates, who prefer the quiet of the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	A month ago, a taxi hit his car while he was driving to the  
ballpark; he still made batting practice on time. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing seems to faze him. Whenever there's a stressful moment,  
he's the player teammates turn to for guidance and stability. He's 
a union leader, mentioned as a possible successor to Donald Fehr, 
and a clubhouse leader, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely the guy on the team we all look to,'' Chili  
Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the right-hander became a 20-game winner for the  
first time in a decade, the longest gap in baseball history between 
20-win seasons, and now he's 10-4 in 18 starts with a 2.65 ERA, 
second in the American League. A five-time All-Star and 1994 AL Cy 
Young Award winner, Cone is 178-97 in his career with a 3.14 ERA 
and three Series title. 
</P>
<P>
	Still probably short of Hall of Fame numbers, but his worth goes  
beyond stats. It's his grit. 
</P>
<P>
	``He leaves his heart on the mound every time he goes out  
there,'' Chuck Knoblauch said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on off day, Cone manages to win or at least keep it close.  
</P>
<P>
	``Think about what he's been through, with the surgeries and the  
aneurysm,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``You look at a handful of 
players in each sport and say that they get the most possible out 
of their ability, David Cone is one of those players. Physically 
and mentally, he's a special player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Following last year's World Series sweep of San Diego, the  
Yankees weren't sure whether to re-sign Cone, even after he went 
20-7. Finally, on Nov. 11, he haggled out an $8 million, one-year 
contract that gives him the chance to earn an additional $100,000 
for each start from 17 through 31. 
</P>
<P>
	New York had confidence in his heart, if not his arm.  
</P>
<P>
	``The questions are valid if you look at the MRIs and the  
X-rays,'' Cone said Sunday. ``The MRI and the X-rays only show so 
much. Doctors only tell half the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On May 10, 1996, after missing a start for the first time in  
nine years, Cone was diagnosed with the aneurysm near his right 
armpit, an illness some thought might be life threatening. Doctors 
took a one-inch vein from his left thigh and used it to repair two 
arteries in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than four months later, he made a most amazing return,  
pitching seven no-hit innings at Oakland before manager Joe Torre 
and pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre decided 85 pitches were enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Joe was going to leave the decision to me, I'm going back  
out there and throw caution to the wind,'' Cone said at the time. 
``I think Mel and Joe did the right thing, trying to protect me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Yankees down 2-0 to Atlanta, he turned around the World  
Series by winning Game 3. He went 12-6 in '97 but by October, when 
Cleveland battered him in a playoff start, it was clear he needed 
another operation. 
</P>
<P>
	After an arthroscopic surgery cleaned up the shoulder that  
December, the Yankees babied him in the spring of 1998. Turned out, 
the best of his career was still to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's more to pitching than medical history,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> New Apple Laptop Has Fans in Frenzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. has yet to reveal its  
mysterious new laptop computer, let alone start to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	But judging from the anticipation in the Mac community, Apple's  
latest surprise promises to be another sales splash -- extending the 
company's comeback and shaking up portable design just as its iMac 
personal computer prompted the industry to rethink the clunky beige 
desktop. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have another blockbuster on their hands,'' said Tim  
Bajarin, an industry consultant who heads Creative Strategies 
Research International, in Campbell, Calif. ``There is an amazing 
amount of anticipation and excitement around this machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are obstacles to another Apple best seller, including  
potential production problems and a worldwide shortage of 
flat-panel screens, which could drive up Apple's costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry buzz over the laptop's expected design, price and  
performance is accelerating ahead of a keynote speech on Wednesday 
by Apple co-founder and acting chief executive Steve Jobs, at the 
MacWorld trade show in New York. Jobs is expected to unveil the 
computer during his address. 
</P>
<P>
	While Apple is keeping a characteristic tight lid on details  
prior to the show, industry watchers and customers expect the 
machine to make a strong design statement that borrows generously 
from the enormously popular iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	The jellybean-shaped desktop was introduced by Apple last August  
and comes in five colors. Strong sales led the company last week to 
report its seventh straight quarterly profit, and have pushed up 
Apple's share of retail desktop sales to 6.7 percent in May, double 
that of a year ago, according to the ZD Infobeads research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the iMac, the Apple laptop is expected to use translucent  
plastic so the user can faintly see the machine's inner circuitry. 
Less certain is whether it will come in several colors, or whether 
the edges will be rounded in subtle homage to the iMac's casing, 
which sports a built-in monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the laptop promises to break convention with rival machines,  
which generally look like thin boxes and are used mostly by 
traveling professionals. If priced affordably, a snazzy portable 
could potentially become a status symbol among students and 
everyday desktop users, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be a design that will bring wolf whistles of  
appreciation from men and women,'' said Richard Doherty, who heads 
The Envisioneering Group industry consultancy, based in Seaford, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the laptop is expected to be priced hundreds of dollars  
less than Apple's PowerBook laptop for professionals, introduced 
this past spring starting at $2,000. Apple doesn't currently sell a 
laptop aimed at consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaper laptops are available elsewhere at under $1,000, but  
they are mostly off-brands that use outdated technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Some major Mac purchasers already are concerned about potential  
supply shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth College, for example, has contacted Apple salespeople  
to see if its roughly 1,200 freshman can get first dibs on the 
laptop when it comes out. iMacs were a big seller this past year at 
the Ivy League school, which requires incoming students to have a 
computer and gives them discounts on purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's widely rumored that Apple will sell out their product  
line'' of laptops, said Larry Levine, Dartmouth's director of 
computing. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new portable takes off, it could help Apple crack a new  
technology market -- people who are intrigued by laptops, but are 
reluctant to buy them because of the price and stodgy design. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 37 percent of laptops owned in the United States are used  
in homes, with the rest used in workplaces, according to ZD 
Infobeads. That compares to about half of all desktops used in the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Apple has yet to reclaim its glory of the 1980s,  
when one out of every four desktops sold was a Mac, it continues to 
have great influence in the PC industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing's certain. While Apple has shown a knack for using  
design to lure newcomers to technology, the laptop offers a bigger 
hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, problems with Apple production led its laptops  
to overheat during use, costing the company money and credibility. 
Modifying the traditional design of the computer casing could prove 
difficult, since squeezing components into such a small space is a 
challenge in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a worldwide shortage of flat-panel screens, which  
use liquid crystal instead of electron beams to show text and 
images, could drive up component costs and hurt Apple's ability to 
make money on a low-priced laptop.

<HEADLINE> Keeneland Horse Sales Set for Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Yearlings from the cream of the 1998 foal  
crop, including five by the late great Mr. Propsector, go on the 
auction block starting Monday at Keeneland's annual sale of elite 
colts and fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the two-day sale is expected to draw spirited bidding  
from the world's top thoroughbred owners and trainers, with no hint 
that the strong spending of recent years will slow. 
</P>
<P>
	``All indications are that it's going to be very good,'' said  
Duncan Taylor, president of Taylor Made Sales Agency, one of the 
largest consigners of yearlings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Racing's getting good exposure, they had a record crowd at  
Belmont, the stock market's stayed good. All the indicators are 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, buyers spent an average of $482,765 on 149 horses,  
with 15 going for $1 million or more and 56 fetching $500,000 or 
more -- all levels of spending not seen since the mid-to-late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year was the fourth straight in which the average price  
paid for a Keeneland July yearling was up. The average price was 
the highest since 1985 and the median price of $360,000 was the 
highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the bidders driving last year's big numbers were Satish  
Sanan's Padua Stables and the European-based Coolmore partnership 
of Michael Tabor and John Magnier. Together, Coolmore and Padua 
accounted for 11 of the $1 million yearlings and 30.5 percent of 
the money spent at the sale, and both are back for this year's 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
	They will find plenty of well-bred yearlings on which to bid.  
</P>
<P>
	The second-to-last crop from Mr. Prospector, euthanized last  
month at age 29, includes a colt who is a half-brother to Belmont 
winner Editor's Note and a colt out of Seattle Slew daughter 
Embellished. 
</P>
<P>
	And Arthur Hancock's Stone Farm will see if it can strike gold  
for the second year in a row with a son of Mr. Prospector out of 
the mare Angel Fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Hancock topped the sale with a Mr. Propsector-Angel  
Fever colt that sold for $4 million, the highest Keeneland summer 
sale price since Seattle Dancer went for a record $13.1 million in 
1985. Sanan and the Coolmore operation joined forces in an attempt 
to buy that colt, but lost out to Japanese horseman Fusao 
Sekiguchi. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Mr. Prospector fillies in this year's sale are Serena's  
Tune, a daughter of 3-year-old champion filly Serena's Song, winner 
of 11 graded stakes and $3.3 million in her career, and a yearling 
out of Fit For A Queen. 
</P>
<P>
	The sires with the most horses cataloged are Gone West, with 14,  
1992 Belmont winner A.P. Indy and Irish champion Woodman, with 13 
each, and two-time leading sire Deputy Minister, with 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two Triple Crown winners, Seattle Slew (1977) and  
Affirmed (1978), each have yearlings in the sale, while young sires 
Grindstone, Hennessy and Smart Strike each will have foals from 
their first crop up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	All but 11 of the yearlings cataloged for the sale were bred in  
Kentucky, and only one was bred outside North America, a chestnut 
colt by Forty Niner out of World Glory, who was foaled in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale opens with a session Monday evening and concludes with  
sessions Tuesday afternoon and evening.

<HEADLINE> News Media Seize on Kennedy Tragedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TV stuck with a story that for many anxious  
hours yielded few new facts -- then, Sunday evening, gave up its 
tragic outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	At a broadcast briefing shortly after 9:30 p.m. EDT, Coast Guard  
Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee left no hope for John F. Kennedy Jr., 
his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and his sister-in-law Lauren 
Bessette, whose plane went down off the Massachusetts coast Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, said Larrabee in a  
grim voice, ``could not be too optimistic about survival.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the nation's three newsweeklies had busted deadlines  
and remade their issues to put John F. Kennedy Jr. on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Time, U.S. News and World Report, and Newsweek were due on  
newsstands Monday after scrambling to focus on the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We pretty much redid the whole edition,'' said Newsweek  
spokesman Roy Brunett. Of its 55 editorial pages, 29 were devoted 
to the cover package of stories, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	People magazine, which in 1988 anointed Kennedy ``The Sexiest  
Man Alive,'' also gave him the cover in its next issue, out this 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, John F. Kennedy Jr. is extremely popular with our  
readers, so we'll give this the attention it deserves,'' 
spokeswoman Susan Ollinick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday newspapers devoted page after page to coverage of the  
search. While The New York Times placed the story on the left-hand, 
secondary spot on its front page, The Washington Post ran the 
banner headline ``JFK Jr. Feared Dead in Plane Crash,'' and the New 
York Post cried, ``MORE TEARS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the day, while the nation was watching, listening and  
reading, many also spoke up. On Sunday afternoon, America Online 
logged one message posted every second concerning the Kennedy 
disappearance. That's comparable to the response after Princess 
Diana's death in 1997, said spokeswoman Regina Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are mostly well-wishers and prayers and  
I-remember-when,'' Lewis said from AOL headquarters in Dulles, Va. 
``Not everyone has a newspaper column, and as people are digesting 
this, they want to say something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox all concentrated on the Kennedy tragedy on  
their Sunday morning news programs, and cable's CNN, Fox News 
Channel and MSNBC stayed with the story throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	But until late in the day, most of what viewers found was  
rehashed information, recapped family history and what often 
sounded like eulogies -- even before the worst was conceded. 
</P>
<P>
	``He makes a real point of introducing himself,'' said George  
Stephanopolous on ABC's ``This Week,'' praising Kennedy in the 
present tense as a regular guy. But a few moments later, he sadly 
spoke of sister Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg: ``Now she's lost her 
entire immediate family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From hovering helicopters, the networks beamed pictures of Coast  
Guard search efforts off Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	They also relied on their news archives, which chronicle the man  
called ``the nation's favorite son'' all the way back to a 1960 
newsreel of him leaving the hospital at 13 days old with his mother 
and president-elect father. 
</P>
<P>
	Other footage showed Kennedy and his wife of slightly less than  
three years -- a golden couple who commanded the world's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	The TV vigil seemed eerily familiar to Bob Schieffer, anchor of  
CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Every so often,'' he said, ``almost as if on schedule,  
something happens to the Kennedys and we gather around our 
television sets to watch them deal with yet another unspeakable 
grief.''

<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Justin Leonard wasn't happy about  
losing a three-way playoff in Sunday's British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	But he knew that Jean Van de Velde, who blew the tournament with  
a triple bogey on the final hole, was even more depressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I bad as I feel, he feels worse,'' said Leonard, who won  
the Open two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's tough to go through to have a lead in the championship  
at the last hole and not be able to win. It has to be a sick 
feeling for him and through the playoff as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard thought he had blown his chance as Van de Velde stepped  
to the 18th tee three shots ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I had lost but I knew I had to stick around and went  
to one of the little trailers behind the scorers' tent,'' Leonard 
said. ``The first thing I saw was Jean hitting the ball into the 
creek. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not a whole lot you can learn from that other than he  
got himself in a position to win the tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard and Van de Velde ending up losing in the playoff to Paul  
Lawrie of Scotland, who had finished two hours earlier. If Leonard 
was dismayed by his performance, his two-over-par finish in the 
four-hole playoff upset him more. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, I lost the British Open twice on one day which is  
twice as hard to take,'' said Leonard, who triumphed at Troon in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In both regulation and the playoff, Leonard hit his second shot  
on 18 into the Barry's Burn, the creek in front of the green. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time, he thought he needed a birdie to have any chance  
and hit a 3-wood from the rough to the water. 
</P>
<P>
	``Got up and down for a bogey,'' he said. ``At the time I didn't  
think it mattered a whole lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, if he had made par, he would have won the  
title -- Van de Velde's horrendous 18th only put Leonard in playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty much chaos,'' Leonard said of the playoff in  
which all three players missed the fairway and the green on the 
first two holes as rain trickled down. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all pretty embarrassed. To get it up and down for a  
bogey and up and down for a bogey at 16 and I still found myself in 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a good putt at 17 from 40-50 feet which could easily  
have gone in and then at 18 I hit a great tee shot and had a little 
bit of an uphill lie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a little bit behind it, hit is a hair fat, just enough  
to not get it over the burn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrie, already one ahead after a birdie three at the third  
playoff hole, landed his second shot four feet from the flag and it 
was all over.

<HEADLINE> Burnitz's Injury Comes at Bad Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jeromy Burnitz's timing has never been the  
greatest. 
</P>
<P>
	It still isn't -- just as the Brewers are coming on, he's on the  
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	He struggled for four seasons with the Mets and Indians before  
Cleveland traded him to Milwaukee in 1996. He became a solid 
contributor for the Brewers, but his team has struggled while the 
Indians remained perennial championship contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	After a breakout season in 1998, Burnitz has become a bonafide  
star this season with 26 homers, 73 RBI and a starting spot in the 
National League outfield in the All-Star game. What's more, his 
Brewers are showing signs of life after getting back to .500 with a 
win Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Burnitz will be watching from the sidelines for at least  
three weeks, likely longer. He broke a bone in his right hand when 
he was hit by a pitch by Kansas City's Jose Rosado Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The pitch broke Burnitz's fifth metacarpal bone, and his hand  
was put in a splint. He came to County Stadium briefly on Sunday 
but left before Jose Valentin's two-out single in the ninth drove 
in Lou Collier and wrapped up Milwaukee's 11th win in 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers placed Burnitz on the 15-day disabled list, but he  
could be out twice that long, Milwaukee manager Phil Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't replace a guy like Burnie, and I'm sure it's really  
hard for him to watch without contributing,'' Garner said. ``I'm 
sure he's going to deal with this in a positive way, but it's 
tough, real tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burnitz started in Tuesday's All-Star game and had an RBI  
double. He also finished second to Ken Griffey Jr. in the home 
run-hitting contest. It was valuable exposure for a player from a 
small-market team. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he will have to wait, and the Brewers' young, potent offense  
will have to find a new cleanup hitter. On Sunday, Alex Ochoa -- who 
is hitting .342 but has just five homers -- took Burnitz's place and 
had two singles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, when he comes back we'll be in position for him to  
give us a surge,'' left fielder Geoff Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner hasn't settled on a strategy to replace Burnitz.  
Candidates for the No. 4 spot include catcher and fellow All-Star 
Dave Nilsson, who has 19 homers and 52 RBI; Ochoa, who homered 
twice Saturday against Kansas City; and Jenkins, who has 14 homers 
on the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of guys who have been swinging the bat so  
well,'' Garner said. ``This is going to give everyone from Alex 
Ochoa to Rich Becker a chance to step up and prove they belong in 
the lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Brewers haven't had trouble scoring runs lately. Their team  
batting average has been around its current .286 for two weeks, 
just a percentage behind Colorado for the NL lead, and their .365 
on-base percentage is the league's best. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burnitz is a big part of our lineup, but we're gaining a lot  
of confidence as a team,'' Marquis Grissom said. ``To have him out 
of the lineup, everybody has to turn it up a little bit.''

<HEADLINE> Megamall Builder Eyes Calif., Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Megamall developer Mills Corp. is targeting  
California and Europe in an ambitious plan that seeks to dot the 
landscape of two continents with entertainment-oriented shopping 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Best known for building huge, suburban malls such as Ontario  
Mills near Los Angeles, the company has profitably ridden a 
retailing trend that aims to court shoppers by combining discount 
retail shops with upscale restaurants and entertainment centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Based in Arlington, Va., Mills has taken the entertainment side  
of that equation beyond video arcades to trout-fishing ponds, 
skateboard parks and even a BMX dirt-bike trail in malls in 
California, Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida, Arizona, Illinois, 
Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Mills wants to apply that same formula to open-air plazas  
in U.S. and European cities. In Europe, the company is looking at 
sites in Spain and Northern Italy. In California, potential sites 
include downtown Los Angeles and the San Francisco area. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans for the European and downtown Los Angeles projects are  
still in the formulative stages, but Mills executives believe 
European and American shoppers share an attraction to shopping 
spiced with entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's where we think retailing is going,'' Laurence C.  
Siegel, Mills chairman and chief executive officer, said in an 
interview. ``It's got to be interactive. It's got to be fun. 
Shopping has got to be exciting. If it's not, just turn on the 
computer and buy it online.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Mills opened the $165 million Block at Orange, an  
open-air shopping plaza in suburban Orange, Calif. The company's 
first open-air development, the Block is smaller than Mills' indoor 
malls, and features upscale stores instead of discount outlets, but 
it shares the same emphasis on entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	With modifications, the concept could work in Europe, said  
Stanley Eichelbaum, president of the consulting firm Marketing 
Developments Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``With refinement, it has potential just about throughout the  
world,'' said Eichelbaum, whose company is developing similar 
projects in Central America and the Middle East. ``Worldwide 
there's a desire, especially in the aging portions of the world, 
for the nostalgia of the streetside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe, in particular, is naturally suited to Siegel's vision  
because retailing never moved indoors, as it did in the United 
States during the 1960s and 1970s. A few indoor malls based on the 
American model have been built in Europe, but the concept hasn't 
caught on, said Eichelbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	In downtown Los Angeles, Siegel wants to build an upscale  
outdoor shopping plaza that would include a hotel and office space. 
Construction of the plaza would be good news for downtown, which 
already appears on its way to renewal with plans for a basketball 
arena, the Roman Catholic archdiocese's new cathedral and the $255 
million Disney Concert Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the sound you hear of the dam bursting in terms of  
interest in downtown,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the 
Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. ``The standard line 
is downtown is still a troubled area, but you've got to look longer 
range because there's a tremendous amount of money being spent on 
downtown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concept of mixing entertainment and retail is not unique to  
Mills, but the company has done a good job of attracting top names 
in both industries to its malls. In some cases, Mills has worked 
with companies such as Saks Fifth Avenue to make their first 
venture in the outlet arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Discount outlets featured at Mills megamalls include Reebok,  
Samsonite, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. 
Entertainment venues include companies like Dave &AMP; Buster's and 
GameWorks. 
</P>
<P>
	Typically, the huge malls averaging 1.7 million square feet,  
such as Ontario Mills, are built 15 to 40 miles outside a major 
metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
	Three more are under construction in Nashville, Concord, N.C.,  
and Katy, Texas. Eventually, Siegel wants to build another 30 
across the United States. The company already has picked sites in 
Georgia, New Jersey, Maryland, Massachusetts, California and 
Ontario, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for Mills, a real estate investment trust, rose 9  
percent to $45.6 million during 1999's first quarter. Earnings 
before an extraordinary item were up 25 percent to $10.8 million, 
thanks to higher lease rates and increased mall occupancy levels. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of their malls are very, very popular with the public,''  
said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report. ``By 
and large this is the day and age for companies such as Mills.''

<HEADLINE> Arthur Mitchell Honored in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Arthur Mitchell isn't wholly  
comfortable with the idea of being a dance ``hall of famer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always thought those things were for the old and dead,''  
Mitchell said. ``But I'm glad to get the honor while I'm still 
alive and kicking. Although I'm not kicking as high these days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who became the first black male principal dancer of a  
major ballet company in 1955 and went on to found the Dance Theatre 
of Harlem, was inducted Sunday into the Dance Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke the traditionally white ballet mold when he joined the  
New York City Ballet, under the direction of George Balanchine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell quickly gained fame for roles that Balanchine  
choreographed especially for him, including the ballet ``Agon'' and 
the role of Puck in ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my role model and mentor,'' Stephanie Dabney, who danced  
with the company for 15 years, said. ``If it wasn't for him, I 
would not have gotten the chance to dance the roles that I did.''

<HEADLINE> Mourners Gather at JFK Jr.'s Apt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In a familiar ritual of mourning, hundreds of  
people came to John F. Kennedy Jr.'s doorstep on Sunday to leave 
flowers, candles, prayers and poetry expressing grief over the 
presumed deaths of Kennedy, his wife and sister-in-law in a plane 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all watched him grow up through the TV and when something  
like this happens, it happens to all of us,'' said Frank Lopez, a 
furniture truck driver, who came from Queens with his mother, Lucy, 
to leave an American flag and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedys, he added, ``are part of America, and they show  
Americans what they could be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People came on foot, in taxis and private cars to the former  
commercial building-turned-luxury condo in Manhattan's Tribeca 
district, where Kennedy lived in a top-floor penthouse. A claque of 
news media all but outnumbered the private citizens at any given 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, film director Spike Lee arrived unexpectedly, left  
a white envelope addressed in red ink to ``The Kennedy's,'' and 
darted back to his car before most spectators and photographers 
recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
	Next to the door, Jose Torres of the Bronx had posted a drawing  
based on the famous picture of Kennedy at age 3, saluting the 
casket of his slain father, President John F. Kennedy. It was 
inscribed, ``Has anyone here seen my old friend John-John?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are each of us angels with only one wing, and we can only  
fly embracing each other. We send our prayers and hope you are in 
the arms of the angels,'' wrote Luciano DeCrecenzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rose's beauty is very dear. Enjoy its beauty when it is  
here. As soon as it comes it is gone,'' said a note signed, 
``Hafez, a Persian Poet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Melissa Monahan, 23, who came from New Jersey with flowers, said  
JFK Jr. was ``a living part of history, yet he was very human... to 
honor them is kind of comforting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It should not have happened to him. He was our crown prince in  
America. He stood for everything that was good in this country,'' 
said Joan Roth, a special education teacher in the Bronx. ``He was 
an American dream... he was beautiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some visitors were surprised to find that Kennedy lived in what  
at first glance is a seedy neighborhood of 19th century warehouses, 
factories and lofts, whose facades belie the luxury conversions 
within. Actor Robert DeNiro and other film industry notables live 
in the area just north of the financial district. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very modest way of living ... I don't know many  
people who would live in this area, in San Francisco,'' said Gilles 
Desaulniers, 47, who runs a grocery store popular with celebrities 
in the bay city. 
</P>
<P>
	Desaulniers said he was in New York for a food fair and stayed  
over after hearing of the Kennedy crash. ``I feel like the people 
of my generation are all disappearing, people who can make an 
impact on our lives,'' he said. ``I'm almost used to it now. I'm 
just really moved by the fact that he gets on a plane and 
disappears.''

<HEADLINE> Dead Gray Whales Wash Ashore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Starved gray whales are washing up dead on  
West Coast beaches in the highest numbers in a quarter-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 155 whale carcasses came ashore as the mammoth marine  
mammals made their annual 6,000-mile migration from their winter 
retreat in the lagoons of Baja California to the feeding grounds of 
the Bering Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists believe a shrinking food supply may be the  
problem, while others blame a growing population fighting for the 
same amount of food. It's likely a combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, if it's found that the whales have outgrown their  
food supply, it would be seen as a positive sign for a species that 
was on the brink of extinction early this century and listed as 
endangered as late as 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five carcasses washed up in Mexico early in the year. The  
strandings continued as the migration moved northward: 37 dead in 
California, 24 in Washington and Oregon, seven in British Columbia, 
22 in Alaska. Last year 80 whales washed ashore. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the number of whales washing ashore represents only  
a fraction of the actual deaths, estimated to be 800 this year. 
Ocean currents, wind and other factors determine whether a carcass 
makes it to a beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence suggests the whales are starving: They've washed up  
emaciated, some having wandered off course into inlets like Puget 
Sound and San Francisco Bay. Many of the dead were adult females, 
more susceptible than males to malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody knows for sure'' why the whales are dying, said Joe  
Cordaro, a wildlife biologist for the National Marine Fisheries 
Service in Long Beach, Calif. ``There are a lot of theories out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One theory is that the whale population has outgrown the Bering  
Sea's food supply. Most gray whales eat the bulk of their food -- 
small crab-like creatures or tube worms sucked off the ocean floor 
-- during the two or three months they spend in the Bering Sea. They 
store energy in their blubber before returning to Baja to breed. 
</P>
<P>
	The population is now estimated at 26,600, up from a low of  
2,000 at the turn of the century when commercial whalers almost 
wiped them out for fuel, soap, pet food and whalebone corsets. They 
became protected in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be seeing the first large whale population to reach  
carrying capacity after whaling,'' said John Calambokidis, senior 
research biologist at Cascadia Research in Olympia, Wash. ``They 
reached the limit of the food supply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Climate changes such as last year's El Nino or ocean warming  
also could have reduced the available food. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little evidence to suggest that pollution is killing  
the whales or their food. Decomposition of the beached whales often 
prevents autopsies, but tests that have been performed showed only 
trace amounts of contaminants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right away, when whales wash up dead, people start talking  
about pollution,'' Cordaro said. ``We do know they have some 
contaminants in their blubber, but it does not appear to be at 
lethal levels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toxic contamination would have killed more whales and other sea  
creatures in small, concentrated areas, not like the broad 
distribution of gray whale beachings seen this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, environmentalists in Mexico have raised concerns --  
so far dismissed by scientists -- over salt plants near breeding 
lagoons. In Washington, the noncommercial Makah Indian hunt of a 
gray whale earlier this year was preceded by months of controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing here that threatens the existence of gray  
whales, nothing to suggest they're going back on the endangered 
list,'' said Bruce Mate, professor of fisheries and wildlife at 
Oregon State University. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say it will take more time and study before they can  
fully explain the whale deaths. If the food shortage is related to 
climatic conditions, the number of deaths will decline in the 
future. If the population has expanded beyond the food supply, more 
whale carcasses will litter the coast. 
</P>
<P>
	That's bad news for residents of seaside communities where  
smelly cadavers occasionally wash up. In January, residents in the 
posh San Diego neighborhood of La Jolla pinched their noses while 
the remains of a gray whale were hauled to a dump. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior life guard B. Chris Brewster dreads more carcasses.  
</P>
<P>
	``After having worked on the whale, I can tell you that it takes  
about three showers in turpentine to get the smell off your skin,'' 
he said. ``One lifeguard had to replace a wet suit it smelled so 
badly. There's just no way to describe it.''

<HEADLINE> Open Trophy Back Where it Belongs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Scots don't have summer, not a real  
one, anyway. Their big cities have too few bright lights. And 
nobody ever flies over for the food. 
</P>
<P>
	But what the Scots have more of than anyone else in the world --  
besides breathtaking vistas -- is golf. And now, thanks to homeboy 
Paul Lawrie from just up the road in Aberdeen, they once again own 
the most important piece of hardware in the very game they 
invented. 
</P>
<P>
	Victory came 68 years after the last Scot won on home soil, in  
the very same place, Carnoustie. And even if you didn't know much 
about Lawrie -- New Year's Day baby, 1969; two previous wins as a 
European tour pro -- you knew he descended from the same bloodlines 
as Tommy Armour the moment he wrapped his big hands around the auld 
claret jug. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Lawrie didn't begin his acceptance speech by  
thanking a swing guru, personal trainer, nutritionist, sports 
psychologist or the corporation that manufactured his clubs for 
helping him win the British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	He thanked Carnoustie's greenskeeper first, then his wife and  
family. That portion of the speech might have been longer, except 
Lawrie's wife was at home tending to their 7-month-old son and the 
rest of his family was in Spain ``enjoying themselves in the sun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he turned to the grandstands on either side of the 18th  
green and thanked the fans who cheered him on all tournament long, 
especially through the darkening chill and driving rain of the 
four-hole playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The only thing that would have been more authentically Scottish  
was for Lawrie to mention each and every one of his hunting dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thanks to everyone that knows me, which is a lot of you now.  
You all clapped for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a local boy,'' he finished. ``Thanks a lot.''  
</P>
<P>
	Lawrie put American Justin Leonard and Frenchman Jean Van de  
Velde out of their misery on the 22nd hole all three of them played 
Sunday with the bravest shot of the tournament. It was a 4-iron 
from 221 yards out that sailed through the wind and wet and over 
the narrowest part of the last green to within 3 feet of the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	It capped the greatest final-day comeback in the history of  
major championship golf, from 10 strokes off the lead. In keeping 
with theme established during the four days of the tournament, 
Lawrie's shot was also one of the riskiest. 
</P>
<P>
	The best players in the world came to Carnoustie, the toughest  
championship venue there is, and right from the start -- to turn 
Bobby Jones' famous line on its head -- played a game with which all 
the rest of us are only too familiar. 
</P>
<P>
	With the fairways narrowed in places to the width of a country  
lane, rain falling occasionally and the wind howling steadily, 
their shots flew off course with regularity. All of a sudden, pros 
were banished to those parts of a golf course only hackers ever 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes they had to improvise shots from thigh-high hay. Other  
times, it might be with one foot in a sand bunker and the other on 
a ridge. A few times, they swung mightily and missed. A few other 
times, they made contact and after seeing where the shots wound up, 
wished they had missed. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, almost to a man, they complained about how unfair  
it was. By the end, it made them so wacky that at the most critical 
juncture of the tournament, Van de Velde took off his socks and 
shoes and waded into the Barry Burn, the meandering stream that 
crosses the 18th hole three times, and prepared to play his ball 
where it lay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wait just a little longer,'' Craig Parry, his playing partner  
said only half in jest, ``the tide's going out in a couple of 
minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After some pleading, though, Van de Velde's caddy talked him  
into taking a drop and trying the more conventional play. Yet more 
wackiness only ensued when the Frenchman hit his next shot into the 
bunker guarding the right side of the 18th green and managed to get 
up and down with a triple-bogey 7 and into the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour later, Lawrie stared at the same bunker for the second  
time that afternoon. As he stood in the fairway, he had a 1-stroke 
lead over Leonard, who had dumped his approach shot into the burn, 
and Van de Velde, who was hacking his way toward the green via the 
left-side rough. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrie could have played cautiously, laid up with a wedge on his  
second shot and then hit another, shorter wedge shot into the green 
for a certain bogey 5 to secure his win. But that would have rubbed 
his Scottish nature the wrong way, gone against the way he was 
taught to play the game. 
</P>
<P>
	So he hit that brave, or maybe foolhardy, 4-iron across the  
slate-gray sky, walked up with all those cheers still ringing in 
his ears and tapped in for a birdie 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just went ahead and did my job,'' Lawrie said. ``The golf  
course was very, very tough. But it's a major tournament and you 
should have to pass the exam.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Netscape, M'Soft Execs Make Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft and Netscape may be two of the  
Internet's fiercest rivals, but you wouldn't know it by the way 
some former top executives are joining forces. 
</P>
<P>
	James Barksdale, chief executive of Netscape before it was  
bought by America Online Inc. in March, and Brad Silverberg, who 
formerly led Microsoft Corp.'s Internet strategy, are financing a 
new startup in Silicon Valley, Tellme Networks Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Barksdale and Silverberg, along with most of Tellme's roughly 20  
employees -- many formerly from Microsoft and Netscape -- are 
contributing a total of $6 million as ``seed money.'' Despite being 
called Tellme, the company is vague about what it wants to sell, 
beyond saying it plans a service that will change the way consumers 
use the traditional home telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a 120-year old device. It's not very sophisticated in the  
ways you find information and people,'' Barksdale said a telephone 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives say they are vague because don't want to set  
expectations high for a product that isn't expected to come out for 
another year. But they say the experience of working on opposite 
sides of the Internet software wars may come in handy when making 
fresh inroads into a new high-tech realm. 
</P>
<P>
	Tellme is expected to announce the investment on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Tellme was founded by Mike McCue, former vice president of  
technology at Netscape, and Angus Davis, former product manager of 
Netscape's Communicator Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Hadi Partovi, lead program manager for Microsoft's  
Internet Explorer browser, made headlines when he joined the 
company co-founded by his former arch-enemies at Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are under 30, and Angus is 21 years old.  
</P>
<P>
	It is the Barksdale Group's third investment since Barksdale  
left Netscape and started the outfit to invest in Silicon Valley 
startups.

<HEADLINE> Fight for Control of Phone Cos. Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The five-week battle for control of two  
telephone companies, U S West Inc. and Frontier Corp., ended Sunday 
with the two bidders dividing the spoils, each getting one company. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, a Denver-based local phone company, will merge with  
Qwest Communications International Inc. in a stock swap worth $34.7 
billion, or $69 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier Corp., a Rochester, N.Y.-based local and long-distance  
company, will be acquired by Global Crossing Ltd. for $10.9 
billion, or $63 a share, in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Qwest and Global Crossing are building worldwide  
fiber-optic cable networks to give customers high-speed Internet 
access. The rivals both wanted the customers and revenues of U S 
West and Frontier to make their networks profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing this whole episode will do is educate people,  
investors that yes, it's wonderful to have a state-of-the-art, 
almost science-fiction quality network, but you need customers on 
that,'' said Peter Treadway, an analyst with Ryan, Beck-Southeast 
Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing had formed deals with U S West and Frontier, but  
Qwest trumped them with higher offers. 
</P>
<P>
	For both Qwest and Global Crossing to declare victory, each  
company had to compromise. Qwest withdrew its bid for Frontier, and 
Global Crossing reduced the breakup fee U S West had to pay for 
backing out of its deal. U S West will now pay a $420 million 
penalty, instead of $850 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frontier is worth a lot more to Global Crossing than it is to  
Qwest,'' Treadway said. ``Frontier provides Global Crossing with a 
nationwide fiber-optic backbone, which Qwest already has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Global Crossing wasn't prepared to escalate the bidding war  
for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to shareholders, Bob Annunziata, chief executive  
officer of Global Crossing, said he would not raise his offer for U 
S West. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe your best interests would be served by  
increasing our bid by an additional premium of approximately $5 
billion in order to match or exceed the competing offer,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Clayton, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Frontier, will become a vice chairman of Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts and investors have raised the possibility that  
Qwest only bid for Frontier as a cutthroat bargaining ploy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could easily draw the conclusion that Qwest's bid from day  
one had a diversionary element to it,'' Treadway said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's chairman and chief executive officer, Joseph Nacchio,  
maintains that its offer was in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was interested, I was sincere, my shareholders, to be  
perfectly frank weren't all that interested in Frontier,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock has been hammered since the company announced its  
offers for the two companies. The shares closed Friday at $35 a 
share, off 22 percent from its pre-bid price. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest now gets U S West's customers in 14 west and midwest  
states. The combined company will keep the Qwest name, but both 
companies will have equal representation on the 14-member board of 
directors. The combined company will pay a 5 cent annual dividend. 
U S West currently pays $2.16 a year, while Qwest pays none. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Qwest and U S West are both based in Denver, the  
companies should be able to save more money but cutting additional 
costs. And while Colorado politicians supported a Qwest-U S West 
combination, which would keep the headquarters in the state, the 
labor union has voiced opposition fearing the companies will slash 
more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nacchio said, ``I expect a minimal impact on the employee  
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executives expect the deal to close in mid-2000, pending  
regulatory and shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Trujillo, chairman, president and chief executive  
officer of U S West will become a co-chairman of Qwest and 
president of the combined company's Internet, local and wireless 
businesses. That position is better than the vice-chairman's seat 
he was originally offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Nacchio will keep the titles of chairman and chief executive  
officer of Qwest. So, while structured as a merger of equals, 
Nacchio will have the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear when you think about operating the company  
you've got to have one person in charge of how the business is run, 
and that person is Joe,'' Trujillo said.

<HEADLINE> Aldrin Glad Armstrong Was First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin said Sunday that  
he has no regrets that Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon ahead of 
him 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, who became the first man to walk on the moon on July  
20, 1969, was chosen because of seniority, said Aldrin, who touched 
the moon moments later. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was rather relieved that it was decided that particular way  
because I didn't have to respond to all sort of questions about 
what am I going to say when I get on the moon,'' said Aldrin in a 
British Broadcasting Corp. interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has had to take the attention of the world as the first man  
to be on the surface of the moon,'' said Aldrin. ``And that has a 
considerable impact on a person's life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aldrin, who was visiting London in conjunction with the  
celebration of the anniversary of the moon landing, said civilians 
should go into space. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time that ordinary people be given the  
opportunity,'' he said. ``I don't see why we don't start by taking 
a journalist up before the (2000 presidential) election.''

<HEADLINE> White Sox' Thomas Leaves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- White Sox first baseman Frank Thomas left  
Chicago's game with the Milwaukee Brewers in the first inning 
Sunday after suffering a bruised right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, who reached base after being hit by Bill Pulsipher, was  
leading off third base when Brook Fordyce fouled off a pitch. The 
line shot hit Thomas on his foot, and he fell hard to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed in the game and later was forced out at the plate, but  
Paul Konerko replaced him at first base to start the bottom of the 
first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was taken to St. Michael Hospital for X-rays, which were  
negative. The team listed him as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas is hitting .323 this season with 12 home runs, 25 doubles  
and 57 RBI. He has played in all 89 of Chicago's games, the only 
player to do so.

<HEADLINE> CNN Beefing Up Financial Content </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN is adding 2 1/2 hours of financial news on  
weekdays and giving Wolf Blitzer a prime-time anchor slot as part 
of a schedule overhaul to go into effect in September. 
</P>
<P>
	The news network will also change the time slot and format for  
its struggling newsmagazine series, ``NewsStand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CNN will add ``Money Talks,'' a business-oriented breaking news  
program, from 11 a.m. to noon ET, replacing a talk show. ``Street 
Sweep,'' a half-hour wrapup of Wall Street activity, will air at 4 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-hour business news program that now airs at 6 a.m. will  
double in length, starting at 5 a.m. to take advantage of growing 
early-morning TV viewership. All of the new business programming 
will be simulcast on CNNfn, the network's financial news sister 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	``Moneyline,'' a business wrapup that airs at 6:30 p.m., is  
CNN's most lucrative show. The additions are a reflection of the 
hunger for business news, said CNN USA President Rick Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issues that are growing big-time are the pocketbook  
issues,'' he said. The expansion of business news does not, he 
said, mean trouble for CNNfn, which is the poor sister to CNBC in 
financial programming because of its inability to be picked up on 
many cable systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Blitzer, CNN's longtime White House correspondent, will anchor  
``The World Today'' newscast at 8 p.m. with the current anchors, 
Joie Chen and Jim Moret. The show shifts from 10 p.m. to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	``NewsStand'' will move back to 10 p.m., where it launched last  
year. CNN said it will be more of a live news show and less of a 
newsmagazine, and will drop the nightly themes it used in 
collaboration with Time Inc. magazines. Willow Bay, Stephen Frazier 
and Judd Rose will share anchor roles. 
</P>
<P>
	``NewsStand'' has struggled in the ratings and saw its  
reputation hurt when it aired a report about alleged Vietnam War 
era nerve gas use that the network later retracted. 
</P>
<P>
	The new format will give CNN more flexibility to respond to  
breaking news yet still do the type of stories that appeared on the 
newsmagazine, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think the network needs, if you're a full-service  
network, to do more than breaking news,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Use of Morse Code Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Canadian coast guardsman Kevin Layton  
remembers using Morse code to talk a ship's crew off Hawaii through 
a medical emergency. Former U.S. radioman Ed Brady recalls dots and 
dashes coming from a ship that hit ice en route to Denmark until it 
sank, all hands lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``So distinctive,'' Brady says of the distress signal SOS, for  
generations Morse code's chilling call for help from seafarers. 
``It just registers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's consigned to a storied past.  
</P>
<P>
	Months after the code was abandoned under international  
convention for ships in trouble, the only private U.S. network of 
coastal radio stations using Morse has turned off the transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	With that, mariners and Morse practitioners say, a long  
antiquated but still eminently reliable form of communication has 
ended in U.S. commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	A final ceremonial message was tapped out last week to  
Washington, where the first such message originated 155 years ago. 
On May 24, 1844, Samuel Morse's question, ``What hath God 
wrought?'' pulsed along 35 miles of steel wire to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple but slow, the telegraph was overtaken decades ago by the  
telephone, by data systems capable of reproducing printed words at 
the receiving end, and by satellite for most forms of 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
	But until the newest generation of satellite and computer  
technology took hold, Morse code endured for mariners. 
</P>
<P>
	Now e-mail is within easy reach for many at sea and modern ships  
have automated emergency beacons designed to allow rescuers to zero 
in on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morse code has finally met its match,'' says Tim Gorman,  
operations director for Globe Wireless, the company that dropped 
the curtain on commercial radiotelegraphy by ceasing transmissions 
at its four stations in Half Moon Bay, Calif., and Slidell, La. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week the World War II-era Liberty ship Jeremiah O'Brien,  
docked in San Francisco harbor, transmitted a Morse farewell to 
President Clinton. ``History is made on this day as we embark on a 
new era of communication,'' it began. 
</P>
<P>
	The message was translated back into English and sent to the  
White House the modern way, via e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	It was acknowledged with an automated e-mail response from the  
White House, no hands on deck. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Maritime Organization officially phased out  
Morse code Feb. 1 for ships in peril, replacing it with the 
high-tech Global Maritime Distress and Safety System. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Coast Guard ceased Morse operations several years ago  
and no longer monitors radio frequencies used for the code. But 
Brady, now in the Coast Guard's communications office, says it will 
respond if it happens to hear that infamous, now archaic, dot dot 
dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot, meaning SOS. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no government facility listening,'' he said. And now  
with the loss of the radio stations, there is ``nobody privately 
listening,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morse experts say the stations, KFS, KPH, WCC and WNU, were the  
last commercial radiotelegraph operations in North America. They 
continue to beam shipping information, news and weather to ships at 
sea as part of the larger Globe Wireless network using satellites 
and high-frequency radio. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology now considered a tortoise was an astonishing hare  
in its time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Information will be literally winged with the rapidity of  
lightning,'' the Baltimore weekly Niles National Register reported 
after Samuel Morse made his historic transmission. Space and time 
were ``annihilated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The invention eventually ended the age of news dissemination by  
pony express, steamer and courier pigeon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press, formed four years after Morse's  
demonstration, rose on the strength of the expanding telegraph as 
information that once took days or weeks to go from city to city 
sped to its destination in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports from the Civil War, greetings between distant relatives,  
dispatches on market prices in far-off places -- all could be sent 
in the time it took to reach the telegraph office. At first it 
consisted of clicks; later, tones. An international Morse code was 
developed that was more suitable for foreign languages. 
</P>
<P>
	Radiotelegraphy penetrated the wildest tempests.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have seen and heard reports that when a ship gets into a  
bad storm and gets into trouble, the first thing to go is satellite 
communications,'' said Layton, of the Canadian Coast Guard in 
Halifax, Nova Scotia, which monitors busy North Atlantic sea lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Morse code was right there 'til the ship flipped under the  
water.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morse continues to be used in poorer parts of the world and is  
popular with ham radio enthusiasts. U.S. naval ships seeking silent 
communication still use the code with flashing lights. 
</P>
<P>
	Another vestige remains, although those who practice it are  
surely oblivious. 
</P>
<P>
	The rhythmic beat by fans in sports arenas -- dum-dum,  
dum-dum-dum, dum-dum-dum-dum, dum-dum -- is Morse code for the 
numbers 7 and 3. By telegraphers' shorthand, 73 means best wishes.

<HEADLINE> How Did Television Become So White? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- During the 1970s, television viewers followed  
black families in the penthouse (``The Jeffersons''), the projects 
(``Good Times'') and a junkyard (``Sanford and Son''). 
</P>
<P>
	A decade later, TV's first family was Bill Cosby's Huxtables.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, in 1999, the NAACP has attacked the four biggest networks  
for a ``glaring omission'' of minorities in major roles on comedies 
and dramas. The nation's oldest and largest civil rights 
organization is threatening lawsuits and boycotts, and suggesting 
that the Federal Communications Commission hold hearings on the 
topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``To paraphrase Newton Minow when he said television is a vast  
wasteland,'' said Robert Johnson, founder and chairman of Black 
Entertainment Television, ``I'd say television is a vast white 
land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happened?  
</P>
<P>
	Experts suggest the major networks have become timid and  
slavishly devoted to the demographics prized by advertisers -- 
young, white and affluent. And it doesn't help that there are no 
blacks with the authority to determine what goes on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime time isn't devoid of blacks. Cosby has another show. ABC's  
``The Hughleys'' stars a black family, although it deals with their 
experiences living in a white neighborhood. Actor Eriq LaSalle is 
prominently featured in the ensemble of ``ER,'' prime-time's most 
popular show. CBS is planning a midseason replacement series, 
``City of Angels,'' a medical drama with a primarily black cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Dramas like ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Law and Order'' are more likely  
than comedies to have multiracial casts. ABC's ``The Practice'' 
includes two black actors in its ensemble cast portraying lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the paucity of black actors on the new shows  
premiering this fall that prompted the NAACP action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost looks as if somebody is turning the clock back and  
trying to avoid using black performers,'' said Doug Alligood, 
senior vice president for special markets at the advertising firm 
BBDO. ``It's not something that's imagined. It's real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining viewership and a proliferation of programming choices  
mean it's harder to reach a mass audience today. The networks have 
increasingly become specialized in their efforts to reach an 
advertiser-friendly audience. It's clear they don't believe black 
actors help much. 
</P>
<P>
	Television is also cyclical, or blindly imitative. Ensemble  
shows like ``Friends'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' recently have been 
particularly influential among programmers, producing a string of 
look-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
	So many young, white actors walked across the stages when the  
networks announced their fall schedules this spring that they 
seemed interchangeable. Hollywood had trouble casting all the 
shows. It wasn't just blacks who were underrepresented; people over 
age 50 were seen almost as infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't take risks anymore,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Major network programming divisions are also run by a tight

	``They're being myopic,'' Alligood said. ``Too many people are  
talking to themselves. Too many programs are being created by 
people who are sitting around saying, `That's funny to me and funny 
to my buddies, let's put it on.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Oddly enough, a BBDO study found that blacks and whites were  
watching the same shows more often this year than at any time since 
the 1991, such as ``ER,'' ``Touched by an Angel,'' ``Monday Night 
Football'' and ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the bad news for the industry is how quickly TV sets are  
being turned off in black homes. Ratings for prime-time network 
shows among black audiences were off 16 percent from a year ago, 
and 26 percent for the 20 most popular shows, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP didn't mention the two smaller networks, UPN and the  
WB, which this fall will each have four comedies with primarily 
black casts. ``The Steve Harvey Show'' on the WB was the year's 
most popular show among black audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Both networks, however, will run their black-oriented comedies  
back-to-back-to-back-to-back on one night. This ``strip'' 
programming of similar shows is popular among programmers as a way 
of stopping viewers from changing channels. But it can also be 
interpreted as a subtle form of segregation. The message: time for 
whites to watch something else. And what's interesting to note is 
that these shows don't even appeal to all blacks, some of whom 
consider them to be offensive and to offer a bigoted view of black 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	Many black viewers are suspicious that even these networks don't  
have a long-term commitment to their needs. Fledgling networks 
often use black-oriented shows as a way of quickly building an 
audience, since blacks in general watch more TV than whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet when the networks are established, they then push for shows  
they believe will appeal to whites because advertisers consider 
whites a more lucrative target, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives at ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC were almost sheepish in  
their response to the NAACP. None indicated they believed they were 
doing enough to promote diversity. Even before the NAACP 
announcement, executives at NBC and ABC said they considered it a 
priority to cast a wider ethnic net. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps that's a good sign,'' Alligood said. ``In the past,  
they would have come back with an arrogant or defensive attitude. 
... Unfortunately, in our business, things don't change unless 
there is a little bit of stress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is less optimistic. Indeed, he's banking on the status  
quo: BET is developing a series of 10 made-for-TV movies and a 
late-night talk show designed to reach the burgeoning black middle 
class, which he believes the major networks don't really care 
about.

<HEADLINE> How Did Television Become So White? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- During the 1970s, television viewers followed  
black families in the penthouse (``The Jeffersons''), the projects 
(``Good Times'') and a junkyard (``Sanford and Son''). 
</P>
<P>
	A decade later, TV's first family was Bill Cosby's Huxtables.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, in 1999, the NAACP has attacked the four biggest networks  
for a ``glaring omission'' of minorities in major roles on comedies 
and dramas. The nation's oldest and largest civil rights 
organization is threatening lawsuits and boycotts, and suggesting 
that the Federal Communications Commission hold hearings on the 
topic. 
</P>
<P>
	``To paraphrase Newton Minow when he said television is a vast  
wasteland,'' said Robert Johnson, founder and chairman of Black 
Entertainment Television, ``I'd say television is a vast white 
land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What happened?  
</P>
<P>
	Experts suggest the major networks have become timid and  
slavishly devoted to the demographics prized by advertisers -- 
young, white and affluent. And it doesn't help that there are no 
blacks with the authority to determine what goes on the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime time isn't devoid of blacks. Cosby has another show. ABC's  
``The Hughleys'' stars a black family, although it deals with their 
experiences living in a white neighborhood. Actor Eriq LaSalle is 
prominently featured in the ensemble of ``ER,'' prime-time's most 
popular show. CBS is planning a midseason replacement series, 
``City of Angels,'' a medical drama with a primarily black cast. 
</P>
<P>
	Dramas like ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Law and Order'' are more likely  
than comedies to have multiracial casts. ABC's ``The Practice'' 
includes two black actors in its ensemble cast portraying lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the paucity of black actors on the new shows  
premiering this fall that prompted the NAACP action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It almost looks as if somebody is turning the clock back and  
trying to avoid using black performers,'' said Doug Alligood, 
senior vice president for special markets at the advertising firm 
BBDO. ``It's not something that's imagined. It's real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Declining viewership and a proliferation of programming choices  
mean it's harder to reach a mass audience today. The networks have 
increasingly become specialized in their efforts to reach an 
advertiser-friendly audience. It's clear they don't believe black 
actors help much. 
</P>
<P>
	Television is also cyclical, or blindly imitative. Ensemble  
shows like ``Friends'' and ``Dawson's Creek'' recently have been 
particularly influential among programmers, producing a string of 
look-alikes. 
</P>
<P>
	So many young, white actors walked across the stages when the  
networks announced their fall schedules this spring that they 
seemed interchangeable. Hollywood had trouble casting all the 
shows. It wasn't just blacks who were underrepresented; people over 
age 50 were seen almost as infrequently. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't take risks anymore,'' Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Major network programming divisions are also run by a tight  
fraternity of executives, all of them white, and it sometimes 
seems, as interchangeable as the actors. NBC Entertainment 
President Garth Ancier did the same job at the WB. ABC 
Entertainment President Jamie Tarses was a top executive at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're being myopic,'' Alligood said. ``Too many people are  
talking to themselves. Too many programs are being created by 
people who are sitting around saying, `That's funny to me and funny 
to my buddies, let's put it on.'''

<HEADLINE> Still No Sign of JFK Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- A vast aerial search of the sea off  
Martha's Vineyard resumed Sunday after Coast Guard cutters 
overnight found no signs of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Their plane was reported missing off the shores off the resort  
island early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard Falcon jet took off about 6 a.m. to begin the  
daytime search and assess weather conditions, said Coast Guard 
Chief Petty Officer Dennis Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour earlier, authorities began combing the beach on  
all-terrain vehicles looking for any signs of the plane or its 
passengers that may have washed ashore, state police Lt. Richard 
Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, police Capt. Robert Bird appealed to the  
public to turn over any debris that might be related to the crash, 
noting that holding on to such evidence is a criminal offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be an essential part of this investigation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bird also said crews are likely to search for debris on an  
island known as Nomans Land, a former military site about 3 1/2 miles 
southwest of Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	A daylong search Saturday yielded plane fragments, a  
prescription bottle belonging to Kennedy's wife and a piece of 
baggage belonging to his sister-in-law, but no signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard cutters using bright lights and a sonar-equipped  
ship searched overnight, but three helicopters and an Air National 
Guard C-130 airplane were grounded early Sunday because of low 
haze. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee, interviewed Sunday on  
ABC's ``This Week,'' said the search with sonar was hampered by 
``the very rocky bottom that complicates the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Gary Jones said statistics suggest a  
person has slim chances of surviving in 68-degree waters for more 
than 36 hours. But he added that each case is unique, and that 
recoveries have been made in worse conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33,  
and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, departed Friday night from 
Fairfield, N.J., to Cape Cod for the wedding of his cousin Rory, 
daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, at Hyannis Port. The 
wedding was postponed -- replaced with prayers for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	A family friend said Lauren Bessette was to be dropped off at  
the Vineyard before Kennedy and his wife continued on to Hyannis 
Port. Another friend reported the plane missing to the Coast Guard 
about 2:15 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philbin Beach in Aquinnah -- the portion of the Vineyard  
popularly known as Gay Head, and near where Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis owned a 365-acre estate -- a wheel, a headrest and part of a 
plane support known as a strut had washed up, said Coast Guard Lt. 
Craig Jaramillo. A black bag with Lauren Bessette's name on it also 
was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA reported the last radar contact with the plane was at  
9:39 p.m. Friday during its final approach to the airport on the 
island off Cape Cod. Radar records showed the plane's last known 
location was about 17 miles southwest of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	John Fish, a sonar expert with Cape Cod-based American  
Underwater Search and Survey, said water depths range from 84 to 
120 feet in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seabed is flat, sugar sand, fine sand. There are no  
canyons that would hide wreckage,'' Fish said. However, he said 
shadows from boulders and debris from about 20 shipwrecks in the 
area could hinder the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy recently acquired the single-engine, six-seat Piper  
Saratoga II HP -- a plane known in the aviation industry as a 
high-performance airplane with a good safety record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, flying it at night, in a hazy sky and under visual  
flight rules -- the reported conditions Friday night -- is 
challenging. Kennedy had obtained his pilot's license last year, 
but he was not licensed to fly on instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th  
anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident, in which Sen. Edward 
Kennedy's car went off a bridge, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne 
on a tiny island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy has lived entirely in the public eye, from his birth  
shortly after his father's election as the nation's 35th president, 
to his poignant salute on the day of his namesake's funeral, to his 
romances with Daryl Hannah and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	A former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he launched  
his own political magazine, George, in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was wed Sept. 21, 1996, to Bessette, a former publicist for  
fashion designer Calvin Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, who is 18 months older than Carolyn, works as  
an investment banker in New York City. She has a twin sister, Lisa 
Ann. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City, Jose Torres put up  
a poster Sunday on the building where Kennedy lives with his wife. 
The poster read: ``Has anyone seen my old friend John-John?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, he was Mr. New York,'' said Torres, 42. ``Everybody  
loved him, and he was a really nice guy. He said hello to me once 
when I met him riding my bike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Greenwich, Conn., about 200 friends and neighbors of the  
Bessettes packed St. Michael's Church, offering prayers, 
condolences and memories. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Cardini, one of Bessette's former classmates, left two  
bouquets of flowers at the high school they attended, which sits on 
the church grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to let her know we're thinking about her,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Kennedy, the only other survivor of the young family  
that transfixed the world four decades ago, was on a rafting trip 
out West, CNN reported.

<HEADLINE> New Modem System Helps Diabetics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- A new modem system is allowing some  
diabetics to send their blood-sugar levels to their doctors with 
the touch of a button. The technology means fewer office visits and 
faster treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Dempsey is among 10 western New York diabetics testing the  
modem system produced by Indianopolis-based Roche Diagnostics. For 
years, she kept track of her changing blood-sugar levels by jotting 
them in a log book which she carried back and forth to her doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she transmits the information directly to the doctor's  
office from home or work through a modem that saves her from 
logging entries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before ... I communicated (with my doctor) once every two or  
three months, when I visited,'' the Niagara Falls woman said. 
``Now, I'm communicating with him on a weekly basis ... and when he 
sees the results, he calls me to tell me whether I should change my 
treatment plan or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system is marketed as the Acculink modem system, which works  
with the Accu-Chek Complete blood glucose meter. The system also is 
in limited use in a several other cities, including San Francisco 
and Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Paresh Dandona, Ms. Dempsey's doctor, said the technology is  
especially beneficial for patients who must travel long distances 
to their doctor's office and for unstable patients, who must check 
their blood up to four times a day and frequently phone in the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Acculink system, patients prick their finger, put a  
drop of blood on a test strip and place it in the meter, which 
reads the results. The data can then be quickly transmitted through 
a telephone line to the doctor's computer or fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patients don't have to spend time trying to call the  
person and dictate the values,'' said Dandona, director of the 
Diabetes-Endocrinology Center of Western New York. ``When it is 
convenient for the staff to look at the information, they can 
analyze and interpret it and get back to the patient. 
</P>
<P>
	``This can be done round the clock because you're not waiting  
for someone on the other side to talk to you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics' bodies don't produce or properly use insulin, a  
hormone needed to convert sugar and starches into energy. The cause 
of the disease is a mystery, although genetics and factors such as 
obesity and lack of exercise appear to play a role. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15.7 million people, or roughly 6 percent of Americans,  
have diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. The 
seventh-leading cause of death in the country, it can lead to 
blindness, kidney and nerve disease, heart disease and stroke 
without careful treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gerald Bernstein, former president of the American Diabetes  
Association, said technology allowing patients to deliver their 
blood levels from remote sites would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	Regular monitoring by a doctor is essential, especially for  
patients with unstable blood-sugar levels, said Bernstein, director 
of the Diabetes Management Program at Beth Israel Medical Center in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that patients not only transmit the numbers from  
the meter, but continue to keep a handwritten log to retain a feel 
for how they correlate to their health. 
</P>
<P>
	``Patients have a better understanding of their numbers when  
they write them down, but that's a personal thing,'' he said. 
``It's empowering.''

<HEADLINE> Cast of 'Star Trek' To Tour States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH (AP) -- Classic ``Star Trek'' fans rubbed shoulders with  
some old friends this weekend -- Scotty, Sulu, Chekov and Uhura. But 
how long can the lovefest continue? 
</P>
<P>
	``It can go on as long as people are enthusiastic,'' said Walter  
Koenig, 62, who played Ensign Pavel Chekov. ``But I suppose we have 
a finite existence. There was a time when I thought we could go on 
indefinitely. But the times are changing, and I can see a time when 
we will not be on the road. It's inevitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Dave Scott, whose Kansas-based Slanted Fedora  
Entertainment brought Koenig, James Doohan, Nichelle Nichols 
(Uhura) and George Takei (Sulu) together for a 14-state tour, said 
all the actors have turned down offers for future group 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Doohan, 79, who played Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott, pledged  
to keep going as long as he can. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it will fade as long as we're alive,'' he said  
Saturday while signing autographs and sitting for pictures with 
fans. ``I have a responsibility to go where the fans invite me.''

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Cousins Carry on Legacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	They prompt admiration, outrage and, perhaps above all,  
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy Jr.'s generation of Kennedys inherited a  
legendary political name founded on Irish-American grit and a 
father's fortune. They've extended the controversial dynasty to a 
third generation, along with a famous name that still evokes 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they feel that this is the Kennedy legacy,'' historian  
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. said Sunday. ``Their fathers and uncles were 
not out to make money. They had it. But they felt a sense of 
obligation to people in society who didn't have the good fortune to 
be born as they were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30 Kennedy cousins include the prominent, the prodigal and  
the tragic. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert F. Kennedy, one of nine Kennedys of his generation,  
fathered 11 children, two of whom went into the family business of 
politics -- exclusively Democratic. Massachusetts congressman Joseph 
Kennedy is retiring after six terms. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend is 
in her second term as Maryland's lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
	With several Kennedy cousins in politics, they inevitably meet  
beneath capitol domes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Kennedy Townsend shared her 1994 victory with her  
cousin, state Delegate Mark Shriver. That made things awkward 
recently when he championed a bill to fund after-school programs. 
Republicans argued that the money would end up being controlled by 
Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
	For three terms Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's son, Rep. Patrick  
Kennedy of Rhode Island, has voted with his cousin Joe on most 
issues. As chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign 
Committee, he would have helped Joe raise money for 2000 if Joe 
hadn't bowed out. 
</P>
<P>
	Another draw among the post-baby boom Kennedys is journalism.  
</P>
<P>
	Maria Shriver, daughter of Eunice and Sargent Shriver, is an  
award-winning ``Dateline NBC'' co-anchor. Robert's son Douglas 
Kennedy is now a Fox News correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	The younger John Kennedy defied critics by giving up his  
prosecutor's job and publishing ``George'' magazine, a blend of 
celebrities and politics. Many speculated that he might later move 
to politics like his father, who won a Pulitzer prize for the book, 
``Profiles in Courage,'' and occasionally wrote dispatches from 
London when his father was ambassador there. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Kennedy cousins pursued nonprofit work aimed at  
improving conditions for the homeless, the environment and other 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is an environmental law professor at Pace  
University in White Plains, N.Y. He recently announced he helped 
set up a company to sell Keeper Springs Mountain Spring Water. 
Profits are to go toward keeping tap water clean. 
</P>
<P>
	His sister Kerry, married to Housing and Urban Development  
Secretary Andrew Cuomo, heads the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center 
for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Kennedy Jr., who lost a leg to cancer as a child in 1973,  
founded Facing the Challenge, which promotes self-help programs for 
the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Edward M. Kennedy's 1994 re-election campaign was headed by  
his nephew, the late Michael Kennedy, who also led a nonprofit 
organization that supplies heating fuel to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergent generation of Kennedys has added tarnish as well as  
luster to the family name. John called cousins Michael and Joseph 
``poster boys for bad behavior'' in his magazine's September 1997 
edition. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael had been making headlines through an alleged affair with  
an underage baby sitter. Joe, who had been strongly considering a 
run for governor in 1997, gave it up after being beset by bad 
publicity. Among his critics were his first wife, who objected when 
he sought an annulment of their marriage. In his youth, he was 
involved in a car accident that left a passenger paralyzed for 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, William Kennedy Smith, one of four children of former  
ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith, was charged with rape. He 
was acquitted after a trial that included testimony from his uncle 
Ted. He is now a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	Disputes divided the family even early on.  
</P>
<P>
	John's mother, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, ``made it a  
strict rule not to allow Caroline and John Jr. to fraternize with 
their Hickory Hill cousins,'' author Jerry Oppenheimer wrote in his 
book about Robert's wife, Ethel, titled ``The Other Mrs. Kennedy.'' 
Hickory Hill was Robert Kennedy's Virginia homestead. 
</P>
<P>
	And tragedy often brought the family together.  
</P>
<P>
	Three other members of this generation of Kennedy children have  
died. Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, President and Jacqueline Kennedy's 
second son, was born nearly six weeks premature in August 1963 and 
died after two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert's son David died in 1984 of a drug overdose in a hotel  
after being kicked out of the family vacation home at Palm Beach. 
Shortly after the babysitter story broke, David's brother Michael 
died in a Colorado skiing accident.

<HEADLINE> Authorities Say Kennedy Likely Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- After two days of searching and holding  
out hope of a miraculous survival, authorities conceded late Sunday 
that John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister likely were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement effectively confirmed the worst fears of  
Americans for the son of the fallen president, who had become crown 
prince of America's pre-eminent political dynasty; for his wife, 
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, a former fashion publicist who turned 
press-shy after her marriage; and her older sister, Lauren 
Bessette, a rising New York investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to shift, and I say shift very purposefully, from  
our focus on search and rescue to search and recovery,'' Coast 
Guard Rear Adm. Richard M. Larrabee, the head of the search 
operation, said at news conference at Otis Air Force Base on Cape 
Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the search for Kennedy's missing plane, which has  
covered almost 9,000 square miles, on Sunday produced no major 
finds but authorities were focusing on ``a couple of targets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are simply potential targets and don't necessarily  
represent an aircraft or part of it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, not unexpected, ended official hopes for the  
survival of JFK Jr., who had been famous since the indelible salute 
he gave at his father's funeral on his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy was piloting a single engine Piper  
Saratoga carrying his wife and sister-in-law when it went down in 
the waters off Martha's Vineyard on Friday night en route to his 
cousin Rory's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	The quintessential media figure, he was shadowed always, in  
college at Brown, on dates with Madonna and Daryl Hannah, at law 
school, and in his courtship and marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have failed the bar twice, but he was a Kennedy, not one  
of much known political ambition, but a prince who was once crowned 
``the sexiest man alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searchers looking for Kennedy's plane had zeroed in earlier in  
the day on a spot at the bottom of the sea after picking up an 
automatic emergency signal Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Larrabee said the signal had been discounted and could have  
come from a data marker dropped by the Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A sonar-equipped ship was sent to the spot off Martha's Vineyard  
where debris from the plane was found earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said on Monday divers would begin searching possible  
targets in water 60 to 80 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in Washington, President Clinton offered the prayers of  
a nation, saying the Kennedys ``have suffered much and given more'' 
as a family over the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this difficult moment, we hope the families of these three  
fine young people will feel the strength of God, the love of their 
friends and the prayers of their fellow citizens,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy and Bessette families spent a second anguished day  
Sunday awaiting word along with the rest of the nation, as federal 
authorities set up a top-level command center to oversee the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have spent some very painful moments with the families  
tonight. I think they understand,'' Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy's sister, Caroline Kennedy, whose whereabouts had been  
unclear since the accident, had awaited word on New York's Long 
Island. It was not known why she did not attend the wedding or join 
the family in Hyannis Port. She and her family were said to have 
just returned from a Western rafting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experienced pilots said that a relatively new pilot like  
Kennedy may have been ill-advised to fly at night, while others 
said it was routine. A source who is friendly with the Kennedy 
family told The Associated Press that Kennedy had intended to fly 
earlier in the day, but his sister-in-law, an investment banker, 
had to work late. 
</P>
<P>
	However, it wasn't clear that the crash was necessarily due to  
pilot error or inexperience, as opposed to mechanical failure or 
other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy had recently acquired the single-engine, six-seat Piper  
Saratoga II HP. Newspaper reports said he had 100 to 200 hours of 
flying time. 
</P>
<P>
	He had obtained his pilot's license in April 1998 but was not  
licensed to fly on instruments alone, the way experienced pilots do 
in bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The disappearance of the son of the 35th president brought forth  
the kind of emotion stirred two years ago by the death of Princess 
Diana, with the TV networks devoting all-day coverage and 
newspapers rolling out extras on the movie-star handsome lawyer and 
magazine publisher whose life had been untarnished by scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mourners left flowers at the Brookline, Mass., birthplace of his  
father, at the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston and on 
the steps of John and Carolyn Kennedy's apartment building in New 
York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday happened to be the 30th anniversary of another family  
trial -- Chappaquiddick, in which Sen. Edward Kennedy's car went off 
a bridge on an island next to Martha's Vineyard, killing passenger 
Mary Jo Kopechne and ending any hope Kennedy had of becoming 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., as he became known, has been a reluctant icon. He  
eschewed a political career for publishing, and avoided the 
troubles that plagued many of his cousins. His wildest act, at 
least publicly, may have been getting a small shamrock tattoo. 
</P>
<P>
	His appeal transcended generations. His father was voted into  
the White House by the generation that fought World War II. He was 
born while that generation raised its children and for them he 
would always be that little boy, in a blue coat and shorts, 
saluting his father's casket on his third birthday. 
</P>
<P>
	To another generation, he was ``the sexiest man alive'' -- a  
title bestowed on him by People magazine. New York's gossip pages 
simply dubbed him ``The Hunk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other family members, Kennedy never entered politics,  
although he was constantly questioned about a future in the 
political arena and often mentioned as a candidate for Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy graduated from Brown University in 1983, turning his  
attention to a variety of pursuits: searching for a sunken pirate 
ship off Cape Cod, visiting India for six months, raising funds for 
the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, he introduced his uncle, U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
at the Democratic Convention -- and received a two-minute standing 
ovation. A year later, he graduated from New York University with a 
law degree. 
</P>
<P>
	He joined the Manhattan district attorney's office the next year  
-- but only after failing the bar twice. ``HUNK FLUNKS,'' read a 
tabloid headline after one of those attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he launched the magazine George -- subtitled ``not just  
politics as usual.'' Its trademark became celebrity covers; the 
first issue featured Cindy Crawford dressed as George Washington, 
sporting a bra top, white wig and tight pants. 
</P>
<P>
	The lithe, blonde Bessette Kennedy enjoyed a privileged  
upbringing as the stepdaughter of a surgeon in posh Greenwich, 
Conn. But not even that could prepare her for life in the Kennedy 
clan, a jet-setting existence complete with White House invitations 
and family weekends in Hyannis Port. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, 18 months older than Carolyn, graduated from  
Greenwich High School in 1982. She worked as an investment banker 
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York City; a card from that 
company bearing her name was found attached to luggage that washed 
ashore off Martha's Vineyard on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Memorialized in Fireworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- John A. Kotowski was a rocket scientist.  
After he died, his family thought it fitting to send his remains 
into space. Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
	Kotowski, who designed rockets, missiles and a drill that  
collected samples from the moon's surface, died last summer at age 
85. On Saturday night, he received a nearly astral send-off when 
his ashes were scattered in a 3 1/2 minute fireworks display over the 
San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would love every moment of it,'' daughter-in-law Jane  
Kotowski said. ``It just suited his personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kotowski, who has been married to John Kotowski Jr. for  
nearly 30 years, said her husband and his brother, Robert, arranged 
their father's cremation last year according to his wishes. But 
they couldn't decide what to do with his ashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kotowski then saw an announcement in his local newspaper  
in Littleton, Colo., about scattering ashes in fireworks and knew 
it was the ideal solution for his father, an aerospace engineer who 
retired from Martin Marietta, now the Lockheed Martin Corp., in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	They contacted the Neptune Society of Northern California, which  
specializes in nontraditional cremations, and arranged the $3,200 
fireworks display, a first for the society. 
</P>
<P>
	The society turned to Dick Hassenger and his San Diego-based  
Celebrate Life, which had performed 23 previous cremains displays. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's an absolutely marvelous business. You can help  
people through a very difficult time in their lives and leave with 
memories of fire in the sky,'' Hassenger said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cremains were inserted in10 fireworks shells and exploded to  
Rossini's ``William Tell'' overture. Each traveled about 450 feet 
up and covered a sphere of about 500 feet, Hassenger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine family members were taken about two miles off San  
Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf to watch Saturday night's display.

<HEADLINE> Caroline Kennedy Awaits Word </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- She was the little girl who walked her dad to  
the Oval Office each morning and rode a pony on the White House 
lawn. Grown up now with a family of her own, Caroline Kennedy 
appears to be the last survivor of Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the day after her brother's plane went missing,  
Caroline Kennedy stayed far from the media and far from the rest of 
the Kennedy clan gathering in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy, husband Edwin Schlossberg and their children aged  
12, 9 and 6 were waiting out the search at a home they have in the 
Hamptons on eastern Long Island, a summer playground for the rich 
and famous. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a characteristically discreet way for a very private  
woman to handle her very public life. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy, who had been out West rafting with her family  
before her brother was reported missing, returned to Long Island 
Saturday. She had not planned to attend the wedding of Rory Kennedy 
at Hyannis Port, Mass., but it was not clear why. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., 38, was en route to the wedding when his plane  
disappeared. His wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, 
Lauren Bessette, were also on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kennedy, 41, was extremely close to her brother. They were  
children together in the brief presidency that came to be known as 
Camelot after the legend of King Arthur, going on 6 and 3 when 
their father was assassinated in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, they endured the murder of their uncle, Robert F.  
Kennedy, in 1968, and adjusted when their mother, Jacqueline 
Kennedy, married Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis the same 
year. They did well in private schools in New York, avoided drugs 
and scandals -- and were kept far from the rest of the Kennedy clan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jackie had made it a strict rule not to allow Caroline and  
John Jr. to fraternize with their Hickory Hill cousins,'' author 
Jerry Oppenheimer wrote in ``The Other Mrs. Kennedy,'' his book 
about Robert's wife, Ethel. Robert and Ethel Kennedy's homestead in 
Virginia was known as Hickory Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Burke, a former aide to another Kennedy brother, Sen.  
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said in the book that Caroline had 
previously spent time there ``but with all that stuff going on out 
at Hickory Hill -- especially the problems the boys were having -- 
Jackie just didn't want Caroline and John there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As adults, Caroline and John often joined forces, presenting an  
award to preservationists in their mother's honor, and launching 
another award in their father's memory. They allowed an auction 
house to sell off 5,000 items from their mother's estate, and later 
blocked someone else from selling some of their father's diaries. 
</P>
<P>
	But while JFK Jr.'s love life and career as a magazine publisher  
have always been tabloid fodder, Caroline Kennedy, a lawyer, was 
wary of the limelight. Her brother addressed the Democratic 
National Convention in 1988, but she declined to serve as 
convention chairwoman four years later. And while JFK Jr. walked 
out to talk to reporters camped outside the Fifth Avenue building 
where their mother died in May 1994, Caroline Kennedy kept her 
thoughts to herself. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that she shuns the public eye. She rides the subway and  
walks her kids to school. She appears frequently at arts events, 
co-chaired a gala fund-raiser for the American Ballet Theater and 
last spring presented an award to Hillary Rodham Clinton at Lincoln 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, she happily chatted with reporters about the legal  
issues in ``The Right to Privacy,'' a book about privacy law which 
she wrote with a law school classmate. But any question that poked 
into her own privacy was parried with: ``I'm not going to tell 
you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She had earlier abandoned a career as a photojournalist because  
every time she tried to take pictures, someone was taking a picture 
of her. Her tall figure, honey-colored hair and shy smile were 
always bound to attract the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as hopes fade for finding her brother alive, ``There's a  
kind of pathos of the lonely survivor,'' said Peter Collier, author 
of ``The Kennedys: An American Drama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Caroline Kennedy married Schlossberg, a designer of museum  
interiors and exhibits, her brother served as best man, and gave 
this toast: ``All my life there has just been the three of us -- 
Mommy, Caroline and I.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there is just the one.

<HEADLINE>  Cone Wanted Solitude at Perfect Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Cone just wanted to be alone. He walked  
off the mound and straight to the clubhouse after each inning. 
</P>
<P>
	No high-fives, no pep talks, no pats on his back.  
</P>
<P>
	After all, perfection is nothing to be trifled with.  
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I talked to David today, was before the game  
when we went over the hitters,'' catcher Joe Girardi said. ``We 
talked about the pitch selection and I didn't say another word the 
rest of the day. Nobody was brave enough to joke with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone stayed away from his teammates for the first two outs of  
each inning, every time changing his T-shirt that was soaked with 
sweat because of the near 100-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre found Cone in his clubhouse office  
after the sixth inning. Neither had much to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We walked past each other,'' Torre said. ``I just told him he  
could use my office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the pair met for the next three innings, under the exact  
same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every inning after that, I made a point of doing it again,''  
Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Cone was on the bench just before retaking the mound each  
inning, his teammates completely ignored him, in keeping with 
baseball superstitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of them had been through this when David Wells pitched his  
perfect game last season for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been spoiled by a couple perfect games, and I think that  
helped the mood,'' Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outfielder and designated hitter Chili Davis was the only one  
who tried to lighten things up. 
</P>
<P>
	He was catching Cone during warmups in the eighth inning and  
told Cone to throw the ball faster. 
</P>
<P>
	`''You can throw the ball as hard as you want. I caught in the  
minors,''' Davis told Cone. ``Even something like that, which 
wasn't very funny, broke the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After completing the perfect game and being mobbed by his  
teammates, Cone eventually found himself back at his hideout in 
Torre's office, where he got a congratulatory call from Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who saved the no-hitter  
with a backhanded grab in the eighth inning, enjoyed Cone's 
perfection more than Wells'. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today was more exciting for me,'' Knoblauch said. ``The guy is  
the ultimate teammate and for him to be able to pull this off was 
amazing. Equally amazing was the fact that this happened on Yogi 
Berra Day and we actually had Don Larsen here.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Arrives at Confederations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- The U.S. team arrived Sunday for the  
FIFA Confederations Cup, and coach Bruce Arena acknowledged the 
Americans are a longshot. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena said he hoped to beat New Zealand on Saturday in the  
Americans' opener, but conceded the first-round games against 
Brazil (July 28) and Germany (July 30) would be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Americans are eliminated, Arena said Mexico would become  
his favorite to win the fourth edition of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena said the Americans would play an exhibition game this week  
against Egypt, which is in the tournament's other group. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament is for the champions of each of soccer's  
continental confederations. France, the World Cup champion, was 
invited but declined.

<HEADLINE> New Apple Laptop Has Fans in Frenzy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. has yet to reveal its  
mysterious new laptop computer, let alone start to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	But judging from the anticipation in the Mac community, Apple's  
latest surprise promises to be another sales splash -- extending the 
company's comeback and shaking up portable design just as its iMac 
personal computer prompted the industry to rethink the clunky beige 
desktop. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could have another blockbuster on their hands,'' said Tim  
Bajarin, an industry consultant who heads Creative Strategies 
Research International, in Campbell, Calif. ``There is an amazing 
amount of anticipation and excitement around this machine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are obstacles to another Apple best seller, including  
potential production problems and a worldwide shortage of 
flat-panel screens, which could drive up Apple's costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But industry buzz over the laptop's expected design, price and  
performance is accelerating ahead of a keynote speech on Wednesday 
by Apple co-founder and acting chief executive Steve Jobs, at the 
MacWorld trade show in New York. Jobs is expected to unveil the 
computer during his address. 
</P>
<P>
	While Apple is keeping a characteristic tight lid on details  
prior to the show, industry watchers and customers expect the 
machine to make a strong design statement that borrows generously 
from the enormously popular iMac. 
</P>
<P>
	The jellybean-shaped desktop was introduced by Apple last August  
and comes in five colors. Strong sales led the company last week to 
report its seventh straight quarterly profit, and have pushed up 
Apple's share of retail desktop sales to 6.7 percent in May, double 
that of a year ago, according to the ZD Infobeads research firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the iMac, the Apple laptop is expected to use translucent  
plastic so the user can faintly see the machine's inner circuitry. 
Less certain is whether it will come in several colors, or whether 
the edges will be rounded in subtle homage to the iMac's casing, 
which sports a built-in monitor. 
</P>
<P>
	But the laptop promises to break convention with rival machines,  
which generally look like thin boxes and are used mostly by 
traveling professionals. If priced affordably, a snazzy portable 
could potentially become a status symbol among students and 
everyday desktop users, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be a design that will bring wolf whistles of  
appreciation from men and women,'' said Richard Doherty, who heads 
The Envisioneering Group industry consultancy, based in Seaford, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the laptop is expected to be priced hundreds of dollars  
less than Apple's PowerBook laptop for professionals, introduced 
this past spring starting at $2,000. Apple doesn't currently sell a 
laptop aimed at consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheaper laptops are available elsewhere at under $1,000, but  
they are mostly off-brands that use outdated technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Some major Mac purchasers already are concerned about potential  
supply shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Dartmouth College, for example, has contacted Apple salespeople  
to see if its roughly 1,200 freshman can get first dibs on the 
laptop when it comes out. iMacs were a big seller this past year at 
the Ivy League school, which requires incoming students to have a 
computer and gives them discounts on purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's widely rumored that Apple will sell out their product  
line'' of laptops, said Larry Levine, Dartmouth's director of 
computing. 
</P>
<P>
	If the new portable takes off, it could help Apple crack a new  
technology market -- people who are intrigued by laptops, but are 
reluctant to buy them because of the price and stodgy design. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 37 percent of laptops owned in the United States are used  
in homes, with the rest used in workplaces, according to ZD 
Infobeads. That compares to about half of all desktops used in the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Apple has yet to reclaim its glory of the 1980s,  
when one out of every four desktops sold was a Mac, it continues to 
have great influence in the PC industry. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing's certain. While Apple has shown a knack for using  
design to lure newcomers to technology, the laptop offers a bigger 
hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, problems with Apple production led its laptops  
to overheat during use, costing the company money and credibility. 
Modifying the traditional design of the computer casing could prove 
difficult, since squeezing components into such a small space is a 
challenge in itself. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a worldwide shortage of flat-panel screens, which  
use liquid crystal instead of electron beams to show text and 
images, could drive up component costs and hurt Apple's ability to 
make money on a low-priced laptop.

<HEADLINE> British Open Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP)-- Tiger Woods hit his driver about a  
half dozen times in the British Open and went for 35 holes without 
a birdie. 
</P>
<P>
	Need any more reasons why he has now gone 10 majors without  
winning one? 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, for the week the driver was taken out of our  
hands, and that's probably the way they wanted to set it up,'' 
Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	He finished with a 3-over 74 and for a total of 10-over 294,  
tied for seventh four strokes short of reaching the playoff. He had 
six birdies, 12 bogeys and two double bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods played this course in the Scottish Open in 1995 and '96,  
but that was when the rough was ankle-high instead of knee-deep. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the Scottish Open, we hit driver off No. 5 (411 yards),''  
he said. ``This week you had to hit 6 or 7 irons to keep it short 
and in play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like almost everyone else, Woods was critical of how the Royal  
and Ancient set up the course, with wheat field rough and narrow 
fairways. Still, he's ready to return. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that if they're going to make the rough this high, go  
ahead and give us some room to hit. ... We are fine with 20-yard 
fariways, but then don't have the rough so high. But if you want to 
have it knee-high, then give us some room, give us a chance to 
play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd still love to play here again,'' he added. ``I think this  
is the hardest on the rotation. It's also definitely the fairest 
because there's only one blind tee shot and that's on 14. One most 
links you don't see everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *QUIET TIMES:* This may be remembered as the quietest British  
Open in history. 
</P>
<P>
	There were few birdies to applaud with only 18 players breaking  
par in the four rounds. Until the astonishing playoff, the gallery 
on the 18th Sunday sat in long stretches of dead silence, broken 
only by polite applause -- the kind given when two-time champion 
Greg Norman finished his round with a 72 to finish three strokes 
out of the playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to hear roars for birdies and eagles,'' Norman said.  
``At places like Augusta, it really spurs you on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Woods, Norman was not pleased with the set up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think they (R and A) got it a little wrong,'' he said. ``The  
narrowest of the fairways became even more narrow with the height 
of the rough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think when they sit back and analyze the way they set it  
up, having the fairways 11 to 12 yards wide in layup areas, and 15 
yards where we get to hit drivers on 480 yards holes, it becomes a 
little much when you're playing with 30 mph winds.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	RYDER FOR LAWRIE:@ Paul Lawrie's playoff victory guarantees him  
of making his first Ryder Cup team. The British Open victory was 
only the third win of his European Tour career and also guarantees 
him a place in next year's Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know about the Masters until an official told me when  
I finished my round. I've always wanted to play at Augusta. I'm 30, 
but I feel my career is just starting. I feel I can compete with 
the big guys now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reaching the playoff also boosted Justin Leonard's chance of  
making the U.S. Ryder Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RELIEF WANTED:* Jean Van de Velde wanted relief from the rough  
on the 11th hole in the third round so he wouldn't kill the 
cameraman. It was granted -- by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal and Ancient said Sunday a rules official erred by  
allowing the Frenchman to take a drop from the rough because the 
immovable object -- a television crane -- was not between Van de 
Velde's ball and the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	His lie was so bad that Van de Velde had no choice but to play  
back to the fairway, which is where the crane came into play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is regrettable that the ruling on the 11th hole was  
incorrect,'' said David Rickman, rules secretary for the R and A. 
``In the circumstances, the player's request was reasonable and 
understandable. But, in accordance with the local rule, relief 
should not have been granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The referee's ruling for a drop still stands, and Van de Velde  
still had a nasty lie in the rough. He still had a 20-foot putt for 
par, which he missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was similar to what happened to Larry Nelson in the  
1989 U.S. Open at Oak Hill. Nelson's ball stopped directly in front 
of a tree. When he tried to play back into the fairway, he found an 
immovable television stand in front of him -- but was denied relief 
because it was not in the line of the flag. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ODDS AND ENDS:* Nick Faldo's chances of making the Ryder Cup  
team must be nearly zero after he missed his first British Open cut 
in 24 tries. Faldo, who turned 42 on Sunday and has won more Ryder 
points than any player in history, is so low on the Ryder standings 
that he must rely on a wild-card pick from captain Mark James. 
James seems more likely to pick Jesper Parnevik and Bernhard 
Langer. Other possibilities are Thomas Bjorn, Patrick Sjoland and 
Per-Ulrik Johansson. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest post-war winning scores at the British Open are:  
Fred Daly, 1947 (293); Sam Snead, 1946 (290); Gary Player, 1968 
(289); Bobby Locke, 1952 (287); Peter Thomson, 1958 (286). Player's 
round came at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson on playing Carnoustie and missing the cut: ``I  
wish I hadn't come here. I would rather be at home with my wife and 
baby. ... I don't think there is an individual in the R and A who 
would break 100 around here.'' ... Several players have taken to 
calling the course ``Car-nasty. ... The R and A's Hugh Campbell, 
chairman of the championship committee, admitted he was wrong in 
making the fairways so tight. ``On the narrowness of the fairways, 
I hold my hands up.''

<HEADLINE> Great Lakes Dip to 32-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- After a brisk voyage along Lake Ontario's  
southern shore, Dave Walsh steered his 28-foot sailboat toward 
home, carefully hugging the west-shore pier as he entered 
Irondequoit Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	His caution stemmed from the growing risk of getting hung up on  
shifting sandbars. Because of a shortage of snow and rain over the 
past year, the Great Lakes have ebbed to their lowest levels since 
1967. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty yards off the pier, the sailboat ran gently aground on a  
sandbar, stranding Walsh and his sons, Russell, 15, and Jeffrey, 
14. It was a first for Walsh in 30 years of sailing on Lake 
Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of small boats have run aground on the lakes this year.  
Many more have gouged hulls or damaged propellers from hitting 
obstacles that previously were too deep to worry about. Freighters 
and other large ships don't go near the shallow water where 
sandbars are appearing. 
</P>
<P>
	It's in stark contrast with last year, when spring torrents  
pushed Lake Ontario above flood level and storm waves turned a few 
shoreline homes near Rochester into islands. Now, beaches are 
lengthening, or in some spots even emerging for the first time in 
three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last 30 years, with the lake levels significantly above  
average, there was a greater cushion; people weren't that close to 
that bottom,'' said Roger Gauthier, a hydrologist with the Corps of 
Engineers in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Ontario recently stood at 7 inches below average. Seven  
inches may not seem like much water, but that's on a lake that 
stretches roughly 200 miles long and 50 miles across. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Erie was down 3 inches, Superior was 6 inches off and  
Michigan and Huron came up 8 inches short. 
</P>
<P>
	The lakes will probably recede an additional 1 1/2 feet through  
November before inching back up again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lake Ontario has one advantage over the other lakes: a plug of  
sorts. A dam sits on the 40-year-old St. Lawrence Seaway leading 
down to the Atlantic Ocean, and the flow through its gates has been 
reduced slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just hoping for the best,'' said Tony Eberhardt, chief  
of the Lower Great Lakes Water Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
	From January 1998 through this spring, the Army Corps of  
Engineers estimates that precipitation was 20 percent below normal 
in the Great Lakes basin. 
</P>
<P>
	Business is leaking away from small marinas unable to rent out  
their shallow dock spaces. All 18 slips at Long Pond Marina in 
Greece, a Rochester suburb, lie empty and owner Mark Sheffield 
reckons he'll lose $10,000 in fees. 
</P>
<P>
	He's staying afloat with the increased demand for boat repairs.  
</P>
<P>
	The sand bar that left Walsh and his sons high and dry was 4  
feet below the surface, but his sailboat -- ``Blown Away'' -- has a 
draft of 5 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing they tried would get the boat off the sand, not even  
firing up the engine. 
</P>
<P>
	But then a fellow cruised by on a jet ski.  
</P>
<P>
	He dismounted and waded across the sand bar to tie a line to  
their boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Blown Away'' was towed off the sand without damage, but Walsh  
knows he'll have to be more careful on a planned trip to the 
Thousand Islands, a St. Lawrence Seaway resort region. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you hit the bottom there, you're mostly hitting  
granite,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Spouses of Some Reps. Spurn DC Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan  
gathered his belongings and moved to the nation's capital after his 
election in 1992. His family stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	Stupak and his wife Laurie, a councilwoman in their hometown of  
Menominee, already had agreed she and their two sons would not 
follow if he won. 
</P>
<P>
	``We figured that we would be apart either way and that it was  
better for us, better for the family, if the kids and I would 
remain in the district,'' said Laurie Stupak, now the mayor. ``It 
was less destructive to our family life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stupaks are hardly an anomaly. More and more, lawmakers'  
spouses are staying in their home states instead of moving to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Children, careers or contempt for the city keep some away, while  
lawmakers' regular weekend visits back to the district encourage 
others to stay put. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just don't move to Washington like they did,'' said  
Sandie Knollenberg, president of the Republican Congressional 
Spouses Club and wife of four-term Rep. Joseph Knollenberg, R-Mich. 
``That's been changing with the advent of working women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the congressional spouses are a television news anchor  
(Deborah Knapp Bonilla, wife of Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas); the 
president of the National First Ladies' Library (Mary Regula, wife 
of Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio); the chief executive officer of 
Washington's leading public broadcasting station (Sharon Percy 
Rockefeller, wife of Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.); and the 
chairman of RIF, a national literacy advocacy group (Lynda Johnson 
Robb, wife of Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va.) 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really become a very challenging issue, and I don't think  
there's any good answer,'' said Debbie Dingell, married to longtime 
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. ``It's very hard for spouses and 
families to travel back and forth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As reasons for the trend, she cited the pressure on members to  
be with their constituents and the difficulties of travel for 
spouses. Congress does not provide travel allowances for families, 
nor can spouses travel at government rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dingell, president of General Motors' philanthropic arm,  
observed that she also has begun to spend more time in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm John's eyes and ears in the district. I'm working there. I  
grocery shop there,'' she said. ``In many ways, the family keeps in 
touch with everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some husbands live outside of Washington, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Larry Lehrner, a kidney specialist, wed freshman Rep.  
Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., in May but stayed in Las Vegas because of 
the practice he shares with three endocrinologists and six other 
kidney doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell people that she has three reasons to come home every  
weekend,'' he said: ``First to see her two kids, second to see her 
constituents and third to see me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such arrangements generally are not the norm for senators, who  
usually are older, have grown children and serve longer terms -- six 
years vs. two years for House members. There are a few senatorial 
exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine GOP Sen. Olympia Snowe's husband, John McKernan Jr., the  
state's former governor, runs two companies based in Portland. 
Democratic Sen. Patty Murray's family returned to Seattle in 1995 
during her first term. 
</P>
<P>
	Some believe the dwindling physical presence of families and  
social opportunities in lawmakers' lives hurts interpersonal 
relations in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Families are the softening and the glue,'' said Mrs. Dingell.  
</P>
<P>
	Others said it would help Congress function better. ``It's hard  
to fight with your friends,'' said Mrs. Knollenberg, adding that 
families could benefit by moving to Washington. ``You will 
disagree, but you will do it in a nicer way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawn Gibbons said she tried life in Washington but returned to  
Reno, Nev., after three months. She blamed it on too many lonely 
Washington weekends with their son while her husband, GOP Rep. 
James Gibbons, went home to his constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just can't pick up an 11-year-old and go back and forth,''  
Mrs. Gibbons, a Nevada assemblywoman, explained. She said moving 
was ``kind of a shocker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept thinking, `What is normal here?''' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Stupak had been on the Menominee, Mich., city council for  
several years when her husband won the first of his four House 
terms. She stayed to fulfill her commitment to the city and to keep 
their sons in the same schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's worked very well for us that way,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> First Union Hiring 2,000 Tellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Banking giant First Union Corp. is hiring  
2,000 tellers in an admission it's misjudged how much customers 
want to see real people for their banking needs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Charlotte bank began the effort a few months ago and has  
hired about 1,000 tellers. First Union spokeswoman Allison Rash 
said Friday the bank now plans to hire at least 1,000 more tellers. 
Plans are to hire an undetermined additional number of sales 
specialists for the branches, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes after about 5,800 First Union workers were laid  
off in March. 
</P>
<P>
	First Union, which upset investors by twice reducing quarterly  
earnings estimates this year, laid off employees and cut costs in 
an effort to boost profits. The bank has struggled to absorb 
acquisitions including Philadelphia's CoreStates Financial Corp. 
and finance company The Money Store. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 2 percent of those laid off this year came from the  
bank's Future Bank branches, Rash said. 
</P>
<P>
	Future Bank is a First Union concept that relies heavily on  
technology such as personal computers, ATMs, the Internet and 
telephones to use fewer employees in each branch. Many of the 
employees rotate between a group of branches. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank sent many of the extra workers displaced by the concept  
to a central calling office in Charlotte. Now First Union 
management has found that even though customers don't need to come 
into a branch, they come in anyway and demand service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we value our customer relationships,'' Rash  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was well received by analysts.  
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence Cohn, an analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. said he thought  
the bank was just ``overzealous'' in their cost-cutting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did they manage this process properly? The answer is obviously  
not. It cost them money to lay people off. It's going to cost them 
again to hire people. Did they waste a lot of money in here? 
Absolutely,'' Cohn said. ``On the other hand it's an ongoing 
business and you've got to handle the business. They made a mistake 
and they recognize it.''

<HEADLINE> Cat Thief Wins Swaps Stakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Always a contender this year, Cat Thief  
finally won a race. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief hooked up with General Challenge in a stretch duel and  
won by a head Sunday in the $500,000 Swaps Stakes for 3-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Cat Thief's first victory since October. He had placed in  
five graded events this year, including seconds in the Fountain of 
Youth and Blue Grass Stakes and thirds in the Kentucky and Florida 
derbies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Pat Day, Cat Thief covered 1 1-8 miles in 1:47.87 and  
paid $7.60 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, 11th in the Kentucky Derby, returned $2.10  
under David Flores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were sitting right where we wanted, it was perfect,''  
Flores said. ``I thought I was going to go by Cat Thief at the 
quarter-pole, but the winner just kept on fighting and just never 
quit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walk That Walk and Corey Nakatani were another 11 lengths back  
in third. Desert Hero, 13th in the Kentucky Derby, was fourth under 
first-time rider Jerry Bailey. There was no show wagering on the 
four-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	Day sensed something in Cat Thief that the horse hadn't shown  
him in the Fountain of Youth and Florida Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made an excuse for him in the Fountain of Youth because I  
thought maybe he needed the race and had a license to get a little 
tired,'' Day said. ``But in the Florida Derby, when push came to 
shove, he didn't get it done and I felt like there was a little 
more there and he just wasn't giving it to me. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, he was tenacious. I don't think if we'd have gone  
around two more times the other horse was going to get by us,'' Day 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, who shipped to California from Kentucky in late June,  
prevailed in General Challenge's neighborhood. General Challenge 
came into the race undefeated in five California starts, including 
a 2-for-2 record at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who would've thought Cat Thief was going to run like that?''  
said Bob Baffert, trainer of General Challenge, who carried high 
weight of 122 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainer D. Wayne Lukas set a record with his fourth Swaps  
victory. His others were Victory Speech in 1996, Thunder Gulch in 
1995 and Clear Choice in 1986. He had been tied with Gary Jones at 
three. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a horse race. Pat Day rode him to perfection,'' Lukas  
said by phone from Keeneland, where he's attending the yearling 
sale. ``He was hooked every step of the way by a very good horse 
and still had something left to hold off a very good horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, who carried 120 pounds, sprinted to the early lead  
and eventually settled along the rail to set up the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought we had a real good chance going in,'' Lukas said.  
``General Challenge hadn't been able to beat him before. It was a 
very credible performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge stalked the pace early, put a head in front of  
Cat Thief in midstretch and then continued pressing to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of those races where the fans got their money's worth  
and I didn't get mine,'' Baffert said. ``We just got flat outrun. 
We had every chance to get by and we couldn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $300,000, increased Cat Thief's career  
earnings to $1.1 million, with three wins in 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Flores later found the winner's circle in the $300,000 Sunset  
Handicap, scoring an upset with Irish-bred Plicck. The winner paid 
$39.60, $14.60 and $6.60 and covered 1 1/2 miles on the turf in 
2:26.4. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion River Bay was second and paid $4.60 and  
$3.60, while Argentine-bred Lazy Lode was third and returned $4.20 
to show. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $100,000 Hollywood Juvenile Championship, Dixie Union and  
Alex Solis won by 1 1/4 lengths over Exchange Rate in 1:09.95 for six 
furlongs. The winner paid $3.40, $2.20 and $2.10 and is owned by 
Herman Sarkowsky, former co-owner of the Seattle Seahawks and 
Portland Trail Blazers. 
</P>
<P>
	Love That Red won the $100,000 Answer Do Stakes by 1 1/4 lengths  
over Men's Exclusive. The winner covered 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:15.06 and 
paid $4.80, $2.60 and $2.10.

<HEADLINE> Bookseller Collects Used Volumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The five dogs in John King's office are castoffs  
that lost an ear or an owner before landing in his care. 
</P>
<P>
	The canines fit neatly into King's secondhand empire of rare and  
used books. They get the same tender care and benefit from the same 
rule against throwing away anything of value, a rule that has 
allowed King to turn his collection, John K. King Books, into one 
of the nation's largest. 
</P>
<P>
	``John has that rescuer bent to him,'' says the store's  
assistant manager, Thomas Heitjan. ``He picks the dogs up off the 
street, the books that have no home, and the employees too. A lot 
of us couldn't find jobs in the real world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King's world includes as many as 1 million books housed in a  
converted glove factory, filling four stories in an industrial area 
near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	To it he draws customers ranging from wealthy bibliophiles to  
the merely curious. Aaron Stepien, of Dearborn, visits the 
bookstore about once a month. ``I come in with the intention of 
getting one or two books, and I end up leaving with a stack,'' he 
says. ``There's really no reason to go anywhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, who will only put his age in the late 40s, quit college to  
pursue his passion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some kids hang out at the graveyard. They become gravediggers.  
Some kids hang out at the dope dens. They become dope dealers. I 
hung out at used bookstores,'' he says. ``I respected the things I 
read. It was information that other people didn't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, a balding man with blond ringlets bumping his collar,  
roams the store and his office building behind it with a 
walkie-talkie and a bottle of Mountain Dew. The dozen or so staff 
members rely on walkie-talkies to find each other, allowing King to 
proudly claim ``the only radio-dispatched used bookstore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The store's exterior is worn like a battered paperback, and a  
soapy light seeps through plastic-covered windows onto hundreds of 
shelves 6 1/2 feet high -- enough to stretch four miles, King 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the concrete floor sport a '70s vintage pea-green  
carpet mended with duct tape. Milk crates from defunct dairies 
serve as storage bins and footstools. There's not a chromed 
espresso machine in sight. ``I don't want people spilling coffee 
all over the books,'' King says. 
</P>
<P>
	He also says he sells about a million books a year. Customers  
include other collectors as well as decorators who want the 
solemnity of books bound in leather. 
</P>
<P>
	On one typical spring day, Linda Snide of Lincoln Park roamed  
the fiction area. Like many other customers, Snide has her own 
collection that she supplements with regular visits to King's 
store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a book person,'' she says. ``I never fall asleep without a  
book. I love the textures, the smells of books, the feel of books. 
This is the perfect place to be. I could lose myself for a day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth Schubert and her brother, Bob Chase, browsed the cookbook  
section. Both are avid collectors in their own right -- Ms. 
Schubert, 80, has already arranged for her collection to go to 
Harvard when she dies. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase, who lives in Florida, calls King's prices and arrangement  
superior. ``We're usually satisfied if we walk into a bookstore and 
they have this many,'' he says, lining off about a third of the 
books King has on the topic. ``It's just sheer volume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King's office doubles as a showroom for rare and collectible  
books -- a much more presentable space full of gilded volumes, 
prints and history's flotsam. 
</P>
<P>
	About twice a year he publishes a catalog of his rare goods --  
not just books, but documents and photos, such as a signed 1941 
letter from Adolf Hitler to an officer. 
</P>
<P>
	His oldest book dates to 1478. The most expensive, a first  
edition of Samuel Johnson's English dictionary, lists for $12,500. 
Among the rarities is a limited edition of James Joyce's 
``Ulysses'' autographed by the illustrator, Henri Matisse, and 20 
or so books with ``fore-edge'' paintings on the vertical edges of 
the pages. 
</P>
<P>
	King and his crew scour other stores and estate sales, looking  
for bargains. Many people offer the store the odd collection of a 
deceased relative passionately interested in engineering, 
volunteering, mountaineering. Those discoveries are the kind King 
cherishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not like buying books from some warehouse,'' he says.  
``It's people who picked the books and read them and lived with 
them and learned from them. All their philosophies and all their 
thoughts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King relies on thousands of reference books for setting prices,  
and the research often pays for itself. The store once bought a 
book signed and dated by Carl Sandburg and Sinclair Lewis to 
someone named ``Gene.'' A quick check of Lewis' biography found 
that on the same date, the two writers visited socialist leader 
Eugene V. Debs in prison -- and King could double the book's price. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wonderful to know so many people throughout history  
signed a book, or touched a book,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the advent of the Internet, he says, that wonder is  
supporting fewer and fewer businesses. Now, King says, any ``scummy 
guy'' with a computer can check out the prices and information from 
a professional, then put his own goods online at lower prices 
without paying for the research -- or getting it right. 
</P>
<P>
	The store does put its rare-book catalog online and sells one to  
two books a day that way. Though King understands the challenge of 
his online competition, he has no plans to expand his Internet 
sales. He doesn't even want computers in his office -- preferring to 
collect IBM Selectric typewriters, kept near mementos of the 
now-defunct bookstores he roamed as a teen-ager.

<HEADLINE>  Berra Honored After 14-Year Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maybe Yogi Berra left a little magic on the  
glove he borrowed from Joe Girardi. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-three years ago, Berra caught Don Larsen's perfect game.  
On Sunday, he borrowed the glove to catch Larsen's ceremonial first 
toss. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recreated our game before, and he did it for real in the  
game,'' Berra said after David Cone's perfect game against 
Montreal. ``I'm glad we were all here for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were there to celebrate Yogi Berra Day, which not only  
honored the former Yankee player, coach and manager, but also 
publicly marked his reconciliation with owner George Steinbrenner 
after 14 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra had been back at Yankee Stadium this year to throw out the  
first pitch at the home opener, take part in Joe DiMaggio Day and 
watch other games. This time, he was the focus. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra was showered with gifts from the Yankees and applause from  
the fans. He was given a trip to Italy -- and a meeting with the 
Pope -- a 1998 World Series ring, a collection of rings from his 10 
championships as a player. He also received a framed jersey, the 
original 1951 World Series banner and $100,000 for his baseball 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Cone went out and matched what Larsen did to the Brooklyn  
Dodgers on Oct. 8, 1956, in Game 5 of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of broke down a little bit,'' Berra said. ``I heard a  
lot of pros and cons about whether I should come back. I'm glad we 
made up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the best part for Berra was seeing former teammates like  
Bobby Brown, Jerry Coleman, Whitey Ford, Larsen, Gil McDougald, 
Phil Rizzuto, Joe Pepitone and Bobby Richardson and former players 
like Mel Stottlemyre, Don Mattingly and Willie Randolph. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't tell me who was coming. It was great,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	After DiMaggio's death in March, Berra gained the unofficial  
title of the greatest living Yankee and was the biggest link to the 
team's dynasty in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joe DiMaggio was always the main stay at Old-Timers' Day and  
those events,'' said Richardson, who played with Berra and for him. 
``Yogi has taken over that role now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For 14 years, Berra had stayed away from the team he spent 17  
years with a player, then managed twice and coached. The whole 
thing started when Steinbrenner dispatched general manager Clyde 
King to fire Berra after a 6-10 start in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the home opener in April, the man who coined the phrase  
``it ain't over 'til it's over'' had stayed away from Yankee 
Stadium for any official event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been fired three times and twice was told by the owner,''  
Berra said. ``One time I wasn't. A manager is hired to be fired. I 
just wanted to hear it from the owner, not someone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berra and Steinbrenner reconciled in January and Berra is once  
again a prominent part of the Yankees. He visited the team in 
spring training and drops in on Yankees manager Joe Torre and the 
coaching staff just to talk baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he hadn't been away for so long it wouldn't be Yogi Berra  
Day,'' Torre said. ``Every day would have been Yogi Berra Day. Yogi 
is a major part of what this team is about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his time away from the Yankees, Berra coached for the  
Houston Astros, built his museum and occasionally showed up at 
Yankee Stadium early in the day -- before he could be noticed -- to 
visit friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what uniform you would see him in, he was always in  
a Yankee in my view,'' said Don Mattingly, who played for Berra in 
1984-85. ``I'm glad that he has settled his issues because this is 
where he belongs.''

<HEADLINE> Reagan Had Pen Pal for 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dozen lines Ronald Reagan scribbled from the  
set of a World War II propaganda movie in response to a fan letter 
from a 13-year-old Philadelphia girl began a pen pal relationship 
that lasted half a century. 
</P>
<P>
	As described in The New Yorker magazine, Reagan's letters  
offered intimate insights into his many incarnations: B-movie actor 
to Truman Democrat to labor activist to conservative politician to 
the president who chiseled his own chunk of mortar from the Berlin 
Wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine reports in the issue on newsstands Monday that  
Reagan's pen pal, Lorraine Wagner, saved 276 of Reagan's letters 
and cards and recently sold them to a Philadelphia-area autograph 
dealer, Steven Raab. The New Yorker said she wants the collection 
to end up in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters dealt candidly with both personal and professional  
matters -- both ups and downs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Reagan wrote of his desire to work out his marital problems  
with actress Jane Wyman, his first wife. ``Janie is still a pretty 
sick girl in mind, but I'm still hoping that things will be 
different when she gets over this nervousness,'' he wrote in answer 
to 18-year-old Lorraine's 1948 question about divorce rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--In the same year, he wrote of his great hopes for the country  
after Harry S. Truman's upset victory in the presidential election. 
``I'm sure Truman, with a Democratic congress, will do lots to make 
things better in every way, and what a landslide it was for him, 
the votes boy!'' 
</P>
<P>
	--The future president exulted at an impending visit to Los  
Angeles in 1950 by Lorraine and a Brooklyn, N.Y., friend, the 
international president of Reagan's fan club. ``Boy oh boy, wait 
till you see (the ranch) I bought,'' Reagan wrote. ``It's a honey, 
a great big ranch nearer the Ocean, swimming pool and everything. I 
feel like a kid with a new toy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--He kept a stiff upper lip when his movie career waned as  
younger actors became a new kind of leading man and he was 
relegated to fronting for a Las Vegas variety show. Doing casino 
monologues, he wrote to his friend in 1954, was like ``going over 
`Niagara Falls' in a tub,'' but ``the show is going over real 
big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters even touched on the mundane, such as his distaste of  
English weather. After filming World War II drama ``The Hasty 
Heart'' in ``damp foggy'' England in 1949, he wrote that he never 
wanted to work there again. ``Was I ever happy to reach the old 
USA. I hope I can stay in California the rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After becoming active in Republican politics, Reagan used  
Lorraine and her husband -- she married Navy veteran Elwood Wagner 
in 1954 -- to learn the candid perspectives of a middle-class 
American family, The New Yorker said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1964 election, he repeatedly wrote of the merits of  
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater, the GOP presidential candidate 
against President Johnson. Mrs. Wagner turned from leaning toward 
Johnson to voting for Goldwater, then jokingly chided Reagan for 
brainwashing her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't agree that you have been brainwashed,'' he wrote two  
days after the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do agree that you kept an open mind, looked at both sides  
and made a personal decision in the finest example of the tradition 
of our democracy. If we are to continue having freedom, it will be 
because of people like yourselves and not those who are just 
blindly going down the road, voting on the basis of who makes the 
most attractive promise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few years of their correspondence -- it ended in 1995  
with the announcement that Reagan has Alzheimer's disease -- Reagan 
often spoke of his pleasure at the fall of communism and the end of 
the Cold War. He wrote of his thrill at having lived to see the 
Berlin Wall torn down and, on a trip to Eastern Europe in 1990, how 
he carried a hammer to the wall and chiseled off his own chunk. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship began with a fan letter from a teen-ager to a  
movie star, answered as Reagan took a break from shooting Irving 
Berlin's ``This Is the Army.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It ended 52 years later, when 65-year-old Mrs. Wagner received  
the same farewell message from Reagan that was sent to thousands of 
friends to tell them of his Alzheimer's.

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr., Diana Remain in Their Prime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Their easy smiles and their glamorous lifestyles catapulted them  
to an unparalleled upper tier of fame -- a perch unusual even for 
this celebrity-obsessed nation. Somehow, these two were different. 
</P>
<P>
	She was an actual princess; he was the closest thing this  
country had to a prince. America's tragedy was his personal loss; 
her private trials became public obsessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It kind of seems like Princess Diana all over again,'' said  
Melissa Monahan, 23, of Dumont, N.J., visiting the flower-festooned 
stoop outside John F. Kennedy Jr.'s lower Manhattan loft Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana and JFK Jr., whose superstar allure made them objects of  
desire, whose sorrows made them seem accessible, lived different 
lives under very different circumstances. Yet each of them -- tragic 
young people who lived well and were lost abruptly -- represents the 
pinnacle of enduring celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a 20th-century phenomenon, driven by movies, television and  
now cyberspace, born with the likes of Rudolph Valentino and Jean 
Harlow, refined with James Dean and Marilyn Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood created the star machine; then the rest of the world  
went Hollywood. During the tumult of the 1960s, Jack and Bobby 
Kennedy, Malcolm X and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. became a new 
kind of celebrity that blended achievement and allure. Their 
assassinations ensured it would last forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so for many young superstars, who tarnish with age. The  
corpulent Marlon Brando will never eclipse the forever lanky Dean, 
and Monroe has far more staying power than an Alzheimer's-stricken 
Rita Hayworth ever will. 
</P>
<P>
	Now JFK Jr. and Diana are frozen in that video-age amber, their  
legacy an archive's worth of images ready for eternal playback on 
TV and the Net, showing them forever in their prime, the ordinary 
and the extraordinary in one slick package. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're living in a time when the machines of mythology are more  
powerful and pervasive than ever,'' said Art Simon, author of 
``Dangerous Knowledge: The JFK Assassination in Art and Film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Diana and JFK Jr. were easy sells, examples of historian  
Daniel J. Boorstin's 1961 definition of celebrity as ``someone 
known for their well-knownness.'' They sold well: Diana has been on 
the cover of People magazine 50 times, JFK Jr. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The lovely Diana was the ideal royalty for a talk-show culture  
that demands accessibility with its pipe dreams. She was divorced. 
She fought bulimia. Her blemishes showed through the glitz but 
never overshadowed it. Her mother-in-law, the queen, traveled in 
limos; Diana kissed AIDS patients. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr.'s very lineage ensured him a place. He was the namesake  
and most visible vestige of Camelot, of a time and a presidency 
that may not have been innocent but is remembered that way. 
</P>
<P>
	But while his parents were patricians who appealed to common  
folk, he was a self-styled commoner who, though a Kennedy, favored 
Rollerblading around his neighborhood and throwing Frisbees around 
Central Park. Jackie Onassis might well sweep into the Four Seasons 
behind oversized sunglasses; her son favored breakfast at Bubby's, 
a corner restaurant in his Tribeca neighborhood. Like Diana, he 
stooped to conquer, and it was captivating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was saying to myself, 'Why are you feeling like it was your  
loss? Why is it so painful?''' said Lavonne Smith, 43, of Chicago. 
``That's the way it was with Princess Di -- all weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, people said, he was a celebrity, but so many likened him to  
a little brother or a son or a regular guy. He seemed the nation's 
property: They took his father away, people said, so he belonged to 
us. Much like the language that British and Americans alike used 
when Diana died. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the times that we see them, they're doing something  
that Joe American would do,'' said Matt Hogge, a 24-year-old 
chemical engineer from Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, JFK Jr. was never one of us; he was the son of a mythic  
president just as 17-year-old Prince William is the son of a real 
princess who will spend his life living up to her memory. In an 
interview just before her death in an August 1997 car crash, Diana 
suggested the younger Kennedy's approach to fame might be a useful 
model for her son, a future king. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want William to be able to handle things as well as John  
does,'' she told The New Yorker. 
</P>
<P>
	Then she died, and joined the ranks of the famous who never grow  
old, who become blank slates for an endless list of dreams. 
</P>
<P>
	``With both of them, there was so much room to project and  
imagine anything you wanted,'' said Simon, the author. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could project a future political candidate. You could  
project a great lover and romancer of women. You could project a 
down-to-earth guy. You could write a dozen biographies without even 
knowing the guy,'' Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, he's a receptacle for a lot of fantasies. That's  
what Diana was, too. And that may be the perfect definition of the 
ultimate celebrity.''

<HEADLINE> Frenchman Collapses at British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Jean Van de Velde teetered on the  
brink of collapse the entire British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	When it finally came, it was spectacular.  
</P>
<P>
	In a bizarre 18th hole performance that had spectators covering  
their eyes in anguish, Van de Velde went from sure winner to 
eventual playoff loser in seven shocking strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Needing only a double bogey to win, the Frenchman who had made  
so many miraculous saves all week unraveled in a shocking 
combination of bad shots and poor decisions. Thousands crowding the 
18th green could only murmur in sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
	Wielding a 2-iron to finish in style when he should have been  
laying up to protect a lead, Van de Velde blew a three-stroke lead 
on the final hole to cost him the title he was never supposed to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even go for the glory. That wasn't even glory,'' Van  
de Velde said. ``That wasn't something absolutely bad I was trying 
to do. You know, it just came out to be a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The engraver had already started putting Van de Velde's name on  
the championship claret jug when it all disintegrated in the space 
of 487 torturous yards. 
</P>
<P>
	It may have been the greatest collapse in major championship  
golf history. It was certainly the most stunning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I blew it on 18,'' Van de Velde said. ``But there are  
worse things in life. Some terrible things are happening to other 
people. It's only a golf tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A hole that began innocently enough with a pushed tee shot spun  
out of control with a horrible decision to go for the green with a 
2-iron from 189 yards instead of laying up safely with a pitching 
wedge and then going for the green in three from the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
	It ended with Van de Velde needing to sink an 8-footer for a  
triple bogey seven just to get into the playoff won by Paul Lawrie. 
</P>
<P>
	In between, Van de Velde hit a grandstand and he hit it in the  
water. He hit it into the deep rough and he hacked it into a 
greenside bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see him just throwing the tournament away,'' playing  
partner Craig Parry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde even climbed down the rock wall of the Barry Burn,  
stripped his shoes and socks off, and contemplated a miracle shot 
from the water. It seemed as if he was determined to go up in 
flames, but by the time he got down to the ball the water had risen 
and he abandoned that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could see the ball sinking and saying, `Not for you  
today,''' Van de Velde said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a chaotic end to a round Van de Velde had somehow held  
together with the magic of his putter while only hitting five 
fairways. 
</P>
<P>
	As he stepped on the tee, he saw 487 yards of terror, with deep  
rough on the left and a ditch known as the Barry Burn snaking its 
way down both sides of the hole and in front of the green. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also could have hit wedges all the way down the hole and  
still won. He only needed six, not four. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next time, maybe I'll hit the wedge and you will all forgive  
me,'' Van de Velde said. ``I knew all I needed was a five or six. 
But one thing you learn in golf, though, is nothing is done until 
you make the last putt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde pulled out a driver, his first bad decision, but  
one that didn't hurt after the ball came to rest right of the 
fairway on a grass peninsula surrounded by the Barry Burn. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the decision that cost him the tournament. His 2-iron  
was pushed and headed for the grandstand, hitting it and bouncing 
back off the rock wall of the Barry Burn about 50 yards from the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	The ditch was still between him and the green, though, and his  
third shot, a wedge, barely got out of the deep rough and plopped 
into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	After going into the ditch barefoot, with water up to his  
calves, Van de Velde dropped back in the rough and hit again, now 
his fifth shot with the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	This one landed in the greenside bunker, where Parry already was  
in two. Parry hit next, holing his shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about you following me into the hole?'' he asked Van de  
Velde. 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde didn't, but knocked it about eight feet away. He  
then calmly stepped up and made the put, shaking his fist in a 
combination of anger and relief. He yelled at the offending ball, 
then heaved it into the water it had just come from. 
</P>
<P>
	There was still a playoff ahead, but Van de Velde was done. It  
showed when he hit a horrendous drive off the first playoff hole 
deep into a thicket of bushes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me awhile to swallow it,'' he said. ``I hit a shocking  
drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van de Velde's wife, Brigitte, who had followed him the entire  
day, was standing on a milkbox to peer over the crowd as her 
husband fell apart. 
</P>
<P>
	The advice she had wanted to give him at lunch that day but  
didn't dare say would have proved helpful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thinking if you have a one- or two-shot lead, don't go  
for the green,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brigitte was smiling and happy, as was her husband, despite  
losing the opportunity of a career in which the 1993 Roma Masters 
was his only win. Only his caddy was mad, with the two exchanging a 
few words. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't have to focus on the bad things that happened,'' Van  
de Velde said. ``There's a lot of good things that happened this 
week, too. Besides, who will remember any of this in 200 years?''

<HEADLINE> Delay Placed JFK Jr. at Risk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The sky was hazy and growing dark when John F.  
Kennedy Jr. set out over the sea in his small plane -- conditions 
that would have made it difficult for even the most veteran pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	According to at least one family friend, it wasn't supposed to  
happen that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy had intended to make a daytime flight Friday but was  
delayed when his sister-in-law couldn't leave work early enough and 
he hit traffic coming out of New York, the friend, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	For a relatively inexperienced pilot like Kennedy, without the  
training to rely solely on instruments in bad weather, it may have 
been an ill-advised idea to set out as darkness fell, many flight 
experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pointing toward open ocean on a nearly moonless night, that  
has tripped up pilots for a long, long time,'' said Drew Steketee, 
senior vice president of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots 
Association. ``Flying at night requires more vigilance. Flying at 
night over ocean, the risks go up more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the investigation has only begun, and there is no  
indication that the crash resulted from poor training or 
decision-making by Kennedy. Crashes can also result from mechanical 
failure, fuel problems or other factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Aboard the plane with Kennedy were his wife, Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette, a New York investment 
banker. 
</P>
<P>
	No flight plan was filed to detail Kennedy's route to the island  
of Martha's Vineyard, and he did not request air traffic control 
assistance along the way. Flying without a flight plan or radar 
assistance isn't unusual for flights conducted under ``visual 
flight rules'' -- flights that take place in good weather, with the 
pilot keeping track of his own position and nearby aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	What was known is that he left Fairfield, N.J., at 8:38 p.m.  
Friday with visibility reported at 4 to 5 miles. His flight path 
took him over the Connecticut shore, and after passing over the 
southwestern tip of Rhode Island at 9:26 p.m., the plane headed 
toward Martha's Vineyard, said Robert Pearce, chief investigator 
for the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was at 5,600 feet when it headed out over the ocean.  
At 9:40 p.m., about 17 to 18 miles west of Martha's Vineyard, it 
was at 2,500 feet. When it was last detected, 29 seconds later, it 
was at 1,800 feet, about 16 1/2 miles west of the Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's pretty far out to be that low,'' said Michael Barr,  
director of the aviation safety program at the University of 
Southern California and an experienced fighter pilot. ``Most likely 
it was one continuous descent after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Kennedy's craft could handle such a rapid a descent if  
flown under control, Barr said planes of that type usually descend 
at half that rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service reported that haze cut visibility  
to about 6 miles at the Martha's Vineyard Airport, where he was 
supposed to drop off Lauren Bessette and then head for Cape Cod for 
the wedding of his cousin Rory Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was clear. They were definitely landing visually (without  
instruments),'' said Adam Budd, a ramp attendant working on the 
Martha's Vineyard Airport runway when Kennedy's plane was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Bob Arnot, chief medical correspondent for NBC, said  
visibility that night was limited by haze as he passed about 3 
miles south of the Vineyard just after 9 p.m. He had to rely on 
instruments to land at the nearby island of Nantucket, where he 
vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just black,'' Arnot said. ``You couldn't see Martha's  
Vineyard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instruments include devices to locate airports, to maintain  
specific courses and speeds and to find the correct direction and 
angle to specific runways. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for experienced pilots, flying at night over ocean is a  
tricky proposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``He set himself up into a very bad corner by flying over the  
ocean at sunset, in the haze,'' Barr said. ``I always said it's 
like flying in an eggshell, everything just blended together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At night, over water, with just a sliver of moon, the horizon  
can be impossible to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``In layman's language, you can't tell which way is up,''  
Steketee said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to newspaper reports, Kennedy, 38, had flown 100 to  
200 hours since getting his license. When he passed his pilot's 
exam 15 months ago, Kennedy had 92 hours of flight time -- more than 
double the 40 hours most test takers have, said John McColgan, a 
Federal Aviation Administration examiner who tested Kennedy after 
he took a pilot's course at the Flight Safety Academy in Vero 
Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	He passed with flying colors, McColgan said, and was licensed to  
fly by visual flight rules.

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr. Search Anything But Routine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The Kennedy family wanted to keep it relatively  
routine. But the search for the single-engine plane that 
disappeared over the Atlantic with John F. Kennedy Jr. inside was 
anything but that. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House ``situation room'' was alerted. Federal  
transportation officials swung into action, and sophisticated 
military equipment was brought to the waters off Martha's Vineyard. 
Several Clinton administration cabinet members, including the 
secretary of defense, were rousted from their beds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The same amount of effort would have been expended for an  
average citizen,'' said Capt. Sandy Troeber of the Air Force's 
rescue coordination center in Virginia. ``Every life is as 
important as the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Coast Guard says it has ``no set protocol'' -- no  
benchmark on how to react when a civilian's small plane vanishes or 
goes down. ``Every case is different,'' said Petty Officer Virginia 
Adams. ``I can't give you a specific.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The search for Kennedy, his wife and her sister, last seen  
departing New Jersey for the Vineyard on Friday night, began when 
the Coast Guard received a call from a family friend saying the 
plane was late. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard officials called the FAA and the Air Force Rescue  
Coordination Center at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Va., the 
unit that coordinates searches throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force notified the White House at about 5 a.m., and some  
Cabinet members -- including the transportation and defense 
secretaries -- were alerted, said White House spokesman Jake 
Siewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours, a Coast Guard jet and two Coast Guard helicopters  
were launched and an Air Force plane was transformed into an aerial 
command post. Soon, 15 more small planes manned by volunteers from 
the Civil Air Patrol, the Air Force auxiliary organization, were 
dispatched to help. 
</P>
<P>
	By mid-Saturday, more than a dozen Coast Guard vessels had  
joined the search, along with Civil Air Patrols from six states. 
</P>
<P>
	Several sophisticated federal research vessels capable of  
undersea searches sailed to the scene from Montauk, N.Y., including 
one that surveys the ocean floor for the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	After night fell Saturday, Air National Guard helicopters  
equipped with infrared temperature sensors continued searching in 
the dark. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton called a Boston Coast Guard command center  
Saturday night and was ``very concerned,'' said Coast Guard Rear 
Adm. Richard Larrabee, who spoke Sunday to Massachusetts Gov. Paul 
Cellucci about the search. 
</P>
<P>
	The family is communicating with government officials through  
Housing and Urban Affairs Secretary Andrew Cuomo, who is married to 
Kerry Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the head of the National Transportation Safety Board  
was flown to Massachusetts to set up a headquarters for the 
investigation and a command post was set up at Otis Air Force Base 
on Cape Cod to coordinate activities by the Coast Guard, Navy, 
NTSB, NOAA, Federal Aviation Administration and state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerned about receiving preferential treatment, the Kennedy  
family had asked the government to keep its reaction relatively 
routine, government sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Some involved in the search bristled at the suggestion that the  
Kennedys were getting extra attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been asking me that all day,'' said Lt. Col. Don  
Desfosse, an Air Force auxiliary pilot who spent Sunday patrolling 
the air west of the Vineyard. ``I'm out there to find somebody, and 
hopefully to find them and save them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is difficult to find a similar situation to use as a  
benchmark. In June 1997, when a helicopter carrying four Coast 
Guard crewmen crashed off the California coast, an around-the-clock 
search was called off after four days. The search involved four 
cutters, a helicopter and a plane.

<HEADLINE> Davis Cup Veterans Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLINE, Mass. (AP) -- Some were old and gray. Others looked  
ready to play. They were Davis Cup veterans who stood where it all 
began to celebrate a century of international tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very grateful they remembered the people who played in the  
Davis Cup years ago,'' said Jack Kramer, who played for the United 
States in 1939 and 1946-47. ``It sure was a marvelous group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From 87-year-old Sidney Wood, who played for the United States  
in 1931 and '34, to MaliVai Washington, who last played in 1997, 
the players lined up behind the cup itself and U.S. and Australian 
flags. The two countries finished their Davis Cup quarterfinal with 
singles matches Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Americans in the ceremony included Tat Bartzen, Robert  
Seguso, Tom Gorman, Aaron Krickstein, Gardner Mulloy, Robert Perry, 
Ham Richardson and Tony Trabert. Australians Ken McGregor, Fred 
Stolle and Frank Sedgman also took part. 
</P>
<P>
	Some, like 84-year-old grand slam winner Don Budge, skipped the  
ceremony because of the 100-plus degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Davis Cup was founded in 1900 when recent Harvard graduate  
Dwight Davis commissioned a trophy for $750 and challenged England 
to a three-day tie at the Longwood Cricket Club. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just like it was back in 1938,'' said the 78-year-old  
Kramer, who won three national doubles titles here. 
</P>
<P>
	A common theme this week is the drop in stature of the Davis Cup  
as it competes with individual tournaments offering big prize 
money. This year, the two top American singles players -- Pete 
Sampras and Andre Agassi -- both balked initially before Sampras 
changed his mind and decided to play doubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to see them get 100 percent participation,'' Kramer  
said. ``I think the Cup deserves that.''

<HEADLINE> Aerial Search for JFK Jr. Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- A vast aerial search of the sea off  
Martha's Vineyard resumed Sunday after Coast Guard cutters 
overnight found no signs of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
	Their plane was reported missing off the shores off the resort  
island early Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard Falcon jet took off about 6 a.m. to begin the  
daytime search and assess weather conditions, said Coast Guard 
Chief Petty Officer Dennis Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	An hour earlier, authorities began combing the beach on  
all-terrain vehicles looking for any signs of the plane or its 
passengers that may have washed ashore, state police Lt. Richard 
Kelley said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, police Capt. Robert Bird appealed to the  
public to turn over any debris that might be related to the crash, 
noting that holding on to such evidence is a criminal offense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can be an essential part of this investigation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bird also said crews are likely to search for debris on an  
island known as Nomans Land, a former military site about 3 1/2 miles 
southwest of Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	A daylong search Saturday yielded plane fragments, a  
prescription bottle belonging to Kennedy's wife and a piece of 
baggage belonging to his sister-in-law, but no signs of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard cutters using bright lights and a sonar-equipped  
ship searched overnight, but three helicopters and an Air National 
Guard C-130 airplane were grounded early Sunday because of low 
haze. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Rear Adm. Richard Larrabee, interviewed Sunday on  
ABC's ``This Week,'' said the search with sonar was hampered by 
``the very rocky bottom that complicates the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larrabee was among several officials connected with the search  
who said they still hoped to find the plane's passengers alive. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a news conference at 9 a.m. Sunday, Larrabee noted that  
the water temperature is 68 degrees and ``the survivability in 
those temperatures has been exceeded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33,  
and his sister-in-law, Lauren Bessette, departed Friday night from 
Fairfield, N.J., to Cape Cod for the wedding of his cousin Rory, 
daughter of the late Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, at Hyannis Port. The 
wedding was postponed -- replaced with prayers for the missing. 
</P>
<P>
	A family friend said Lauren Bessette was to be dropped off at  
the Vineyard before Kennedy and his wife continued on to Hyannis 
Port. Another friend reported the plane missing to the Coast Guard 
about 2:15 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At Philbin Beach in Aquinnah -- the portion of the Vineyard  
popularly known as Gay Head -- a wheel, a headrest and part of a 
plane support known as a strut had washed up, said Coast Guard Lt. 
Craig Jaramillo. A black bag with Lauren Bessette's name on it also 
was found. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA reported the last contact with the plane was at 9:39  
p.m. Friday during its final approach to the airport on the island 
off Cape Cod. Radar records showed the plane's last known location 
was about 17 miles southwest of the Vineyard.

	John Fish, a sonar expert with Cape Cod-based American  
Underwater Search and Survey, said water depths range from 84 to 
120 feet in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The seabed is flat, sugar sand, fine sand. There are no  
canyons that would hide wreckage,'' Fish said. However, he said 
shadows from boulders and debris from about 20 shipwrecks in the 
area could hinder the search. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy recently acquired the single-engine, six-seat Piper  
Saratoga II HP -- a plane known in the aviation industry as a 
high-performance airplane with a good safety record. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, flying it at night, in a hazy sky and under visual  
flight rules -- the reported conditions Friday night -- is 
challenging. Kennedy had obtained his pilot's license last year, 
but he was not licensed to fly on instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's disappearance came one day before the 30th  
anniversary of the Chappaquiddick incident, in which Sen. Edward 
Kennedy's car went off a bridge, killing passenger Mary Jo Kopechne 
on a tiny island adjacent to Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
	Universally known as ``John John,'' Kennedy has lived entirely  
in the public eye, from his birth shortly after his father's 
election as the nation's 35th president, to his poignant salute on 
the day of his namesake's funeral, to his romances with Daryl 
Hannah and Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
	A former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, he launched  
his own political magazine, George, in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	He was wed Sept. 21, 1996, to Bessette Kennedy, a former  
publicist for fashion designer Calvin Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	Lauren Bessette, who is 18 months older than Carolyn, worked as  
an investment banker in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Caroline Kennedy, the only other survivor of the young family  
that transfixed the world four decades ago, was on a rafting trip 
out West, CNN reported.

<HEADLINE> Fight for Control of Phone Cos. Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two rival telecommunications companies ended  
their five-week takeover fight for control of U S West Inc. and 
Frontier Corp. with each declaring victory. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, a Denver-based local phone company, will merge with  
Qwest Communications International Inc. in a stock swap worth $34.7 
billion, or $69 a share, while Frontier Corp., a Rochester, 
N.Y.-based local and long-distance company, will be acquired by 
Global Crossing Ltd. for $10.9 billion, or $63 a share, in stock, 
the companies announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Qwest and Global Crossing are building worldwide  
fiber-optic cable networks to give customers high-speed Internet 
access. The rivals both wanted the customers and revenues of U S 
West and Frontier to make their networks profitable. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing this whole episode will do is educate people,  
investors that yes, it's wonderful to have a state-of-the-art, 
almost science-fiction quality network, but you need customers on 
that,'' said Peter Treadway, an analyst with Ryan, Beck-Southeast 
Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing had formed deals with U S West and Frontier, but  
Qwest trumped them with higher offers. 
</P>
<P>
	For both Qwest and Global Crossing to declare victory, each  
company had to compromise. Qwest withdrew its bid for Frontier, and 
Global Crossing reduced the breakup fee U S West had to pay for 
backing out of its deal. U S West will now pay a $420 million 
penalty, instead of $850 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frontier is worth a lot more to Global Crossing than it is to  
Qwest,'' Treadway said. ``Frontier provides Global Crossing with a 
nationwide fiber-optic backbone, which Qwest already has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Global Crossing wasn't prepared to escalate the bidding war  
for U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to shareholders, Bob Annunziata, chief executive  
officer of Global Crossing, said he would not raise his offer for U 
S West. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not believe your best interests would be served by  
increasing our bid by an additional premium of approximately $5 
billion in order to match or exceed the competing offer,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Clayton, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Frontier, will become a vice chairman of Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts and investors have raised the possibility that  
Qwest only bid for Frontier as a cutthroat bargaining ploy. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could easily draw the conclusion that Qwest's bid from day  
one had a diversionary element to it,'' Treadway said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's chairman and chief executive officer, Joseph Nacchio,  
maintains that its offer was in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was interested, I was sincere, my shareholders, to be  
perfectly frank weren't all that interested in Frontier,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock has been hammered since the company announced its  
offers for the two companies. The shares closed Friday at $35 a 
share, off 22 percent from its pre-bid price. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest now gets U S West's customers in 14 west and midwest  
states. The combined company will keep the Qwest name, but both 
companies will have equal representation on the 14-member board of 
directors. The combined company will pay a 5 cent annual dividend. 
U S West currently pays $2.16 a year, while Qwest pays none. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Qwest and U S West are both based in Denver, the  
companies should be able to save more money but cutting additional 
costs. And while Colorado politicians supported a Qwest-U S West 
combination, which would keep the headquarters in the state, the 
labor union has voiced opposition fearing the companies will slash 
more jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nacchio said, ``I expect a minimal impact on the employee  
base.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Executives expect the deal to close in mid-2000, pending  
regulatory and shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Solomon Trujillo, chairman, president and chief executive  
officer of U S West will become a co-chairman of Qwest and 
president of the combined company's Internet, local and wireless 
businesses. That position is better than the vice-chairman's seat 
he was originally offered. 
</P>
<P>
	Nacchio will keep the titles of chairman and chief executive  
officer of Qwest. So, while structured as a merger of equals, 
Nacchio will have the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very clear when you think about operating the company  
you've got to have one person in charge of how the business is run, 
and that person is Joe,'' Trujillo said.

<HEADLINE>  Larsen Relives Yankees History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pitching a perfect game doesn't mean you've ever  
seen one. So, Don Larsen decided to stick around at Yankee Stadium 
just in case. 
</P>
<P>
	Good call.  
</P>
<P>
	After he recreated his own perfect day before Sunday's game,  
Larsen sat back and watched David Cone pitch the 14th perfect game 
in modern history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see mine,'' Larsen said of his perfect game against  
Brooklyn in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series -- the only one in 
Series history. ``How could I? I was working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen was at Yankee Stadium for Yogi Berra Day and even threw  
out the first pitch to Berra, his catcher for the game in 1956. He 
planned to watch a few innings before heading back to his hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed as soon as he saw Cone pitch.  
</P>
<P>
	``As time went on, it was still a perfect game. I would have had  
to have been silly to leave then,'' Larsen said. ``I'm glad I came 
to see it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For more than 40 years, Larsen was the only Yankee to pitch a  
perfect game. Now he is linked to the only other two Yankees to do 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Larsen went to the same high school, Point Loma in San Diego, as  
David Wells, who achieved perfection on May 17, 1998, against 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	And he was the last person to talk to Cone and touch him before  
Cone threw his perfect game against the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shook hands before I threw out the first pitch and I wished  
him good luck,'' Larsen said. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game, they embraced, forever linked in baseball  
history. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pretty smooth,'' Larsen said of Cone. ``He had total  
command of his pitches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Larsen watched Cone breeze through the Expos lineup, it was  
only natural to reflect back to 1956. He recalled a catch Mickey 
Mantle made in left-center field that would have been a home run in 
any other park, and he remembered Berra leaping into his arms after 
the final out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't woken up since then,'' Larsen said. ``I thought  
about my day a lot. I'm sure David is going to think about this 
every day of his life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Yankees greats were on hand Sunday, as the team  
relived and later made history. 
</P>
<P>
	Berra was honored after his 14-year feud with owner George  
Steinbrenner ended in January. Also on hand were Phil Rizzuto, 
Whitey Ford, Jerry Coleman and Bobby Richardson, who all played for 
New York in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recreated our game before and he did it for real in the  
game,'' Berra said. ``I'm glad we were all here for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Announcer Bob Wolff, who called Larsen's game on TV, was in the  
press box to watch Cone's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was rising and falling with the waves of the crowd,'' Wolff  
said. ``It was just like 1956.''
