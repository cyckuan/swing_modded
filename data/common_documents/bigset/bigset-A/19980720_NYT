O'MEARA JOINS GOLF'S ROYALS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ It isn't often you get three champions in a
single golf tournament, but it felt that way Sunday during the
British Open ceremony. Brian Watts became legitimate, Justin Rose
won over a nation, and Mark O'Meara became a true master of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In a performance that did justice to the tournament's great
tradition, O'Meara scored a two-shot victory over Watts Sunday in a
four-hole playoff at Royal Birkdale. It won't go down as one of the
great finishes, for Watts was a virtual unknown who found a little
too much rough and sand in the end. But a different form of history
was involved Sunday, one that lifted O'Meara into some very
exclusive company.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the Masters and the British Open in the same year,
O'Meara joined a Hall of Fame list of six players _ Ben Hogan,
Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, Tom Watson and Nick
Faldo _ in the postwar era. That's the jump O'Meara made this week.
He went from good ol' Mark, finally breaking through in a major at
the age of 41, to a man who can break his opponents' hearts
anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As the week progressed, and Royal Birkdale unleashed its
distinctive brand of torment, Augusta seemed far, far away. You
just couldn't imagine a greater contrast of world-class courses.
The damage here was almost unbelievable at times: A round of 82 for
Nick Price, an 85 for Phil Mickelson. Lee Janzen: 11-over for the
tournament. Defending champion Justin Leonard: 18-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the toughest course I've ever played,'' said
Janzen. `
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was just in the practice rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of 72 holes, O'Meara and Watts were at even-par 280,
the first time that had occurred at the British since Greg Norman's
victory at Turnberry in '86. Watts' day ended in defeat, but this
week was a career breakthrough for him. After years of hard work on
the Japanese tour, he pocketed $329,000 for second place _ and a
guarantee of getting a U.S. tour card, if he wants it, for next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had told me I'd be in a playoff for the championship at
the start of the week, I wouldn't have believed you,'' said Watts.
``I'm disappointed I didn't win, but I'm very proud of myself.
Hopefully I've gained some respect _ and some respect for the
Japanese tour, as well. People don't realize the caliber of play we
have over there.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, meanwhile, made history on many fronts. He became the
oldest player in the modern era to win two majors in the same year
(Nicklaus and Hogan did it at the age of 40). And he broke the
streak of 15 consecutive majors being won by different people. When
the PGA arrives in Seattle next month, it won't seem like another
crapshoot that could go any old way. They'll all be chasing
O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he wasn't going to make any mistakes out there,'' said
Tiger Woods, whose spectacular birdie-birdie finish gave him a 66
and sole possession of third place at 1-over 281. ``He made the big
putts at the Masters, and he did it again here. The guy is so
capable of gutting it out and winning championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose fell two shots short of that playoff, finishing in a tie
for fourth at 2-over with Jim Furyk, Jesper Parnevik and Raymond
Russell, a mostly unsuccessful European Tour player who came home
with a final-round 66. But around England, where Rose grew up and
learned the game, they'll remember this as Justin's tournament.
Just 17, he outplayed some heavy hitters _ David Duval, Ernie Els,
Fred Couples and Payne Stewart, just to name a few _ in his last
tournament as an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Rose shot an impressive 69 Sunday, with the weight of his
country's expectations riding heavily on his shoulders, and he
holed a 45-yard pitch shot at the very public 18th green _ the shot
of the tournament, to say nothing of the loudest roar.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole week has been really special for me, unbelievable as
well,'' said Rose, who registered the highest British Open finish
by an amateur since American Frank Stranahan tied for second in
1953. ``With the incredible support I got, I never had time to be
nervous. The other day I imagined myself as Jack Nicklaus coming up
that 18th fairway, for some silly reason. To finish like I did
today and hear that crowd, it was just superb.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of British observers think Rose is too young to turn
pro, but it's too late to argue. He confirmed Sunday that he will
enter the upcoming Dutch Open as a professional. ``I made my
decision just now, today,'' he said. ``It's something I'm not going
to regret one bit.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the 18th hole rolled around for the second time
Sunday _ the last of the four playoff holes _ O'Meara was in an
enviable form of cruise control. ``Coming up that fairway,'' said
his caddie, Jerry Higginbotham, ``Mark turned to me and said, `I
can't believe how calm I am. I've (begin ital) never (end ital)
been this calm.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `That's OK, Mark, I'm nervous enough for the two
of us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara clinched the playoff with a very professional par,
drilling a 4-iron onto the fringe, lagging a 20-footer to within
three feet and calmly knocking it home. That was the story of his
day: Straight down the middle, no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Watts had reached the playoff with an epic bunker shot on 18,
getting it to within one foot to the delight and amazement of
everyone. ``Absolutely as good a shot as I've ever seen with that
kind of pressure,'' said O'Meara. Watts seemed to have been blessed
by fairy dust over the last three days, exempt from the horrors
affecting everyone else. But when the playoff began, his game
finally unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   On the first playoff hole, 15, Watts missed a five-foot birdie
putt while O'Meara was sinking his (from six feet). On 17, Watts'
drive left him with a hillside-rough lie so difficult, he was lucky
to float it back onto the fairway. He made a wonderful, scrambling
par on that hole to stay one shot down, but when his second shot on
18 found the bunker, he had run out of miracles. Knowing he had to
sink the shot, he ran it some 30 feet past _ ``I wasn't going to
leave it short'' _ and there went the drama.
</P>
<P>
   But not the history. Moments later, as O'Meara held aloft the
old Claret Jug, he told the crowd that the British Open is the
``most special tournament'' to him, more so than the Masters or the
U.S. Open. That brought a thunderous roar, for O'Meara truly
understood the challenge of Birkdale, and what it meant to play
championship golf there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredibly gratifying to sit here and know my name is on
that trophy,'' he said. ``I think I'm a very nice player, a good
player. I mean, this is my 18th year on the tour. I don't consider
myself a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   What he accomplished Sunday, however, was the stuff of
greatness. The 127th British Open went to a man quite worthy of the
honor.

MR. STEADY MORE ELECTRIC THAN WATTS 
BY BRUCE JENKINS
</HEADLINE>
 COMMENTARY-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ This thing was going to end on the 18th
hole if it killed them. The British Open's four-hole playoff would
finish at 18, and if Mark O'Meara and Brian Watts were still tied,
they'd go play No. 18 again. And again. They'd play the 18th until
the sun went down, if they had to.
</P>
<P>
   Great format, by the way. It was the only way to go. For the
thousands of fans perched around the 18th green Sunday, there were
enough memories to last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Tiger Woods win the tournament there? It certainly seemed
that way for a while. Woods had some awful moments along the way, a
lot of missed putts and that third-round 77, but his reputation
took some massive strides Sunday. He showed he could play links
golf, with its narrow fairways and shin-deep rough, with the best
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' final two holes Sunday were chills-down-the-spine
material. He had two murderous shots that, to stay in contention,
he absolutely had to make. First came a 30-yard chip on 17th, and
he nailed that. Then came a 30-foot putt on 18, which he sank with
his trademark fist-pumping style, and the place went crazy. It
wasn't the Masters, but then again, he won that one in a runaway.
This was clutch, exciting golf on a course that sent some
world-class players into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   So now there was Tiger's good friend, Mark O'Meara, coming up to
18. O'Meara doesn't charm the press with nutty witticisms, but he
is vintage professional golf. He looks like a guy out of the old
``Wonderful World of Golf'' series, standing on some exotic course
with Jimmy Demaret, Billy Casper and Lloyd Mangrum. He is just as
solid as could be, with the sweet swing and the unshakable
temperament. Now the British Open title was so close, O'Meara
almost could taste the champagne flowing out of the old Claret Jug.
</P>
<P>
   This was before Brian Watts joined the playoff picture, and
O'Meara had a two-foot putt to finish at even par. If he blows it,
he's in a playoff with Woods. Deep down, O'Meara just might have
cherished the prospect. These are two good friends who have
elevated each other's game _ and the general state of golf _ over
the last few years. They had a nice little duel at the '97 AT&AMP;T at
Pebble Beach (O'Meara beat Woods and David Duval by a stroke), and
privately, they have yearned for more.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Birkdale was the setting to end them all, but . . . maybe
some other time.
</P>
<P>
   Just before O'Meara addressed that two-footer, a huge roar went
up. It could only have been the 17th hole, because Watts and Jesper
Parnevik were the last twosome on the course. A birdie for Watts?
Nobody knew until O'Meara canned that putt. Then it became
official. Watts would be heading up the 18th needing only a par to
force the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   If they ever made a film of Brian Watts' life, they'd put
dead-ringer Beau Bridges in the title role. Sort of a bummer _ you
really prefer Jeff Bridges _ but that's the story of Watts' life:
Way out on the fringes, doing well (on the Japanese tour) but not
in the mainstream. In fact, he's in the Japanese doghouse right
now. Fussing and fuming about a bad round in the Fuji Classic two
months ago, he calmly turned 180 degrees and slammed two balls in
the ocean. One of those shots was an easy chip to the green, and
when he pulled out the 3-wood, you got the idea he had something
else in mind.
</P>
<P>
   There were demons of some sort pursuing Watts on Sunday. Every
time he lined up a big shot, some weird noise went off. Nothing
quite matches the utter silence of the British Open gallery before
a big shot, but Watts couldn't buy a break.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up his second shot on 18, the one that put him in the
bunker, Watts had to hit it through the shouts of red-coated
marshals trying to keep spectators off the fairway. As he set up in
the bunker _ for an astonishing shot that put him within a foot of
the cup and right into the playoff _ a car alarm went off. Six loud
honks in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Two holes deep into the playoff, Watts was in the process of
hitting a difficult shot out of the rough when a train when by,
clackety-clacking along the rails. And just as he putted on 17 _ a
gutty seven-footer that kept him one shot down _ there was a huge
clanging noise, like somebody taking a bat to an empty gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   What is this, a Spike Jones record? It reached the point where
you were expecting kazoos, or maybe some guy breaking into a tuba
solo. Watts didn't win the tournament, but he sure outlasted the
circus. The fans loved him, too. Two days ago, they didn't have the
first clue who he was. Sunday they were yelling ``Wattsy!'' like he
was some bloke from the nearby pub.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, it was back to the 18th. This is one of the most
fascinating and unique clubhouses in all of golf. If the curious
little white, curving structure looks like a ship, it's because it
was designed exactly that way. ``The architect who designed it,''
says Ken Duncan, Birkdale club president ``saw the clubhouse as an
ocean liner, setting out through our sandhills to the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the members were out, distinguished gentlemen, many of
them war heroes, in their black blazers and conservative ties. In a
fantastic turn of luck, the weather had turned mild, even sunny on
occasion. Watts was back in the sand, trying to pull a Houdini
against O'Meara's steady course, but no luck this time. Maybe it
was too quiet for him. Maybe he would have been more comfortable if
a Roman Candle had exploded.
</P>
<P>
   In a really sweet coincidence, the day's last remnants of pure
sunlight graced the green as O'Meara addressed his final putt. As
it fell, his two kids were running to his side, right on the green,
with wife Alicia right behind. ``That walk up the 18th was just
phenomenal,'' Alicia said. ``I've never experienced anything like
it. The thing about Mark is, he works and works until he's achieved
his goal. It sounds so simple, but that's what he's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the British Open champion might as well have been some
good-hearted guy at your local club, not taking his title or
anything too seriously. ``You know, that golf ball sitting on the
ground doesn't know how old you are,'' he said. ``It doesn't know
if you're 41 or 50 or 22 or 17. It just kind of sits there, waiting
to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Mark O'Meara's world, simple and admirable and pure.
Fittingly, as he left the grounds, it was raining again. The
Lancashire coast wasn't letting anyone get off that easily. One
would imagine he never broke stride.

ROGERS WINS 10TH AS A'S BEAT TWINS 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Some other teams think the A's will trade
left-hander Kenny Rogers to a contender before the July 31
deadline. If general manager Billy Beane makes that move, he
deserves to have Kevin Mitchell sit on him.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless the deal in question is something like Rogers to
the Mariners for Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny is not only our No. 1, he would be No. 1 on 90 percent
of teams,'' Beane said Sunday, reiterating that he keeps saying no
to the teams calling about Rogers and Billy Taylor. A Mike Fetters
deal remains likely, but Beane offered no details on calls he has
received about Fetters.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs homered twice in the A's 5-2 win over the Minnesota Twins
on Sunday, the capper to a 5-6 homestand, and Rogers (10-3) became
the first A's pitcher since Todd Stottlemyre in 1995 to have 10
wins in a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to be here as long as I'm here,'' A's manager Art
Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rogers, ``That's good. I don't want to play without him
here, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers has one more year on his contract, plus an option, and
that is a big part of the A's dreams of contending in the future.
He was uncanny Sunday, doing more with less all day long. ``That's
the value of having a No. 1 starter,'' Beane said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers made his start, despite a strained hamstring, tumbled to
the grass and landed on his elbow during the game when he caught a
spike, and just kept pitching. Before it was over, he had logged
his club-leading third complete game, more than the A's had last
season, and all without ever finding a groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flipping salad today,'' Rogers said. ``I was way under
hitting speed, but I changed speeds off that, too. . . . It was a
tough day for me to get the ball in the vicinity of the plate. When
I had to make a pitch, I made it. But I was erratic, probably the
most I've been all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers just keeps delivering graduate-level seminars on how to
be a staff ace. The key is not so much having dangerous pitches, or
even knowing how to use them. The key is ignoring anything bad that
happens, and convincing everyone you didn't even notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, he just took us on his shoulders and carried us,'' Howe
said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Miguel (``Headache'') Tejada uncorked one of the more
extravagant wild throws to first you will ever see _ in the seventh
to score a run from second and make it a one-run game _ and Rogers
just kept pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tejada flung his throw 10 feet wide of first, and way
high, Mike Blowers started that inning by making an error to put
Otis Nixon on first. Rogers responded by throwing over to first so
many times, he finally caught Nixon leaning for his league-leading
eighth pickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the keys to the game, picking him off,'' Howe
said. ``Obviously, since the next guy hits the ball off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's came into the game 4-16 in games in which they make two
or more errors, and it would have been easy to follow that pattern.
But Rogers just refused to let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Howe stuck with him, even after he gave up a leadoff single to
Brent Gates in the ninth and looked over to the dugout right
afterward. Rogers came through with a tough 3-1 pitch to Nixon that
turned into a comebacker and an easy double play. When Rogers
followed that up by striking out red-hot Matt Lawton (7-for-10 in
the series), he staggered in front of the mound momentarily, as if
he couldn't believe his day's labor was behind him after 138
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``What an effort, just a tremendous effort,'' Howe said. ``He's
something.''

YOUNG ALREADY TRYING TO RUN 49ERS' CAMP 
BY GARY SWAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _ Steve Young was taking charge Sunday in the
second day of the 49ers' rookie training camp:
</P>
<P>
   ``We have rules here. You've got to learn the rules. You guys
are new in Stockton. . . . You're a little unruly today. Hold it.
(begin ital) Hold it. (end ital) If you're not in the front row it
ain't happening for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Young was not talking to players new to the 49ers' system. He
was talking to fans new to the team's training camp ritual of
asking for autographs after practice. About 200 fans crammed the
fence Sunday, many pushing and shoving. They thrusted pens, paper,
footballs and jerseys over the fence top for Young to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're young and impressionable,'' Young said of the crowd.
``They'll learn.''
</P>
<P>
   He could have said the same for the rookie draft choices and
free agents trying to settle in under wicked heat _ 109 Saturday,
100 Sunday _ at the team's first camp at the University of the
Pacific. The veterans are scheduled to report today, and the first
full-squad practice is tomorrow at 8:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Young looked sharp Sunday throwing to J.J. Stokes, an early
veteran arrival in camp, and to new tight end Irv Smith. He did
plenty of scrambling and throwing, something he didn't do as much
of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he is hoping to enjoy this season more than last
because the team kept him under wraps so much because of a
first-game concussion and the offense's lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the last season it was emphasized to me every week `you
cannot get hurt.' '' Young said. ``Not that that will change that
much because I don't want to get hurt. But maybe the play-calling
and other things will expand, and we can get a little more active
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   If Young has a major concern, it is getting his offensive line
in shape, especially at tackle, with Derrick Deese switching to the
right side and Jamie Brown, who was only an occasional starter in
Denver, taking over at left tackle.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers want to give quarterbacks Jim Druckenmiller and Ty
Detmer most of the work in the five exhibition games, but Young
said he has worked hard in the offseason to toughen his body and
wants to work on his mental preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roger Staubach told me one time that you have to redouble your
effort every year to stay the same. . . . I don't know if I've
doubled it, but it's certainly much more than it was 10 years
ago,'' said Young, who will be 37 in October and starts his eighth
season as the 49ers' starter. He has won the NFL passing title six
of those seasons, ranking him with Sammy Baugh for the most ever.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he has reached that point in his career that he
enjoys even the little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older you get the more you appreciated the stuff that you
know isn't going to last forever,'' he said. ``I love
quarterbacking. I love getting into the huddle and calling the
plays. If the receiver called the plays, then I'd want to be
receiver. It's a great quest for me. It's a great learning tool for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   He even loves training camp, he said, at least now before the
tedium sets in during two-a-day practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind training camp. I get free food, and a wake-up
call,'' he said. ``You know you usually have to pay $80 at a hotel
to get a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   Young had to make certain adjustments his first few nights in a
new dorm in a new town. The window to Young's room looks out over a
parking lot where security lights shine all night. Friday night he
could not sleep, and he let coach Steve Mariucci know about it
first thing Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said he got an earful of Young's whining last season
and does not want to hear anymore. He has brought ``No Whining''
signs to paste in the dorm.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Young taped black paper to the window Saturday
night and said he slept soundly.
</P>
<P>
   But the quarterback had another complaint Sunday, Mariucci said.
Of the 80 players in the camp, only Young and Jerry Rice merit two
lockers apiece _ but Young's are in a corner so if he is using one,
he can't get into the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in there yelling, `I can't use my lockers,''' Mariucci
quoted Young as saying. `` `I have two lockers but what good does
it do me. I can't use them.' I think he's just doing this to shake
things up.''

   HOUSTON _ Giants manager Dusty Baker likes to say that water
seeks its own level, a folksy way of explaining that good hitters
eventually hit, and good teams eventually win. The converse is true
as well, of course. Over time, bad hitters and bad teams always
will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what happened to the Giants as they foundered through a
1-8 road trip, their worst in the Dusty Baker era? Have they proved
themselves to be a second-tier team worthy only to battle for a
wild-card berth in the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   They hardly could argue otherwise after their disastrous journey
through Colorado, Los Angeles and Houston, which ended with a
heartbreaking, 4-3 loss in 12 innings to the Astros on Sunday.
Derek Bell hit a bases-loaded single off a rusty Robb Nen in the
12th to complete Houston's sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Giants 11 games behind first-place San
Diego, twice the deficit they faced at the start of the road trip.
Expectations must be lowered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to pretty much forget about winning the division,''
said Charlie Hayes, who homered in the fourth inning to tie the
game and later was involved in a controversial call that, as usual,
went against the Giants. ``We're still in the wild card. Hopefully
we can right the ship and get on the right page.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Giants started the second half last
season with a terrible, 4-8 trip, then rebounded to win 90 games
and the National League West. That heartens Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a temporary bump in the road,'' he said. ``Sooner
or later you won't remember this. It's like a bad dream. As bad as
things are going, that's why we wanted that cushion above .500. As
bad as we're going, we're still eight games above .500. If we had
started the trip at .500 we'd be six or seven below now. Now that
would be demoralizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Giants are enjoying the fruit of their 11-game
winning streak in late May and early June. As bruised as they are,
they return to San Francisco tonight for a seven-game homestand a
half-game behind the Chicago Cubs for the NL wild card.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' first order of business should be a return to solid
fundamental baseball. They are not a team of superstars; their
modus operandi is keeping the game close with solid starting
pitching, playing flawless defense to make opponents earn their
runs and then cash in on the big hit.
</P>
<P>
   On the road trip, the Giants did the opposite. The starters
allowed three or more runs in one inning five different times. The
defense committed seven errors, and there were few clutch hits. The
3-4-5 hitters, Barry Bonds, Jeff Kent and J.T. Snow, hit a combined
.188.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, the Giants have been hurting without Shawn Estes,
Julian Tavarez and Rich Aurilia, who will come off the DL tonight
when the Giants face the Arizona Diamondbacks. Rookie Russ Ortiz
will make his first big-league start for the Giants, who got an
excellent start from Mark Gardner on Sunday after the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Bell and Jeff Bagwell, then gave up a three-run homer
to Moises Alou for a quick 3-0 Astros lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants got the runs back with two homers of their own in the
fourth off Pete Schourek. Bonds hit his 20th with Bill Mueller
aboard after a single, and with one out Hayes tied the game with
his own blow into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner pitched six zeroes after allowing Alou's 23rd homer, but
the Giants could not score again while he was in the game to
present him with an eighth victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes nearly put the Giants ahead in the eighth with a smash
toward the left-field line with two aboard, but third baseman Sean
Berry dived to stop it and threw Hayes out, or so the umpire ruled.
The replays showed he beat the throw. The Giants never scored.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gardner and the Giants' bullpen pitched 10 straight
shutout innings until the 12th, when Bill Spiers hit a one-out
double off a rusty Nen, who then walked Biggio intentionally. Nen
then walked Ricky Gutierrez unintentionally to load the bases for
Bell, who lined an 0-2 pitch to center for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ended a trip that, according to Baker, ``shows you, hey,
nothing is ever promised to anybody. Whatever happens, I'd rather
it happen now than later. Now we'll see what we've got down deep.''

OSUNA'S STRUGGLES CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ For two innings, Antonio Osuna looked like he was
ready for the setup role. Then came the third.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who has struggled since being moved out of the closer
role when Jeff Shaw was acquired at the All-Star break, allowed
three consecutive singles to start the eighth Sunday night. The
first two came around to score to tie the game, and the Dodgers
lost 5-4 in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not very good right now,'' said Osuna, who allowed a
season-high three runs Friday night, including Mark McGwire's
second home run. ``But it is not the role I'm in. Tonight, I lost
concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna struck out Tom Pagnozzi to end the sixth. In the seventh,
McGwire took Raul Mondesi to the wall, but Osuna escaped trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ron Gant and John Mabry singled and Pat Kelly laid down a
perfect bunt to load the bases. Scott Radinsky came in and two runs
scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Tony in that spot,'' manager Glenn Hoffman said. ``He
looks comfortable, but if he's not we'll have to talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Good reviews:!off ESPN broadcaster Charlie Steiner, in town for
Sunday night's telecast, worked with former Dodgers GM Fred Claire
during a July 4 game between the Mets and Braves in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said it was clear Claire was still stinging from the
June 21 firing but offered valuable insights during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great for me because I got to play GM for a night,''
Steiner said. ``There are so many moves that are made that the
average fan doesn't think about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets might have been the perfect team for Claire to analyze
because Mike Piazza and Hideo Nomo used to play for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Claire, aware that fans in New York want to sign Piazza for any
price, said it isn't that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pointed out that Al Leiter and John Franco are free agents
and that Rey Ordonez and Edgardo Alfonzo and others are eligible
for salary arbitration,'' Steiner said. ``Everyone says give Mike
what he wants, $90 million, $100,000 million, but Fred was saying
`Where does the money come from?' He said a lot of things I never
thought about. He was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire, who is looking into a baseball job with other clubs, is
expected to do at least a few more broadcasts for ESPN this season.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hit: After getting hits in his first three at-bats of the
series, Wilton Guerrero went 0 for 16 the rest of the way.

NEW YORK'S MOST RESPECTED OFFICERS LED PRECINCT WHERE SEX SCANDAL
FESTERED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, re-editing throughout)   (sw) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They include the police commissioner of Philadelphia,
a Manhattan Criminal Court judge and the chiefs who supervise New
York's detective and transit police bureaus. The list of former
supervisors at the Midtown South precinct over the last 15 years
reads like a ``Who's Who'' in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Police Commissioner Howard Safir has blamed a ``breakdown in
supervision'' at Midtown South for enabling officers there to have
sex with prostitutes routinely, often while on duty, without
getting caught. He said the activity went on for as long as a
decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Although the police say there is no evidence to suggest that
supervisors knew about the activity, were the internal inquiry to
show otherwise, the department could find itself in the unenviable
position of having to interview former ranking officers at Midtown
South, one of the city's busiest station houses and one of its most
prestigious commands.
</P>
<P>
   As the department confronts the scandal, which has enveloped 27
officers so far, it remains unclear how deep investigators will dig
in exhuming the precinct's past.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internal Affairs investigators say the inquiry might have
led to other police supervisors had a leak to The Daily News not
prompted the department to end it Thursday. In the last two weeks,
they said, two officers had told investigators the illegal activity
was more extensive and had gone on for longer than previously
thought.
</P>
<P>
   The two agreed to cooperate by obtaining incriminating
statements from other officers, the investigators said. It is not
known whether the two cooperating officers named any supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a break, and it looked like it might take us into a
whole new realm,'' said an Internal Affairs investigator who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``But we never got the chance to follow
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, Safir's spokeswoman, defended the inquiry on
Sunday, saying, ``We are conducting a very thorough investigation
which will go wherever it leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Few details have emerged about how extensive the police
involvement was over the years at the brothel, at 335 West 39th
Street, and at a massage parlor where officers were filmed at least
once demanding sex. How many officers and prostitutes may have been
involved at any given time is still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Safir, citing a failure to supervise, has transferred
three precinct supervisors at Midtown South, including the
commander, Deputy Inspector Joseph McKeever. But Manhattan police
supervisors confirmed that McKeever arrived there only a year and a
half ago, after the Internal Affairs Bureau and the Manhattan
district attorney's office had already begun their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also exploring possible criminal charges
against officers who may have received sex in exchange for
protection. Thus far, 21 officers and one sergeant have been
stripped of their guns and badges and placed on modified duty. On
Sunday, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani described the participating officers
as a small group who had invited new officers ``who might be
interested'' to join from time to time. ``It was never in any way
precinct-wide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said on Saturday that he would give the transferred
supervisors the benefit of the doubt, for now. ``I never exclude
the possibility of a reasonable explanation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mayronne, who commanded Midtown South in 1987 and 1988
before going on to become the department's chief spokesman, finally
retiring in 1996, said he ``would be very much surprised'' if
officers under his command frequented the brothel. But speaking by
telephone from his home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., he added that
commanding officers ``rely on the lieutenants and the sergeants,
because they're out there more than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it seemed impossible that police officers could have
kept the ring a secret for so long. ``Fifteen years?'' he said. ``I
mean, cops are tight-lipped, but they go to parties. Eventually, it
would get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who led Midtown South are John Timoney, once the
precinct's executive officer, who later rose to first deputy
commissioner before leaving to become Police Commissioner in
Philadelphia; Chief of Detectives William Allee, also once the
precinct's No. 2, now one of the ``superchiefs'' who make up
Safir's inner circle; Chief George Brown, formerly its commanding
officer, now head of the Transit Division; Deputy Chief Michael
Fox, also once commanding officer, now the second-in-command of
Patrol Borough Manhattan South, and Capt. John Wasiak, once the
precinct's executive officer, who heads the dignitary protection
unit in the Intelligence Division.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Mayronne, none of those former supervisors could be
reached for comment on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who oversaw Midtown South during the time the sex
ring is said to have existed have reputations for being tough on
corruption, prostitution, or both.
</P>
<P>
   Brown became known for aggressive vice crackdowns when he ran
Midtown South. His officers figured out when prostitutes began
their workdays and arrested them as soon as they hit the street,
driving many out of the precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Another former executive officer, John Walsh, later headed the
internal police prosecutor's office and developed a reputation as
the department's conscience, unflinching in his discipline of
corrupt officers. He later was appointed to the Manhattan Criminal
Court. He now is an acting Supreme Court justice.
</P>
<P>
   Some question whether even the most effective supervisor could
have learned of the illicit activity.
</P>
<P>
   One former chief and precinct commander who spoke on condition
of anonymity said that the fault lay not in poor management but in
a departmental system in which officers on the street are rewarded
mostly for writing tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're writing 40-plus summonses a day, the boss doesn't
care if you do it in two hours, and the other six hours of your
shift you're out of sight,'' he said, adding that the result of the
investigation was likely to be a doubling of the number of
sergeants at Midtown South. ``They want to get to the source of
this,'' he said, ``but it's the department itself.''

TO WIN WEST, RANGERS MUST GET DEFENSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Texas Rangers have stumbled and fumbled
their way through half a summer of shabby baseball, putting up with
mediocre pitching and worse defense to mold themselves into what
they are Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A first-place team.
</P>
<P>
   Is this a great division or what? It's amazing what three gritty
come-from-behind victories at home against an expansion team can do
for a team's morale. That improves their record to 15-20 since Tom
Hicks was approved as owner, including a 6-1 mark against expansion
teams.
</P>
<P>
   But there they are, sitting atop the American League West
standings after the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Anaheim Angels
on Sunday night at the same time the Rangers were breaking the
collective hearts of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for the third
consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   How do you figure that magic number thing again?
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, any combination of one team going .500 the rest of the
way and the others not trading for Roger Clemens, Mike Piazza
and/or Roberto Alomar will clinch it.
</P>
<P>
   All of this indicates that the division is just begging to be
taken and nobody is good enough right now to win it. The Angels
have several holes in their lineup and a wounded pitching staff,
the Athletics are short on talent and the Mariners have a
conflagrant bullpen and a volatile Randy Johnson who's perfectly
capable of going off on any teammate at any time.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers really ought to win this division. They have the
best talent, even though there is some sentiment within the
organization to package Darren Oliver and minor-league talent for
another starter. The pipe dream possibility is Clemens, but
Cardinals pitcher Todd Stottlemyre might be a more reasonable
target, depending on their availability by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers won't win unless they start playing better. The
cold, sober truth is the Rangers only have three games remaining
against an expansion team. They have seven remaining against the
New York Yankees, whose pitchers aren't noted for doing what Tampa
Bay's Bryan Rekar did Sunday night _ walking a guy (Mark McLemore)
who was deliberately trying to make an out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the division is there for the taking,''
McLemore said. ``There's also no doubt we're capable of playing
better than what we've been playing. We can't be saying it would be
great to have this guy or it would be great to have that guy. We
just have to go out and play and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' problem is not pitching, a stunning development
considering the team's history. The most troubling aspect of this
team is a lack of solid everyday defense.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about outfielders climbing walls, infielders
diving for balls or even catchers throwing out 62.7 percent of
attempted base stealers. We're talking about _ and manager Johnny
Oates is talking about _ making the routine play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the area where we have the potential to show
the greatest improvement,'' Oates said. ``We're not going to score
more runs and we're not going to pitch much better. But we can
catch the ball better and make the little plays. We've done it
before and we'll do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers committed 28 errors in their first 56 games and went
34-22. They've committed 44 in their past 42 and are 20-22. The
pitching was similar in both stretches. So was the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a little bit lucky,'' catcher Ivan Rodriguez said.
``The way we've been playing the last two weeks, we could be six or
seven out. But the other teams haven't been playing well either.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're getting there. We're still going to win this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They should, and without Clemens. The owners have spent enough
money. If they don't win, they'll have nobody to blame but
themselves.

BRITISH OPEN CHAMP RAISES ACHIEVEMENT BAR FOR NEIGHBOR GRIFFEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Come October, the Bragging Rights Festival
in a posh Florida development may be too insufferable for the
sports world to bear.
</P>
<P>
   So, Mark O'Meara, what's the bigger deal: Two major professional
golf championships in a single season, or 62 home runs in a single
season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two majors,'' said O'Meara, laughing. ``No question.''
</P>
<P>
   He can afford the conceit, because he's done his part. His
neighbor and pal in the Isleworth community of suburban Orlando,
Ken Griffey Jr., still has a ways to go before he breaks the most
glamorous record in sports.
</P>
<P>
   But if Griffey breaks Roger Maris' mark, it's almost certain
he'll get a celebratory sip from the Claret Jug, the trophy that
goes annually to the winner of the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara recalled that the same gesture was afforded him by Ian
Baker-Finch, who won the Open the last time it was played here at
Royal Birkdale, in 1991. O'Meara entered the final day tied with
Baker-Finch. O'Meara had a 69 that day, finishing with a five-under
275, but his good friend Baker-Finch took the Jug.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara later went to Baker-Finch's home, where he had the
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Look, I can't tell you how much it meant I played
with a good friend, and how supportive you were to me, and how much
it helped,''' O'Meara recalled of the conversation. ``He said, `I
want you to drink out of this just as if I drunk out of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now it is O'Meara's turn to celebrate his astonishing good
fortune, made richer by the weather ordeal of this weekend on the
shoreline of the Irish Sea as well as the fact that it follows his
Masters championship in April.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention it took him four playoff holes to vanquish Brian
Watts, the little-known American who demonstrated that obscurity is
not a synonym for inadequacy.
</P>
<P>
   The pair finished the regulation 72 holes tied at 280, the first
time in 12 years the Open hasn't had a champion below par.
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't sufficient testimony to the climatological
nightmares that scoured these 100-year-old links, there was this
from Lee Janzen, winner of last month's U.S. Open, who came in
11-over Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the toughest course I ever played, and that
was just in the practice rounds,'' he said. ``(Saturday) certainly
proved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the torment of the third round, Sunday's finale was
a morning in Tahiti. It only rained hard for about half the day,
and gusts were rarely more than 20 mph.
</P>
<P>
   That was sufficiently benign to allow room for a challenge to
Watts, the third-round leader at par who again Sunday was mostly
undaunted against the pressure of his first challenge in a major,
bagging a 70.
</P>
<P>
   But only O'Meara's cool demeanor, which surprised even him, had
the mettle to unhinge Watts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara told his caddy after he hit his second shot of the final
hole in regulation that he had never felt so calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I can't explain that,'' he said. ``I
felt a little bit nervous going into the playoff. There's a lot on
the line in a major championship. The first thought that came in to
my mind was, `You lose a playoff and think at least I gave it a
good try.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But deep down inside you're going to be pretty disappointed. I
didn't want to be disappointed today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the unlikely Watts who felt the disappointment, never
recovering from a bogey on the first playoff hole. But in fact, the
most serious threat to O'Meara expired during regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Another of his Isleworth pals, Tiger Woods, finished
birdie-birdie for a round of 66 and a 281 total, one stroke behind.
Woods finished several twosomes ahead of O'Meara and Watts, so all
he could do was wait to see if his neighbor and pal fell back to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never pull for him to miss a shot,'' said Woods. ``Our
friendship matters more.''
</P>
<P>
   By loaning his backup putter to Woods before play began Sunday,
O'Meara suggested facetiously that he had already taken care of any
Woods' challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished first and he finished one shot off,'' he said,
grinning. ``That's why that putter is the backup.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did O'Meara, at 41, become the oldest player to win two
majors in the same year, he is the first American to turn that
trick since Tom Watson in 1982 (U.S. and British Opens). And it
happened in the 18th year of his pro career.
</P>
<P>
   With so much attention on Woods, 22, and English phenom Justin
Rose, a 17-year-old amateur who finished at 282, O'Meara made a
telling point for codgerdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf ball sitting on the ground doesn't know how old you
are, it doesn't know if you're 41 or 50 or 22 or 17,'' he said.
``It kind of sits there waiting to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, no one in the world is hitting balls quite like
O'Meara, unless it is Griffey. If O'Meara continues his mastery
through the PGA Championship at Sahalee next month, it won't make
any difference how many home runs Griffey hits.
</P>
<P>
   He'll still have to carry O'Meara's bag all winter.

   SEATTLE _ The Mariners finished an 11-game homestand Sunday at
the Kingdome, finding almost enough pain to overshadow the good
feelings. Players were limping in the outfield, rubbing jaws and
heads in the infield, lying face down near home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal today was to see who could get hurt the most,''
starting pitcher Jeff Fassero wisecracked.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wilson qualifies there. As a six-game Seattle win streak
ended with a 4-1 defeat to the Kansas City Royals, the Mariner
catcher suffered torn ligaments in his left ankle while pouncing on
a passed ball and will be lost for up to a month.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson will be put on the 15-day disabled list Monday and
replaced by catcher Raul Chavez from Class AAA Tacoma, at least
temporarily. Mariners officials said they will consider pursuing a
veteran catcher, possibly Joe Oliver, who was recently released by
the Detroit Tigers, to share duties with John Marzano, Wilson's
backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That clouds the day a bit,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Stumbling through the first half of the season, the Mariners
(45-54) appear to have righted themselves in July. They are 11-5
this month, including 8-3 on the just completed homestand. But
Wilson has been a big part of that resurgence, hitting three homers
in the past week and providing a career-best six RBIs in last
Friday's game against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner catcher was hurt in the third inning after a low
pitch squirted from his glove for a passed ball, bounding about 15
feet left of the plate. Trying to prevent Kansas City's Mendy Lopez
from scoring, Wilson charged after the ball in his usual aggressive
style. He slid on his right knee and tried to plant his left foot,
only to roll his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   After tossing the ball weakly to Fassero _ too late to catch
Lopez crossing the plate _ Wilson collapsed face down. Grimacing,
he covered his ankle with his catcher's mitt. Two trainers carried
him from the field, making sure he put no weight on the injured
joint.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday's mishap dicated he be placed on the disabled list,
Wilson had never been on the DL in seven seasons with Cincinnati
and Seattle. He had played so much in recent years that Piniella
had decreed his catcher would take regular rest breaks this season,
a moot point now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as serious an injury as I've ever had,'' said Wilson,
his wrapped ankle the size of a grapefruit. ``I don't know if I
caught a seam or just a spike in the turf that I couldn't get out.
I rolled it good.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitch Storey, one of the Mariner physicians, said X-rays
showed that Wilson won't need surgery. But the catcher will have to
immobilize his ankle for at a week to 10 days, and faces a minimum
of two weeks of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably looking at three or four weeks before he's
playing,'' Storey said.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Mariners, Wilson was their only casualty. There
were plenty of chances for more.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, third baseman Rico Rossy and shortstop Alex
Rodriguez collided, not once but twice, while chasing a popup. Both
went down on first contact, jumped up and hit again before Rossy
one-handed the ball behind third with a stunned look. Rodriguez
dropped to a knee, rubbing his jaw after catching the back of his
teammate's head. Rossy appeared to have the right-of-way on the
catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called for it at the same time,'' said the third baseman,
who watched the play on videotape with Rodriguez after the game.
``I gave him a hard time and I knocked him down. I told him he had
better get up quick or people would think I was stronger than him.
No damage done.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning, center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. climbed the
wall trying to intercept a home run by Kansas City's Dean Palmer,
but succeeded only in slightly twisting his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I limping when I came to the plate in the ninth?'' Griffey
said. ``I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   When people weren't hurting themselves, former Mariner Tim
Belcher and Fassero were locked in a pitcher's duel. Belcher (9-8)
went seven innings, yielding his only run on Rodriguez's 30th homer
in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero (9-6) threw a complete game, serving up runs on Wilson's
throwing error in the first, the passed ball that cost him his
starting catcher, a groundout and Palmer's 19th homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have a day off Monday to travel to Florida and
consider life without Wilson. The thought already has crossed
Marzano's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I felt when he got hurt is, we're losing a lot
out there, we're losing a leader,'' the journeyman catcher said.
``I'm replacing him, but don't expect Dan Wilson.''

SEAHAWKS SIGN TOP DRAFT PICK, BUT WARREN MOON A HOLDOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ Anthony Simmons is here. Warren Moon is not.
</P>
<P>
   When the Seahawks practice for the first time this morning at
their Eastern Washington University training camp, they will do so
without their starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Moon did not report for a mandatory team meeting Sunday night.
He plans to fly to Los Angeles Monday to meet with his agent, Leigh
Steinberg, and discuss his options.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's holdout overshadowed Sunday's signing of Simmons, who
became the team's first No. 1 draft choice to be in camp on time
since quarterback Dan McGwire in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons signed a six-year, $7 million contract, but the
linebacker from Clemson can void the final year by attaining
incentives and the club has the option of buying back the sixth
year. What won't change is the $3.6 million signing bonus Simmons
received.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of football operations Randy Mueller tried to
stress the positive _ Simmon's signing _ and shrug off the negative
_ Moon's holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited to get going and that we have all our draft picks
signed and in camp for the first time in quite awhile,'' he said.
``I can't control Warren not being here. ... We can't do any more.
We can't take (salary) cap dollars from subsequent years and invest
those right now in Warren Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks regarding a reworked deal for Moon actually took a turn
for the worse Sunday, despite the Seahawks upping their offer by
$325,000. Steinberg seemed aggravated and even a bit insulted by
the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very surprised it has come to this,'' Steinberg said.
``The intention never was to have Warren hold out. This is not what
we wanted. But with them saying they won't do anything more than a
one-year deal, there was no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The impasse remains a matter of dollars, and sense.
</P>
<P>
   Moon was scheduled to make $550,000 in the second season of a
two-year contract he signed last year, when Moon was expected to be
the backup to John Friesz. The club had offered him a $1 million
raise before bumping it Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The club cites Moon's age (42 in November) and salary-cap
restrictions for not offering Moon a longer deal or more money on a
one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg has been asking for a three-year contract that
includes a $6 million signing bonus and will pay Moon at least $5
million this season. Steinberg points out that the Seahawks' latest
offer would still leave Moon the 23rd-highest paid quarterback in
the NFL and the 19th-highest paid player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, who also represents Friesz, helped the Seahawks free
$1.475 million this season when he renegotiated a three-year, $4.25
million deal that Friesz signed Saturday. Steinberg seemed baffled
that the club did not offer more of that money to Moon, but Mueller
said the excess already was budgeted in the club's original offer
to Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Moon could retire, but Steinberg said even speculating on that
option is premature. Moon could sign the team's latest offer. Or he
can continue to hold out, although he can be fined as much as
$5,000 per day during the first training camp absence in his
20-year professional career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren has made it crystal clear that he wants to play at
least two more years,'' Steinberg said. ``But in our talks today,
they mentioned his age ad nauseam.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Friesz, who accepted a pay cut, will replace Moon as
the starter this morning, and for as long as Moon's holdout might
last.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago at this time, John was our No. 1 quarterback,''
offensive guard Pete Kendall said of a situation that changed when
Friesz suffered a broken right thumb in the season opener. ``I have
every confidence in John and I think just about everybody here
does. Even if things don't get worked out, I feel good about who
our quarterback is going to be opening day _ no matter if it's No.
1 (Moon) or No. 17 (Friesz).''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall doesn't want it to come to that. He understands Moon's
predicament, but also hopes his absence doesn't cloud the bigger
issue for a team that is attempting to make the playoffs for the
first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we'd like to have the guy who's going to be our No.
1 quarterback be here when camp opens,'' Kendall said. ``But
Warren's got some issues that he needs to work out. I'd rather have
him in camp when he's happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hope it's not a distraction, and I hope it doesn't drag
on too long and hurt what this team is going to accomplish.''
</P>

GREER'S TWO-RUN DOUBLE LIFTS RANGERS TO AL WEST LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers left fielder Rusty Greer emerged as a
.300 hitter once again _ albeit for only one at-bat _ Sunday night
at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The red-headed outfielder chose a most opportune moment.
</P>
<P>
   Greer's two-run, fifth-inning double ignited a five-run outburst
during the Rangers' 7-4 victory against the expansion Tampa Bay
Devil Rays and propelled the home team into first place in the
American League West with the Anaheim Angels' 7-4 loss to the
Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said,
``that was ``the'' at-bat of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander John Burkett, who allowed four runs on 10 hits,
protected the four-run advantage granted him with a workmanlike
seven innings before giving way to left-hander Eric Gunderson and
closer John Wetteland, who recorded his 27th save with a scoreless
ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Greer, whose average rested at .250 during late May, perhaps
made it all possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the bottom half of the fifth inning trailing
3-2 after a run-scoring single by Devil Rays third baseman Wade
Boggs. Right-hander Bryan Rekar, though, could not protect the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Fernando Tatis began the rally with a leadoff
single and advanced to second on what could be described as no
ordinary single by the Rangers' leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Tom Goodwin lined a bullet in the direction of
Devil Rays first baseman Paul Sorrento. The well-hit ball glanced
off Sorrento's glove for an infield single instead of an
inning-killing double play with Tatis running on the pitch, and
Rekar loaded the bases by issuing a walk to second baseman Mark
McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Greer to the plate with the opportunity to inflict
serious damage, but Rekar quickly put the left fielder in a hole
with two strikes in as many pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I wanted to do was just give that bat away,''
said Greer, who will enter tomorrow's game hitting .450 (18-for-40)
during his past 10 contests with six runs batted in during his past
three games. ``You at least want a sacrifice fly in that situation.
I had to stay up there and battle and try to at least put the ball
in play.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer fouled four two-strike pitches before Rekar (0-2)
eventually hung a 2-2 curveball in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to stay inside of it,'' Greer said, ``and ended
up driving it into left field.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer laced the pitch into left field for his seventh
multiple-hit game in the past 11 games. Tatis and Goodwin scored
easily, and McLemore raced into third on the double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt fine, and then I went out there and didn't pitch a good
inning,'' said Rekar, who retired seven of eight batters entering
the fifth inning. ``I didn't make the pitches when I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez also delivered a quality at-bat
during the inning after failing behind in the count with two quick
strikes. Gonzalez eventually delivered a run-scoring ground ball
that scored McLemore with the Devil Rays' infield playing at normal
depth.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Rangers' a 5-3 lead and brought first baseman Will
Clark to the plate, who deposited a 1-1 pitch from Rekar into the
upper-deck porch in right field to complete the five-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad location. Bad pitching,'' Rekar said of the fastball.
``That is what they will do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer missed a home run narrowly during his seventh-inning
at-bat. The fly ball to deep center field nestled in the glove of
Quinton McCracken and returned Greer's batting average to .299.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it important? No, but once you reach a certain level,''
Greer said, ``you obviously want to maintain it. The bottom line is
I don't care if I hit .300 as long as we win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not hit .300 and contribute more in other ways _
getting on base, driving in runs _ to help this team win.''

ANGELS-CARDINALS DISCUSSING BLOCKBUSTER TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ A source close to the Angels said Sunday that the club
is considering making a blockbuster trade with the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels would give up outfielder Garret Anderson, pitcher
Jason Dickson and Triple-A pitcher Scott Schoeneweis in exchange
for pitcher Todd Stottlemyre and outfielder Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, who started Sunday's game against the Dodgers, went
into the day 9-8 with a 3.29 ERA. Jordan began the day hitting .328
with 15 homers and 59 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stottlemyre, 33, and Jordan, 31, are eligible to become
free agents at the end of this season. And Jordan, who played
defensive back for the Atlanta Falcons from 1989-91, has said he is
considering going back to football and playing both sports.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jim Turner, Jordan's agent, is trying to convince
Jordan not to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian's a very interesting guy,'' Turner said. ``And he has a
lot of belief in himself doing things. But that would be awfully
difficult to imagine. My best advice to him is that `(baseball) is
where your future is.' There's a difference between emotion and
reality. He's just hitting his stride as a baseball player. It will
be awfully interesting to see how good he can be. He could
establish himself as one of the great players in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley improved: Pitcher Chuck Finley said his right
forearm/wrist felt much better Sunday, one day after he got hit by
a line drive hit by the Orioles' Joe Carter in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who will be pushed back in the rotation from Tuesday to
Friday, is a magnet for freak injuries, but he was happy it wasn't
worse on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to hit me in the face if I didn't put my arm
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley suffered a cut on his right knee in his start Wednesday
that required eight stitches to close. This is just another in a
long list of freak injuries the lefty has had over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked how it (forearm) felt last night,'' Finley said.
``I said my knee doesn't hurt anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the freak injuries) are created to make me forget
about the time before. I broke my wrist to make me forget about
getting cracked in the face. I hurt my knee to forget about my
wrist. And I got hit last night to forget about my knee.... It's
weird, very weird stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Endangering records: What kind of season is Darin Erstad having?
If he continues on his pace, he'll set Angels single-season records
in four offensive categories. Following are the categories,
Erstad's projected total and club record:
</P>
<P>
   Hits _ Erstad (215), Alex Johnson (202 in 1970); doubles _
Erstad (53), Doug DeCinces (42 in 1982) and Johnny Ray (42 in
1988); total bases _ Erstad (374), Don Baylor (333 in 1979);
extra-base hits _ Erstad (90), DeCinces (77 in 1982).
</P>
<P>
   Watson tabbed: Allen Watson will start in Finley's spot Tuesday
in Minnesota, his first start since an elbow injury and cut wrist
had him on the disabled list for six weeks. He returned last week
and has made three relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted Allen Watson to have a start,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``All along, that's where we felt he would best help
the club.''

CARDINALS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ In the halls of Dodger Stadium, they called it ``The
Curse of Matt Luke.''
</P>
<P>
   Luke was a story of perseverance, a popular 27-year-old rookie
who was shipped to Cleveland last month. The Dodgers then went on
to play poorly against lesser opponents during a stretch that
ultimately cost Bill Russell and Fred Claire their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Luke returned, started playing a lot of left field when Bobby
Bonilla went down, even hit two homers that should have won Sunday
night's game at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Luke was lifted for a pinch hitter in the eighth inning
with a two-run lead. That's when the Dodgers' 5-4 loss to the St.
Louis Cardinals began to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   It was a percentage move. Right-handed hitting Trenidad Hubbard,
who flied out against left-hander Lance Painter with two runners on
and one out, was hitting .410 (16 for 39) against lefties. But
baseball is not always a numbers game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting a chance to play, so I'm not going to
second-guess anything,'' said Luke, who hit the game-winning homer
in Saturday's victory. ``I'm confident against right-handers and
I'm confident against left-handers. I'll leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pulling within 3{ games of the wild-card spot, the
Dodgers open a seven-game homestand tonight against Cincinnati
knowing things could be better.
</P>
<P>
   They split the four-game series with the Cardinals in sweltering
heat that could have robbed them of their spirit and their pitching
staff. But the Dodgers sure weren't happy about the victory that
got away.
</P>
<P>
   The game was won in the ninth when Mark McGwire singled against
Scott Radinsky (4-5) with one out, took second when Ron Gant was
hit by a pitch with two out and scored on a single by left-handed
hitting John Mabry.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had right-handed hitters Gary Gaetti and Brian
Hunter on the bench, but manager Tony La Russa stuck with Mabry,
who is batting .333 against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry drove a 1-2 pitch to left. Roger Cedeno, who came in to
play there in the ninth, was briefly frozen by the liner, then took
it on one hop and came up throwing.
</P>
<P>
   It was strong, but landed well wide of the plate and McGwire
slid home ahead of the tag.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers trailed 2-0 in the first after a Ray Lankford home
run against Chan Ho Park.
</P>
<P>
   They got a run back in the second on an RBI single by Charles
Johnson against Todd Stottlemyre.
</P>
<P>
   After Eric Karros singled to open the fourth, Luke drove a 2-2
fastball into the Cardinals' bullpen to give the Dodgers a 3-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Luke made it 4-2 when he crushed a Stottlemyre fastball 421 feet
to dead center.
</P>
<P>
   It was his seventh of the season. He is batting .320 (13 for 40)
with three homers and 20 RBI since taking over for Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Just not against left-handers.

ANGELS BULLPEN CAN'T HOLD LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ For most of his brief appearance Sunday night, Angels
closer Troy Percival couldn't find the plate. And even when he did,
the Baltimore Orioles hit him. The result was three ninth-inning
runs for the Orioles and a 7-4 victory over the Angels before
38,840 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Angels' 12th in 16 games and sent them into
second place, one-half game behind Texas in the A.L. West.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tough one to swallow for the Angels, considering they
got a solid performance from starter Omar Olivares (61/3 innings,
three runs, seven hits) and were able to score four runs against
Orioles starter Mike Mussina.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson's two-out, two-run triple in the sixth inning
extended his hitting streak to 17 games and gave the Angels a 4-2
lead, but the bullpen couldn't hold it. Orioles designated hitter
Eric Davis, who hit a solo home run off Olivares in the sixth, hit
a two-run homer off Greg Cadaret in the seventh to tie the game at
4.
</P>
<P>
   Pep Harris relieved Cadaret and kept the game tied until the
ninth, when Percival (2-4) came in and subsequently lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   Percival walked four in two-thirds of an inning, three of them
coming with two out. He threw 28 pitches _ only 10 for strikes _
and had to be relieved by Mike Holtz, who got the final out.
</P>
<P>
   With a runner on second and two out, Percival walked Brady
Anderson and Davis on 3-1 pitches to load the bases. Then he threw
four consecutive balls to Rafael Palmeiro, forcing in a run for a
5-4 Orioles lead. Percival got ahead in the count on Cal Ripken,
but Ripken lined a 1-2 pitch to center field for two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm (ticked) off,'' Percival said. ``But there's nothing I can
do about it. I've got to get ready for our next game Tuesday. If
they get five hits off me, fine. But the defense can't help me when
I'm walking people.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Percival's pitches were close, just missing the strike
zone, but he wouldn't use it as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those pitches were thigh-high or above, but if he (home-plate
umpire Gary Cedarstrom) wasn't giving it to them all night, I'm not
going to complain. I'm not going to beg for pitches. I couldn't get
the ball down. I didn't have control tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a matter of inches on all of 'em,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``That's the name of the game. But it's a
matter of putting the ball where you have to put it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares gave the Angels what they saw earlier in the season
before he fell into a slump. He was among the league leaders in ERA
a month ago but had lost four consecutive starts going into
Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   He shut out the Orioles for five innings until Davis homered
leading off the sixth. He also gave up an RBI double to Chris
Hoiles in the inning, and left after he walked Rich Becker with one
out in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I found myself again,'' Olivares said. ``I was throwing
the ball the way I was before. I hit my spots and had good
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares credited his improvement to lifting weights and running
more between starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I felt good and was able to finish my
pitches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense, after scoring four runs off Mussina,
couldn't do anything with Orioles reliever Jesse Orosco (4-1), who
got the win by shutting out the Angels in 12/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the second half of the season, we're down to 60-some
games,'' Collins said. ``Each game you get a lead late in the game
and you can't hold the lead becomes important, real important.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival took the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team gets four runs off Mussina, they did a fantastic
job,'' Percival said of the offense. ``They didn't deserve to
lose.''

O'MEARA IS JOLLY GOOD 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ Mark O'Meara sat on the damp grass on the
upslope leading off the 18th green at Royal Birkdale Sunday,
watching as Brian Watts tried to keep his date with destiny in the
127th British Open. Mired in a trap across the green and faced with
an improbable stance as his implausible journey seemed near a
close, Watts had to execute the shot of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Watts, an American who plays golf on the Japanese
tour, nearly holed it said it all about this year's rendition of
the game's oldest championship. When the ball came to rest about 6
inches from the cup, few applauded as enthusiastically as O'Meara.
``Probably,'' he said, ``the greatest shot under pressure I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant the two would walk to the 15th tee to engage in a
four-hole playoff. They'd finished at even-par 280 after a
tournament played in fierce winds, soft rain, and occasional gales
but ended on a reasonably benign evening when O'Meara would win the
playoff by two shots, becoming a golfer of rare distinction after
two decades in the game.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Meara closed out the resolute Watts, he became, at the
age of 41 years 6 months and 6 days, the oldest golfer to win two
majors in the same year. It was a suitable companion piece to the
Masters title he won in April in equally dramatic fashion by holing
a 20-foot birdie putt on the 72d hole. Jack Nicklaus (1980) and Ben
Hogan (1953) were 40 when they won two majors.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan won three, an accomplishment O'Meara can duplicate if he
wins the PGA Championship at Sahalee in Redmond, Wash., next month.
The last to win two majors in the same year was Nick Price, who won
the British Open and PGA in 1994, and the last to win the British
Open and the Masters in the same year had been Nick Faldo in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   This was a quirky British Open on a historic course, where
previous championships had been won by Americans Arnold Palmer, Lee
Trevino, Johnny Miller, and Tom Watson. The average score in
Saturday's gale was 77.5. Phil Mickelson and defending champion
Justin Leonard finished 28 over par. As Leonard said Saturday
following an 82, his advice to those in contention would be to
``keep your wits about you.'' O'Meara did, and his star has never
been more glittering.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, who wrapped birdies on the 11th, 12th, and 14th holes
around a bogey on the 13th, finished 68_280. Watts, who won the
1987 NCAA championship out of Oklahoma State but had to settle for
being a huge success in Japan after struggling to acquire his PGA
Tour card, held on for 70_280.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, who languished in the background after an opening
65, birdied the 15th (two putts), 17th with a dramatic chip-in, and
18th when he rolled in a 30-foot putt to stay alive ended up
66_281. Sensational English teenager Justin Rose (69) was in a
foursome with Scotland's Raymond Russell (66), Jim Furyk (70), and
Sweden's Jesper Parnevik (70) at 282.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara never trailed in the playoff, tapping in for a birdie on
the opening par 5 and watching Watts's gallant birdie try go by the
board when his putt just nicked the cup. After they each parred 16,
Watts seemed to be out of it on the 17th, when he pushed his tee
shot into the right rough and had a virtually unplayable lie. He
slashed it out, hit his fourth shot out of heavy hay and made a
putt to match O'Meara's par.
</P>
<P>
   Going to 18, Watts knew he needed a birdie to prolong the
playoff, but his second shot ended up in the left rear bunker. ``I
felt I still had a chance after making par on 17,'' he said. ``I
knew I had to hole the bunker shot to have any kind of a chance to
win.'' He exploded 30 feet past the cup, missed the putt, and
O'Meara had three putts to win. He took two.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara's critical stretch in the fourth round began with
birdies on the 11th (6-iron, 15 feet) and 12th (4-iron, 22 feet), a
bogey on the 12th out of a bunker, and a birdie on the 14th
(3-iron, 4 feet). He made the required birdie on the par-5 17th
that was a driver/short iron shot in Saturday's wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shot that really sticks in my mind,'' said O'Meara, ``was
the 3-iron I played to 14. I came off a bogey, and I had 201 yards
into the a left-to-right wind. I hit a 3-iron (to 4 feet), and that
was a great shot for me in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts, who earned approximately $1.4 million on the Japanese
tour when he won five times in 1994, would have earned an exemption
to play the US Tour through the end of this year and the next five
years had he won. He leaves wife Debbye and infant son Jason home
in Edmond, Okla., when he commutes five or six times a year to
compete in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave up,'' Watts said. ``I was only able to advance it
30 yards on 17, but after making par I felt I still had a chance.
I'm proud of myself to be here, and I probably earned a little
respect for the Japanese tour.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara had been dismissed as a steady, dependable player and a
good family man. He was Tiger's neighbor. He was also 0 for 56 in
major championships until he won the Masters. The stories always
said he was a solid player who could win, but he'd come unglued in
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   No more. ``The win at the Masters,'' said O'Meara, ``was
tremendous because of the way I held up coming down the stretch. I
knew I had crossed that hurdle, and I would say I used that to my
advantage out there today.''

<P>
   DETROIT _ There are days when Red Sox righthander Bret
Saberhagen leaves the mound and isn't sure if he should laugh or
cry. Sunday, he felt like doing both.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen went seven innings for the fourth time this season,
but he didn't walk away with a victory. He was locked in a duel
with Detroit Tigers lefthander Justin Thompson, but once he
departed, the Tigers found a way to post a 3-1 victory in the
rubber game of a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The loss went to closer Tom Gordon, who came into a 1-1 game and
allowed both runs. Saberhagen said this may have been his best
outing of the season. But the Red Sox lost, and the only thing
Saberhagen can do about it is hope for a better outcome in his next
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating losing to teams that we should be beating,''
said Saberhagen. ``It's tough to swallow. It was the best I felt
all year since the surgery. But it was the manager's decision that
I should come out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he asks me for the ball, I'm done. You're not going to be
able to win the battle. The decision is made. I haven't pitched any
longer than that in three years. I hope to continue what I did in
the first half. Unfortunately, I came up a little short in the
three games I've thrown in after the break.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen hasn't won since July 1, when he went seven innings
in beating Montreal. After the break, he had no-decisions against
Baltimore and Tampa Bay, failing to reach the sixth inning in
either outing. The Sox lost both games.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon hadn't worked since last Monday against Tampa Bay. The
Tigers touched him for four straight singles, and some aggressive
baserunning turned them into two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't bring Flash in just to get him some work,'' said Red
Sox manager Jimy Williams. ``Not at all. We were trying to win the
game. We go back to protecting our pitcher. We have more games to
play. You start pushing that (panic) button a little bit, and the
next thing you know you have a disabled pitcher. Then you have
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen had thrown 88 pitches in seven innings, 62 for
strikes. He gave up a home run to Luis Gonzalez in the fourth
inning. Bill Ashley had given the Sox the lead with a third-inning
homer. During the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings, Saberhagen was
frustrating the Tigers. But the Red Sox sensed he was tiring. Rich
Garces was warming up in the fifth and sixth. But Gordon got the
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he done his job,'' said Williams. ``And I didn't
want to push it. Coming into the season, he's your fifth starter
and he was going to get five to six days of rest. But now he's the
No. 3 guy and pitching on four days rest. We just need to have him
the rest of the way. We had a rested bullpen basically and our
closer going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen said he had no problem passing the baton to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why you are asking so many questions about
Flash,'' he said. ``They brought in a guy who has saved or won so
many games for us. How can you question that? He's done the job day
in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Sunday. Gordon gave up a one-out single to Joe Randa.
The Tigers then sent Randa on a hit-and-run play. It worked because
Brian Hunter pushed the ball to the right side, and second baseman
Mike Benjamin had been designated to cover the bag. With runners on
first and third, the stage was set.
</P>
<P>
   Damion Easley's single past short scored Randa and moved Hunter
to third. Bobby Higginson's base hit then plated Hunter. Faced with
a two-run deficit, Damon Buford and Keith Mitchell each singled
with two out in the ninth for the Red Sox, but Thompson got Ashley
to fly to center and end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys know me,'' said Gordon. ``They know I'm going to go
to my curve regardless of what the count is. They put the bat on
the ball and they won the game by doing it. We had a lot of chances
to win the game. We didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the balls were hit hard. But some days there is
nothing you can do about it. You try to keep the ball in the
infield, keep the ball down. When it goes through, it goes through.
That's just part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the hit and run normally,'' said Tigers manager
Buddy Bell, ``because you give up too many runs that way. But we
weren't doing a whole lot. And Brian Hunter executed it as well as
you can. That kinda got us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this no-decision can help Saberhagen get going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased about the way I felt,'' he said.
``Hopefully, this is the first of many games when I can go out
there and feel good and not be concerned with a little aches ache
on the top of my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good fastball. I located the ball well and mix mixed
in some curves and changeups. Hopefully, I will pitch a little bit
better and not make a mistake here and there.''

JONES BREEZES IN 100 
</HEADLINE>
 GAMES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER

<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ It began life as ``The Women of Speed.''
Plural. Gwen Torrence, Gail Devers, Merlene Ottey, and Marion Jones
_ with 12 Olympic or World Championship medals among them _ would
meet at the Mitchel Athletic Complex in the 100 meters, a
promotional highlight of these Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   But life does not always proceed apace, even for the fastest
women in the world. Torrence pulled out weeks ago, citing lack of
fitness after battling injuries. Devers withdrew just hours before
the event, citing a tendon pull in her foot. Jamaica's regal Ottey
valiantly toed the line, but even she didn't have a chance as the
singular Jones breezily won in 10.90.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing were Zhanna Pintusevich of Ukraine (11.09), Inger
Miller of the United States (11.18), and Ottey (11.21).
</P>
<P>
   Not that the field of eight in this finals-only format was
sluggish, even without the two American stars. For perhaps the
first time in history, every lane was filled with a woman who had a
personal best under 11 seconds. Even a Jones false start, however,
wasn't enough to keep the other seven in the race, which she led
wire to wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best race in the world,'' said Jones, who is now
undefeated in running the nine fastest times in the world this
year, including Sunday night's into the wind. ``I wouldn't say I
was disappointed, but I was a little surprised. It was actually the
second slowest time for me this year. I was just glad to come away
with the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 23, has lost at 100 meters only twice in the 13 months
since she decided to forsake basketball _ in which she was a
starting point guard on North Carolina's 1994 national championship
team _ for her self-professed ``first love'' of track and field, at
which she still holds the national high school 200-meter record.
Since her emphatic return at the 1997 US Outdoor National
Championships, when she won the 100 and the long jump on little
more than weeks of training, she has become the second-fastest
woman in history, with a 10.71 in the 100 that puts her behind only
Florence Griffith-Joyner's 10.49.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, she repeated as US champion in the 100 (10.72) and
the long jump (23 feet 8 inches) and added a victory in the 200
(22.24), the first woman in 50 years to hold all three titles
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ottey _ who will meet Jones again tonight in the 200 _
refused to cede the season. ``Today she is unbeatable, but we'll
have some more meets,'' said Ottey.
</P>
<P>
   Jones elected to skip the long jump, in which she still gets by
on speed and strength rather than anything resembling technique.
``I wanted to come here and give a good performance in the 100 and
200,'' she explained. ``There's no reason for me to come here and
overdo it.'' Nonetheless, she dominated the event even in her
absence _ when gold medalist Shana Williams was asked what it would
have taken to beat Jones had she entered, Williams didn't hesitate
in replying: ``It would take her having a bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Jones agrees. ``I'm very confident,'' she
acknowledged. ``We train to win, not to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jones continued her winning ways, the women's 800 marked
another stop on the comeback trail for Meredith Valmon, who
graduated from Harvard in 1990 as Meredith Rainey before leading
the US 800-meter team to the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Valmon, living in Silver Spring, Md., with her son and 400-meter
Olympian husband Andrew Valmon, spent 1997 on maternity leave after
giving birth to a son, Travis, last July 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling great, better than I thought I would,'' she said
after finishing fourth in 2:00.10 to Mozambique's Maria Mutola
(1:58.83) and two of the three Clarks in the race, Jearl (1:59.08)
and Joetta (2:00.02).
</P>
<P>
   Now 36, Joetta Clark has been competing as an elite runner since
1978, the year after little sister Hazel, a student at the
University of Florida who finished seventh (2:08.68), was born.
Sister-in-law Miles-Clark, the current US 800-meter champion,
married their brother, J.J., two years ago. To make matters even
cozier, J.J. coaches all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always nice,'' said Miles-Clark of running against the
family. ``I know when they're in we're going to run fast.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Bryan Bronson ran the seventh-fastest time in history (47.15) to
win the men's 400-meter hurdles, leaving local favorite Derrick
Adkins, trying to ignore a hamstring injury, to bring up the rear
in 49.74. Despite the outcome, Adkins said he was glad he decided
to run. ``That was the best part of the day, I guess,'' he said of
the cheers by the crowd of 9,136 (capacity 12,000) that greeted his
introduction ... Ato Boldon, running for Trinidad and Tobago,
turned in a strong 200 meters with a winning time of 20.15 ... In
the women's 3,000-meter steeplechase, Brookline's Lesley Lehane
took the bronze medal despite falling on the first barrier and
prompting a restart. ``I felt bad,'' she said. ``I didn't think
they'd call it back. I was ready to get up and keep running.'' It
was only the fourth steeplechase ever for the 35-year-old women's
track coach at Boston University.

A SUMMER CAMP NOBODY ENJOYS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Baseball training camp: Spring. Change of
seasons. Pitchers and catchers report first. Leisurely days under
pleasant late-winter Florida/Arizona skies. A month of no-stress
games. Easy rapport between players and media. Comfortable
accommodations and virtually unlimited freedom during off-hours.
</P>
<P>
   Football training camp: Height of summer. Relentless heat, often
accompanied by stifling humidity. Bodies heretofore unbanged for
six months or more now rudely reacquainted with pain. Two miserable
practices a day, interspersed with boring meetings. College-style
accommodations with hardly any freedom to do anything worth doing
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's spring training has a romance and a literature all
its own. Football training camp is the closest thing most of them
will ever come to incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   No one likes training camp in football. How much you hate it is
just a matter of degrees. If there is such a thing as a necessary
evil, emphasis on the evil, in American professional sport, it is
professional football training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate training camp,'' says Lawyer Milloy, the excellent
third-year safety. ``You get your butt whipped for a month. You get
tired of the food. It's nasty. It's smelly. It's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's here. Your New England Patriots checked into Bryant
College for all the paperwork Sunday. This morning coach Pete
Carroll and his staff will begin eliminating those smiles from all
those faces.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, start your sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them can also start their worrying. The Coach says there
are a few jobs to be won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are guys over in the dorms who are excited about
taking somebody's job,'' says Carroll. ``There's the running back
spot. There's competition at the receiver spot. There's competition
at the corner spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Training camp can be vitally important for young players,
especially first-year players. And in case any of this year's
rookie crop is unclear as to just how important these hot, sweaty,
painful weeks can be, they should pull up a chair and listen to
Chris Canty, the maligned first-round pick of 1997 who made just
about every intentional and unintentional mistake a rookie could
concoct last year.
</P>
<P>
   Canty was characterized last season by his unwarranted swagger.
I am here to report that he is now at least saying the right thing.
Whether he is capable of playing it all out on the field is
something we will know sooner, rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one needs to tell me this is an important year for me,''
points out the diminutive cornerback, who nodded affirmatively when
asked if he had been a bit, um, immature in his approach to his
profession last season. ``I was the No. 1 pick, and I felt I was on
top of the world,'' Canty confessed. ``The camp brought me back
down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting he should say that, because if the camp actually
brought him ``back to earth,'' how then to characterize the type of
attitude which, as late as the final regular-season game, had him
celebrating a sack while a very live football was lying at his
feet? It's pretty clear that any attitude adjustment he made took
place when the season was over, and not before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a first-round draft pick and he kind of thought we were
lucky to have him,'' says Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Canty was a late arrival last season, and he was not in NFL
shape when he did show up. The combination was deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know what's going on,'' Canty explains, ``you're
pretty much walking around with your head cut off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the conditioning ... ``It's like night and day,'' he
claims. ``I did come to camp out of shape last year, not knowing
what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   This year there are two No. 1s, running back Robert Edwards and
cornerback (they hope) Tebucky Jones. Neither arrives with
Canty-like baggage. They swaggereth not. Based on early returns, it
is hoped that these are indeed men of action, because neither could
be considered a man of words. Edwards gets a quick A-plus in
Gridiron Cliche, giving us, in the same sentence, a ``110
percent,'' a ``focused,'' and a ``just want to help the team.''
Jones, the celebrated father of three (who must be the first
Patriot draft choice with concerns about the local school systems),
is quite parsimonious with the language, ``nope'' being his
favorite answer to most questions.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so neither is an after-dinner speaker, at least not yet.
They are now being paid to play football, and they are about to
embark on a journey about which, frankly, they know nothing.
Consider Jones's answer when asked if he was curious about how an
NFL camp will work. ``Nope,'' he said. ``It's just like college
camp, only longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Son, see us in a week or two. You might wish to amend that
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Training camp is an unavoidable part of the deal, and one the
veterans all wish they could miss. But it is not all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' says Milloy, ``but it's fun. What training camp
does is allow a team to grow together, to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   You're hurting, but the next guy is hurting worse, and some
Friday in November you'll look back and laugh about something that
happened on a sweltering day in July. It's what makes football
football.

PATRIOTS' LAW HAS IT COVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Respect for Ty Law's talents has come
slowly. The folks who vote for the All-Pro team haven't yet chosen
Law, and one reason may be that Law doesn't get much action at his
left corner spot because everyone's always picking on whomever is
playing the right side.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago it was Otis Smith. Last year it was Jimmy
Hitchcock. This year it may be Tebucky Jones or last year's No. 1
draft pick, Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   When teams throw to Law's side, they often think twice about
doing it again. Other than Ted Johnson, Law may be the NFL's best
player who hasn't earned All-Pro status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of frustrating,'' said Law. ``Going into my fourth
season, I haven't been able to display what I think I can really
do. There's always somebody different in there and they're always
going to try them before they try me. The most important thing is
to be successful as a secondary and be the top defense in the
league. Jimmy did a hell of a job, but he's gone now and so whoever
is back there has to do the job and carry his weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Law decided to skip assistant coach Johnny Parker's
strength-and-conditioning program in the offseason. Such a brave
act can usually get you in hot water with the coaching staff, but
Law decided to go through a private program in St. Louis with Bob
and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, which was recommended to him by his
cousin, Hall of Fame running back Tony Dorsett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down to do something different,'' said Law. ``It was a
big help. He showed me how to run and brought my speed up a little
bit. I didn't have to worry about anything. I just worked out,
rested my body and got myself into it. I definitely improved my
speed and overall conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   For two straight months, Law said he devoted himself to the
program. It was the same program that Brian Jordan of the St. Louis
Cardinals, one of the National League's top hitters, worked with
prior to the start of the baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely worked every part of my body,'' said Law. ``I
thought we, as football players, were the most physical athletes in
the world, but I have a new respect for track. They are so specific
about every part of the body. In training for football, we're not
as conscious of that. They also do a hell of a lot more running
than we do. It was something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you brought us (football players) to train with them, half
of us wouldn't make it. It's different. Bob incorporated both
football and track into my regimen. It's not that I was slow. But
it was something I needed to do because I knew what my weaknesses
were and I just wanted to go and do something different.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't trying to denigrate Parker's program. In fact,
he praised Parker and said he would have gotten a lot out of his
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a different approach. I think you'll see more
football players doing this with Bob Kersee in the future. I know
that Terry Fair, the rookie cornerback, was also down there with me
before the draft. Hopefully, it'll pay off for me,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's seen film of Jones's mini-camps and has come away
impressed with the rookie's athleticism. But he warns that simply
being a great athlete doesn't always translate into becoming an NFL
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way he moves. He has great recovery speed,'' said
Law. ``It's different playing corner in NFL. There are a lot of
things to learn, but he has tremendous talent, great speed. He's
going to have an advantage because he's such a great talent. When
you can run a 4.3 and have a vertical leap like he has, that's half
the battle. But he has to learn. A guy like Terry Glenn is going to
show him some things he hasn't seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Law thinks this Patriots' camp should be more of a comfort for
the defense, which has now been together for two straight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Sid (assistant coach Steve Sidwell) will throw
something new at us,'' said Law. ``I think it's important that we
play well in our regular defense. If we're shutting teams down on
first and second down, then third down is going to be a party for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's also developed a respect and admiration for Pete
Carroll for the way the coach handled last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always gave Pete the benefit of the doubt in any situation
last year,'' said Law. ``He had a hell of a job to do. He's
somewhat like Drew in that he has all kinds of pressure. I tip my
hat to him. We almost got back there (the Super Bowl) again. We're
counting on him. I hope the Bill Parcells thing is over for him.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes his All-Pro snubs are finished, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can compete with any of those guys who are
All-Pro's,'' said Law. ``But it keeps me motivated. I'm going to
prove that I can be the best corner in football.''

JONES'S NEW FLOOR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roy Jones Jr. hasn't forgotten the first time he got
knocked flat. He won't forget the second time, either.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was 12 years old when an unseen heavy bag came swinging in
his direction and drove him to the floor of a gym in Pensacola,
Fla. It was more than a dozen years before it happened to him
again, when a similarly unseen straight left hand from World Boxing
Association light heavyweight champion Lou Del Valle sent him
sprawling on the seat of his pants for the first time in his
professional career Saturday night in the Theatre at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shocking moment in an otherwise one-sided unification
fight, and when it was over Jones had easily retained his World
Boxing Council share of the 175-pound crown as well as adding Del
Valle's WBA portion, but the fact that for a moment one of the best
fighters in the world was on the floor caused the kind of buzz that
few of Jones's 37 victories had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vulnerability is a good thing for a fighter,'' said HBO Sports
vice president of programming Lou DiBella after Jones (37-1) had
scrambled up from the eighth-round knockdown with a bemused look on
his face and resumed beating the tar out of Del Valle for the
remainder of their 12-round bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rap against Roy has been that he has no one to fight.
Well, tonight he had opposition and he stood up to it and I think
that makes him bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got knocked on his rear end. I still think he's the best
but I'm more interested in seeing him fight after that.''
</P>
<P>
   This was no flash knockdown. It was a perfect left hand from
behind a lead right jab and it cracked the side of Jones's chin and
buckled him the way an angry reader crumbles a newspaper. But no
sooner had he hit the floor than Jones was getting up, clutching
the ropes for a moment to regain his balance before cursing
himself. A chin that has seldom been hit in 38 fights had been
well-tested by a fighter who won the WBA title landing a similar
blow to the face of Eddy Smulders last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's mandible had passed the touch test, although later he
seemed to have little interest in a retest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me with a damn good shot,'' Jones admitted after
he'd won 11 of the 12 rounds in all three judges' opinions and was
deemed so in command by one that he refused to award Del Valle the
traditional 10-8 spread in the eighth because he had been battered
for most of it before the knockdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a licking and keep on ticking. I had a premonition I
would get lackadaisical and get knocked down. When I went down I
was shocked but when I got up I thought, `You knew this was coming
and you still let it happen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had started to lose my mental focus. I get lackadaisical
when I'm having my will a little bit. I'm not out there to kill
anybody so my mind kind of slows down. But I knew then I couldn't
let Lou push the issue. He's right when he says Roy doesn't like to
get hit. I still don't like to get hit.''
</P>
<P>
   After that knockdown he seldom did, although Del Valle's plan of
trying to nail Jones with straight lefts coming in out of his
southpaw style worked better than most people anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he couldn't do it often enough to win but what he
did accomplish was to show the world he was no accidental champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roy's a great fighter,'' Del Valle said. ``I'm a good fighter.
I got nothing bad to say about him. He's all that. I thought I was
going to get him but I gave him too much respect.''
</P>
<P>
   That respect was well earned. Jones repeatedly strafed Del Valle
(27-2) with nasty shots to the head and body, swelling his right
cheek early, knocking his mouthpiece to the floor, badly cutting
his left eyelid when the two accidentally clashed heads midway
through the fight and ultimately convincing him to throw fewer and
fewer punches because they were leading to brutal punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Del Valle made clear that he could stand up to Jones, taking his
best shots without buckling, but he could not avoid those shots and
over time they wore him down physically and broke him down
mentally.
</P>
<P>
   While his corner kept exhorting him to keep the pressure on and
throw that dangerous left more, Del Valle punched less, something
that often happens to even the best of fighters once they realize
it's not their night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so fast, you throw it out there and you pay for it,'' Del
Valle said. ``I didn't want to gamble like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones often was able to land whenever he chose and on several
occasions that led him to break into a wide grin in the midst of
one of his assaults, while the valiant Del Valle would take the
punches and then shake his head ``No,'' as if that alone could
negate their effect.
</P>
<P>
   It did not, but when he combined that willingness with the
sneaky left that sent Jones to a place he hadn't been in over a
decade, it did for him what none of his victories could.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of boxing is a guy can lose a fight like this and
be elevated,'' DiBella said. ``People know Lou Del Valle can fight
now. He can go to Europe and make a lot of money. He lost his title
but he gained something, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Jones. He gained a tiny crack of vulnerability that may
make it easier to land a final unification bout with International
Boxing Federation champion Reggie Johnson after Jones fights a
required match with former WBC interim champion Gianfranco
Rocchigiani in December.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean Jones will lose to anyone but it may convince
opponents like Johnson and IBF middleweight champion Bernard
Hopkins that it's worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, his trip to the floor was worth taking.

MANY UNIVERSITIES ARE GOING `VIRTUAL' _ CLASSROOMS WITHOUT
WALLS  VIA INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAMELA BURDMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the University of Colorado at Denver put
courses online to boost its adult education program last year,
almost 80 percent of those who enrolled turned out to be on-campus
undergraduates who preferred the convenience of logging on at
midnight to waking up for an 8 a.m. lecture.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  It wasn't what officials expected, but it may have been a
glimpse of their future. All across the country, going to college
is acquiring a whole new meaning as higher education undergoes a
virtual transformation, one that some predict will make traditional
campuses the dinosaurs of the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted by physical location or summer breaks, the cyber
classes have captured the imagination of college leaders and public
officials seeking to educate more students for less money. Even
corporate executives are eyeing a piece of the higher-education
market, worth several hundred billion dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   But critics are questioning the very premise that more high-tech
is better when it comes to education. They worry that colleges are
forgetting the merits of a traditional college education in favor
of simply dispensing information and churning out degrees. How,
they ask, will virtual colleges help students learn how to interact
with others and become good citizens?
</P>
<P>
   ``This step in the electronic direction is . . . a
depersonalizing of education,'' said Ed Condren, a Chaucer scholar
at UCLA. ``It suggests that facts or degrees make one an educated
person _ instead of considered thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Distance learning has been around for years, through
correspondence courses, satellite television and CD-ROMs. Many,
perhaps most, college classes already use e-mail communication and
Web sites with multimedia teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   But virtual classrooms go a big step further, completely
replacing face-to-face sessions with online lectures, reading
assignments and discussion groups. Some of them are self-paced, but
often groups of students proceed through assignments on roughly the
same schedule. That allows for continuous, though asynchronous,
classroom discussion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pioneers of this approach to learning is the
for-profit University of Phoenix, with online headquarters in San
Francisco and nearly 4,000 students in virtual classes. Students
are also taking entire courses online at many of the nation's
traditional institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
   California schools are among those moving most aggressively into
the new domain, through alliances with high-tech corporations. And
they are proceeding so quickly that experts can only speculate
about how many students are taking courses online.
</P>
<P>
   -- At UC Berkeley Extension, about 1,300 students are taking
courses via America Online, and Dean Mary Metz says the school
hopes to have enrolled a total of 5,000 by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   -- At UCLA, about 750 students were enrolled in about 220
extension courses this spring through the Home Education Network,
which was recently renamed OnlineLearning.Net. According to
President John Kobara, the company has the rights to put all 4,500
UCLA Extension courses on the Internet, though some faculty members
dispute that.
</P>
<P>
   -- At Golden Gate University in San Francisco, 600 students are
taking 30 summer courses through the school's CyberCampus. Golden
Gate has used the services of two Bay Area companies _ Convene and
Well-Engaged _ to deliver the courses. Before long, speculates
Provost Chris Lefferts, half of the university's students could be
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Association of Schools and Colleges has already
accredited 30 virtual degree programs on the West Coast, including
a doctoral program in Transformative Learning and Change at the
California Institute of Integral Studies and a master's program in
nursing leadership at Sonoma State University.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those courses are available via the California Virtual
University, an electronic catalog of online courses at 89
accredited schools throughout the state. CVU was started by
Governor Pete Wilson to promote virtual education by bringing the
state's world-class universities together with leading high-tech
and entertainment companies.
</P>
<P>
   CVU was designed to compete for students with the Western
Governors' University, an institution formed by 17 other states and
Guam. But there is one big difference: WGU will grant degrees,
while the California program works as an information bank to help
students locate courses and degree programs in the state that are
offered online.
</P>
<P>
   Both CVU and WGU were touted as ways to teach more students with
less money. But so far the cost savings are theoretical at best.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges typically don't even know how much money they are
spending on information technology, said Christopher Oberg of the
Claremont Graduate University, a former college administrator. ``We
are loath to find out what it costs, because we fear the answer
will make us look silly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Rand Corporation concluded that colleges could
trim costs by replacing faculty with technology, but author David
McArthur said most schools are reluctant to do that because they're
trying to prove the online medium works through more teacher
contact, not less. Designing courses on the Web is also more
expensive _ anywhere from $20,000 to $3 million per course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distance learning is a wildfire,'' said Michael Lambert of the
Distance Education and Training Council. ``It's going to cost three
times as much if you continue along this current track.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts on the new techniques insist that, done right,
online learning involves more, not less, teacher-student
interaction than traditional classes _ the very reason why it's not
necessarily cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more work,'' said Golden Gate University Associate
Dean Mary Canning, who teaches a course in taxation online. ``My
students have to e-mail their assignments to me on a weekly basis,
then I mail back comments on their assignments. In the classroom, I
can tell by their faces when I'm losing somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Harisim, a professor at Simon Fraser University in
Vancouver and director of a study of distance learning methods
throughout Canada, reports that students actually participate more
online.
</P>
<P>
   That's because in traditional classrooms, the professor uses 80
percent of the allotted time and a handful of students dominate the
rest, said Harisim. Online courses, on the other hand, allow more
participation by students who are shy, speak a foreign language or
are slow to formulate their ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Harisim worked with a group of graduate students who actually
preferred the virtual classroom to the real thing. ``They said they
got to know one another better,'' she recalled. ``They said it was
a meeting of minds. They got to know what everyone was thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   While traditionalists insist that the best learning can only
happen in a classroom, Harisim said even poor online classes may be
no worse than large lecture courses in which students never so much
as look a professor in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Whether particular programs are up to snuff ultimately will be
decided by accreditors. But Steven Crow of the North Central
Association of Colleges and Schools, an accrediting association in
Chicago, said accreditors generally accept the premise of online
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly concerned about the quality of learning
that can be delivered through the Internet any more than I'm
concerned about the quality delivered through sending out CD-ROMs
or videotapes, and those things have been going on for a long
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research to date suggests that Crow has good reason to be
optimistic. ``In study after study,'' said Langdon Winner of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York, ``what is found is
that some students do a little better, some students do a little
worse, and for the rest there is no significant difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts say the real virtue of the virtual classroom lies
not in cutting costs, but in expanding access to a college-age
population that over the next decade will increase by 3 million
students nationwide, including nearly half a million in California.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Rodota, Wilson's deputy chief of staff, said it is still
unclear how many of those ``Tidal Wave II'' students the state can
realistically educate online. ``A significant portion of those
enrollments will be addressed through distance education,'' he
said, ``but the definition of significant is yet to be known.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainties, many governors seem confident that
the public's money is better spent creating virtual colleges than
building campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey by the Education Commission of the States, a
majority of governors said they place a high value on technologies
that let students take classes any time, anywhere. Few stressed the
need for students to have a traditional on-campus experience.
</P>
<P>
   Of 35 governors who responded to the survey, 34 said technology
is their first-choice strategy for improving access to a college
education.
</P>
<P>
   This thinking is already beginning to play out:
</P>
<P>
   CSU's newest campus, on the old Fort Ord site in Monterey Bay,
has plans to enroll a majority of its projected 25,000 students
online. And though UC is planning a 10th campus, in Merced, that
campus is being designed with cyber-age technologies in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Such stories leave some professors suspicious that the move
toward electronic learning is a thinly veiled way to automate
education, turn courses into widgets and lay off faculty members.
At the very least, they say, these plans for undergraduates seem
inconsistent with the oft-stated purpose of virtual classrooms: to
reach those adults who can't spare the time from work or family to
visit a college campus.
</P>
<P>
   In interview after interview, students, teachers and parents
said that going to college with live professors is an option that
shouldn't go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like edutainment or Socrates with a soundtrack,''
said Maria Quintero, who just finished her junior year at Pomona
College. ``We want flesh-and-blood professors _ people to inspire
us, to infuriate us, to motivate us.`
</P>
<P>
   Though fewer of today's college students are 18- to
24-year-olds, the idea of those students going to school online
gives pause even to fans of the virtual campus.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Frey, 40, of Gualala, a student at Golden Gate's
CyberCampus, is a case in point. Because she lives two hours from
the nearest college campus, the Internet made it possible for her
to pursue a master's degree _ and made her a devotee of virtual
learning.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't even consider that option when her 18-year-old
daughter was looking into colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``An 18-year-old needs that feeling of campus life and what it's
like to go to college,'' said Frey. ``If everything is online, they
don't have a chance to broaden their horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   Even cyber enthusiasts say the medium has its limits. ``I
wouldn't want to teach an acting class over the Web,'' said
Lefferts of Golden Gate University. ``I would not want to teach
crisis-intervention skills over the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Michael Lambert of the Distance Education and Training
Council: ``The adult learner loves it, but I have three sons, and I
would not want them to be distance learners.''
</P>
<P>
   Few believe that campuses will be discarded altogether, and most
experts think the college education of the future will include some
combination of online and on-campus instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, I think we'll always have campuses,'' said Sally
Johnstone of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education
in Colorado. ``We have to send these children away. There's more
that goes on at a campus than listening to a faculty member.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would question whether 10, 15 years from now it will be
the norm that a kid goes to a campus for four or five years. What's
so magical about that?''

OH, MY SPLITTING CHECK! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIMAYO, N.M._ If you count the four margaritas and two orders
of tortilla chips and salsa _ which, of course, we did count, there
being no legal way around it _ the six of us consumed $85.85 worth
of eats for dinner one recent evening here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To which you also must add $5.05 in sales tax, which, naturally,
was added automatically to the bill here at the Rancho de Chimayo
restaurant just east of Espanola, which is half an hour north of
Santa Fe, which is an hour north of Albuquerque. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And if you don't know where Chimayo is by now I'm not going to
help you any more. In the first place, locating Chimayo is taking
up way too much space here. Second, it doesn't matter half a hoot
where we ate. Where we ate is not the point, if there really is any
point to this, which I'm beginning to doubt and which you must have
started doubting at least two paragraphs back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can look up Chimayo on a map. (It's not far from
Taos.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, then. The bill, as you could figure out if only your math
skills were equal to those of an energetic third grader, was
$90.90, which, like $85.85, had a nice but meaningless symmetry to
it. (In fact, both amounts made me wish we had eaten, instead, in
Pago Pago or Walla Walla.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had not asked for separate checks. The subject never arose.
We were too busy speaking of such things as the merits of frozen
margaritas versus margaritas on ice. (I considered it a harmless
way tequila few minutes.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, naturally, when the bill came we had to confront what has
become an increasingly common American dilemma _ whether to divide
a dinner check among friends by exactly how much each person
ordered or simply divide the total by the number of diners. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters will tell you that Americans are all strung out about
education, racism, Iraq, the environment and Bill Clinton's pants.
And maybe some of them are _ the 347 people who ever talk to
pollsters. The rest of us are in knots over more difficult issues,
such as how to divide a restaurant check. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If I had access to reliable statistics here in northern New
Mexico, I'd look up how often your average American dines out now
compared with, say 25 years ago. I know it's more, but I don't have
any statistics. Statistics are illegal in New Mexico. It's one
reason I've fallen in love with the place. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the rate of dining out increases (it may have something to do
with why pollsters can never find anyone at home except the same
347 people), the dilemma of how to divide the check grows.
Unfortunately, politicians refuse to address the question. I'm
sorry. I erred. I said ``unfortunately.'' I meant ``fortunately.''
It must have been the frozen margarita. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of ways people approach the problem of restaurant
check-splitting. But first someone must pick it up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have verified none of these stories, but have heard of dinner
parties that have sat for up to six months before anyone cracked
and picked up the check. One reason is that whoever grabs it first
becomes the presumed expert. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell us what we owe,'' is the first thing the check-grabber
hears. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I refuse to cave in to such weasels. In fact, at Rancho de
Chimayo I picked up the check first _ and only an hour or two after
it appeared. I pretended to ponder it with intensity. I furrowed my
brow. I cluck-clucked a little. I shook my head. Once or twice I
even said, ``Hmmmm.'' Finally the man next to me fell for it. He
could stand it no longer and asked to see the bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He pretended to ponder it. He furrowed his brow. He
cluck-clucked, shook his head and said ``Hmmmm'' once or twice. It
was a ridiculous performance. I was ashamed of him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The check made its way around the table this way. And when it
got back to me the next evening it was accompanied by a $20 bill,
which I naturally considered a gift from God. But as I was about to
pocket it with a prayer of thanks, the woman who had placed it
there said that although she probably had change coming, she was
willing to donate the whole $20 to the cause. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing what a generous spirit will do. Before I knew it,
$20 bills _ none counterfeit, so far as I know _ were pouring in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I kept all the cash and put the whole thing on a charge card.
When the bill comes I'll send a copy to everyone at the table with
a note about how much each owes. Not many margaritas were consumed
this night, but my hope is they were powerful enough for this to
work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   DROUGHT-TEXAS (Brownsville, Texas) _ The most compelling tale of
how the drought is affecting Texas farmers and the towns they live
in. In the Texas Panhandle, the drought has wiped out 1.5 million

likely to reduce vegetable plants by 50 percent, and the drought
threatens the citrus crop. By JENALIA MORENO.
</P>
<P>
   DROUGHT-OVERVIEW (Houston) _ An overview on how drought is
hurting farmers raising crops from cotton to corn already. The lack

percent and is beginning to force ranchers to sell off cattle
early, driving down prices. By NELSON ANTOSH and JENALIA MORENO.
</P>
<P>
   COP-CROOK (Albany, N.Y.) _ Gary Evans is the confessed killer of
five men. Jim Horton is a senior state police investigator with a
illustrious string of arrests in major cases. The two have had a

Evans case has raised questions about whether the suspect was
coddled over the years. By MIKE HUREWITZ.
</P>
<P>
   MURDER-HIRE-GIRLFRIEND (Brownsville, Texas) _ Cristina Cisneros
has never been charged with a crime. But just before a Houston jury
convicted her mother of arranging the murder-for-hire of Cristina's
ex-boyfriend, prosecutors said Cristina was aware of what her
mother had done and that she had accompanied her to pay the blood
money. Who is Cristina Cisneros and what was her involvement in the
killing of Joey Fischer? By JAMES PINKERTON.

building a global powerhouse when he testified before a U.S. Senate

step toward removing the word `regional' from the way SBC is
described and giving this country a global competitor,'' Whitacre
said. By SANFORD NOWLIN.

role in his intense World War II drama because of that seriousness.

   TROY-DONAHUE (San Francisco) _ Troy Donahue sat pool-side at the
Hotel del Sol in the Marina, tan as ever, a little on the thin

the hammocks in the courtyard, squinting back 40 years to see
himself in ``A Summer Place.'' By EDVINS BEITIKS.

   BBN-McGWIRE (San Francisco) _ Four years after baseball tried to
ruin itself by canceling the World Series, a larger-than-life force

It's a 6-foot-5-inch, 253-pound, red-haired giant with 20-inch
biceps who, by chasing one of baseball's most storied records in a
Bunyanesque way, has breathed life into a sport badly in need of
some fresh air. By MARK FAINARU-WADA.

The fire sales were to be in full force by now, with the July 31
trade deadline right around the corner. But a funny thing happened
on their way to oblivion. They began winning, and now they're
baseball's hottest teams. By JOHN SHEA.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ A wildlife mystery was solved
last week with the discovery of what first appeared to be a
500-pound bird. This episode started when a pilot with the
Department of Fish and Game picked up a signal from a ground-based
radio transmitter, identifying it as the same frequency emitted by
a radio collar banded on an endangered marbled murrelet. By TOM
STIENSTRA.
</P>
<P>

   TRAVEL-VEGAS-WEDDINGS (Las Vegas) _ More than 200,000 people
exchanged vows last year in Las Vegas, home to about 50 wedding
chapels. Fast and cheap is still a main lure _ and Elvis

</P>
<P>
   JUDGE-DRUGS (San Jose, Calif.) _ As a young police officer, I
had no patience or sympathy for alcohol and other drug abusers.
Now, as a trial judge handling criminal, juvenile and family law
cases, experience and education have shown me a side to the problem
that many in Washington or Sacramento choose to ignore or are
politically afraid to acknowledge. By EUGENE M. HYMAN.

MONICA AND ME, DEPOSED IN WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
 -HNS   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Where were the cameras, the legal analysts and Matt
Drudge? After all, I was being deposed with no one to leak
testimony to but myself.
</P>
<P>
   So what if there are no interns? I was giving a deposition last
week in a case the New York Times called a ``key test of freedom to
use the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, I want to be a media celebrity, too. I want a book deal.
</P>
<P>
   I'm one of eight plaintiffs involved in an American Civil
Liberties Union lawsuit against the Loudoun County, Va., public
library system because my newspaper's Web sites were blocked. The
filtering device is supposed to keep children from viewing porn
when they use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a prude and a technophobe. So what am I doing here?
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the deposition I had to examine some of my
columns on a laptop computer and I couldn't even get the cursor to
move. I had to have a laptop consultation with my lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The filtering device, called X-Stop, supposedly blocks obscene
Web sites, but censors the darndest things, like the San Francisco
Examiner and the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I got involved. I thought it was funny.
</P>
<P>
   Other blocked Web sites include those of such leading
``pornographers'' as the Quakers, the Yale University Biology
Department and the American Association of University Women.
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're thinking. If you were a parent in Loudoun
County, you wouldn't want your kids reading about what goes on in
San Francisco either.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, I laughed too _ until I was deposed.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, for the days when the word ``deposed'' applied only to
dictators. These days it's the in thing inside the Beltway. Now I
know what Monica, Linda and Bill have been going through.
</P>
<P>
   You have to sit down with your lawyer and, under oath, answer
questions posed by the lawyer from the other side. The idea is to
say as little as possible. That's impossible for me.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer representing Loudoun County was courtly during the
two-hour session, but he was still going for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did that column run?''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. They all run together.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what Bill Clinton feels like when asked to match
dates and interns?
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the Examiner print obscene material?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing I could think of besides some City Hall deals and
mayoral quotes about toilet tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm a plaintiff in this case, the last thing I want to
be is a leaker. But this wasn't a grand jury. I believe Ken Starr
has no interest in me. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   So I can leak a few details about my deposition.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the lawyer asked if I recognized my page in the
on-line Examiner. I said it looked right, but I didn't know because
I'd never called it up.
</P>
<P>
   He asked who would know. I said my sister in Seattle, because
she actually reads the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer pressed me on how I knew the Examiner and my column
were blocked in the Loudoun County libraries, except for what the
ACLU told me.
</P>
<P>
   I said I'd called a Loudoun librarian, but she said she wasn't
allowed to talk. How do you know if your Web page is censored in
any of a million libraries?
</P>
<P>
   At least Henry Miller got a letter from his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, one of my co-plaintiffs is John Ockerbloom, who
publishes banned books on his Web site. I ran into him
post-deposition and asked what Loudoun County had done to James
Joyce's ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's banned again,'' he said. This time electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ulysses'' is available in print in the Leesburg branch of the
Loudoun County library system, however. I saw it listed in their
electronic card catalog, which had easy-to-follow instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I couldn't see if the Examiner is still blocked.
The librarian said I needed a library card to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While I was in charming colonial Leesburg, I stopped by the
offices of the weekly Leesburg Today, and talked to reporter Jan
Schroeder, who has been covering the case that has torn the county
asunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The membership of the library board has changed significantly
in the last couple of weeks, and there may be a change in policy on
the filtering devices,'' she said. ``I don't know how this will
affect the lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the suit will go away. Loudoun County has a growing
population and needs books and librarians. No one needs an
expensive lawsuit and incompetent bluenose software.
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to go to court, even a guy who can get another
column out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The day after being deposed, I watched 50 photographers outside
the federal courthouse waiting to take yet another picture of Linda
Tripp. As if one picture isn't more than enough.
</P>
<P>
   So many tourists bug the photographers that they've printed
signs saying: ``We are here to cover the Ken Starr grand jury.
Monica Lewinsky is not appearing. Appearing today is ...''
</P>
<P>
   My name will never fill that blank. I'm involved in a case with
no sex, just devices claiming to expunge sex. It's not Monica, it's
just the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God I wasn't allowed to try to find my Web page in the
Leesburg library. I would have had to ask the librarian for help.
</P>

`TRACKERS' CAN AID IN HUNT FOR PROFITS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the merger of AT&AMP;T and Tele-Communications Inc. goes through
as planned _ and that's not a sure thing _ it is expected to spawn
an intriguing investment option.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a class of stock that behaves like the cable company.
In the best of all worlds, it would offer the growth of cable
without the monstrous debt loads that long have been a part of that
growth business.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T will issue two so-called ``tracking stocks'' when the deal
closes.
</P>
<P>
   One will track its Liberty Media Corp. division, which provides
programming services to the cable operations. The other tracking
stock will follow AT&AMP;T's consumer business. The main AT&AMP;T stock
will focus on the wholesale and commercial phone business.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of tracking stocks. These securities are
normally created by gigantic, diversified corporations, which
believe that they own divisions that would be worth a lot more if
they were independent. They dearly want to hold on to those gems,
so instead they create tracking stocks.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, the markets don't reward those big companies
for owning a highly profitable, growing division because that
operation may be buried inside a behemoth with less-than-stellar
results in an out-of-favor industry.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. pioneered the idea back in the days it
personified the problems of the Rust Belt by issuing tracking stock
for Electronic Data Systems Corp. before that was spun off.
</P>
<P>
   GM still has a tracking stock for its Hughes Electronics Corp.
subsidiary. That stock is called ``General Motors H'' with the
stock symbol of GMH. The ``H'' stock name explains why tracking
stock also is called a ``letter'' stock.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Marathon Oil is a tracking stock for its parent
company, USX Corp., which is the holding company that owns U.S.
Steel.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of investing in a tracking stock is that you often
get a growth company that comes with a big name behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tracker is a growth company,'' said Eileen Connolly, AT&AMP;T
spokeswoman. ``People who own the tracker are believing that the
value of that company as a growth company will appreciate over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   That belief helped finance massive growth at Electronic Data
Systems and could allow TCI to enter the lucrative but hugely
expensive telephone world.
</P>
<P>
   In AT&AMP;T's case, its new division also ``gets to take advantage
of its AT&AMP;T brand name,'' Connolly said.
</P>
<P>
   A tracking stock enables you to sharpen your investment focus
because you can invest in just a division of a company instead of
its parent.
</P>
<P>
   In Marathon Oil's case, ``if someone wants to invest in USX, but
they're really only interested in the oil part of the business,
they can invest in the oil part of the business,'' said Bill
Keslar, USX spokesman. ``It's a pure play.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks also help companies keep overhead costs in line
because they share top management with their parent companies.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks are unusual, so they may sell for a discount
because Wall Street doesn't understand them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where there is confusion, there is opportunity,'' said
Jonathan Schoolar, senior portfolio manager at Aim Capital
Management in Houston, a mutual fund company. ``If you're willing
to do all the work, if you're willing to track down the assumptions
and make judgments about them, it's possible that you have a very
inefficiently priced stock simply because a lot of people can't get
their arms around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracking stocks aren't the easiest thing to understand because
not many experts follow them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have sectors that are not as well followed, it can
create opportunities, but it just means that the individual
investor probably needs to do a lot more research and digging
around to find out exactly what these tracking stocks are all
about,'' said Lynn Bernard Jr., executive vice president of global
investment strategies at Pinnacle Management &AMP; Trust in Houston, a
money management firm.

DROUGHT MAY CHANGE FARMING IN SOUTH TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENALIA MORENO 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ In the Rio Grande Valley, farmers are
facing the worst drought in more than 40 years _ a drought that is
expected not only to ruin most crops this year, but one that may
change the farming landscape here forever.
</P>
<P>
   Wracked by a succession of crippling freezes, droughts and
floods in recent years, many farmers are expected to give up, move
or dramatically cut back their operations.
</P>
<P>
   Oranges lie on the ground, completely rotted. Cotton is little
more than dead stalks, with a few clinging cotton bolls. Cornstalks
are dry and brittle, and sugar cane is only half the size it should
be at this time in the season.
</P>
<P>
   From grapefruit to grain sorghum, corn to cotton, the Lower Rio
Grande Valley benefits from the rich soil of the Rio Grande and a
growing season that is nearly year-round. It is a region that has
two of the state's most agriculturally productive counties _ Starr
and Hidalgo. And rain is its lifeblood.
</P>
<P>
   That it hasn't rained appreciably for more than four months is
potentially devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's representative of the situation that many of the
counties are going to be in,'' said Jason Johnson, an extension
economist at the Texas Agricultural Extension Service in Weslaco.
</P>
<P>
   Early estimates suggest South Texas farmers already have lost
$160 million, while cattle ranchers have lost $40 million. And
those figures will continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
   To recoup some of their losses, some farmers simply will move
all or part of their operations to Mexico to take advantage of
cheaper land and labor and fewer environmental and governmental
regulations. Some big growers from South Texas already have begun
to move their farms south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have decided to weather the crisis are facing a
difficult decision _ which of their crops they will save with their
remaining water.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, farmers have relied on irrigation water from
Amistad and Falcon reservoirs. However, water levels in the two
reservoirs are 22 percent of what they should be. Since 1994, the
nearly two dozen water districts in the Valley have placed their
farmers on water allocations.
</P>
<P>
   Four of those districts are now out of water, and most are
nearly dry. If the reservoirs drop to 11 percent, officials have
threatened to cut off water completely for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Sparks, a farmer near Mercedes, grows sugar cane, cotton,
corn and grain sorghum. What's left of his cotton crop will be
ready for harvest in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty much a disaster,'' Sparks said, pulling a
cotton stalk out of ground that has not been irrigated.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks is a second-generation farmer whose brother lives nearby.
Farming is the only thing he knows how to do and he's been doing if
for 25 years, he said, as he drove a pickup truck down a levee that
goes to some of his land. Dust from the dry road billows behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, 44, leases all of his 6,000 acres, some from retired
farmers, some from corporations and others from widows.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the land would be too expensive, and he can't afford to
make that kind of commitment to land where the results are so
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   His sugar cane crop, which requires vast supplies of water, will
not be ready for harvest until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm out of water in two (irrigation) districts and two other
districts, I have just a smidgen left, and I'm saving that for
sugar cane,'' Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't rain soon, he may have to break some of his leases
just to break even.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to pick and choose which crops you are going to save
and which you are going to have to give up,'' Sparks said, sticking
his boot into the gaping cracks in the ground near his sugar cane
field. ``That's something you never had to do in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst drought I've ever seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Duda, a general manager at Duda Valley Onions in
McAllen, said his company has cut in half the number of acres on
which it is growing crops. The company grows mostly onions, but
also some cabbage, bell peppers, celery, parsley and cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   If it does not rain by December, many of the Valley's citrus
trees will be so stressed that they will produce little healthy
fruit for as long as two years, predicts Ray Prewett, executive
vice president of the Texas Citrus Mutual trade association. Some
trees will die, and many farmers will not replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Because of two recent freezes that killed many trees, less than
33,000 acres of citrus groves remain in the Valley, Prewett said.
That is about 1,500 acres fewer than South Texas had before a 1989
freeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that if we had a lot of trees that went
out, they would never be replanted,'' Prewett said. ``The citrus
industry would never recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not so surprising, there are a lot of people seeking
divine intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks is praying that it won't rain for the next few weeks,
because precipitation could ruin his cotton crop by discoloring the
open bolls.
</P>
<P>
   He said his dry land, or non-irrigated, cotton is so poor he'll
lose money on it. While he should profit from irrigated cotton, he
wouldn't estimate how much those fields would yield.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got half the people praying for rain, the other half for
it not to rain. I guess they're stronger,'' Duda said.

TEXAS GROWERS FACE AN `ARMAGEDDON' WITH FIELDS STRICKEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NELSON ANTOSH 
and JENALIA MORENO 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Farmers have been cursed by either too little or too
much rain for three years running.
</P>
<P>
   This year it is too dry _ withering crops on dry land fields and
even stunting the growth in some irrigated ones.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, too much rain delayed planting, then a dry spell hurt
many farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, farmers lived through a severe drought that
caused $1.9 billion worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   The economic blows will be more than many Texas farmers can
take, according to a major lender. The worst situation is 1.6
million acres in the South Plains around Lubbock where seeds never
really sprouted.
</P>
<P>
   For local growers the 1998 drought is ``as serious as
Armageddon,'' says Don Goldston, president of the El Campo
Production Credit Association, the primary supplier of crop loans
in an area from Houston to Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   This year could be the final one for as many as 15 to 20
percent, he predicts. The exact number won't be known until late
fall or winter.
</P>
<P>
   Yields were mediocre in the 1996 drought year, Goldston said,
and last year was even worse because rains caused late planting,
followed by a brief drought, then rain during the harvest period.
</P>
<P>
   In Willacy County in South Texas, 17 percent of farmers quit the
business after a drought two years ago. This year's drought could
drive out 25 percent of the farmers in this county with little
irrigation.
</P>
<P>
   This year's low crop prices compound the effects of the drought.
Local farmers who harvest 35 or 40 bushels of corn per acre will
get only $2.25 per bushel if they can sell it at all, Goldston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the heat and drought, much of the corn contains
aflatoxin, a mold that is carcinogenic. If the corn has more than
300 parts per billion, elevators will reject it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing corn with 300, 500, 700 and even 1,000 parts per
billion'' of the toxin, Goldston said. At such levels, the corn
must be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   As the result of the double whammy of drought and low prices,
Congress is considering a $500 million disaster assistance program.
It will help, but that won't go very far across the entire nation,
Goldston said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at Texas A&AMP;M University calculate that the drought
has thus far caused $1.5 billion in direct losses to farmers since
a high-pressure ridge from Mexico shut off the faucet.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are expected to escalate as ranchers become
affected. As of last week, 126 counties were in the process of
seeking disaster declarations, which would make farmers and
ranchers eligible for low-interest federal loans.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lower Rio Grande Valley, this makes four bad years in a
row. ``We are fixing to have a big train wreck down here. Farmers
are hanging by the last thread of the rope,'' said Melinda Berg,
manager of the Elsa Co-Op Gin.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of rain there since planting time in mid-February to
mid-March has been ``not a drop,'' Berg said. The prospects are
much better for the 60 to 65 percent of the cotton in that vicinity
that is irrigated. Ginning is just starting there.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of some scattered showers in West Texas, the
near-term prospects for rain are slim, according to Joel Burgio,
senior meteorologist for Weather Services Corp. in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't likely to be much change from the current hot and
dry weather for ``at least the next couple of weeks,'' Burgio said.
</P>
<P>
   The high pressure parked almost directly over Texas during May
and June, Burgio said. It has since drifted westward, with the
center over California, he said, but it still influences Texas
weather.
</P>
<P>
   This upper level ridge, at about 15,000 feet, began with El Nino
but took on a life of its own even as El Nino weakened, Burgio
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of perpetuates itself,'' said Burgio. The feedback
mechanism works by drying the soil, which allows the scorching sun
to make the soil hotter than if it were moist. This heat radiates
back into the atmosphere, which reinforces the high pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The high pressure ridge could last for another month, or even a
month and a half, he predicts.
</P>
<P>
   Not even irrigation can protect crops from scorching heat of
over 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M experts are predicting a 15 percent reduction in yield
for the irrigated cornfields of the Panhandle because the heat
interfered with pollination, which is needed to produce corn. The
stalks are tall and green, but the ears don't have as many grains
on the cob as they should, said Ronald Smith, associate head of the
Department of Agricultural Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't normally expect yields to be impacted that
greatly,'' he said, ``but we got no help from Mother Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   The drought's duration across the state is still short by
historical standards, but the damage estimates are high because it
coincided almost exactly with the time that farmers had to have
rain for spring-planted crops. ``When it stopped raining in March,
it really stopped,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest estimates of direct damage to farmers are $500
million for cotton, $330 million for forage crops, $225 million for
corn, $140 million for grain sorghum, $136 million in added feed
cost for livestock, $100 million for horticultural crops and $44
million for livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on the state's overall economy is estimated at $4.6
billion. About 40,000 people in the state will lose their jobs as a
result of the drought, according to Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in the Valley facing hard times are repairing old
equipment to keep it running, while sales of new machinery have
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is off even for the farmers who had a fair
crop,'' said Earl Neuhaus, owner of Barbee-Neuhaus Implement in
Weslaco.
</P>
<P>
   He's not ordering any more tractors or other big equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big-ticket items that require a commitment are not being
sold. Farmers are not going to make any purchases,'' Neuhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchers are worried a continued drought could cause a price
collapse by sending large numbers of cattle to market.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the price for calves is down slightly, but that is a
more of a reaction to low prices for fattened steers rather than to
the drought, said Ernest Davis, livestock marketing specialist at
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of East Texas and South Texas, pastures and
ranges are dry, but it's not bad enough to force mass sell-offs,
Davis said. The big herd sell-offs will occur this fall if there is
no rain, he predicts. In any event, the impact on price won't be as
great as in 1996 because there are fewer cattle on ranches now than
then, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the grass dries up and prospects for making hay turn bleak,
the prices paid at auctions for cow-calf pairs _ which are bought
for breeding _ have plummeted. Pairs that brought $800 to $900 are
now fetching $500 and less, because buyers are reluctant to take
home new mouths to feed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place to go with them,'' said J.D. Sartwelle Jr.
of Port City Stockyards in Sealy.

A NEW CHAPTER IN ZEPPELIN HISTORY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A harsh, late-afternoon sun was toasting passengers on the open
deck of a ferry hugging the German shore of Lake Constance.
</P>
<P>
   Far removed from the pressures of work and home, the co-pilot
and I had spent a glorious day leisurely exploring almost the
length of an inland sea so vast that its borders touch three
nations: Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the crowded boat progressed slowly westward from Lindau
toward our base in Constance, we sipped from glasses of wine whose
roots existed in one of many gently sloping vineyards beside
hauntingly beautiful towns _ perhaps Nonnenhorn or Meersburg _
along our route.
</P>
<P>
   And then we saw the airship. In the lower sky directly ahead.
Above Friedrichshafen.
</P>
<P>
   Were our minds playing tricks? Were the grapes that
intoxicating? Friedrichshafen, we knew, is the lake-front village
where Count Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin assembled the first
dirigible airship. But that was 98 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though Count von Zeppelin imagined his creation both as a
long-lasting favored mode of international transportation and as a
critical element of military strategy, other aviation advances soon
diminished the Zeppelin's practical value. Then, on May 6, 1937,
following its much-touted first transatlantic flight, the
Hindenburg _ built in Friedrichshafen _ exploded and burned,
killing 36 people, as it tried to land in Lakehurst, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The era of the Zeppelin was effectively over. Production all but
shut down following the Hindenburg disaster. And relentless bombing
in World War II destroyed industrial Friedrichshafen.
</P>
<P>
   So what was this in the sky?
</P>
<P>
   We squinted into the sun as the boat advanced toward the harbor.
Toward a huge craft _ it was no mirage _ that resembled a Goodyear
blimp.
</P>
<P>
   Now the airship was hovering directly ahead. Then making
circles, seemingly teasing passengers on the boat whose pace was
considerably slower. This was obviously not a routine sight because
the German passengers were frantically seeking out the best camera
angles.
</P>
<P>
   As the craft passed our starboard side, we could make out words:
Zeppelin NT LZ N07.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, it was on our port side. More words: Stuttgart
Hofbrau. Even if German-made Zeppelins and U.S. blimps fly 4,500
miles apart, they share a common commercial bond.
</P>
<P>
   For half an hour, maybe longer, the Zeppelin followed our path,
then retreated as we continued toward Constance, where we were
headquartered in the Inselhotel, an establishment steeped in
history for two main reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ From 1235 to 1785, it was the location of a Dominican
monastery.
</P>
<P>
   _ And this was where, in 1838, Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin was
born.
</P>
<P>
   By then, we were too immersed in Zeppelin lore to let the events
of the afternoon pass without learning more. And sure enough, we
know now that the NT (for New Technology) LZ N07, the first
Zeppelin constructed in six decades, was launched within the past
year and is conducting test flights over Lake Constance this summer
_ as the forerunner of an advanced generation of airships.
</P>
<P>
   Built by the reborn Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik company in
Friedrichshafen, it utilizes three rotatable engines, can attain
heights of 8,000 feet and travels at speeds of almost 90 mph _
faster than conventional blimps. Though maintaining the same basic
shape and framework as the original Zeppelins, this NT model is
held aloft by helium, an inert gas, rather than by the highly
flammable hydrogen that was inside the Hindenburg.
</P>
<P>
   The first new-age Zeppelin, 247 1/2 feet long and 49 1/2 feet
wide, is designed to carry 12 passengers and two crew members. Once
the airship is certified for commercial passenger flight _ probably
early next year _ a Swiss company, Skyship Cruise, plans short
excursions and intra-European commuter flights.
</P>
<P>
   Though tickets are not yet being sold and pricing isn't
established, persons interested in a flight can put their name on a
list by accessing http://www.zeppelin-nt.com on the Internet and
following instructions. That Web site and
http://www.plaza.ch/skyship (Skyship Cruise) are good sources for
information.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the beginning. Plans are to build at least 10 NT
Zeppelins. Projections are that future airships may carry as many
as 86 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The airship's history is celebrated at the 2-year-old Zeppelin
Museum located in the former harbor station only steps removed from
the Friedrichshafen boat dock. The museum houses the world's
largest collection on the history of dirigibles; the most popular
attraction is a partial reconstruction of the Hindenburg, including
its passenger cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, a new chapter in Zeppelin history is being written in
the sky above. &QL;

SPIELBERG, HANKS: TOGETHER AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Steven Spielberg is the most successful filmmaker in
the world. Tom Hanks is one of the biggest stars. So why have they
never worked together before ``Saving Private Ryan?''
</P>
<P>
   Because they like each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always worried about going into business with
friends,'' Hanks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very good friends, and our wives are inseparable,''
said Spielberg, who is married to actress Kate Capshaw.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks is married to actress Rita Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Hanks had come to Dallas to talk about the movie
as part of a five-city publicity tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Hanks and I coincidentally read the script at the same
time,'' Spielberg said. ``He wanted to do it, independently of
knowing I was reading it, and I wanted to direct it independent of
knowing Tom had just read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our agent informed us, we got on the phone with each
other. The first discussion was, do we risk the friendship if we
don't agree on something and we get into a fight and never speak to
each other again?''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks smiled on being told what Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a conversation very early and just said, let's not pull
any punches, let's treat each other just like we would anybody
else. You can't hurt my feelings and if I hurt yours, well, that's
just too bad,'' he said with that familiar Hanks laugh.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Hanks what he thought of Spielberg, he wanted to
know in what sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as a guy? Well, I still can't believe I know him, ya
know?'' Hanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks smoothly switched gears, doing his imitation of a
star-struck fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I know Steven Spielberg, ha, I've got his phone number. I
can call him up. (He pretends to talk on the phone.) `Hey Steven,
how ya doin'? I saw one of your movies last night. I think it was
called `Jaws.' Was that the shark movie?'''
</P>
<P>
   He switches back to his more serious persona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still do what we've always done. We talk about movies.
`Hey, what have you seen? What did you think of that?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like being in college, where everybody hangs out
between classes and argues about stuff. That's what we do all the
time. Oh, we talk about the kids and all that kind of stuff, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that director and star form a mutual
admiration society. Just ask Hanks what makes Spielberg a good
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, listen,'' he said, ``the same thing that made Edison
such a good light-bulb inventor. That's just what he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Steven better now because I've worked with him. If you
haven't worked with him, you probably think Steven is this
absent-minded goofy guy who, like, dresses really badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the set, he thinks in cinematic terms. To see him
operate so fast, be so totally focused, and to see possibilities
where you just can't keep up with him. He just goes and goes and
goes and goes and goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working on this movie was, `Ok, I get it with Steven. He's an
ultra-super genius.' That's the deal with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ask Spielberg about why audiences like Hanks so much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I made this movie 45 years ago, I would have cast Jimmy
Stewart, who like Tom Hanks, is Everyman, represents all of us,''
Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (Capt. Miller) is the toughest character Tom has had to
play in terms of what he doesn't give up to the audience. He has a
hidden agenda. And yet because we know Tom Hanks so well, we know
that no matter how much he's hiding himself, inside there's a human
being.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trust a human being that he doesn't show us for such a long
time in this picture. I wanted that kind of paradox for Capt.
Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   So the gamble paid off. Hanks and Spielberg are still friends.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Three months ago, historian Stephen Ambrose was invited
to a private screening of ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   All Ambrose knew about the Steven Spielberg film was that it
starred Tom Hanks and was about U.S. soldiers in World War II.
Ambrose, who has interviewed thousands of World War II veterans for
books such as ``Citizen Soldier'' and ``D-Day,'' doubted a
Hollywood movie could get it right.
</P>
<P>
   The film opened with a half-hour scene of U.S. troops landing on
Omaha Beach on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got done with D-Day, I yelled up to the
projectionist, `Cut!''' Ambrose said. The studio executive
operating the projector stopped the film, worried that Ambrose was
unhappy. But that wasn't it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I've got to recover,''' Ambrose said. ``I was
just wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people will share Ambrose's emotions when ``Saving
Private Ryan'' opens Friday. It is Spielberg's most powerful film
since ``Schindler's List'' and, like the earlier film, it is a
thrilling, emotional, harrowing experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best war film ever made,'' Ambrose said. ``I think
100 years from now, this will be the touchstone for World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is as realistic as the filmmakers could make it. That
means it shows soldiers struggling, sacrificing, killing and dying
in a way many Americans have never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to look at this movie and say, `It couldn't
have been that bad,''' Ambrose said. ``I guarantee you, it was that
bad. I saw what I've been hearing from veterans for 30 years. I
never thought I'd see it on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hanks and Spielberg, that was the whole point.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to do this unless you're going to be
brutally authentic, because it's been done every other way,'' said
Hanks, who plays Capt. John Miller, who leads a band of Army
Rangers on a special mission right after D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a great responsibility to do it right,'' said Hanks.
``You don't want to dishonor the men who died. You don't want to
alter the reality of the actual event. You don't want to make it
seem easier or simpler or more glorious or more glamorous. You just
want to find out what happened and re-create it as closely as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Saving Private Ryan,'' that meant sending actors to a
pre-film boot camp to learn what living in the mud and cold was
like. And it meant showing the carnage of men having limbs blown
off and dying while crying out for their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to debunk the mythology of war,'' said Spielberg,
whose father was a radio operator on a B-25 bomber in Burma during
the war. ``So many films have been made here and abroad that
glorify war.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our guys were heroes, those who got killed and those
who survived. I just didn't want to put a pedestal under their
feet. I did my best to avoid that by making this movie from the
combat veteran's point of view. To tell it like it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the film seems certain to increase admiration for
the U.S. soldiers who fought in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people will go back and look through their
family trees after this one,'' said Matt Damon, who plays Pvt.
James Ryan. ``That's the effect it had on me. A really profound
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked myself a lot of questions about my generation. I
watched it with a certain sense of guilt. I'm guilty of looking at
Memorial Day as a day at the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Damon, like Spielberg, Hanks and Ambrose had come to Dallas to
talk about the movie as part of a rare five-city publicity tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gone city to city since `Raiders of the Lost Ark,'
17 years ago,'' Spielberg said, leaning forward almost out of his
armchair and speaking with an earnest urgency. ``The reason I
decided to do it on this picture is that a lot of people identify
me with `E.T.' and `Raiders of the Lost Ark' and buttered popcorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want people seeing `Private Ryan' because of my
involvement or Tom Hanks' involvement to be prepared. This is a
very honest and therefore graphic look at combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also I want them aware that I don't think anybody 14 years old
or younger should even see this movie. I think 15 years old is a
debatable age.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the film, loosely suggested by real events, the army
discovers that three U.S. brothers were all killed on D-Day.
Another brother, Pvt. Ryan (Damon), parachuted into France on
D-Day. He is missing.
</P>
<P>
   A decision is made to send a small squad, led by Miller, to find
Ryan and bring him to safety. But that means putting the lives of
the entire squad in danger.
</P>
<P>
   As they fight their way to Ryan, the men keeping asking whether
the mission is justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, why not?'' Hanks said. ``Is it also insanity? Yes, it's
that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think it is justified, because the four stars in
(their mother's) window means she's got four sons serving in the
armed forces, and three of them are dead. So get that last one out
of there. Let the family continue.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is not far-fetched. During World War II, five brothers
died together when their ship sank. Their story became a
heart-wrenching patriotic film, ``The Fighting Sullivans'' (1944).
</P>
<P>
   Another family lost three sons during the week of D-Day. A
fourth brother, Fritz Niland, remained in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow the war department _ don't ask me how _ within three
days was aware of this,'' Ambrose said. ``They said, `Get that kid
out of there.'''
</P>
<P>
   No men's lives were risked to save Niland. But what if he had
been behind enemy lines? That's the moral question that runs
through ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The core thing that attracted me (to this script) was that it
was a morality play,'' Spielberg said. ``Once I got involved, I
realized I had an opportunity _ my dad fought in that war, and he's
81 years old today _ to say thank you to my father and say thank
you to all of the kids then who did what they did to let us do what
we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Spielberg's dad's stories of World War II that inspired
him to make his first amateur war movie when he was a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me all about it,'' Spielberg said. ``He admittedly
lied to me when he first told me about it. He was making up stuff,
but I was only 8 years old, so it was OK for him to sort of glorify
what I wanted to hear, John Wayne-style stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad finally told me the truth about how hard it was. He
threw his new stories right in the face of his old stories. I was
about 14 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg throws ``Saving Private Ryan'' into the face of other
war movies. But it won't shock those who have read war memoirs such
as Ambrose's recent bestseller, ``Citizen Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never before seen a movie in which a G.I. shoots a
German who has his hands up, saying, `Kamerad (comrade),''' said
Ambrose, who was surprised to find it in the movie. ``It happened
all the time. I've heard stories that would just kill your heart.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, U.S. movies have shown enemy soldiers killing
prisoners in the heat of battle, but Americans were never the ones
who did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American public wouldn't have stood still for it in '45 or
'55 or '65,'' Ambrose said. ``You'll never see it in a Zanuck film
(Darryl F. Zanuck made the famous D-Day film, `The Longest Day').''
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizen Soldier,'' published last year, is based on interviews
with hundreds of World War II veterans. Ambrose relates numerous
stories in which Americans did the supposedly unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noboby's got a right to judge men in combat,'' Ambrose said,
``because there is nothing to compare (it) to. The friendships that
are formed, the hatreds, the misery, the degradation, the
exhaustion, the fear. These things are totally absent from civilian
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, who gained early fame by writing a multivolume
biography of Dwight D. Eisenhower at the president's request, was
surprised to be listed as a consultant on ``Saving Private Ryan.''
Ambrose assumes screenwriter Robert Rodat read the Fritz Niland
story in his book, ``D-Day.'' Spielberg and Hanks read Ambrose
works closely before rewriting the screenplay, which was originally
a more standard adventure tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read every history book on World War II,'' Spielberg said.
``I talked to numerous veterans of Omaha Beach, who really informed
us of what it was like to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks was determined to make Miller a true, typical American
called upon to do extraordinary things.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't that basic cigar-chomping, rough-and-tumble,
follow-me-boys World War II icon,'' Hanks said. ``He was a citizen
soldier, just like Stephen Ambrose talks about. Just like they all
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all scared out of their wits. They were all seasick.
They were all in the midst of chaos, in which things happened far
too quickly. They don't know how they got out of there (alive).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to fall back on any kind of Sgt. Rock and His
Howling Commandos bravado, because that's just an utter waste of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did these ordinary men get the courage to face death?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Hanks, shaking his head. ``I think you
have to go back to understanding what it was like to be alive in
1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine, but as of June 5, 1944 (the day before
D-Day), no one knew if the war was going to be over in a year or 10
years. Or if it would ever be over. They didn't know if we were
going to win this thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys weren't heroes. They weren't going to establish
themselves as larger-than-life figures. They were just going to get
it done, to get home. Period. The end.''

BROMELIAD PUPS FLOWER WITH AGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Five years ago a friend gave me a bromeliad that had bloomed
and wilted. To my surprise, it sprouted two new plants in a few
weeks. I detached them from the mother plant and replanted them.
The mama has finally died but has given me 12 babies that are all
doing well. I would like to know how to make them bloom. Have you
heard of a mother plant having so many babies?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have seen several pups pop up around a mother plant, but I
don't know that I've seen as many as 12.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient while your pups mature enough to flower. It can take
18 to 24 months. To keep them on track, make sure they are in a
bright, warm spot. Water properly.
</P>
<P>
   When the plants are old enough to bloom but don't, you might
apply a fertilizer with phosphorus. Wait for results.
</P>
<P>
   If after several months, light, warmth and phosphorus don't
help, try the following procedure:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pour off any water in the plant cups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place a fragrant, ripening apple with a mature bromeliad plant
in a clear plastic bag and seal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place the bag with plant and apple in a warm place. Avoid the
sun. As the apple ripens, it produces ethylene gas, which
stimulates flower production.
</P>
<P>
   _ Remove the plant from the bag in a week and place in the
original location. If the apple is over- or underripe, the process
may fail. If so, be patient a few more months, then try again if
the plant doesn't flower on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last winter a friend gave me a large red amaryllis bulb. We
planted it, and it bloomed beautifully just in time for the
holidays. Now what should I do to get it to bloom again? Its long
leaves are starting to fall over. It is in a pot inside.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can either plant your amaryllis in the garden or continue
growing it in a pot.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to the holidays and pick up care there: Forcing
amaryllis into bloom for the holidays is a favorite gardening
activity. Once the big blossoms fade, remove the scape _ the stalk
that holds the flowers _ but not the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to water the plant so it will keep growing after it
flowers. Give it some fertilizer, and keep it in bright light. When
the weather warms, place the amaryllis outdoors in a partially
shaded spot for the summer, and water as needed. (Yours seems,
however, to be doing fine indoors.) Apply diluted liquid fertilizer
or fish emulsion weekly through July, then stop fertilizing and
reduce watering. The foliage will begin to die down.
</P>
<P>
   Stop watering when the foliage yellows and allow the bulb to
begin a dry, dormant period. Cut off the dead foliage and place the
bulb in a cool, dark place until the fall. It must have about a
three-month dormancy to bloom again.
</P>
<P>
   After dormancy, repot in a fresh mixture so the bulb neck is
above the soil level. Select a clean clay pot, with a drainage hole
two inches larger in diameter than the amaryllis bulb. Blooms are
best if the bulb is slightly pot-bound.
</P>
<P>
   Fill the container with a good potting mix. The soil line should
be about an inch down from the top of the pot. Amaryllis prefer a
humus-enriched, sandy soil that is slightly acidic. Add 1-2
tablespoons of superphosphate to each gallon of potting mix.
</P>
<P>
   Water and gradually move the pot to brighter light.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis received as holiday gifts can be moved to the garden
when the weather is warm. Simply scratch a little high-phosphorus
fertilizer into the ground, then place the potted amaryllis on that
spot. The roots will reach down through the pot into the garden
soil. Or plant the bulb (with the neck above soil level) in a
well-draining, organically enriched soil.
</P>
<P>
   While container amaryllis are dormant in the fall, garden bulbs
are dormant in winter and flower in spring.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As our live oak's canopy grows larger, our otherwise healthy
St. Augustine is growing thinner and less robust nearest the trunk.
Is there a grass we can plug or seed in this area that will coexist
with and thrive more than the St. Augustine?
</P>
<P>
   A: St. Augustine, I'm afraid, is the most shade-tolerant of our
perennial turf grasses. You can thin the tree's canopy from time to
time to maximize sunlight penetration. St. Augustine will grow
fairly well under a live oak when there is adequate light from the
sides, so if possible, eliminate anything that obstructs such
light. And you can keep the grass that is growing beneath the tree
taller so it appears thicker.
</P>
<P>
   But you may want to resort to a ground cover at some point.
There are a number of options that can be used attractively.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We are searching for an evergreen, flowering vine that can
withstand hot, wet conditions. Since the fence is only three feet
from the side of our drive, we would like something without thorns.
Any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not sure what you mean by wet. If the soil is soggy
during our usual rainy years, your best bet is to improve the soil
by working in some sand and compost. If drainage is adequate and
the soil is simply moist, you should be OK if there are enough
nutrients in the soil. Work in compost to improve nutrient levels.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina jessamine, Confederate jasmine and pink jasmine are all
evergreen vines. Carolina jessamine (Gelsemium sempervirens)
produces bright yellow, fragrant blooms in late winter or early
spring and takes sun or partial sun. Pink jasmine (Jasminum
polyanthum) produces beautiful pink flowers about the same time in
sun to partial sun. It prefers a moist soil that drains well.
Confederate jasmine (Trachelospermum jasminoides) has clusters of
small, fragrant white blooms in April and May. Try to shade the
soil over the root area of these vines with rocks or low-growing
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen wisteria (Millettia reticulata) likes sun and a
fertile soil. It is semievergreen and has glossy, dark green
foliage and purple summer blooms.
</P>
<P>
   You also could try one of the less rampant trumpet creepers
(Campsis radicans) such as the orange-red `Madame Galen.' Trumpet
vines are favorites with hummingbirds. They are not evergreen but
flower spring to fall. The black-eyed Susan vine (Thunbergia alata)
is a root-hardy vine that freezes back in a cold winter but remains
evergreen in one as mild as '97-'98. This grows on the west side of
our house where it blooms for many months during the year. It's in
an organic soil. You could mix an early-flowering, evergreen vine
with a deciduous but long-flowering type for a great display.

   ``The naming of cats is a difficult matter, it isn't just one of
your holiday games.'' T.S. Eliot might have said the same of
companies, had he been a corporate image consultant; but he lived
in benighted times, before civilization developed that fine art.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sentiment is appropriate in these merger-mad days.
What, for instance, should British Airways and American Airlines,
who hope this autumn to clear regulatory obstacles to an alliance,
call their offspring?
</P>
<P>
   Eliot would have advised caution: he favored ``sensible,
everyday names.'' Sadly, there are fewer and fewer of these about.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago a name was a simple way of distinguishing a thing, a
person, or a company from other things, people or companies.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before companies had grasped such fashionable
notions as corporate identity; and before they had cottoned on to
the trick of handing large checks to people who could teach them to
be cool or hot _ or both at once.
</P>
<P>
   These days, real names such as W.H. Smith or Walt Disney are
out; they are not only old-fashioned but also redolent of the
egocentricity that business must pretend to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Today's fashion-conscious company has two tempting trends to
choose between. One leans on classicism which, according to the
image consultants, is laden with values _ and values, as everybody
knows, are very 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Hence Diageo, for the merged Guinness-Grand Met, which combines
the Latin for day with the Greek for world and means nothing in any
language.
</P>
<P>
   The drug business is thick with fake classical: Novartis (the
Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz merger), Zeneca (the pharmaceutical spin-off
from ICI) and a whole biotechnology family of little Cygnuses,
Cephalons and Sequuses.
</P>
<P>
   The other trend, which has its origins in unhappy compromises,
is to do interesting things with capitals. SmithKline Beecham was a
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers (which seems, confusingly, to call itself
PCw for short) is the longest recent example of such corporate
breathlessness: Mr. Lybrand, one feels, is well out of it.
</P>
<P>
   But why stop at just two capital letters? Bolder companies, such
as OXiGENE, a biotech company, and NeXT, a software firm, are
pushing at the frontiers of typography.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as idealab!, an Internet company in which the
indisputably fashionable Steven Spielberg has a stake, consider
capitals an outdated convention and prefer to play with
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who succumb to temptation should remember that
fashions in names suffer from the same problem as fashions in
clothes or decor: they change. And it is a lot more expensive to
retool your corporate identity than to throw out your flared
trousers or avocado bathroom suite.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the more successful a company, the harder it is to get
rid of an embarrassing moniker. The managers of Toys ``R'' Us must
cringe at their name today; but it is too late to change.
</P>
<P>
   Still, trends are hard to buck and trendsetters hard to ignore.
If BA and AA decide to go with the vogue, there is a name just
waiting that is in tune with the spirit both of the age and of
their enterprise: icarus! &QL;

<P>
   BOSTON _ How can you get good teachers in the public schools?
Over the past few farcical months, Massachusetts has been
wondering.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, demand for new teachers is expected to reach
2 million over the next decade, and states are in fierce
competition to get the best of the crop. So first Massachusetts has
tried tests, and now it is trying bribes.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that either will work; but in a state that
prides itself on a long history of quality education, the debate is
raging red-hot.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in April, when, following the lead of 43 other
states who already require such exams, Massachusetts held its first
statewide test for nearly 1,800 candidates aspiring to teach in the
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   To its astonishment, almost 60 percent of the candidates failed.
Around 30 percent failed a basic reading and writing test, with
questions along the lines of ``What is a preposition?'' and
``Define the word `abolish.'' Some 63 percent failed the maths
paper.
</P>
<P>
   In one section of the reading and writing test, a paragraph from
``The Federalist Papers'' was read aloud three times as dictation.
Among the interesting words thereby introduced to the lexicon were
``improbally,'' ``integraty,'' ``bodyes'' and ``relif.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with such results, the state Board of Education did
what any other self-preserving body would do: it voted to lower the
pass mark. Roughly 260 more of the candidates thereby slid through.
</P>
<P>
   Then the board reinstated the original, higher, pass mark,
prompting the interim education commissioner to blame the switch on
``political forces'' and immediately resign.
</P>
<P>
   After the test debacle, state officials had a better idea. After
all, Massachusetts has a $1 billion budget surplus waiting to be
spent: and what better cause could there be than education?
</P>
<P>
   A number of school systems in other states have already turned
to such incentives to attract qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore offers housing bonuses of $5,000 to new teachers, with
a bigger bonus if they are willing to work in rough areas.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit offers bonuses of $3,000, and Los Angeles provides a
$5,000 salary differential to teachers who are bilingual.
</P>
<P>
   New York City is recruiting (with the lure of generous starting
salaries) from as far away as Austria, which has a surplus of
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Massachusetts may cap the lot by offering teachers the
biggest bonus in the country: $20,000 merely for signing the
contract. If the law passes, 250 aspiring teachers could receive
such a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   To put the sum in context, it is not far off the average
starting salary for a teacher in the Massachusetts public schools
($26,540), and $5,000 more than the median signing bonus received
by all graduates from Harvard Business School who accepted job
offers last year.
</P>
<P>
   This idea is the brainchild of Thomas Birmingham, the president
of the state Senate, who unashamedly describes it as ``elitist.''
There are several more around.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, the state attorney-general and the leading
Democratic contender for the governor's seat, has proposed $5,000
bonuses for 200 teachers who accept jobs in the state's worst
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cellucci, the acting governor and the leading Republican
contender, would rather use the surplus for tax cuts, but he has
also suggested full college scholarships for top high-school
students willing to teach for four years in Massachusetts public
schools. He has also suggested that all current teachers take the
famous test.
</P>
<P>
   Although international studies have shown no connection between
education spending and achievement, the states like to think that
extra money is at least the key to teacher satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   One national study, by Harvard University's Graduate School of
Education, has shown that low salaries often deter public school
teachers from staying longer than a year in the profession, while
others show that up to half America's teachers leave before their
fifth year of service.
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses could either be awarded in one lump sum, or spread out
over several years to ensure that new teachers stay in their jobs.
They could also be targeted and varied to attract teachers with
particularly valued expertise _ in maths, say, or foreign
languages.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Silber, the chancellor of Boston University
and chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Education, bonuses
``certainly can't hurt, and I suspect they can help a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, believe a more systematic attempt is needed to
improve teacher salaries, working conditions and retirement
policies. ``Attracting teachers is certainly important,'' says
Kathy Kelley, president of the Massachusetts Federation of
Teachers, one of the state's two main teachers' unions. ``Retaining
them is even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   To all those familiar with the intransigence of unionized
teachers, those remarks would seem to spell trouble. &QL;

   This idea is the brainchild of Thomas Birmingham, the president
of the state Senate, who unashamedly describes it as ``elitist.''
There are several more around.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, the state attorney-general and the leading
Democratic contender for the governor's seat, has proposed $5,000
bonuses for 200 teachers who accept jobs in the state's worst
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Cellucci, the acting governor and the leading Republican
contender, would rather use the surplus for tax cuts, but he has
also suggested full college scholarships for top high-school
students willing to teach for four years in Massachusetts public
schools. He has also suggested that all current teachers take the
famous test.
</P>
<P>
   Although international studies have shown no connection between
education spending and achievement, the states like to think that
extra money is at least the key to teacher satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   One national study, by Harvard University's Graduate School of
Education, has shown that low salaries often deter public school
teachers from staying longer than a year in the profession, while
others show that up to half America's teachers leave before their
fifth year of service.
</P>
<P>
   Bonuses could either be awarded in one lump sum, or spread out
over several years to ensure that new teachers stay in their jobs.
They could also be targeted and varied to attract teachers with
particularly valued expertise _ in maths, say, or foreign
languages.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Silber, the chancellor of Boston University
and chairman of the Massachusetts Board of Education, bonuses
``certainly can't hurt, and I suspect they can help a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, believe a more systematic attempt is needed to
improve teacher salaries, working conditions and retirement
policies. ``Attracting teachers is certainly important,'' says
Kathy Kelley, president of the Massachusetts Federation of
Teachers, one of the state's two main teachers' unions. ``Retaining
them is even more important.''
</P>
<P>
   To all those familiar with the intransigence of unionized
teachers, those remarks would seem to spell trouble. &QL;

NEEDLE-EXCHANGE PROGRAMS MEAN MUCH MORE THAN CLEAN SYRINGES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EUGENE M. HYMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ As a young police officer, I had no patience
or sympathy for alcohol and other drug abusers. After all, didn't
they make a free choice to use, to abuse and to become hooked on
various substances, legal and illegal?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, weren't these people just bored, or thrill seekers?
Now, as a trial judge handling criminal, juvenile and family law
cases, I deal with the lives of real people.
</P>
<P>
   Experience and education have shown me a side to the problem
that many in Washington or Sacramento choose to ignore or are
politically afraid to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors
was forced to discontinue a modest needle-exchange program
developed in an attempt to help prevent the spread of the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors had been informed that California Attorney
General Dan Lungren wanted such programs halted. He felt that they
were illegal and would contribute to increased drug usage. He was
prepared to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 study showed drug injection, presumably with unclean
needles, causes more than 60 percent of HIV cases in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of HIV infections among women of
childbearing age are related either directly or indirectly to
injection drug use.
</P>
<P>
   And more than 75 percent of babies diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were
infected as a direct or indirect result of injection drug use by a
parent. The numbers alone suggest that aggressive action is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Recently the federal government has taken contradictory policy
positions regarding the appropriateness of needle-exchange
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy and advocate on behalf of the White House, has
taken the position that needle-exchange programs re-victimize the
disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
   The programs are almost all in predominantly minority,
low-income neighborhoods. The theory is that such programs are
magnets for crime, violence and drug dealing _ and drug usage is
said to increase owing to the availability of free needles.
Therefore, according to that viewpoint, needle-exchange programs
should not exist and, in any case, should not be supported by
federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   His position is a difficult one to accept when consideration is
given to the fact that demands for drug treatment programs greatly
exceed the supply in all sections of our communities, and
especially in the minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala has supported
needle-exchange programs because they provide a means of producing
a marked decrease in HIV infections without escalating drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health has funded much of the
research into the effectiveness of needle-exchange programs and
their impact on drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Their recent findings conclude that such programs have achieved
their goals: Reducing the rate of infection without increasing drug
use.
</P>
<P>
   What is not in the debate between the various Cabinet members
are the appalling facts _ the correlation between drug usage and
HIV/AIDS infections. Since the AIDS epidemic began in 1981,
injection drug use is increasingly responsible for the spread of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   I know that an indicator of the possibility of sexual, physical
or emotional abuse is when youngsters begin to abuse alcohol or
drugs; that substance abuse is a method of self-medication, to help
numb the mind, to help forget the horrible experiences that one has
suffered through, usually in early life.
</P>
<P>
   Substance abuse may also indicate a dual diagnosis _ the
combination of a major mental health disorder along with addiction.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen women in abusive relationships who have at least
temporarily escaped their predicament through a drug-induced haze.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnant intravenous drug users present a special set of
challenges, especially to judges. Common sense tell us that the
fetus benefits from the cession of drug use at any time during the
pregnancy and, naturally, the sooner the better. However, ``cold
turkey'' withdrawal detoxification from depressants like alcohol,
heroin or Valium, virtually guarantees a spontaneous abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the jail has appropriate prenatal procedures to deal with
detoxifying pregnant inmates, the humane course might well be to
allow the woman to obtain outpatient prenatal care coupled with
alcohol and other drug treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Pregnancy provides a unique time for treatment intervention
because the mothers are motivated by fear of harming their babies.
If treatment is not made available, however, we cannot expect them
to stop using drugs on their own, no matter how badly they want to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   Needle-exchange programs provide opportunities for much more
than clean needles. They provide a direct linkage to drug treatment
and counseling as well as needed medical services. They also
provide the opportunity for education regarding safe sex, drug
usage, prenatal education and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why is it then that so many are opposed to needle-exchange
programs on the local, state, and federal levels?
</P>
<P>
   First is the political perspective that ``law and order'' issues
sell to the public and that the ``lock 'em up'' model is the
preferred one. It's a perspective based upon the view that abuse is
a sign of moral decay. It doesn't recognize addiction as a medical
treatment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Second is the sentiment that addicts are damaged goods _
disposables _ and that their children are ``throw-away babies'' who
will be a burden to the public and become addicts themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As a judge, I have worked with abusers of alcohol and drugs for
almost eight years. More than half of the people in our jails and
prisons are nonviolent substance abusers. With adequate treatment,
most could hold productive jobs and care for their families.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by the Rand Corporation, the U.S. General Accounting
Office and California's Department of Alcohol and Drugs, as well as
numerous other government agencies and other institutions, have
demonstrated that prevention treatment is seven times more
effective than straight police intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment need not be extensive or expensive. I have seen
miracles performed for some persons by involvement in Alcoholics
Anonymous or other 12-step programs _ although these are not
considered ``treatment'' in the strict sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   It is cruel how many prisoners are denied such basic treatment
opportunities, and yet we continue to expect that they will leave
custodial facilities clean and sober for all eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Legalization or decriminalization are not answers for these
social issues. Coerced, structured treatment is our only hope for
long-term sobriety for the addict and for our communities.
</P>
<P>
   Most addicts are like most of us, ordinary people who do not
possess special gifts or strengths.
</P>
<P>
   There is however, inside most of us, an inner strength.
</P>
<P>
   We must help addicts overcome their chemical problems with
belief in that inner strength: Grab it, hold on to it, and use it.
They must never surrender it nor lose faith in it _ or in their
abilities or ours to provide the necessary treatment facilities.
</P>
<P>
   We must convince our elected officials that effective treatment
on demand is a right that should be extended to all who request it,
for no child or parent is expendable.

   MA'ALULA, SYRIA _ At the tomb of Saint Thecla in Ma'alula in
Syria, Christians leave symbolic reminders of the blessings they
pray for from the woman who brought Christianity to the area 17
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murmuring in their native Aramaic, the language Jesus is said to
have spoken, they deposit glass eyes or the crutches they hope they
will no longer need. But the tokens most often left are cardboard
cut-outs of the babies they long for.
</P>
<P>
   For years now the Christians of Ma'alula have had fewer children
than their Muslim compatriots. They are also more prone to
emigrate. Already several mosques have sprung up in the once purely
Christian town.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Fertile Crescent, where Christianity first began,
the same story repeats itself. In the Syrian Orthodox monastery of
Mar Mitta, in northern Iraq, which once housed 7,000 monks, only
two remain.
</P>
<P>
   Madaba, a former Christian stronghold in Jordan, is now half
Muslim. Even in Lebanon, once the only country in the Middle East
with more Christians than Muslims, abandoned villages bear witness
to a precipitous exodus.
</P>
<P>
   All the countries of the region have Christian minorities. The
numbers are unreliable but Christians are thought, very roughly, to
make up 2-4 percent of the population of Jordan, the West Bank and
Gaza, and Iraq; 10 percent of Syria; and 30-40 percent of Lebanon.
East Jerusalem, nearly 50 percent Christian in 1948, is now less
than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, the proportion of Jordanians professing Christianity
has fallen by half. And, by one Iraqi clergyman's reckoning, the
number of Christians in Iraq has fallen from 750,000 in 1990 to
500,000 today _ even as the Muslim population has grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders often blame the decline on persecution by the Muslim
majority. America's Congress is currently deliberating a law to
impose sanctions on countries that mistreat their religious
minorities, with the Middle East as one of the intended targets.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials recently claimed that the Palestinian
Authority systematically discriminated against its Christian
population. And the Lebanese government's neglect of displaced
Christians has provoked much criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the whole, governments in the region treat Christians
remarkably well. Even as the population dwindles, churches are
thriving, with congregations spilling out on to the streets. No one
feels the need to hide his faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian, Jordanian and Lebanese parliaments,
Christians occupy a disproportionate share of the seats. A few
ministers or senior officials in all the regimes of the Fertile
Crescent are Christian: witness Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, and Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian Authority's education
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few laws do draw a distinction between Christians and
Muslims, they often do so in the Christians' favor. In Iraq, for
example, only Christians may sell alcohol, a lucrative trade in
these trying times.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, half the jobs in the cabinet and the senior civil
service are reserved for Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christians gripe about Muslim family laws, which force
outsiders to convert if they wish to marry a Muslim, they too enjoy
the right to apply their own family laws within their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination tends to be low-level, reflecting public
prejudices, rather than an orchestrated policy. Israeli claims of
Palestinian persecution rest on the harassment of a few Muslim
converts to Christianity by minor officials.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Iraq, priests complain about over-zealous
bureaucrats who order the building of mosques in Christian
villages. And in Syria, curious peasants ride in to take a look at
the Christians in the Bab Touma part of Damascus (where St. Paul
was smuggled out in a basket).
</P>
<P>
   Such annoyances can hardly explain the hemorrhage of Christians
from the Fertile Crescent. The issue is demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Since colonial times, when French and British administrators
gave preference to minorities in the civil service and the army,
Christians have been moving from the countryside to the cities.
Church schools provide better education, especially for girls, than
state schools. Urbanization and education have, together, led to a
decline in the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those places where the Christian population is growing
in absolute terms, it is shrinking in relation to the Muslims
around it.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the problem, Christians find it easier to emigrate.
Their relative wealth puts air fares and fees within reach, and
their professional qualifications help them obtain visas. Their
long history of emigration has left many with relations abroad who
can press their applications.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders are desperate to preserve their congregations.
In a recent tract, the pope urged Lebanon's Catholics not to give
in to the temptation to seek a better life in another country.
</P>
<P>
   On this matter, at least, the 20 or so different Christian
denominations in the area can agree. They have held two ecumenical
conferences this year, in Cyprus and Baghdad, to search for ways to
staunch the flow.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the priestly exhortations, ordinary Christians say
they cannot afford to stay. While expressing regret at
Christianity's demise, they nonetheless insist they would leap at
any opportunity to leave.
</P>
<P>
   At Mar Mitta, Father Adda, staring out over the empty monastery
courtyard, speaks with pride of the burgeoning Syrian Orthodox
dioceses in America, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he hopes, the situation in Iraq will have improved
enough to lure his flock back from Detroit and Sydney. By then,
there may be nothing to return to. &QL;

   MA'ALULA, SYRIA _ At the tomb of Saint Thecla in Ma'alula in
Syria, Christians leave symbolic reminders of the blessings they
pray for from the woman who brought Christianity to the area 17
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Murmuring in their native Aramaic, the language Jesus is said to
have spoken, they deposit glass eyes or the crutches they hope they
will no longer need. But the tokens most often left are cardboard
cut-outs of the babies they long for.
</P>
<P>
   For years now the Christians of Ma'alula have had fewer children
than their Muslim compatriots. They are also more prone to
emigrate. Already several mosques have sprung up in the once purely
Christian town.
</P>
<P>
   All over the Fertile Crescent, where Christianity first began,
the same story repeats itself. In the Syrian Orthodox monastery of
Mar Mitta, in northern Iraq, which once housed 7,000 monks, only
two remain.
</P>
<P>
   Madaba, a former Christian stronghold in Jordan, is now half
Muslim. Even in Lebanon, once the only country in the Middle East
with more Christians than Muslims, abandoned villages bear witness
to a precipitous exodus.
</P>
<P>
   All the countries of the region have Christian minorities. The
numbers are unreliable but Christians are thought, very roughly, to
make up 2-4 percent of the population of Jordan, the West Bank and
Gaza, and Iraq; 10 percent of Syria; and 30-40 percent of Lebanon.
East Jerusalem, nearly 50 percent Christian in 1948, is now less
than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1967, the proportion of Jordanians professing Christianity
has fallen by half. And, by one Iraqi clergyman's reckoning, the
number of Christians in Iraq has fallen from 750,000 in 1990 to
500,000 today _ even as the Muslim population has grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders often blame the decline on persecution by the Muslim
majority. America's Congress is currently deliberating a law to
impose sanctions on countries that mistreat their religious
minorities, with the Middle East as one of the intended targets.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials recently claimed that the Palestinian
Authority systematically discriminated against its Christian
population. And the Lebanese government's neglect of displaced
Christians has provoked much criticism.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the whole, governments in the region treat Christians
remarkably well. Even as the population dwindles, churches are
thriving, with congregations spilling out on to the streets. No one
feels the need to hide his faith.
</P>
<P>
   In the Palestinian, Jordanian and Lebanese parliaments,
Christians occupy a disproportionate share of the seats. A few
ministers or senior officials in all the regimes of the Fertile
Crescent are Christian: witness Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime
minister, and Hanan Ashrawi, the Palestinian Authority's education
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Although a few laws do draw a distinction between Christians and
Muslims, they often do so in the Christians' favor. In Iraq, for
example, only Christians may sell alcohol, a lucrative trade in
these trying times.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, half the jobs in the cabinet and the senior civil
service are reserved for Christians.
</P>
<P>
   Although Christians gripe about Muslim family laws, which force
outsiders to convert if they wish to marry a Muslim, they too enjoy
the right to apply their own family laws within their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination tends to be low-level, reflecting public
prejudices, rather than an orchestrated policy. Israeli claims of
Palestinian persecution rest on the harassment of a few Muslim
converts to Christianity by minor officials.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Iraq, priests complain about over-zealous
bureaucrats who order the building of mosques in Christian
villages. And in Syria, curious peasants ride in to take a look at
the Christians in the Bab Touma part of Damascus (where St. Paul
was smuggled out in a basket).
</P>
<P>
   Such annoyances can hardly explain the hemorrhage of Christians
from the Fertile Crescent. The issue is demographic.
</P>
<P>
   Since colonial times, when French and British administrators
gave preference to minorities in the civil service and the army,
Christians have been moving from the countryside to the cities.
Church schools provide better education, especially for girls, than
state schools. Urbanization and education have, together, led to a
decline in the birth rate.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those places where the Christian population is growing
in absolute terms, it is shrinking in relation to the Muslims
around it.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the problem, Christians find it easier to emigrate.
Their relative wealth puts air fares and fees within reach, and
their professional qualifications help them obtain visas. Their
long history of emigration has left many with relations abroad who
can press their applications.
</P>
<P>
   Christian leaders are desperate to preserve their congregations.
In a recent tract, the pope urged Lebanon's Catholics not to give
in to the temptation to seek a better life in another country.
</P>
<P>
   On this matter, at least, the 20 or so different Christian
denominations in the area can agree. They have held two ecumenical
conferences this year, in Cyprus and Baghdad, to search for ways to
staunch the flow.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the priestly exhortations, ordinary Christians say
they cannot afford to stay. While expressing regret at
Christianity's demise, they nonetheless insist they would leap at
any opportunity to leave.
</P>
<P>
   At Mar Mitta, Father Adda, staring out over the empty monastery
courtyard, speaks with pride of the burgeoning Syrian Orthodox
dioceses in America, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he hopes, the situation in Iraq will have improved
enough to lure his flock back from Detroit and Sydney. By then,
there may be nothing to return to. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It has been nearly a decade since America's
``white-collar recession'' introduced managers to the hazards of
corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of those managers eventually landed on their feet,
they have spent that decade adapting to a world which offers less
prestige, less security, and fewer nooks and crannies in which
underperformers can hide.
</P>
<P>
   Those managers have had it easy, however, compared with what is
about to happen in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Macroeconomic problems are only part of the story. The real
reason that Japan's managers are in trouble is the need for
long-term restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In America, this was underlined by a shift from smokestack
industries and into high-tech ones, and by firms' efforts to adapt
themselves to new information technology and more assertive
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese firms must also respond to these forces _ and at the
same time unravel several mutually reinforcing habits. A decade ago
those habits were the envy of the West. Now, they spell trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar is long-term employment. When capital was
cheap, and Japanese companies were expanding rapidly, it was easy
to promise young salarymen a job for life. Once the economy
matured, those bright young corporate assets became aging
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost a decade, for example, since Mitsubishi
started an early-retirement plan to unload middle-aged managers:
anyone over 48 years old receives a topped-up pension if he leaves.
Several other big firms have since offered similar schemes.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is knowing just what to do with all those men idling
by the window. Harder still is to adapt the way in which Japanese
middle managers are trained.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of lifetime employment, seniority-based pay and
rapid growth has encouraged firms to invest in wasteful training.
Early in their careers managers are rotated among jobs and
locations, asking few questions when they are transferred, since
they know their careers are in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of this training is different from that in western
firms. Because they move around so much, Japanese managers rarely
develop special expertise in, say, marketing or corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   And because they expect a one-company career, they invest most
heavily in the skill they know they will need: office politics. A
salaryman takes great pains to become a better Mitsubishi man,
Mitsui man or whatever company man is required.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of following these practices, Japan's corporate
infantry has become a battalion of generalists _ middle managers
with no transferable skills, and untrained for anything other than
being loyal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies need to change how they recruit, train and
promote their managers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese managers still deny there is a problem. Nobuyuki
Idei, president of Sony, says he is not worried about the shifting
nature of Japanese careers. When pressed, however, he explains that
many of the firm's divisions are now based overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Kurisaka, Tokyo managing partner of Egon Zehnder
International, a headhunting firm, does not believe that Japanese
companies have grasped the size of their task. ``People all talk
about what they have to do,'' he laments, ``but...they don't really
want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the promise of a long, secure career rings hollow,
recruiters must offer a new bargain: that young managers will
acquire the skills they need to be valuable to other companies. Yet
once a company provides managers with the training they need, they
risk losing them to someone else _ a problem familiar to western
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Thus many companies now recognize the need to send their young
managers to foreign business schools. But whereas American
companies require their employees to refund tuition money if they
leave, this is still illegal in Japan. Instead, companies try to
require their employees to stay for five years or so after they
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies must also inject fresh ideas into their
organizations. Despite their glut of managers, many banks have been
busy calling headhunters in search of anybody with a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just those with financial expertise they are
looking for; they also need people from marketing and IT if they
are to compete with the likes of Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   That is why western companies are benefiting most from the new
market for Japanese managers. For years, IBM was the only foreign
company in the top 50 on surveys of graduates' most-desired
employers. Now, names such as Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and
Microsoft appear.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because their treatment of workers no longer
seems quite so brutal: when Yamaichi Securities went bankrupt last
year, Merrill Lynch stepped in and gave jobs to a third of its
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover western firms can offer an aspiring young manager a
career in whatever speciality he chooses. If he picks Goldman
Sachs, a graduate can become a specialist in mergers and
acquisitions, or bonds. If he joins a Japanese bank, he may start
in one of its local branches.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just graduates of the best colleges who will benefit
from these changes. When only top-flight firms counted, a degree
from a top college was vital. But creativity, enterprise and
business acumen are not necessarily fostered at such places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is full of competent dropouts,'' says Yasuyuki Nambu,
president of Pasona, a company that recruits and trains young
professionals. Although a few Japanese firms have sought Pasona's
services, foreign affiliates can often make better use of Japan's
diversity of young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign firms also make more attractive employers for those
middle-aged managers who do have useful expertise.
</P>
<P>
   When Sakie Fukushima, a headhunter at Korn/Ferry International,
interviews a candidate, she explains that foreign affiliates expect
their managers to supply ideas and take responsibility for profits
and losses _ a pitch sure to appeal only to the adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a decade of Japanese firms' talk about an overhaul,
foreign affiliates still account for more than 90 percent of all
executive searches at both headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   For all its flaws, the Japanese system of job rotation and
company-specific training provided its firms with some advantages
over western rivals. Unfortunately, it cannot survive in a world
where capital is dearer and the future is more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a few innovative Japanese firms will combine the best of
both systems. But many in the West also seek an elusive third way.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to all those western management articles applauding
Japanese business methods, the foreigners have a decade-long lead
in finding a compromise between the two systems. &QL;

 &HT;    Toronto has never been a bigger attraction than it is right now:
In January, five surrounding suburbs were incorporated with the
central core, transforming Toronto overnight into the fifth most
populous city in North America, surpassed by only Mexico City, New
York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
 &HT;    The new mega-city government, led by Mayor Mel Lastman, who
boasts that he once sold a refrigerator to an Eskimo, is intent on
proving that (at least in this case) bigger is not only better but
busier, brighter and far more beguiling.
 &HT;    Toronto's charms as an international city that works are well
known. Through good planning and good luck, it is a city that
focuses far more of its energy on creating the future than on
correcting the mistakes of the past.
 &HT;    It is, some say, New York without attitude, and what it lacks in
presence it makes up for with activity, especially in summer.
 &HT;    When the beacon atop the Canada Life Assurance Building on
University Avenue is capped by the green light that signifies clear
and sunny weather (red means overcast; flashing white, snow),
Toronto heads outdoors.
 &HT;    The theater and entertainment district around the CN Tower and
the Skydome downtown stays thronged until late at night, and even
the disappointing waterfront on Lake Ontario _ cut off by an
elevated highway _ has something happening almost every day
throughout the summer.
 &HT;    The 1,815-foot CN Tower (equivalent to 187 stories) provides a
modern, unifying image for the city. But it is the many robust
neighborhoods, each with its own ethnic flavor or historical
ambiance, that really show off what Toronto stands for. It has at
least three Chinatowns, two Little Italys and a Greek neighborhood
that stretches for miles.
 &HT;    On a quick stroll, visitors can find window displays of fresh
cannoli, smoked whole squid or boxes of exquisite Cuban cigars. But
find one of Toronto's cigar bars and smoke the stogies there.
Taking them across the border is prohibited.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Two special exhibitions highlight this summer in T.O., which is
what some residents call Toronto. The first is the only North
American showing of the Courtauld Collection of Impressionist and
postimpressionist paintings from the Courtauld Institute in London.
 &HT;    Manet's ``Bar at the Folies-Bergere'' and other famous works
will be on display until Sept. 20 at the Art Gallery of Ontario,
317 Dundas Street West, at the edge of Chinatown.
 &HT;    Exhibit schedule: Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. General
museum hours: Tuesday to Friday, noon to 9 p.m., Saturday and
Sunday 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Exhibit admission: $14 weekdays, $17.50
nights and weekends but subject to change. (Prices calculated at 71
cents to the Canadian dollar.) Telephone: (416) 979-6675. For
exhibit tickets: (800) 461-3333.
 &HT;    The other special stop this summer is the Royal Ontario Museum,
100 Queen's Park, (416) 586-8000, where 250 objects from the
Victoria and Albert Museum in London _ including a huge plaster fig
leaf designed to shield Queen Victoria's eyes from the offending
parts of Michelangelo's ``David'' _ will be on display.
 &HT;    ``A Grand Design: The Art of the Victoria and Albert Museum'' is
on view until Sept. 13. Hours: Monday to Saturday 10 a.m. to 6
p.m., Tuesday until 8 p.m. and Sunday 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission:
$10.65. Advance tickets are through Ticketmaster, (416) 870-8000.
 &HT;    At the Lake Ontario waterfront, around Queen's Quay, the annual
Harbourfront Centre Summer Fete offers concerts, dance performances
and films every weekend throughout July and August. Most concerts
are free. Information: (416) 973-3000.
 &HT;    Also back this year is the eight-hour explosion of color and
sound that is the Caribana Caribbean parade, scheduled for Aug. 1.
The parade will leave from Exhibition Stadium at around 10 a.m. and
move up Lakeshore Boulevard, which will be lined with food stands
and vendors' booths. Information: (416) 465-4884.
 &HT;    Toronto is big on films. From Sept. 10 to 19, some 300 films
from over 50 countries will be shown at the Toronto International
Film Festival, most for the first time in North America.
Information: (416) 968-3456.
 &HT;    And if you haven't had enough of ``Titanic,'' the film will be
shown in wide-screen format at the Cine sphere theater at Ontario
Place, 955 Lakeshore Boulevard West, (416) 314-9900, nightly at
8:30 through the summer. Admission: $6.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    It is tempting to think that Toronto is all future and no past.
But a visit to the difficult-to-reach Historic Fort York, Garrison
Road off Fleet Street west of downtown, (416) 392-6907, allows a
look at the city's history.
 &HT;    The fort dates from 1793 and is now surrounded by a maze of
railroad tracks and superhighways. Guided tours are available in
summer, and fabulous photo opportunities to combine the oldest
buildings in Toronto with the futuristic CN Tower.
 &HT;    A beer festival is scheduled for Aug. 7 to 9. Regular admission:
$3.55. Open year round, with the longest hours in summer, from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    Another reminder of the past is the house of William Lyon
Mackenzie, Toronto's first mayor. The small brick town house at 82
Bond Street, a block east of Eaton Center (the huge downtown mall),
was his home from 1859 till his death in 1861. He became mayor in
1834, when the city had only 9,252 inhabitants, and later led an
ill-fated rebellion against the Crown. Open noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday
through Sunday. Admission: $2.50. Information: (416) 392-6915.
 &HT;    This year, Olde Town Toronto Tours, (416) 798-2424, is running
double-decker buses throughout the city. A two-hour tour costs
$17.75, including an all-day pass allowing visitors to get on and
off where they wish. Buses leave every half-hour from near the
Citibank Building, Front and York Streets.
 &HT;    After one has experienced both past and future, the O2 Spa Bar
at 2044 Yonge St., (416) 322-7733, offers an unusual respite. It is
one of North America's first oxygen bars, a place to sip fresh
fruit juices while inhaling plain or scented oxygen. Twenty
minutes' worth of 99.9 percent pure oxygen at the bar is $11.35.
Open from Tuesday to Friday 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Saturday 10 to 9
p.m., Sunday and Monday noon to 6.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Families are welcome at the Delta Chelsea Inn, 33 Gerrard St.
West, (416) 595-1975, fax (416) 585-4302. Children under 18 stay
free in their parents' room, and those under 6 eat free. There is a
supervised playroom.
 &HT;    For $3.55 per child for two and a half hours, parents get time
alone. For peace of mind, they also receive a pager. Rooms have
been recently renovated in cheery pastels and florals. Doubles,
from $132.
 &HT;    If you want to be on the waterfront, the 968-room Westin Harbour
Castle, One Harbour Square, (416) 869-1600, fax (416) 361-7448, is
a moderately priced choice, especially with a summer package.
There's an indoor pool, outdoor deck and a revolving restaurant on
the 35th floor. Rates: doubles from $141, but the Westin Good-Buy
Getaway rate brings that down to $113 until the end of September.
 &HT;    Budget: Best Western Primrose Hotel, 111 Carlton St., (416)
977-8000, fax (416) 977-6323. Slightly away from downtown, the
337-room hotel is still just down the street from the Canadian
hockey palace, Maple Leaf Gardens. The comfortable rooms have king,
queen or two double beds. Double rooms from $106.
 &HT;    Luxury: For convenience and luxury, few hotels beat the Four
Seasons, 21 Avenue Road, (416) 964-0411, fax (416) 964-2301, in the
ritzy Yorkville neighborhood. The 380-room hotel underwent a $5.6
million refurbishment this spring. Soothing cream tones and
tasteful upholstery make the rooms decadently comfortable. Doubles:
from $192.
 &HT;    The Sutton Place Hotel, 955 Bay St., (416) 924-9221, fax (416)
924-1778, is one of Toronto's most luxurious European-style hotels.
Its 292 rooms and suites are among the most spacious in the city.
The furnishings are lush and the rooms bright and airy, especially
those overlooking Yonge Street. Double rooms start at about $135.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The area around College and Clinton Streets in West Toronto's
Little Italy was recently selected as one of the hippest places in
North America by the Utne Reader magazine. One of the oldest
restaurants in the neighborhood is the Cafe Diplomatico, 594
College St., (416) 534-4637.
 &HT;    This place is the essence of Toronto neighborliness: a sidewalk
patio lined with petunias, a jukebox and plenty of opportunity for
people watching.
 &HT;    The menu at ``the Dip'' retains the hearty fare on which it was
founded. Specials are the ubiquitous vodka rose sauce with choice
of pasta, and extra large panzarotti _ a baked pizza dough with
choice of stuffing. Dinner for two with a bottle of Chianti is $46.
The cafe is open daily from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. (until 3 on Friday and
Saturday).
 &HT;    There are many good restaurants in Chinatown on Spadina Avenue,
but make every effort to get into the Lee Garden, 331 Spadina
Avenue, (416) 593-9524, even if it means sharing a table with
strangers (they may not be strangers after you wait on line with
them for 20 minutes).
 &HT;    Plastic table coverings do not detract from the exquisitely
prepared food: quail rolled in lettuce, deep fried and sweetly
delicate soft-shelled crabs. A meal for two with beer and tea is
about $45. Dinner daily.
 &HT;    Long considered one of Toronto's best restaurants, Scaramouche,
Benvenuto Place, (416) 961-8011, remains a place to go for a
special night. Its location on a small rise gives it a striking
view of North America's newest big city.
 &HT;    As meticulous with the menu as it is with reservations, Keith
Froggett's restaurant delights in surprise. Arctic char poached in
aromatic water, served with Ontario asparagus and fingerling
potatoes, is $20. Dinner for two, with wine from the extensive
list: $125. Dinner only, Monday through Saturday.
 &HT;    Rodney's Oyster House, 209 Adelaide St. East, (416) 363-8105, is
less formal. It is easy to miss the entrance, but there is nothing
subtle about Rodney's itself, where many other restaurants come to
buy their seafood.
 &HT;    The long bar is piled with more than a dozen types of oysters,
purchased by the piece and taken raw. A quieter back room retains
the free spirit of the place. Steamed clams and bowls of
periwinkles are also available. Price: about $75 for two, with
drinks. Open 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Saturday.
 &HT;    For a taste of hearty Canadian fare, try the Acadian Room at the
Royal York Hotel, 100 Front St. West, (416) 860-6949. Seafood
chowder, Quebec duck with lavender wild honey, and delicious
Canadian salmon are served in the kind of dark-wood, country-lodge
setting that goes with the nation's image. Dinner for two, with an
Ontario wine, about $100. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily (no
lunch Saturday).
 &HT;    For a bite on the run, try an enormous grilled hot dog from one
of more than 1,000 street vendors in Toronto. On a hearty yellow
bun, they usually take two hands to handle. Lunch for two, with
soda (called pop in T.O.), about $4.

 By ANTHONY DEPALMA 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Toronto has never been a bigger attraction than it is right now:
In January, five surrounding suburbs were incorporated with the
central core, transforming Toronto overnight into the fifth most
populous city in North America, surpassed by only Mexico City, New
York, Los Angeles and Chicago.
 &HT;    The new mega-city government, led by Mayor Mel Lastman, who
boasts that he once sold a refrigerator to an Eskimo, is intent on
proving that (at least in this case) bigger is not only better but
busier, brighter and far more beguiling.
 &HT;    Toronto's charms as an international city that works are well
known. Through good planning and good luck, it is a city that
focuses far more of its energy on creating the future than on
correcting the mistakes of the past.
 &HT;    It is, some say, New York without attitude, and what it lacks in
presence it makes up for with activity, especially in summer.
 &HT;    When the beacon atop the Canada Life Assurance Building on
University Avenue is capped by the green light that signifies clear
and sunny weather (red means overcast; flashing white, snow),
Toronto heads outdoors.
 &HT;    The theater and entertainment district around the CN Tower and
the Skydome downtown stays thronged until late at night, and even
the disappointing waterfront on Lake Ontario _ cut off by an
elevated highway _ has something happening almost every day
throughout the summer.
 &HT;    The 1,815-foot CN Tower (equivalent to 187 stories) provides a
modern, unifying image for the city. But it is the many robust
neighborhoods, each with its own ethnic flavor or historical
ambiance, that really show off what Toronto stands for. It has at
least three Chinatowns, two Little Italys and a Greek neighborhood
that stretches for miles.
 &HT;    On a quick stroll, visitors can find window displays of fresh
cannoli, smoked whole squid or boxes of exquisite Cuban cigars. But
find one of Toronto's cigar bars and smoke the stogies there.
Taking them across the border is prohibited.

 &HT;    Two special exhibitions highlight this summer in T.O., which is
what some residents call Toronto. The first is the only North
American showing of the Courtauld Collection of Impressionist and
postimpressionist paintings from the Courtauld Institute in London.
 &HT;    Manet's ``Bar at the Folies-Bergere'' and other famous works
will be on display until Sept. 20 at the Art Gallery of Ontario,
317 Dundas Street West, at the edge of Chinatown.
 &HT;    Exhibit schedule: Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. General

nights and weekends but subject to change. (Prices calculated at 71

from over 50 countries will be shown at the Toronto International
Film Festival, most for the first time in North America.
Information: (416) 968-3456.
 &HT;    And if you haven't had enough of ``Titanic,'' the film will be
shown in wide-screen format at the Cine sphere theater at Ontario
Place, 955 Lakeshore Boulevard West, (416) 314-9900, nightly at
8:30 through the summer. Admission: $6.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    This is high season for family travel, a time for amusement
parks, beaches, campgrounds _ and stress. That's right, stress.
 &HT;    ``Family travel can be very stressful if you don't do the right
things,'' says Christine Loomis, author of the new handbook
``Simplify Family Travel'' (Reader's Digest, 1998; $17.95).
 &HT;    However, Loomis adds that family travel can also be unstressful
_ if one plans properly. ``The problem is that when you have
unrealistic expectations, you're set up for failure,'' she says.
 &HT;    Loomis, the travel editor of Family Life magazine, has written a
book that is less about where to go with your family than how to
plan the trip. Part of Reader's Digest Simpler Life series, the
slim hardcover book is spiral-bound, perfectly made to slip under
the front seat of the family minivan.
 &HT;    Loomis discusses choosing a place, planning the trip, packing
the right way and getting there. She has chapters on health and
safety, on lodging and dining, and an entire chapter devoted to
play.
 &HT;    She even has a chapter devoted to lists and child-proofing a
hotel room. The hour-by-hour sample itinerary for visiting a theme
park for a week is a must-read for families with small children.
 &HT;    ``I wanted to show how you have to build in free time to any
schedule that you have,'' Loomis explains. ``One problem some
parents have is that they want their kids to see and do a lot. But
you wind up as stressed as when you left. Kids cannot go all day,
every day. They're slower.''
 &HT;    Loomis is quick to add that this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
 &HT;    ``It's good for kids to be slower,'' Loomis says. ``It slows us
down too and that's one of the great things about traveling with
kids. It gives the whole family time to hang out. We're all
overscheduled and what kids really want is time with their parents.
You don't have to spend any money to give them that.''
 &HT;    Loomis, who has a 7-year-old son and two daughters, ages 10 and
16, has a wealth of practical advice. If the family has been
driving all morning, she says, don't stop at a restaurant. Instead
choose a picnic area or someplace with open seating that allows the
kids to move.
 &HT;    To keep kids involved, give each child a disposable camera to
photograph their trip and have the film developed at one-hour labs
along the way.
 &HT;    And pack carry-ons with at least one outfit per person in case
the checked luggage gets lost en route.
 &HT;    ``My family did major RV trips the last two summers and spent
weeks on the road,'' Loomis recalls. ``We took turns picking what
we'd do when we stopped. The rule was that you couldn't bribe the
other person. So my son picked Oscar's Dreamland in Billings,
Mont., which turned out to be 15 acres of old farm equipment. We
had the best afternoon because we laughed so much. We ended up with
great memories.''
 &HT;    Loomis says the best family vacations revolve around things that
everyone might enjoy.
 &HT;    ``Some people like five-star resorts,'' she says, ``while others
like a cabin in the woods and some need to be by the water. You
need to choose vacations that meet everybody's needs to some
degree. The best vacations are those where you've given the kids
some input into what you're doing.''
 &HT;    But there are vacations that aren't well-suited to some
families.
 &HT;    ``A lot of people think that the beach is great with a baby,''
Loomis says. ``It's probably the worst choice. Babies need to eat
and sleep and that means one parent is going back and forth to the
room. And babies shouldn't be exposed to that much sun.''
 &HT;    For young children, Loomis suggests camping vacations.
 &HT;    ``I'm from Colorado where there are lots of serious campers,''
she notes. ``But with kids, you have to scale back. Car camping
becomes a viable way to experience the wilderness. It's different,
but it's no less rewarding. And RVs are a great way to travel.
You've got a refrigerator, which is great if you need to keep
formula. It's a safe environment that stays the same, which is good
for babies, toddlers and preschoolers who like routines. And it
solves the 'I'm-really-uncomfortable-in-the-backseat' blues.''
 &HT;    And what was the best vacation that Loomis and her family have
taken?
 &HT;    ``An RV trip,'' she says. ``We've seen more of America that way.
Two summers ago, we covered 23 states and one province. Last
summer, we did five or six national parks. The great thing about an
RV is that when you see a sign and it sounds interesting, you can
just go.
 &HT;    ``One of my daughters loves history, so we saw Truman's house
and Lincoln's house. My older daughter is into adventure, so went
rafting. And my son loves everything.''
 &HT;    Loomis' most valuable advice: Go with the flow.
 &HT;    ``It's never going to be perfect,'' she says. ``What your family
is at home is what they are on vacation. Humor and flexibility are
crucial.''

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Summer's here _ a time when a running car engine can sound like
a siren's call for many mature travelers looking to take a
vacation.
 &HT;    Here are some ideas to tease your wanderlust into action:
 OREGON TRAIL  
 &HT;    A number of ``interpretive centers'' along part of the Oregon
Trail _ from the town of Ontario, Ore., near the Idaho border to
Oregon City near Portland _ help to make this trek through American
history more interesting than ever.
 &HT;    The fifth and newest center, the Tamastslikt Cultural Institute
(pronounced tuh-must-slikt), (541) 966-9748, five miles east of
Pendleton, Ore., presents the adventures that created the Oregon
frontier.
 &HT;    To help make the 350-mile drive along the trail more meaningful,
ask for a brochure called ``A Guide to the Oregon Trail'' as well
as a brochure/map titled ``Then &AMP; Now,'' which details the path's
many attractions.
 &HT;    Tamastslikt, which means ``interpreter'' in the Walla Walla
language, is the only center along the Oregon Trail designed by,
and dedicated to, Native Americans. It describes three tribes
before and after settlement by emigrants. The complex includes the
Wildhorse Gaming Resort, a 100-unit hotel, 18-hole golf course and
100-space RV park.
 &HT;    Each of the interpretive centers has a unique focus:
 &HT;    Starting east in Ontario, Ore., is the Four Rivers Cultural
Center, (888) 211-1222, which uses interactive exhibits to show the
melding of cultures. Watch for the internment camps that held
Japanese-Americans released from World War II as well as the
influence of the Northern Paiute people and Mexican vaqueros.
 &HT;    Five miles east of Baker, Ore., is the National Historic Oregon
Trail Interpretive Center, (800) 523-1235, at Flagstaff Hill _
where pioneers caught their first glimpse of the promised land.
Here, visitors experience hands-on history, including the chance to
walk in the wagon ruts made by the emigrants more than a century
earlier.
 &HT;    Then comes Tamastslikt followed by the Columbia Gorge Discovery
Center, (541) 296-8600, at The Dalles. As the official interpretive
center for the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, the
Columbia unit dishes up details about fiery volcanoes, massive
landslides and raging floods.
 &HT;    The final stop is the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive
Center, (503) 657-9336, at Oregon City _ also the last destination
for thousands of pioneers. Here, one can find three 50-foot-high
covered-wagon-shaped buildings, an amphitheater and the Heritage
Gardens. On summer evenings, the Oregon Trail Pageant is performed.
Senior discounts are offered at all the centers.
 RENO'S ART  
 &HT;    The Uptown Downtown ARTown Festival in Reno, Nev., brings more
than 200 events to this city during the month of July.
 &HT;    Many events are free _ like the Roads, Rails &AMP; Runways
transportation exhibit at the National Auto Museum on the Truckee
River. You'll see the Virginia &AMP; Truckee Railroad, Reno's trolley
system, early Nevada airfields and the Lincoln Highway showcased in
a unique auto museum.
 &HT;    During regular exhibits, admission for seniors is $6.50 compared
to the regular $7.50 price.
 &HT;    Also look in on The Great Basin Chautauqua under the tent at
Rancho San Rafael Park, where actors portray such historic figures
as Galileo, Mohandas Gandhi and Isaac Newton and describe the
progress man has made over the last 10 centuries.
 &HT;    The historic districts of Reno can be explored through walking
tours, and unique cultural events like ballet performances and jazz
recitals will take place in a developing river-front setting. For
information on Reno, call (800) 367-7366. The ARTown hotline is
(702) 334-2536, or visit www.artown.org on the Web.
 DRIVE NEWFOUNDLAND  
 &HT;    Maxxim Vacations, a Canadian travel company specializing in the
Atlantic provinces, is offering an 11-day cross-island
bed-and-breakfast tour of Newfoundland that costs about $100 per
day _ including airfare and a car.
 &HT;    The trip starts in St. Johns, where tourgoers take a
double-decker bus tour, and includes a two-night stay in
picture-perfect Trinity. The tour then heads toward Gros Morne
National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Park, and travels along the
Viking trail to Lanse aux Meadows. There are overnights at
bed-and-breakfasts and country inns.
 &HT;    The prices for the Newfoundland Hospitality Tours _ including
airfare _ are $1,159 from Boston, $1,389 from Chicago and $1,439
from Los Angeles. For more information, call (800) 567-6666.
 BOGEY &AMP; BACALL IN OHIO  
 &HT;    Mansfield, Ohio, which is midway between Cleveland and Columbus,
has put together a trio of packaged getaways designed to showcase
Richland County. And best of all, each carries a 10 percent
discount for travelers ages 55 and older.
 &HT;    Mansfield boasts Ohio's only Rails-to-Trails path and was the
site of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's nuptials.
 &HT;    The ``American Nostalgia'' package, for example, includes a ride
on the Richland Carrousel, a tour of the historic Malabar Farm
House and dinner at selected restaurants. The price: $67.49 for
seniors, compared to the regular starting price of $74.99 per
night.
 &HT;    The ``Back to Nature'' package starts at $89.99 _ $81 for mature
travelers _ and includes a bike or skate rental.
 &HT;    ``Holiday Magic,'' which will take place between Nov. 27 and
Dec. 31, starts at $89.99 _ $81 for seniors _ and includes
admission to the Winter Wonderland Holiday Lights Festival.
 &HT;    For more information, call (800) 642-8282 or visit
www.mansfieldtourism.org on the Web.
 SENIORAMA  
 &HT;    The 43rd annual production of ``Seniorama, Life Upon the Wicked
Stage'' will be presented up to five times daily from Sept. 23 to
Sept. 26 in the Civic Auditorium in Santa Cruz, Calif. Tickets for
the musical, which is produced by Senior Citizens' Opportunities,
are $12 a person.
 &HT;    The show can be combined with either a brunch or dinner and a
steam train ride through the Redwoods.
 &HT;    The senior rate for the train ride is $15; for either meal, add
$13.99. The total cost: $28.99.
 &HT;    For more information on Seniorama, call (408) 423-6640; for the
steam train ride, (408) 335-4484.
 &HT;    Call Santa Cruz County Visitors Council for a travelers' guide
at (408) 425-1234.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Summer's here _ a time when a running car engine can sound like
a siren's call for many mature travelers looking to take a
vacation.
 &HT;    Here are some ideas to tease your wanderlust into action:
 OREGON TRAIL  
 &HT;    A number of ``interpretive centers'' along part of the Oregon
Trail _ from the town of Ontario, Ore., near the Idaho border to
Oregon City near Portland _ help to make this trek through American
history more interesting than ever.
 &HT;    The fifth and newest center, the Tamastslikt Cultural Institute
(pronounced tuh-must-slikt), (541) 966-9748, five miles east of
Pendleton, Ore., presents the adventures that created the Oregon
frontier.
 &HT;    To help make the 350-mile drive along the trail more meaningful,
ask for a brochure called ``A Guide to the Oregon Trail'' as well
as a brochure/map titled ``Then &AMP; Now,'' which details the path's
many attractions.
 &HT;    Tamastslikt, which means ``interpreter'' in the Walla Walla
language, is the only center along the Oregon Trail designed by,
and dedicated to, Native Americans. It describes three tribes
before and after settlement by emigrants. The complex includes the
Wildhorse Gaming Resort, a 100-unit hotel, 18-hole golf course and
100-space RV park.
 &HT;    Each of the interpretive centers has a unique focus:
 &HT;    Starting east in Ontario, Ore., is the Four Rivers Cultural
Center, (888) 211-1222, which uses interactive exhibits to show the
melding of cultures. Watch for the internment camps that held
Japanese-Americans released from World War II as well as the
influence of the Northern Paiute people and Mexican vaqueros.
 &HT;    Five miles east of Baker, Ore., is the National Historic Oregon
Trail Interpretive Center, (800) 523-1235, at Flagstaff Hill _
where pioneers caught their first glimpse of the promised land.
Here, visitors experience hands-on history, including the chance to
walk in the wagon ruts made by the emigrants more than a century
earlier.
 &HT;    Then comes Tamastslikt followed by the Columbia Gorge Discovery
Center, (541) 296-8600, at The Dalles. As the official interpretive
center for the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, the
Columbia unit dishes up details about fiery volcanoes, massive
landslides and raging floods.
 &HT;    The final stop is the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive
Center, (503) 657-9336, at Oregon City _ also the last destination
for thousands of pioneers. Here, one can find three 50-foot-high
covered-wagon-shaped buildings, an amphitheater and the Heritage
Gardens. On summer evenings, the Oregon Trail Pageant is performed.
Senior discounts are offered at all the centers.
 RENO'S ART  
 &HT;    The Uptown Downtown ARTown Festival in Reno, Nev., brings more
than 200 events to this city during the month of July.
 &HT;    Many events are free _ like the Roads, Rails &AMP; Runways
transportation exhibit at the National Auto Museum on the Truckee
River. You'll see the Virginia &AMP; Truckee Railroad, Reno's trolley
system, early Nevada airfields and the Lincoln Highway showcased in
a unique auto museum.
 &HT;    During regular exhibits, admission for seniors is $6.50 compared
to the regular $7.50 price.
 &HT;    Also look in on The Great Basin Chautauqua under the tent at
Rancho San Rafael Park, where actors portray such historic figures
as Galileo, Mohandas Gandhi and Isaac Newton and describe the
progress man has made over the last 10 centuries.
 &HT;    The historic districts of Reno can be explored through walking
tours, and unique cultural events like ballet performances and jazz
recitals will take place in a developing river-front setting. For
information on Reno, call (800) 367-7366. The ARTown hotline is
(702) 334-2536, or visit www.artown.org on the Web.
 DRIVE NEWFOUNDLAND  
 &HT;    Maxxim Vacations, a Canadian travel company specializing in the
Atlantic provinces, is offering an 11-day cross-island
bed-and-breakfast tour of Newfoundland that costs about $100 per
day _ including airfare and a car.
 &HT;    The trip starts in St. Johns, where tourgoers take a
double-decker bus tour, and includes a two-night stay in
picture-perfect Trinity. The tour then heads toward Gros Morne
National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Park, and travels along the
Viking trail to Lanse aux Meadows. There are overnights at
bed-and-breakfasts and country inns.
 &HT;    The prices for the Newfoundland Hospitality Tours _ including
airfare _ are $1,159 from Boston, $1,389 from Chicago and $1,439
from Los Angeles. For more information, call (800) 567-6666.
 BOGEY &AMP; BACALL IN OHIO  
 &HT;    Mansfield, Ohio, which is midway between Cleveland and Columbus,
has put together a trio of packaged getaways designed to showcase
Richland County. And best of all, each carries a 10 percent
discount for travelers ages 55 and older.
 &HT;    Mansfield boasts Ohio's only Rails-to-Trails path and was the
site of Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall's nuptials.
 &HT;    The ``American Nostalgia'' package, for example, includes a ride
on the Richland Carrousel, a tour of the historic Malabar Farm
House and dinner at selected restaurants. The price: $67.49 for
seniors, compared to the regular starting price of $74.99 per
night.
 &HT;    The ``Back to Nature'' package starts at $89.99 _ $81 for mature
travelers _ and includes a bike or skate rental.
 &HT;    ``Holiday Magic,'' which will take place between Nov. 27 and
Dec. 31, starts at $89.99 _ $81 for seniors _ and includes
admission to the Winter Wonderland Holiday Lights Festival.
 &HT;    For more information, call (800) 642-8282 or visit
www.mansfieldtourism.org on the Web.
 SENIORAMA  
 &HT;    The 43rd annual production of ``Seniorama, Life Upon the Wicked
Stage'' will be presented up to five times daily from Sept. 23 to
Sept. 26 in the Civic Auditorium in Santa Cruz, Calif. Tickets for
the musical, which is produced by Senior Citizens' Opportunities,

 c.1998 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It has been nearly a decade since America's
``white-collar recession'' introduced managers to the hazards of
corporate downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of those managers eventually landed on their feet,
they have spent that decade adapting to a world which offers less
prestige, less security, and fewer nooks and crannies in which
underperformers can hide.
</P>
<P>
   Those managers have had it easy, however, compared with what is
about to happen in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Macroeconomic problems are only part of the story. The real
reason that Japan's managers are in trouble is the need for
long-term restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In America, this was underlined by a shift from smokestack
industries and into high-tech ones, and by firms' efforts to adapt
themselves to new information technology and more assertive
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese firms must also respond to these forces _ and at the
same time unravel several mutually reinforcing habits. A decade ago
those habits were the envy of the West. Now, they spell trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar is long-term employment. When capital was
cheap, and Japanese companies were expanding rapidly, it was easy
to promise young salarymen a job for life. Once the economy
matured, those bright young corporate assets became aging
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost a decade, for example, since Mitsubishi
started an early-retirement plan to unload middle-aged managers:
anyone over 48 years old receives a topped-up pension if he leaves.
Several other big firms have since offered similar schemes.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is knowing just what to do with all those men idling
by the window. Harder still is to adapt the way in which Japanese
middle managers are trained.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of lifetime employment, seniority-based pay and
rapid growth has encouraged firms to invest in wasteful training.
Early in their careers managers are rotated among jobs and
locations, asking few questions when they are transferred, since
they know their careers are in good hands.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of this training is different from that in western
firms. Because they move around so much, Japanese managers rarely
develop special expertise in, say, marketing or corporate finance.
</P>
<P>
   And because they expect a one-company career, they invest most
heavily in the skill they know they will need: office politics. A
salaryman takes great pains to become a better Mitsubishi man,
Mitsui man or whatever company man is required.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of following these practices, Japan's corporate
infantry has become a battalion of generalists _ middle managers
with no transferable skills, and untrained for anything other than
being loyal employees.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies need to change how they recruit, train and
promote their managers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese managers still deny there is a problem. Nobuyuki
Idei, president of Sony, says he is not worried about the shifting
nature of Japanese careers. When pressed, however, he explains that
many of the firm's divisions are now based overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Kurisaka, Tokyo managing partner of Egon Zehnder
International, a headhunting firm, does not believe that Japanese
companies have grasped the size of their task. ``People all talk
about what they have to do,'' he laments, ``but...they don't really
want to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the promise of a long, secure career rings hollow,
recruiters must offer a new bargain: that young managers will
acquire the skills they need to be valuable to other companies. Yet
once a company provides managers with the training they need, they
risk losing them to someone else _ a problem familiar to western
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Thus many companies now recognize the need to send their young
managers to foreign business schools. But whereas American
companies require their employees to refund tuition money if they
leave, this is still illegal in Japan. Instead, companies try to
require their employees to stay for five years or so after they
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese companies must also inject fresh ideas into their
organizations. Despite their glut of managers, many banks have been
busy calling headhunters in search of anybody with a new approach.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just those with financial expertise they are
looking for; they also need people from marketing and IT if they
are to compete with the likes of Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   That is why western companies are benefiting most from the new
market for Japanese managers. For years, IBM was the only foreign
company in the top 50 on surveys of graduates' most-desired
employers. Now, names such as Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and
Microsoft appear.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly because their treatment of workers no longer
seems quite so brutal: when Yamaichi Securities went bankrupt last
year, Merrill Lynch stepped in and gave jobs to a third of its
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover western firms can offer an aspiring young manager a
career in whatever speciality he chooses. If he picks Goldman
Sachs, a graduate can become a specialist in mergers and
acquisitions, or bonds. If he joins a Japanese bank, he may start
in one of its local branches.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just graduates of the best colleges who will benefit
from these changes. When only top-flight firms counted, a degree
from a top college was vital. But creativity, enterprise and
business acumen are not necessarily fostered at such places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is full of competent dropouts,'' says Yasuyuki Nambu,
president of Pasona, a company that recruits and trains young
professionals. Although a few Japanese firms have sought Pasona's
services, foreign affiliates can often make better use of Japan's
diversity of young talent.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign firms also make more attractive employers for those
middle-aged managers who do have useful expertise.
</P>
<P>
   When Sakie Fukushima, a headhunter at Korn/Ferry International,
interviews a candidate, she explains that foreign affiliates expect
their managers to supply ideas and take responsibility for profits
and losses _ a pitch sure to appeal only to the adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   After almost a decade of Japanese firms' talk about an overhaul,
foreign affiliates still account for more than 90 percent of all
executive searches at both headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   For all its flaws, the Japanese system of job rotation and
company-specific training provided its firms with some advantages
over western rivals. Unfortunately, it cannot survive in a world
where capital is dearer and the future is more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a few innovative Japanese firms will combine the best of
both systems. But many in the West also seek an elusive third way.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to all those western management articles applauding
Japanese business methods, the foreigners have a decade-long lead
in finding a compromise between the two systems. &QL;

   WRITERS-WORKSHOP (Fort Worden State Park, Wash.) The beach
beckons, with the sun glistening off the crescent of sand that
kisses Admiralty Inlet, the saltwater beyond alternating between
azure and aquamarine and the imposing snow-capped cone of Mount
Baker standing sentinel on the horizon. Summer in the Northwest is
seldom more dazzling than this. But the largest concentration of
people in this blessed place on the edge of Port Townsend, Wash.,
is not on the beach soaking up sunshine or snatching up seashells.
They are sitting in the cool darkness of the old Joseph F. Wheeler
Theater, where a solitary figure, sometimes a man, sometimes a
woman, stands at a simple lectern on stage and talks about the
delights and frights and disciplines of the imagined word.

   TV-POV (Seattle) Dr. Maren Monsen had been working in the
emergency room just a few weeks when she first had to pronounce
someone dead. The training manual instructed her to check the
patient's breathing and pulse, but it was silent on matters of her
own heart.``It was the first time I had ever been alone in a room
with someone who was dead,'' she later reflected. ``In emergency
medicine we're taught to intervene and be in control. . .. For
doctors, death means failure.'' In time, the young
physician/filmmaker, who hails from Seattle, came to question the
assumption that life must be sustained at all cost. After seeing
patients linger in high-tech misery, she began to wonder: At what
point does life become a fate worse than death? Monsen takes
viewers along on a personal odyssey in her film, ``The Vanishing
Line,'' airing on PBS. The hour-long film is part of public
television's annual summer P.O.V. series, an award-winning showcase
for independent nonfiction films with a distinct point of view.

   FORT WORDEN STATE PARK, Wash. _ The beach beckons, with the sun
glistening off the crescent of sand that kisses Admiralty Inlet,
the saltwater beyond alternating between azure and aquamarine and
the imposing snow-capped cone of Mount Baker standing sentinel on
the horizon. Summer in the Northwest is seldom more dazzling than
this.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest concentration of people in this blessed place on
the edge of Port Townsend is not on the beach soaking up sunshine
or snatching up seashells. They are sitting in the cool darkness of
the old Joseph F. Wheeler Theater, where a solitary figure,
sometimes a man, sometimes a woman, stands at a simple lectern on
stage and talks about the delights and frights and disciplines of
the imagined word.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Port Townsend Writers' Conference, 25th anniversary
edition, where 140 people from Key West to Hawaii gather for 10
summer days and nights devoted to the intensive study of writing.
This is more intellectual boot camp than lazy days summer camp. The
intent and earnest attendees endure stark barracks quarters and
dreary mess-hall food that strongly recall the distant past of this
turn-of-the-century artillery post.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the writing life is not supposed to be some loll in a
hammock, so this conference's rigors may be a most appropriate
reflection of the devotions required in pursuit of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to be too easy,'' admits Jan Wesley, whose
tousled blond looks, weathered leather jacket, blue jeans and host
of silver bracelets bespeak her Los Angeles home and her work in
the film industry. ``I wanted a kick in the ass here, both in terms
of inspiration and to jump-start my own writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley is a typical Port Townsend attendee. She is a woman in
her late 40s _ more than three quarters of the students here are
women, year in and year out, and most seem to be in their 40s.
Wesley has been willing to leave normal life and its obligations
behind in the hope that 10 days away and an investment of nearly
$1,000 will somehow provide what she needs to finally spark
progress toward her long-simmering dream of becoming a serious
writer.
</P>
<P>
   So Wesley sits in a morning class in the old post schoolhouse
and dutifully records the sage but witty advice of poet Marvin
Bell, who has written 13 well-praised books. Bell is a writers'
conference veteran whose graying bearded presence recalls the late
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. He is enumerating a baker's
dozen tips on being a successful writer but is also injecting so
many puckish asides that what he says delights almost as much as it
instructs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things matter _ if you want to write about eternity,
don't write about eternity; write about your cup of coffee,'' Bell
advises. ``It's poetry, it's only poetry _ you have to have both
attitudes. Poetry comes out of life, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is one of 11 faculty members at this summer's conference
(which ended July 19), put on by Centrum, the small but ambitious
non-profit arts organization headquartered at the fort.
</P>
<P>
   These 11 faculty members are writers of stature with books and
fellowships, prizes and professorships to their credit, which is
why the faculty has long been one of Port Townsend's big draws. The
list of writers who have taught here in the past reads like a
literary honor roll, including such notables as Raymond Carver,
Margaret Atwood, Kenneth Rexroth, Alice Walker, Carolyn Kizer, Tom
Robbins and Tobias Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ransom did not have such grand dreams a quarter century
ago, when Fort Worden was becoming a state park and conference
center after doing duty as a treatment center for juveniles. What
Ransom and two compatriots (Joe Wheeler, Donn Trethewey) were
trying to do then was find something that could use some of the
fort's facilities but not require the purchase of much additional
equipment, something preferably in the arts that might snare some
grant money.
</P>
<P>
   A dance festival and a writer's conference were what they came
up with, with the writer's conference closely modeled on what
Ransom had observed when he worked as a waiter two years before at
the Breadloaf Writers' Conference in Vermont. There was only a
handful of such conferences at the time. Port Townsend's later
emergence as one of this country's leading writing conferences,
amid what is now a glut, probably owes more to its early founding
than to its decidedly modest beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom, who served as the conference's director in its fledgling
years, has returned this summer as an instructor, part of a faculty
alumni contingent brought back for the anniversary by current
director Sam Hamill. Ransom has gone on to publish novels and
collections of poems, while also working as a teacher (now at The
Evergreen State College), just as many other writers must do to put
something in the checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom remains a firm believer in the value of writing
conferences: ``One of the big boosts that comes from these
conferences is from seeing that ordinary people do this _ they
demystify writing. And I also believe that if you give me students
here for six hours a day for two weeks, I can give them what I can
teach in a quarter at school. Conferences are superb, especially
for busy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Their time at Port Townsend is busy as well. The crowded daily
schedule quickly becomes implanted in attendees' brains: 8 a.m.
breakfast; 9 a.m. lecture by an instructor; 10:30 a.m. class for
two hours; 12:30 lunch; early afternoon conferences with
instructors; 3 p.m. lecture by an instructor; 6 p.m. dinner; 7:30
p.m. reading by an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of exhilaration and exhaustion flows through both
students and instructors, what with all the events and classes to
attend, the writing to complete or critically assess, the stories
to share in free moments at this sudden gathering of strangers with
like devotions.
</P>
<P>
   As Jane Hirshfield, a 45-year-old poet and instructor from Mill
Valley, Calif., puts it: ``To be in a community of people of shared
passions is a tremendous gift. It is exciting to be able to step
out of our own rooms once a year and find yourself among people who
get as excited about semicolons as you do. A lot of writers can go
all year on the energy that comes from that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that does not come easy. The central moment for many
students at the conference is submitting one's own writing for
critique by 15 or so fellow students and the instructor. This is
private and often intensely personal work suddenly turned naked
public entity, a time for flushed faces and churning stomachs or
worse. Tears are sometimes seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings you up against all your self-doubts and your
impossible standards and you have to confront those, day after
day,'' says Robyn Johnson of Stanwood, an aspiring poet whose
regular life revolves around the financial concerns of directing
the Everett Parks Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come here wanting to perform,'' observes Bruce
Elkin of Saltspring Island, B.C., who is attending for the second
time. ``But when they're criticized, they don't know how to take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouragement can be profound. Elkin's previous instructor at
Port Townsend three years ago implied he ``should go into law
enforcement instead of writing,'' advice that the 55-year-old
consultant ultimately discarded, but not without much
soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, fellow students and instructors try to be
encouraging, especially since rejection is such a frequent
companion in the writer's trade. So constructive criticism usually
abounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling how many hours of hard writing may be
spawned when instructor Annick Smith of Missoula advises one
student, ``This is a powerful, promising start; this has all the
things to make you go on.'' Or when instructor William Kittredge _
who is team-teaching the non-fiction class with Smith, his longtime
partner _ advises another student, ``This gets at some deep-seated
and difficult stuff and I admire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such encouraging words answer a deep craving for aspiring and
beginning writers, which is why many keep coming back to Port
Townsend. Fifteen percent of this year's attendees have been here
before, including Karen Seashore from Sandpoint, Idaho, a
51-year-old former teacher who has left her husband and two teens
at home to attend Port Townsend for the seventh straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place to study like this in my town,'' Seashore
says. ``And I find what I want here _ the faculty is approachable
and I have 10 days without phones or family, amid the fellowship of
writers and the beauty of this place, the bluff, the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The considerable charms of Port Townsend and its Olympic
Peninsula surroundings do add to the allure of the writer's
conference. This town of 8,275 people manages to be arty but not
artificial, a working community with a paper mill and handsome
Victorian buildings in various states of renovation, an enviable
place that seems to be just isolated enough to avoid turning all
cutesy-touristy.
</P>
<P>
   Port Townsend, despite much growth and grumbling, is still not
Aspen or Carmel or La Jolla or even La Conner. But the city remains
well-known in the national arts community, in part because it is
home to Copper Canyon Press (also situated at the fort), which is
probably the country's pre-eminent publisher of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   But the writer's conference is only one of many nationally
recognized workshops and festivals put on by Centrum, a perennially
cash-strapped outfit that somehow manages to mount a non-stop
parade of events throughout the year, everything from classical
music to jazz to fiddle tunes to country blues, events that give
Port Townsend a rich cultural life that many cities 10 times its
size could envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centrum and Copper Canyon are both really well-known back
East,'' says Alison Swan, a 36-year-old editor and reviewer from
Saugatuck, Mich. ``And I think this conference has been fabulous. I
definitely feel recharged by being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the writer's conference are not without their
complaints. Many students wish there were more social activities
with the faculty, while the faculty members wish they had more time
when they were not buried under an avalanche of student papers to
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism, too, is sometimes voiced in private about Hamill, the
conference director, whose introductions of writers at the readings
and lectures are so brusque and insider-enigmatic that they border
on being rude. Some repeat attendees, both students and faculty,
say they yearn for the more civil days past when students
themselves introduced the writers, especially since all these
events are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill is widely respected for being co-founder and editor at
Copper Canyon Press, as well as a much-praised poet and translator
of Chinese literature. But his sandpaper personality does rub many
people the wrong way, especially when he turns stern camp counselor
on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 150 of us here and I have had reports of yelling
problems between some of you and parties at 2 a.m.,'' Hamill
lectures at one point. ``If you can't be kind, be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such moments are quickly forgotten, though, once the readings
begin and the magic of well-chosen words spills off the stage and
drifts out into the summer air.
</P>
<P>
   John Balaban, a 54-year-old poet from Miami, gives a stunning
reading to hushed silence and frequent bursts of applause. He reads
not only his own work, but also poems in Vietnamese and poems he
has translated from Vietnamese, including those from a decade of
work he has devoted to one obscure Vietnamese woman poet who lived
in the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is the central theme of Balaban's work _ he was a
conscientious objector during the Vietnam War who served in Vietnam
as a field representative for the Committee of Responsibility to
Save War-Injured Children. His humanity courses through his poems,
a strong current of caring, and the audience is hanging on his
every word as Balaban builds to the close of his poem, ``Words for
My Daughter'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know the worst and be free from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know the worst and still find good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, as you play nearby or laugh
</P>
<P>
   ``with the ladies at Peoples Bank as we go around town
</P>
<P>
   ``and I find myself beaming like a fool,
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect I am here less for your protection
</P>
<P>
   ``than you are here for mine, as if you were sent
</P>
<P>
   ``to call me back into our helpless tribe.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Lincoln Mercury, Ford's most lackluster division,
is hardly known for its foresight. The joke used to be that the
company's cars were driven exclusively by people's fathers. Now
they are driven exclusively by their grandfathers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in moving its headquarters from Detroit to the Irvine
Spectrum _ a decision that was implemented on July 14 _ Lincoln may
have backed something with more of a future.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000-acre Spectrum, which sits in the heart of Orange
County, Calif., at the intersection of two freeways, is one of
America's most successful business parks, outdoing such rivals as
North Carolina's Research Triangle in everything from office space
to employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum boasts 20 million square feet of commercial space,
more than the whole of downtown San Francisco. It is home to 44,000
employees and 2,200 companies, most of them high-tech start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Creating successful business clusters is the philosopher's stone
of developers. Why has the Spectrum succeeded where so many others
have failed? Locals thank the weather. But the same weather has
hardly turned South-Central Los Angeles into a business Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   They are also full of praise for the University of California's
Irvine campus. But UCI is hardly Stanford or Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Transport has a lot to do with it. From the roof of the AT&AMP;T
building in the Spectrum you can see 26 lanes of freeway and 22
lanes of arterial roads. But what matters more than roads is
something that has fallen into disrepute: planning.
</P>
<P>
   In the Irvine Spectrum the planning is so meticulous that it
conjures up images of the ``Stepford Wives,'' a film about suburban
America in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The business park is but a small part of a gigantic ``Master
Plan'' that was drawn up in 1966 by the Irvine Company, a private
developer that owns a fifth of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   The company could have made a killing when Los Angeles began to
sprawl southwards into its land. But instead it decided to create
something as different from L.A. as possible.
</P>
<P>
   It studied urban developments around the world _ particularly
Britain's garden cities _ and came up with a detailed plan for what
it calls ``orderly growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Bren, a billionaire who took control of the Irvine
Company in 1983, is second to none in his enthusiasm for the Master
Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum is one of the company's three successful business
parks. (A fourth is being built next to the university.) But the
company is just as keen on planning housing, schooling, shopping
and recreation, and it does so with an attention to detail that
makes Singapore's Senior Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, look sloppy.
</P>
<P>
   The local houses are built around village greens; there are
shops within walking distance. In L.A. Tudor manor houses jostle
with mock Byzantine temples; in Irvine you can find yourself in the
wrong house unless you check the number first.
</P>
<P>
   The Spectrum's streets (which rejoice in names such as
``Enterprise,'' ``Fortune'' and ``Technology'') are lined with
mature palm trees that Bren personally selected.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who puts up a neon sign bearing his company's name, or
paints his building anything other than white, is reminded of the
Irvine company's ``rules and regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Business people are usually disdainful of bureaucracy and you
might expect that they would chafe at such restrictions. Instead
they seem to love them.
</P>
<P>
   When the Spectrum opened in the early 1980s it found its first
customers among the Japanese, precisely because it offered such an
orderly environment.
</P>
<P>
   The then-head of Toshiba told the Irvine Company that one of the
things that led him to invest $100 million in the Spectrum was the
certainty that nobody would build a monstrosity opposite his
building. Another 32 Japanese companies have come to the Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans seem equally enthusiastic about micro-management.
Henry Nicholas, the boss of Broadcom Corporation, a chip maker that
has just had a successful public flotation, gives several reasons
why Irvine's obsession with planning is good for business, reasons
that are echoed by others around the Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   One is that it helps in recruiting people from abroad, now a
condition of survival in the high-tech world. Foreigners who
associate Southern California with strip malls and drive-by
shootings are comforted by Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The villages look almost European. The schools have the highest
SAT scores in California. The place is so orderly that the police
break up teenage parties in private houses at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that it makes the future less uncertain. So far the
company has put the pieces of the Master Plan in place with an
almost eerie smoothness, even continuing its orderly growth during
the recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The company has long promised shops and cinemas as soon as there
was enough demand; sure enough, in 1995 the Spectrum got a shopping
mall complete with a 21-screen multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley companies are continually whining about
gridlocked roads and sky-high property prices. The Spectrum is set
to double its size before it is finished; and the Irvine company is
determined to keep a balance between business and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas welcomes planning because it leaves him with less to
worry about. He wants to concentrate on running Broadcom _ and the
Irvine Company removes distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest public-relations problem is that people
are forever bringing up George Orwell's ``1984.'' ``The Truman
Show,'' a film that features a squeaky clean town that turns out to
be the plaything of a megalomaniacal television producer, has not
helped.
</P>
<P>
   Locals point out that Orange County has other landlords, and
that local towns had their own characters long before the Master
Plan. But for all its success, the Spectrum remains rather spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Mercury suffered because it insisted on making cars for
aging Midwesterners. The danger now is that it will start making
cars for the Stepford wives. &QL;

has just had a successful public flotation, gives several reasons
why Irvine's obsession with planning is good for business, reasons
that are echoed by others around the Spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   One is that it helps in recruiting people from abroad, now a
condition of survival in the high-tech world. Foreigners who
associate Southern California with strip malls and drive-by
shootings are comforted by Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   The villages look almost European. The schools have the highest
SAT scores in California. The place is so orderly that the police
break up teenage parties in private houses at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that it makes the future less uncertain. So far the
company has put the pieces of the Master Plan in place with an
almost eerie smoothness, even continuing its orderly growth during
the recession of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The company has long promised shops and cinemas as soon as there
was enough demand; sure enough, in 1995 the Spectrum got a shopping
mall complete with a 21-screen multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   In Silicon Valley companies are continually whining about
gridlocked roads and sky-high property prices. The Spectrum is set
to double its size before it is finished; and the Irvine company is
determined to keep a balance between business and housing.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas welcomes planning because it leaves him with less to
worry about. He wants to concentrate on running Broadcom _ and the
Irvine Company removes distractions.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest public-relations problem is that people
are forever bringing up George Orwell's ``1984.'' ``The Truman
Show,'' a film that features a squeaky clean town that turns out to
be the plaything of a megalomaniacal television producer, has not
helped.
</P>
<P>
   Locals point out that Orange County has other landlords, and
that local towns had their own characters long before the Master
Plan. But for all its success, the Spectrum remains rather spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Mercury suffered because it insisted on making cars for
aging Midwesterners. The danger now is that it will start making
cars for the Stepford wives. &QL;

LIFE NOT ALWAYS SUNNY FOR STAR OF `A SUMMER PLACE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Troy Donahue sat pool-side at the Hotel del Sol,
tan as ever, a little on the thin side, the sleeves of his
cream-colored shirt rolled above his elbows, his blond hair
streaked with shades of gray.
</P>
<P>
   He looked past the hammocks in the courtyard, squinting back 40
years to see himself in ``A Summer Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year in New York, Sandra Dee and I went to ... I call it
a `retrospective,' I don't really know what it is,'' he said. ``I
hadn't seen `A Summer Place' on the big screen in almost 25 years.
To see yourself like that, 25 feet high, to see those two beautiful
kids up there ... it took my breath away. I thought, `My God,
that's me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, 62, was barely out of his teens when he came to
Hollywood and Warner Bros. picked him to star in ``A Summer
Place.'' He can remember ``this feeling that the movie was really
going to click, that we'd hit the sweepstakes. I saw it in a
regular theater for the first time in Pasadena _ looked around,
heard the music, and thought, `We might have something here' ... it
was pretty heady stuff for a kid 22 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing ``A Summer Place'' brings back the month and a half he
spent on location in Carmel, Pacific Grove and Monterey, Donahue
said. ``I can still see Sandra and me on top of that rock on
17-Mile Drive, waiting for the shoot, waiting for the fog to lift
...''
</P>
<P>
   When it came out in 1959, ``A Summer Place'' got a reputation as
``the make-out movie of its era,'' but Donahue never thought of it
as being that hot and steamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really. Not when you think of those Tennessee Williams
things, all that deviation,'' he said. ``I think the reason people
felt that way was because I knocked up Gidget, and it was a
sacrilege to do that to Gidget.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all seemed so damned innocent to me,'' he said of the
movie. ``My personal life was a lot more ... interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   After the success of ``A Summer Place,'' Donahue's personal life
and professional career took a roller-coaster ride through a series
of so-what films, four marriages _ including one to actress Suzanne
Pleshette, a crazed tour of Vietnam, a brush with greatness in
``Godfather II,'' and a love-boat run through tunnels of drugs and
booze.
</P>
<P>
   After Warner Bros. threw Donahue into airhead movies like ``Palm
Springs Weekend'' and ``Parrish,'' coupled with appearances in TV's
``Surfside 6'' and ``Hawaiian Eye,'' his career hit the skids,
helped along by his drinking. A drinker since the seventh-grade,
Donahue found himself flopping overnight at whatever house was
handy.
</P>
<P>
   By 1968, Donahue said, ``It got to where it was, `Hey,
everybody, Troy Donahue's sleeping on my couch, you want to come
over and take a look at him?'''
</P>
<P>
   That year the USO called Donahue and he wound up in Special
Services, sent to Vietnam to entertain the troops. ``I think they
saw me as some kind of right-winger, a conservative hawk,'' he
said. ``They had it wrong. The heart of an anarchist beat in my
chest. But I went, partly because I was into drugs and I knew
Vietnam was one big medicine chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, who was given his own Huey to fly around the country,
remembered talking about the steamy scenes in ``A Summer Place''
with a group of soldiers after the helicopter touched down at a
camp near the Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy says, `You know, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
got laid,''' said Donahue, looking away toward the Caribbean-yellow
walls of the del Sol. ``Just after that, the guy was killed. Three
of them. A mortar shell ... right after he said that to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue fell silent, then turned to say Special Services found
out what he was doing, including hitting up nurses for mind-numbing
drugs. ``And they said, `Hey, we've got the wrong guy here.' They
threw me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue returned to the United States to muddle through some
chump films, including Oliver Stone's first attempts at hand-held
direction, and had a stint in the soap opera ``The Secret Storm''
before getting a call from Francis Ford Coppola to play a member of
the Corleone family in ``Godfather II.'' It was a favor, Donahue
figures, dating back to his school days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 14, my dad died of Lou Gehrig's disease and my mom
sent me to New York Military Academy, up above West Point,'' he
said. ``I got into drama _ putting on school plays _ and there was
this one guy who had a band scholarship ... a kind of roly-poly guy
who played the tuba. He was the kind of guy who could get a laugh
just walking through the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``His name was Francis Ford Coppola. I put him in a few plays. I
guess `Godfather II' was kind of to pay me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue remembered scenes around the table in ``Godfather II''
with other actors winking and calling him Merle, his given name.
Donahue was born Merle Johnson Jr., in New York General Hospital
and was ``brought up on Broadway shows ... seeing all that
adulation, all that worship of actors, I thought, `Why would anyone
want to anything else?'''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Donahue had hoped to revive his career with ``Godfather II,''
``But I was still into drinking and drugging. No way I was going to
make it, the way I was. It's not that I was falling-down drunk on
the set or anything, but I knew what was happening and it ate at
me. It's a soul-destroying thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For years after ``Godfather II,'' Donahue said he lived ``the
life of a washed-up movie star ... but then something happened, I
really don't know what. I got sober and never went back.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been 16 years now, said Donahue, adding, ``It's great to
get that second chance. You're thinking all that time about
celebrity, about being a big name, but when you get sober you
realize none of that mattered. An alcoholic's problem is not
drinking, it's living.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Donahue got a job with Holland-America Lines, directing
passengers in scenes from movies like ``It Happened One Night.'' He
met and fell for mezzo-soprano Zheng Cao, globe-hopping with her
from opera to opera _ ``We just got back from Geneva, where she did
`Madame Butterfly,''' he said. And last year Donahue toured for
more than four months with a production of ``Bye Bye Birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids in the cast were asking, `Who's this Donahue
guy?''' he said. ``I told 'em to ask their mother, or grandmother,
and they'd get an earful.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, people confuse Donahue with Tab Hunter, blond star of
big-screen soaps like ``Battle Cry.'' ``Tab's been pretty open
about his homosexuality,'' Donahue said. ``But people always
confuse us. I've been accused of being gay, and he's been accused
of being straight.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent shoot for Vanity Fair, Donahue and Hunter paired off
for a picture. ``I thought, `Finally, they're going to see we're
two different people.' But then we got the first prints back and in
the caption, sure enough, Tab is Troy and Troy is Tab.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue laughed, a deep, gravelly laugh, and said, ``I don't
want to say I'm a survivor, but I have ... progressed. God knows
when I was 35, I didn't think I'd reach 62. Probably didn't want
to. But I'm not so hard on myself. I appreciate things more and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The drinking wasn't good, said Donahue, the marriage break-ups
he'd just as soon forget, and he still thinks Warner Bros.
doubled-crossed him _ made him do TV and passed him over for lead
parts in ``Splendor in the Grass'' and ``Barefoot in the Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But no regrets, not really. I had a great time,'' he said,
flashing ``A Summer Place'' smile. ``You know, being a movie star
ain't a bad job.''

A SEED OF HOPE IN ULSTER

<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Two weeks after it began, the
standoff that threatened to wreck all the progress made in Northern
Ireland over the last year is all but dead. Tragically, it took the
deaths of three little boys to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by the Orange Order, demanding to march through a
Catholic neighborhood here, went up in smoke with the home where
the Quinn brothers were burned to death last Sunday by a firebomb
that police say was thrown by a Protestant loyalist extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Sickened and in some cases shamed by the deaths and the reaction
to them by some protesters, the crowds in the field next to
Drumcree Church, where the standoff was centered, shrank from
thousands to hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, a rally in the town center here by those who
organized the standoff drew only about 2,000 after organizers were
predicting tens of thousands. Those organizers said they refuse to
compromise their principles, and insist that a token protest will
continue on the hillside at Drumcree until they are allowed to
march down Garvaghy Road, a route they have followed since 1807.
</P>
<P>
   Before he attended the Quinn boys' funeral in Ballymoney, Seamus
Mallon, the nationalist deputy leader of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly, captured the bitter irony of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the victims of someone else's principles,'' Mallon
said of the boys.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, out of the ashes of the Quinn home, many people see
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate voices eventually drowned out those of extremists.
Mallon and David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader and first
minister of the new assembly, stood shoulder to shoulder throughout
the crisis, while those who led the protest at Drumcree split
acrimoniously.
</P>
<P>
   Long loathed and criticized as biased by most Catholic
nationalists, the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which is 93 percent
Protestant, and the British army showed they could hold the line
against loyalist agitation and violence.
</P>
<P>
   And in Belfast, after a disputed march was allowed through the
Catholic Lower Ormeau Road last Monday, both sides showed that
peaceful, principled protest and demonstrations had a future. While
Orangemen marched through without playing some of the triumphalist
songs that Catholic nationalists find offensive, neighborhood
residents stood on the sidewalk, silently protesting by holding
black flags and banners that read, ``Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   The forces determined to use the emotive issue of the annual
marching season, celebrating a 1690 victory by Protestant hero King
William of Orange, to stall power sharing and cross-border
cooperation in the new assembly have been dealt a serious setback.
</P>
<P>
   When the standoff began July 5, the forces aligned against
cooperation between Protestant unionists, who want to remain part
of Britain, and Catholic nationalists, who aspire to unity with the
Irish Republic, had managed to attract even unionists who voted for
the Good Friday agreement and those committed to making the
assembly work.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Quinn brothers were killed, and moderate voices
within the Orange Order called for the protest to end, a bitter
split emerged. Nowhere was this rift better illustrated than in the
case of the Rev. William Bingham.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, 35, an Orange Order chaplain, wept after he learned of
the boys' death. Just hours after they died, Bingham took to his
pulpit and asked the Orange Order to call off its protest here. As
someone who believes that Orangemen have a right to march even in
neighborhoods where they are not wanted, and who has buried six
parishioners murdered by the Irish Republican Army, Bingham's words
carried more weight than most.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last night's atrocious act, a 15-minute walk down the
Garvaghy Road by the Orange Order would be a very hollow victory
because it would be in the shadow of three coffins, of little boys
who wouldn't even know what the Orange Order is about,'' Bingham
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, hard-liners dragged Bingham by his clerical collar
and flung him into a ditch. Later, at a prayer service, Joel
Patton, leader of the hard-line Spirit of Drumcree group, stepped
forward, pointed at Bingham and called him a traitor.
</P>
<P>
   But other Protestant ministers were inspired by Bingham's
courageous stand, and the majority of Orange Order chaplains,
shocked by the boys' deaths and appalled by Bingham's treatment,
backed the call to end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The most indelible image of these last two weeks was the photo
of the Quinn brothers _ 8-year-old Jason and 9-year-old Mark with
mischievous grins, 10-year-old Richard with his two front teeth
missing. But another remarkable image was that of members of the
British Paratroop Regiment guarding the nationalist side of the
barrier at Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, it was paratroopers who opened fire on Catholic civil
rights protesters in Derry, killing 14 in what became infamously
known as Bloody Sunday. Those killings, and especially the
exoneration of the paratroopers, flooded the IRA with recruits and
sent Northern Ireland spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the Paras, the most hated soldiers in Ireland,
were protecting Catholics. Backed by a British government that says
it is determined to show that nationalists will be treated equally,
the security forces rose to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, did not prevent Garvaghy Road residents from
complaining that a caravan of cars from Belfast bearing provisions
for the beleaguered neighborhood was searched by police while
loyalists were allowed to drive unhindered to the field at
Drumcree. When police began searching loyalist cars a few days ago,
they uncovered weapons and all but shut down the protest.
</P>
<P>
   Monica McWilliams, leader of the Women's Coalition, a moderate
party, said she believes the repudiation of the hard-liners, and
the fledgling spirit of nonviolent protest, show that the vast
majority of people here are willing to move beyond traditional
flashpoints and let the new institutions create a more peaceful,
equitable Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' she said, standing on the Lower Ormeau Road as
residents applauded themselves after their peaceful protest. ``This
is the new Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the old one is always hovering in the background.
While the killings of the Quinn boys was unusual, the firebombing
of Catholic homes at this time of year is not. The fervor whipped
up around the annual July 12 celebrations, when Protestants
celebrate the victory of Britain's Protestant King William of
Orange over the country's deposed Catholic ruler, James II,
inevitably leads to Catholic families being intimidated out of
Protestant neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 Catholic families were forced out of their homes,
about twice the average number for the first two weeks of July,
according to police and the Northern Ireland Housing Executive.
There were also retaliatory attacks on Protestant halls and
businesses, presumably by Catholics, and the homes of Protestant
police officers were attacked by loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   While Trimble and Mallon proved their mettle as leaders, they
will be tested again in September, when the new assembly
reconvenes. Trimble's unionist enemies will hold him to his pledge
that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, will not be allowed to
take its two cabinet seats until the IRA begins handing in weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Indirect talks between the local Orange lodge and Garvaghy Road
residents resumed Saturday, but compromise seems a long way off,
and that means Drumcree could be a flashpoint again. More hopeful
is the agreement by another Protestant fraternal group, the
Apprentice Boys, to meet with residents from Derry's Bogside
neighborhood to discuss the routing of their annual parade next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a week after the deaths of three little boys, most people
in Northern Ireland believe they have weathered the annual storm
caused by the march at Drumcree.

STEVEN SPIELBERG'S EXTENDED FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ People look for the Steven Spielberg story in
the dollar signs that dance through their heads when his name is
mentioned. But that's not where it's to be found. Family history,
family trauma, family dynamics are the source of the energies
propelling Spielberg's best films. ``Close Encounters'' stemmed
from youthful stargazing with his computer-programmer father.
``E.T.'' is rooted in his youthful longing for solidity in the
aftermath of his parents' divorce. ``Schindler's List,'' over which
he procrastinated for nine years, got made when he reconnected with
his Judaism, feeling impelled to pass its traditions on to his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other successful artists, Spielberg instinctively
knows enough to leave things at the intuitive level, that stories
work best when they bubble up from the psychic depths. ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' his new film about a behind-the-lines military
rescue on the heels of D-Day, starring Tom Hanks as the captain of
a commando unit and Matt Damon as the GI they're trying to save
because his three brothers have been killed, is set during a war
that took place before the filmmaker was born. But there's a lot at
stake for the 50-year-old Spielberg. Although his films have
grossed billions, and he's recognized as the pop-culture master of
the movies' last quarter-century, he has only grudgingly been
respected as a serious film artist. Not until ``Schindler's List''
was the power of his storytelling recognized as art. ``Amistad,''
in some ways superior to ``Schindler's List,'' was sandbagged.
</P>
<P>
   So Spielberg hit the beaches last year on a self-imposed mission
to reinvigorate the war film, silence the doubters, and come
through as the heavy hitter for his new studio, DreamWorks, which
he runs with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. At a deeper
level, his passion was engaged because this was the film he was
making for his combat-veteran father, 81, who fought in Burma and
complained _ as many of the war veterans his son interviewed did _
that Hollywood never depicted the war they fought, even in its
relatively good films.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad even gave me a couple of scenes for the movie,''
Spielberg says, leaning forward on a hotel armchair, trim, animated
behind wire spectacles, in a summer suit and tieless blue shirt.
``I've made a lot of films from that period. My mom and dad were
products of the 1940s and somehow I just have kind of a strange
connection to that period. I can relate to it actually more than to
the 1990s. Also, the heart of the story drew me. Just the moral
issue of why you send eight men to save one, possibly orphaning
eight parents just to return one to a single mom. The minute I
couldn't find an easy answer, then I began to explore the fact that
I'd always wanted to do a story about World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dad told me, as a kid growing up, that it was a just
war and a necessary war, I thought that was a Dad-ism, something a
dad must tell his son to gain his respect. Lo and behold, decades
later, I'm like, `Dad is right.' I did research, especially in
books by Stephen Ambrose and S.L.A. Marshall. But then I knew I
needed to discover what this film needed to become. I knew I
couldn't do it sitting at home with a pencil. I didn't do any
storyboards.'' Spielberg cast the film and plunged into filming on
a stretch of Irish coast that resembled Omaha Beach in Normandy.
The filming, fast and furious, paralleled the invasion _
intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg hurtled through the filming _ 50 shots a day instead
of his usual 20 or 22 _ partly to parallel the chaotic, unrelenting
conditions of battle. The GIs, charging fortified machine-gun
emplacements, carried the day on raw courage _ that, and a lot of
improvisation. Spielberg adopted the same wing-it style.
``Essentially, it was a matter of throwing myself back 55 years,''
he says. ``I was inspired by the photographs of Robert Capa and the
documentaries by John Huston and William Wellman. I said to myself,
it's going to be realistic, it's going to be the veterans' side of
the story, not Hollywood's side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be more of a Signal Corps cameraman in trying to
capture that war the way it was fought, as if I had a Bell &AMP; Howell
windup and old Ektachrome film. I didn't want there to be an
overlord point of view. I didn't want an Eisenhower or a Montgomery
angsting and suffering at the outcome of the Omaha Beach landing.
My dad's been after me for many many years to tell his story, not
as a war bond drive, but as something that really happened to him.
... My approach was improvisational. I wanted to take that beach a
few feet at a time, just as the Rangers did. It took me four weeks
to move 24 feet up that beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, who plays the squad's reluctant father figure, says
his misgivings about making his first film with longtime friend
Spielberg dissolved in the rapidity and confidence with which the
director worked. Says Hanks, interviewed separately, ``I thought
Steven the auteur would be the guy who dictated every tiny little
aspect. But he was incredibly improvisational when it came to where
he put the camera. One day, the set literally was pointed the wrong
way. Now, he had told me the way he was going to shoot this scene
with a machine-gun emplacement a year ago. So he took a walk and
came back and said, `OK, we're going to shoot the scene this way.'
And so an action set piece became this thing about how hellacious
it is for these guys to run up the hill and you don't know what's
going on. It looked very clumsy, but it also looked very real and
chaotic. It's much less flashy and much more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-star Damon was struck by Spielberg's openness to input from
others, and by his patience. ``Many of the younger cast members
were either filmmakers or writers,'' Damon says, ``and it was like
going to the best film school in the world. ... You can say
something like, `I saw you raise the camera 2 feet there. Why did
you do that?' And he would say, `Well, I'm trying to get
perspective,' and he would just start to lecture on how and why he
did this _ and that's worth 10 years of school, especially on this
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The give-and-take worked both ways, Spielberg insists. The first
meeting between Hanks and Damon played stiffly as it was written.
So Damon improvised a better scene and it was written into the
script.

`PRIVATE RYAN' IS SERIOUS BUSINESS FOR MATT DAMON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By G. ALLEN JOHNSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's fitting that Matt Damon's latest role is as
a grunt in the new Steven Spielberg movie, ``Saving Private Ryan,''
because tearing into the basics is what this young actor does best.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the 20-something stars crowding Web sites and the
cover of Tiger Beat, Damon, at 27, has already been in the business
10 years. His first movie was a one-line cameo in 1988's ``Mystic
Pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly Spielberg chose him for the title role in his intense
World War II drama because of that seriousness. In the film,
co-star Tom Hanks leads a mission to bring back Private Ryan after
his three brothers are killed in action. The U.S. government
doesn't want Ryan's mother to lose all her sons.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks saw the professionalism in Damon before the shooting even
started: ``A lot of young actors try to get by on some sort of
attitude. You know, they have a kind of quasi-slacker mentality
that doesn't have anything to do necessarily with preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt is smart enough and has had enough experience to know
that ... you must come in with a prepared brand of characterization
that he's obviously very facile with.''
</P>
<P>
   On this mid-July afternoon, Damon is pacing a suite in San
Francisco's Ritz-Carlton Hotel, smoking a cigarette. ``I picked up
smoking again,'' the casually dressed Damon says sheepishly. ``I
was losing weight for a movie and can't stay on a diet, so I smoke.
Want one?''
</P>
<P>
   He looks much different from the thick, tough Private Ryan up
there on the screen. He's deep into _ what else? _ preparation for
his next role, which has meant losing 15 pounds. He'll play a
sociopath in Anthony (``English Patient'') Minghella's upcoming
film, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' a role for which he is also
taking Italian, piano and etiquette lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the living-the-role intensity of a practicing ``method''
actor? ``I don't have the natural talent to do it the way some
other people can do it,'' says Damon, who got much of his
enthusiasm for method acting from his hero, Robert Duvall, while
playing a bit part in Walter Hill's ``Geronimo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking for every advantage I can get ... you want
every possible angle covered. So I do a lot of research.''
</P>
<P>
   Past research has included losing so much weight (40 pounds) to
play a drug-addicted Gulf War veteran in ``Courage Under Fire''
that he developed internal problems that required medication, and
hanging out in Knoxville, Tenn., tending bar and going to high
school football games in order to play a Southern lawyer for
Francis Ford Coppola's ``The Rainmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed for Damon since filming ``Saving Private
Ryan'' last year. He and his boyhood best friend, Ben Affleck, won
the Oscar for best screenplay for ``Good Will Hunting,'' an
independent movie set in their hometown of Boston, which they wrote
because they weren't getting enough work. During the filming,
co-star Robin Williams introduced him to Spielberg, who was in town
one day to shoot courthouse scenes for ``Amistad.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, ``Good Will Hunting'' and ``The Rainmaker'' have
become hits, and with the Oscar plus his public breakup with Minnie
Driver (his co-star in ``Good Will Hunting'') and subsequent
liaison with Winona Ryder, he has become a celebrity. And that has
changed things in a way Damon says is uncomfortable for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge personal shift for me,'' he begins. ``In my
family, being guarded was always a bad thing. If you're weren't
sharing what you were feeling, then something's wrong, and you had
to kind of get through that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I find myself being guarded because it's an occupational
necessity, I guess. And that's a bigger shift than it sounds like,
personally. I want to be open, and I want to live my life that way,
sharing things with people, but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon's natural openness very likely is the result of his
communal upbringing. His parents divorced when he was 2 years old,
and his mother _ a professor of child development _ raised him in a
household with five other families.
</P>
<P>
   Of his success, Damon says he hasn't had a lot of time to sit
back and let it all sink in. He's been keeping up a schedule so
hectic that two years ago he moved out of the New York apartment he
shared with Affleck, and he hasn't had his own place since.
</P>
<P>
   He has completed Kevin Smith's ``Dogma'' and John Dahl's
``Rounders,'' and will follow up ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' with
Billy Bob Thornton's ``All the Pretty Horses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since July of '96 I've been on the road, and I'm 15 months
away from being done with work,'' Damon says. ``But I'm trying to
make good movies. When you start doing things for other reasons,
then you're cooked. But if it's an honest attempt every time out to
make a good movie, then you can live with yourself even when it's
not.''

</P>
<P>
   During the grueling filming of ``Private Ryan,'' Damon demanded
he be included in the intense boot camp Spielberg had arranged for
Hanks and the other actors in the company. But Spielberg said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of balked at that at first,'' Damon says. ``Normally I
do a lot of research. And then I realized why, and it was a really
smart move on Spielberg's part. Because since the movie was about
these eight guys, you know, this tight-knit unit, that's looking
for one guy and resenting the fact they're all risking their lives
... they started to forge these friendships and that camaraderie,
and then it started to foster that resentment toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because they're sleeping face down in the mud with full
knowledge that I'm home warm in a bed. Then I show up and go, `Hey
guys, how was boot camp?'''

FILM FESTIVAL SPOTLIGHTS CLASS DIVIDE IN ISRAEL

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ SCENE: A full moon rises over the walls of the Old
City as a crowd gathers in an ancient outdoor amphitheater here for
the opening of the 15th annual Jerusalem Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ACTION: Mayor Ehud Olmert enters stage left, an ally of Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and an ultra-conservative villain to
the liberal Tel Aviv cultural elite in the audience. They boo
Olmert loudly.
</P>
<P>
   DIALOGUE: Assi Dayan, the filmmaker and handsome son of the
liberal icon Moshe Dayan, accepts an award, saying, ``Hey Olmert,
tell your friend'' Netanyahu ``to go straight to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   CUT TO: A cocktail party at the end of the festival's opening.
Olmert takes the microphone from the band. The Tel Aviv crowd looks
up to see what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are all a tiny minority. You can insult me, you can insult
the prime minister, but you will not disgrace this city,'' said
Olmert, fuming. ``You have nothing to do with this city.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Jerusalem Film Festival, where art and politics
are inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this 10-day festival of documentary and feature film,
which ends this week,
</P>
<P>
   only one documentary plumbed the depths of a division in Israel
that went beyond the predictable. It was a film titled, ``The
South: Alice Never Lived Here.''
</P>
<P>
   Set in the aging port city of Jaffa, the documentary traces
three generations of women of the ``Sephardim,'' Jewish immigrants
to Israel largely from Arab countries and the Balkans, Spain, and
Greece. The Sephardim, now about half of Israel's population,
formed a vast underclass in Israeli society often ignored by the
Ashkenazim, or European Jews. The Sephardim turned to the Likud
after feeling betrayed by Labor.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary was written and directed by Senyora Bar-David,
and beautifully filmed by her husband, the award-winning Israeli
filmmaker and cameraman David Benchetrit. The husband-and-wife team
are both Sephardim. They speak eloquently about the class and
social divisions in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The film takes you through Jaffa's Sephardic neighborhoods with
their faded, ruined architecture, which have become an extension of
the poorer south of Tel Aviv. They stand in stark contrast to
wealthier North Tel Aviv where the Ashkenazi Jews live. In the
film, we learn that the Ashkenazi Jews often call the Sephardim
``blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I returned to Jaffa and from there I went on a journey,
somewhat like the journey of Alice in Wonderland,'' said Bar-David,
who grew up in Jaffa. ``I went back to my family roots with the
stories of my 89-year-old grandmother, Ida, and looked for the
future with Elinor, 15, who is also from Jaffa.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dramatic illustrations of the deep class issues
occurs in a North Tel Aviv high school where Elinor has been sent
to help ``integrate'' the classrooms. A preppy Ashkenazi teacher
stands before a class, saying, ``Kids from South Tel Aviv don't
have the same ambitions to succeed, or the capacity. It comes from
the home.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rancor at the opening of the film festival bothered the
couple. As Benchetrit said, ``When Dayan made that comment it was
like the last cry of the spoiled bourgeois elite in Israel, those
Ashkenazis who had everything all their lives. We hope our film
will open up the view of Israel's left and right, and show a much
deeper social and class division that lies beneath them.''

AN ARGUMENT FOR THE HAND AS THE DEFINER OF WHO WE ARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID MEHEGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE HAND 
How Its Use Shapes the Brain, Language, and Human Culture 
By Frank R. Wilson. Pantheon. 397 pp. Illustrated. $30. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our hands. So close to us. So familiar. As we scratch our ears,
point to the dessert we want, or gnaw our nails, they do not seem
remarkable. But it is the thesis of neurologist Frank Wilson's
provocative book that our hands, besides being useful organs,
contain much of the secret of human intelligence and achievement.
</P>
<P>
   By any standard, the human hand is an astonishing adaptation,
far beyond that of our primate ancestors. We are all familiar with
the uniqueness of the opposable thumb, but this is only the start
of the hand's distinctions. The rotational mobility of all the
digits, including the thumb, confers a vast array of possible
clasping combinations. That array, directed by a complex system of
muscles, allows us to hold an egg between fingertips, grip a
screwdriver or a ball, manipulate piano keys or playing cards at
blinding speed, and express subtle nuances of languages.
</P>
<P>
   The range of power and delicacy in the hand is astonishing.
Wilson points out that the ``force needed to depress a piano key
far enough to produce sound is less than three ounces,'' whereas
the force in a rock climber's three-fingered grip might rise to
something like 80 pounds per square inch. The hand can throw a rock
or a spear, grip and control a sledgehammer, detect minute textures
on a surface, as well as create graceful contours in a piece of wet
clay.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson includes an extensive survey of the hypotheses from
natural selection for the rise of the hand, but as with many such
surveys, the mysteries remain. One cannot fully explain the
extraordinary capabilities of the human hand, any more than those
of the human brain, simply by reasoning backward from its utility.
Far more interesting than exactly how it arose and why is what it
means to the species _ and the individual.
</P>
<P>
   The physical marvels of the hand would alone make for an
interesting book, but these marvels represent only the beginning of
Wilson's project. As the director of the Peter F. Ostwald Health
Program for Performing Artists at the University of California
School of Medicine, he specializes in treating disabilities in the
hands of musicians. In studying their problems, he became
fascinated by the emotional identity of the artistic hand. A
milestone in his understanding came, he writes, when he gave a
presentation to a group of musicians about a malady called
musician's cramp. When he showed a video of players who had lost
their abilities, a guitarist in the audience fainted. This happened
in several successive presentations. It was apparent that for the
musician, especially the instrumentalist, the hand is more than
just a tool, like a bow or a horn. Her entire identity and nature
as an artist is in the hands.
</P>
<P>
   With only slightly less intensity, this applies as well to other
high achievers. ``I learned, one person at a time,'' he writes,
``as I conducted interviews with nonmusicians for this book _ when
personal desire prompts anyone to learn to do something well with
the hands, an extremely complicated process is initiated that
endows the work with a powerful emotional charge. People are
changed, significantly and irreversibly it seems, when movement,
thought, and feeling fuse during the active, long-term pursuit of
personal goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the scientific analysis in the book makes for heavy
going, and requires slow and careful reading with attention to
endnotes. But Wilson is a fine, clear writer, with the same
combination of wit, plain speaking, and erudition as MIT's Steven
Pinker. He is clearly an able, sensitive interviewer, and the case
studies he includes, with extensive direct quotation, are
absorbing. They include a German marionette master, a juggler, a
rock climber, a surgeon, a jewelry maker, a guitarist, a movement
therapist, and a rebuilder of hot-rod engines. Each has a different
story, but what all have in common is an advance in personal
development _ you might say an evolutionary advance _ by means of
the hands.
</P>
<P>
   Among other mysteries Wilson explores is that of ``handedness.''
No one knows why human beings should not all be ambidextrous, but
it appears that even though one hand usually dominates, both hands
work in concert in most tasks, with the dominant hand working in a
sort of context set by the other. In stone tool making, for
instances, one hand firmly holds the object while the other carries
out ``praxis,'' or fine-skilled operation.
</P>
<P>
   He lays great emphasis on the work of British psychobiologist
Henry Plotkin's theory of ``secondary heuristics.'' A heuristic, in
Plotkin's conception, is ``that which leads to discovery and
invention.'' Primary heuristics would be adaptions that apply to a
whole species, like birds' wings. Secondary heuristics, as
interpreted by Wilson, are ``novel behaviors or adaptive strategies
invented to meet unpredictable demands presented by the particular
environment encountered by each individual.'' It is here where Homo
sapiens leaves other species in the dust, and the hands usually
make it possible.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is a professor, and much of the book is taken up with
analysis of his ideas of intelligence-in-the-hands as it applies to
education. Most of the masters he interviews _ the juggler, the
rock climber, the jeweler _ had to persist in their arts against
the opposition of their formal schooling. He writes, ``High levels
of achievement in purely `physical' skills ... follow the same
developmental course observed among highly successful
mathematicians, sculptors, and research scientists. The clear
message from biology to educators is this: The most effective
techniques for cultivating intelligence aim at uniting (not
divorcing) mind and body.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson makes a complicated argument. Fundamentally, though, he
is maintaining that however it arose, the hand had the power to
confer such gifts on Homo sapiens that it came to contain our
potential within itself; human intelligence and identity are in the
hands as well as in the mind. He writes, ``Work that demands
skilled use of the hands affords people ... the means to put `a
personal stamp on some aspect of the surround.''' His survey of
research, he writes, ``pointed specifically to the evolution of the
hand and its control mechanisms as prime movers in the organization
of human cognitive architecture and operations.''
</P>
<P>
   It all gives one a greater respect and sense of awe for the
organs we use to manage our worlds, and indeed to make new worlds.
We can't use our feet, ears, noses, or even eyes in quite the same
way _ though perhaps dancers and skiers would disagree. Wilson
quotes the Canadian novelist Robertson Davies, who said it as well
as it could be said: ``The hand speaks to the brain as surely as
the brain speaks to the hand.''

   WRITERS-WORKSHOP (Fort Worden State Park, Wash.) The beach
beckons, with the sun glistening off the crescent of sand that
kisses Admiralty Inlet, the saltwater beyond alternating between
azure and aquamarine and the imposing snow-capped cone of Mount
Baker standing sentinel on the horizon. Summer in the Northwest is
seldom more dazzling than this. But the largest concentration of
people in this blessed place on the edge of Port Townsend, Wash.,
is not on the beach soaking up sunshine or snatching up seashells.
They are sitting in the cool darkness of the old Joseph F. Wheeler
Theater, where a solitary figure, sometimes a man, sometimes a
woman, stands at a simple lectern on stage and talks about the
delights and frights and disciplines of the imagined word.

   TV-POV (Seattle) Dr. Maren Monsen had been working in the
emergency room just a few weeks when she first had to pronounce
someone dead. The training manual instructed her to check the
patient's breathing and pulse, but it was silent on matters of her
own heart.``It was the first time I had ever been alone in a room
with someone who was dead,'' she later reflected. ``In emergency
medicine we're taught to intervene and be in control. . .. For
doctors, death means failure.'' In time, the young
physician/filmmaker, who hails from Seattle, came to question the
assumption that life must be sustained at all cost. After seeing
patients linger in high-tech misery, she began to wonder: At what
point does life become a fate worse than death? Monsen takes
viewers along on a personal odyssey in her film, ``The Vanishing
Line,'' airing on PBS. The hour-long film is part of public
television's annual summer P.O.V. series, an award-winning showcase
for independent nonfiction films with a distinct point of view.

PERIPATETIC CLINTON PUTS HIS PRESIDENCY ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ But for a little time spent at home this month in
Little Rock, Ark., President Clinton is hobnobbing with a wealthy
crowd this summer.
</P>
<P>
   There's Aspen for a retreat this week with supporters who have
given more than $50,000 each to the Democratic Party this year.
There's the Hamptons for a fund-raiser at the home of Alec Baldwin
and Kim Basinger, not to mention a two-week vacation next month on
Martha's Vineyard, where he will hang out with the likes of Carly
Simon.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the party with Sylvester Stallone at a fund-raiser
in Miami in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who once criticized President Bush for his
globe-trotting ways, can barely stay in Washington himself. And
some of the celebrity company he keeps would put some of Bush's
rich friends to shame.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's absences partly reflect his four trips abroad this
year, as well as his desire to escape the scandals of the nation's
capital. But his coming travels are also meant to help the
Democrats stay competitive with the Republicans in the financial
wars of this fall's congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very committed to helping elect Democrats in November to
the Congress, so these trips are pursuant to that,'' said White
House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   With the Democratic Party trailing the Republicans in campaign
contributions, Clinton is pulling out the stops to help his party's
candidates. On Friday, he embarked on a three-week blitz of
three-day weekends blending policy with fund-raising around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and cynics say Clinton is just trying to get away from
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's investigation of his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, a former White House intern,
as well as assorted inquiries into 1996 campaign fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters argue that the president is merely a perpetual
campaigner who enjoys pressing the flesh, and that he is committed
to helping Democrats prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the reason, President Clinton has chosen to become a
bystander to the hard work of advancing the nation's business,''
Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, said this month in
criticizing Clinton's frenetic travel schedule after Democrats
accused the Republican majority of operating a ``do-nothing''
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``His highly publicized executive orders, foreign visits and
frequent Rose Garden ceremonies may be good media publicity,'' Lott
said, ``but they aren't good leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with his international travels, which are expected to
take him to six continents before the year is finished, Clinton
will have spent 39 percent of his time outside Washington in the
first seven months of this year, compared with 25 percent for Bush
for the first seven months of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the last time there was a midterm election in which the
presidency and Congress were controlled by different parties, Bush
made 56 domestic stops in the first seven months of the year.
Clinton has made 37 from January to July of this year.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush went only to Canada and Bermuda during the first
seven months of 1990, Clinton has gone to Africa, Latin America,
Europe, and China so far this year. Reflecting the penchant of
second-term presidents to spend time overseas, he also has trips
planned this year to Russia, India, Pakistan, and Malaysia, and
possibly Bangladesh and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   As a presidential candidate in 1992, Clinton criticized Bush's
foreign travel. ``It's time for us to have a president who cares
more about Littleton, N.H., than Liechtenstein, more about
Manchester than Micronesia,'' he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from his itinerary, Clinton seems to care about both.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving Friday in Little Rock, Clinton said, ``I'm glad to be
back.''
</P>
<P>
   There, he attended a series of Democratic fund-raisers, spent
time playing golf and visiting family and friends. Sunday he went
to New Orleans for a $10,000-a-person dinner for the Democratic
Business Council and a fund-raiser for Representative William
Jefferson. Clinton was also scheduled to deliver an address Monday
to the 75th convention of the American Federation of Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after paying a brief visit to Norfolk, Va., on Saturday
for the dedication of the USS Truman aircraft carrier, he will make
his two-day visit to Aspen, Colo. On July 27, he will head to
Albuquerque, N.M., for more fund-raising and a forum on Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's a three-day weekend in East Hampton, N.Y., for a
``summer lawn party'' thrown by Baldwin and Basinger, plus
fund-raising for individual Democratic candidates. Together, the
Aspen and Hampton weekends are expected to take in well over $2
million, officials of the Democratic National Committee said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first six months of this year, Clinton has either
directly or indirectly helped the party raise nearly $25 million
and trim its debt to $6.9 million, not counting the $3.6 million in
cash on hand.
</P>
<P>
   He'll interrupt his traveling-for-dollars campaign for a
Martha's Vineyard vacation from Aug. 15 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Grossman, Democratic National Committee chairman and a
native of Massachusetts, said there is no reason for the average
voter to be concerned about Clinton spending so much time raising
money from the well-heeled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it sends the wrong message. The president is
seen as working every single day for the American people,''
Grossman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get much campaign funds out of people who are not
heeled,'' said presidential scholar Stephen Hess of the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said that since overzealous Democratic fund-raising to help
Clinton's reelection in 1996 triggered the campaign-finance
investigations that caused the party to run up $16 million in legal
bills and return some large, questionable contributions, Clinton
not only has a political obligation to help his party but also ``a
moral obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hess: ``He left the party in pretty bad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has made no secret of his distaste for
Washington's politics, Toiv, his spokesman, said the president was
not traveling ``for its own sake.'' Most of the foreign trips were
planned before Clinton's most pronounced problem _ the Lewinsky
investigation _ broke Jan. 21. ``He does very much enjoy, thrive
on, getting out and meeting the American people,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is likely to only intensify as the election gets
closer.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said Clinton will attend a dozen fund-raisers in
Washington and five or six other cities as part of a DNC campaign
called Unity '98. Those events will take place in the six weeks
preceding the Nov. 3 election, and include a mid-September
fund-raiser in Boston. Taken together, they are expected to raise
about $18 million for the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president himself will be attending every event as a
single statement of how important it is that this party be
competitive,'' Grossman said. ``The Republicans are trying to run
out the clock and go home and buy the election,'' he said. Clinton,
``as our principal asset, is going to spend a certain amount of
time guaranteeing'' that does not happen.

STATES URGED TO USE NAMES IN HIV REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ High-ranking officials of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, in what AIDS activists angrily call a
``traveling road show,'' are crisscrossing the country lobbying
state health officials to report the names of people who test
positive for the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS advocates and state health officials say the CDC has made
clear its preference for a national database to track the spread of
the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, by using names rather
than codes, though federal health officials say they have not yet
reached a decision on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, AIDS advocates have likened names-reporting to a
scarlet letter for people with the virus and say the practice would
discourage testing and possibly contribute to the epidemic. CDC
officials, however, have warned against &UR;  &LR; inflammatory statements
and fearmongering over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, the Clinton administration has been pushed
and pulled by these factions over whether to rely on names or codes
to track HIV. But by the time the administration decides on one of
the most important public health issues facing the nation, most
states may already have set their policies, say AIDS advocates,
state officials, and civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 states require the reporting of names, while about a
half-dozen, including Massachusetts, are developing code systems.
The remaining states, including those with the highest
concentration of AIDS cases, are undecided, and some states with
existing policies are reconsidering them.
</P>
<P>
   States must weigh the claims of epidemiologists, who insist
names are the best way to capture the information necessary to
monitor and prevent the spread of the virus, against people on the
front lines of the AIDS fight who say codes can be used to meet
these goals. Unlike using names, codes do not sacrifice privacy or
scare people away from being tested for the virus, AIDS advocates
say.
</P>
<P>
   While federal policy is in limbo, an implicit endorsement of
names-reporting by the CDC _ as well as the agency's refusal to pay
for states to develop alternatives to name-based reporting _ could
tip the scales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the CDC backing the (administration) into a position it has
never committed to?'' asked Christopher Anders, legislative counsel
at the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have restrained our discussion to the technical aspects of
how we gather quality data, the attributes of good surveillance
activities, the uses of data, in the absence of a formal
publication'' of a policy, said Kevin M. De Cock, director of the
CDC's HIV/AIDS prevention division.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Thurman, director of the White House Office of National
AIDS Policy, said it is essential for federal and state agencies to
proceed with caution, given that the administration has not decided
on its policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just counting heads, we're trying to save lives, and
we don't want to do anything to discourage testing,'' Thurman said.
``This epidemic can't be looked at in a vacuum. It is unlike
anything we've dealt with heretofore.''
</P>
<P>
   The push to expand HIV surveillance _ tracking how and where the
virus strikes _ began in 1996. For the first time, the number of
AIDS cases _ and deaths _ dropped, while the incidence of HIV
increased, particularly among the poor, women, and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   According to people who attended community forums across the
nation, the CDC has made it clear that names-reporting is
essential, though states should maintain the option of offering
anonymous tests. The presentations have been described by state
health officials and AIDS advocates as ``proselytizing visits,''
sending the message that ``states should do names or else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we haven't given the impression of inflexibility,''
said De Cock. There may be alternatives to names-reporting, but he
said the CDC has found scant evidence that special codes that
contain personal information about an individual without revealing
one's identity are effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tracking system must respond quickly to the disease, be
accurate, and capture as many cases as possible, while eliminating
duplicates so the same people aren't reported twice,'' he said.
``Evidence at the present time suggests that these diverse
functions would be more effective and easily conducted with a
name-based system.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has always relied on names-reporting for diseases such
as syphilis and tuberculosis. Reporting HIV this way would allow
the CDC to link HIV cases with other databases if there were an
outbreak of an HIV-related illness, and make it easier to go back
to health care providers for crucial information, such as how the
virus was contracted, according to De Cock.
</P>
<P>
   Names-reporting also would be a cheaper and more effective
system to implement because a blueprint for how to capture complete
and accurate information already exists, he said.
</P>
<P>
   CDC studies of the code-based tracking systems in Texas and
Maryland found them to be flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, if we're going to do surveillance, we
must ensure data of high quality,'' De Cock said. ``If not, we must
reconsider doing it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, however, rejects that evaluation because the CDC study
was completed before wrinkles in the system were ironed out,
explained Liza Solomon, director of that state's AIDS
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said the state now boasts completed data on 89 percent
of the HIV cases reported, which is on par with a name-based system
and ``has allowed us to see the trends in the epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is developing a system using ``unique identifier''
codes. After studying the systems of two states, advisory groups
concluded that these codes were just as effective as names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both states were able to profile changes going on in the
epidemic,'' said Jean McGuire, director of the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health's AIDS bureau. ``It is quite possible
to get the information needed to profile the disease without using
names. ... The concern that names-based reporting would discourage
testing was very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the stigma and discrimination associated with AIDS,
there is deep concern among health care providers like McGuire that
some people may delay or avoid being tested if they believe their
name would end up on a government list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that if people see their names being
collected for no apparent reason, their worst fears will be
fueled,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director of AIDS Action,
representing a network of 2,400 AIDS service providers. ``Some of
the people we need to reach most urgently, people of color, the
poor, immigrants, the disenfranchised, have little faith in
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of names-testing say several studies illustrate this
point. They also say they fear breaches of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC has its own study showing that only a tiny minority of
people would delay testing because they fear names-reporting. De
Cock conceded that the issue is not resolved, but said the bottom
line is clear: The government has a long track record protecting
the confidentiality of sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly understand concerns about confidentiality,'' said
De Cock. ``Terrible things could happen someplace, somewhere, but
experience says this hasn't happened so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Some dismiss the issue entirely, saying fears are baseless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a risk in continuing to advise people that
there is an extraordinary danger associated with testing for HIV,''
said Michael T. Isbell, a member of the President's Advisory Board
on HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   For Anna Forbes, a longtime AIDS care provider and policy
analyst, the debate about confidentiality misses the point
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we can do something medically about the AIDS virus,
it seems very irresponsible to put anything at all in the way of
being tested.''

LITERARY BOOT CAMP FOR WRITERS TO HONE THIER SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORDEN STATE PARK, Wash. _ The beach beckons, with the sun
glistening off the crescent of sand that kisses Admiralty Inlet,
the saltwater beyond alternating between azure and aquamarine and
the imposing snow-capped cone of Mount Baker standing sentinel on
the horizon. Summer in the Northwest is seldom more dazzling than
this.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest concentration of people in this blessed place on
the edge of Port Townsend is not on the beach soaking up sunshine
or snatching up seashells. They are sitting in the cool darkness of
the old Joseph F. Wheeler Theater, where a solitary figure,
sometimes a man, sometimes a woman, stands at a simple lectern on
stage and talks about the delights and frights and disciplines of
the imagined word.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Port Townsend Writers' Conference, 25th anniversary
edition, where 140 people from Key West to Hawaii gather for 10
summer days and nights devoted to the intensive study of writing.
This is more intellectual boot camp than lazy days summer camp. The
intent and earnest attendees endure stark barracks quarters and
dreary mess-hall food that strongly recall the distant past of this
turn-of-the-century artillery post.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the writing life is not supposed to be some loll in a
hammock, so this conference's rigors may be a most appropriate
reflection of the devotions required in pursuit of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to be too easy,'' admits Jan Wesley, whose
tousled blond looks, weathered leather jacket, blue jeans and host
of silver bracelets bespeak her Los Angeles home and her work in
the film industry. ``I wanted a kick in the ass here, both in terms
of inspiration and to jump-start my own writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley is a typical Port Townsend attendee. She is a woman in
her late 40s _ more than three quarters of the students here are
women, year in and year out, and most seem to be in their 40s.
Wesley has been willing to leave normal life and its obligations
behind in the hope that 10 days away and an investment of nearly
$1,000 will somehow provide what she needs to finally spark
progress toward her long-simmering dream of becoming a serious
writer.
</P>
<P>
   So Wesley sits in a morning class in the old post schoolhouse
and dutifully records the sage but witty advice of poet Marvin
Bell, who has written 13 well-praised books. Bell is a writers'
conference veteran whose graying bearded presence recalls the late
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. He is enumerating a baker's
dozen tips on being a successful writer but is also injecting so
many puckish asides that what he says delights almost as much as it
instructs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things matter _ if you want to write about eternity,
don't write about eternity; write about your cup of coffee,'' Bell
advises. ``It's poetry, it's only poetry _ you have to have both
attitudes. Poetry comes out of life, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is one of 11 faculty members at this summer's conference
(which ended July 19), put on by Centrum, the small but ambitious
non-profit arts organization headquartered at the fort.
</P>
<P>
   These 11 faculty members are writers of stature with books and
fellowships, prizes and professorships to their credit, which is
why the faculty has long been one of Port Townsend's big draws. The
list of writers who have taught here in the past reads like a
literary honor roll, including such notables as Raymond Carver,
Margaret Atwood, Kenneth Rexroth, Alice Walker, Carolyn Kizer, Tom
Robbins and Tobias Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ransom did not have such grand dreams a quarter century
ago, when Fort Worden was becoming a state park and conference
center after doing duty as a treatment center for juveniles. What
Ransom and two compatriots (Joe Wheeler, Donn Trethewey) were
trying to do then was find something that could use some of the
fort's facilities but not require the purchase of much additional
equipment, something preferably in the arts that might snare some
grant money.
</P>
<P>
   A dance festival and a writer's conference were what they came
up with, with the writer's conference closely modeled on what
Ransom had observed when he worked as a waiter two years before at
the Breadloaf Writers' Conference in Vermont. There was only a
handful of such conferences at the time. Port Townsend's later
emergence as one of this country's leading writing conferences,
amid what is now a glut, probably owes more to its early founding
than to its decidedly modest beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom, who served as the conference's director in its fledgling
years, has returned this summer as an instructor, part of a faculty
alumni contingent brought back for the anniversary by current
director Sam Hamill. Ransom has gone on to publish novels and
collections of poems, while also working as a teacher (now at The
Evergreen State College), just as many other writers must do to put
something in the checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom remains a firm believer in the value of writing
conferences: ``One of the big boosts that comes from these
conferences is from seeing that ordinary people do this _ they
demystify writing. And I also believe that if you give me students
here for six hours a day for two weeks, I can give them what I can
teach in a quarter at school. Conferences are superb, especially
for busy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Their time at Port Townsend is busy as well. The crowded daily
schedule quickly becomes implanted in attendees' brains: 8 a.m.
breakfast; 9 a.m. lecture by an instructor; 10:30 a.m. class for
two hours; 12:30 lunch; early afternoon conferences with
instructors; 3 p.m. lecture by an instructor; 6 p.m. dinner; 7:30
p.m. reading by an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of exhilaration and exhaustion flows through both
students and instructors, what with all the events and classes to
attend, the writing to complete or critically assess, the stories
to share in free moments at this sudden gathering of strangers with
like devotions.
</P>
<P>
   As Jane Hirshfield, a 45-year-old poet and instructor from Mill
Valley, Calif., puts it: ``To be in a community of people of shared
passions is a tremendous gift. It is exciting to be able to step
out of our own rooms once a year and find yourself among people who
get as excited about semicolons as you do. A lot of writers can go
all year on the energy that comes from that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that does not come easy. The central moment for many
students at the conference is submitting one's own writing for
critique by 15 or so fellow students and the instructor. This is
private and often intensely personal work suddenly turned naked
public entity, a time for flushed faces and churning stomachs or
worse. Tears are sometimes seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings you up against all your self-doubts and your
impossible standards and you have to confront those, day after
day,'' says Robyn Johnson of Stanwood, an aspiring poet whose
regular life revolves around the financial concerns of directing
the Everett Parks Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come here wanting to perform,'' observes Bruce
Elkin of Saltspring Island, B.C., who is attending for the second
time. ``But when they're criticized, they don't know how to take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouragement can be profound. Elkin's previous instructor at
Port Townsend three years ago implied he ``should go into law
enforcement instead of writing,'' advice that the 55-year-old
consultant ultimately discarded, but not without much
soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, fellow students and instructors try to be
encouraging, especially since rejection is such a frequent
companion in the writer's trade. So constructive criticism usually
abounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling how many hours of hard writing may be
spawned when instructor Annick Smith of Missoula advises one
student, ``This is a powerful, promising start; this has all the
things to make you go on.'' Or when instructor William Kittredge _
who is team-teaching the non-fiction class with Smith, his longtime
partner _ advises another student, ``This gets at some deep-seated
and difficult stuff and I admire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such encouraging words answer a deep craving for aspiring and
beginning writers, which is why many keep coming back to Port
Townsend. Fifteen percent of this year's attendees have been here
before, including Karen Seashore from Sandpoint, Idaho, a
51-year-old former teacher who has left her husband and two teens
at home to attend Port Townsend for the seventh straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place to study like this in my town,'' Seashore
says. ``And I find what I want here _ the faculty is approachable
and I have 10 days without phones or family, amid the fellowship of
writers and the beauty of this place, the bluff, the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The considerable charms of Port Townsend and its Olympic
Peninsula surroundings do add to the allure of the writer's
conference. This town of 8,275 people manages to be arty but not
artificial, a working community with a paper mill and handsome
Victorian buildings in various states of renovation, an enviable
place that seems to be just isolated enough to avoid turning all
cutesy-touristy.
</P>
<P>
   Port Townsend, despite much growth and grumbling, is still not
Aspen or Carmel or La Jolla or even La Conner. But the city remains
well-known in the national arts community, in part because it is
home to Copper Canyon Press (also situated at the fort), which is
probably the country's pre-eminent publisher of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   But the writer's conference is only one of many nationally
recognized workshops and festivals put on by Centrum, a perennially
cash-strapped outfit that somehow manages to mount a non-stop
parade of events throughout the year, everything from classical
music to jazz to fiddle tunes to country blues, events that give
Port Townsend a rich cultural life that many cities 10 times its
size could envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centrum and Copper Canyon are both really well-known back
East,'' says Alison Swan, a 36-year-old editor and reviewer from
Saugatuck, Mich. ``And I think this conference has been fabulous. I
definitely feel recharged by being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the writer's conference are not without their
complaints. Many students wish there were more social activities
with the faculty, while the faculty members wish they had more time
when they were not buried under an avalanche of student papers to
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism, too, is sometimes voiced in private about Hamill, the
conference director, whose introductions of writers at the readings
and lectures are so brusque and insider-enigmatic that they border
on being rude. Some repeat attendees, both students and faculty,
say they yearn for the more civil days past when students
themselves introduced the writers, especially since all these
events are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill is widely respected for being co-founder and editor at
Copper Canyon Press, as well as a much-praised poet and translator
of Chinese literature. But his sandpaper personality does rub many
people the wrong way, especially when he turns stern camp counselor
on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 150 of us here and I have had reports of yelling
problems between some of you and parties at 2 a.m.,'' Hamill
lectures at one point. ``If you can't be kind, be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such moments are quickly forgotten, though, once the readings
begin and the magic of well-chosen words spills off the stage and
drifts out into the summer air.
</P>
<P>
   John Balaban, a 54-year-old poet from Miami, gives a stunning
reading to hushed silence and frequent bursts of applause. He reads
not only his own work, but also poems in Vietnamese and poems he
has translated from Vietnamese, including those from a decade of
work he has devoted to one obscure Vietnamese woman poet who lived
in the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is the central theme of Balaban's work _ he was a
conscientious objector during the Vietnam War who served in Vietnam
as a field representative for the Committee of Responsibility to
Save War-Injured Children. His humanity courses through his poems,
a strong current of caring, and the audience is hanging on his
every word as Balaban builds to the close of his poem, ``Words for
My Daughter'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know the worst and be free from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know the worst and still find good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, as you play nearby or laugh
</P>
<P>
   ``with the ladies at Peoples Bank as we go around town
</P>
<P>
   ``and I find myself beaming like a fool,
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect I am here less for your protection
</P>
<P>
   ``than you are here for mine, as if you were sent
</P>
<P>
   ``to call me back into our helpless tribe.''

THE HIDDEN COST OF BEING SINGLE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arise, you single people _ you divorcees, you
confirmed bachelors, and the otherwise unmarried! In the name of
family values, Congress is out to grab your wallet!
</P>
<P>
   As many people know by now, Congress this year seems intent on
addressing the ``marriage penalty,'' that quirk in the tax law that
forces some married couples to pay more in taxes than they would if
they remained single and earned the same income.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a man and a woman who each earn $37,500 a year
would pay a total of $11,000 in taxes if they were living together
without being married. If they married, the tax bill would jump
$1,400, to $12,500. Lawmakers, particularly Republicans, say this
penalty is unfair, and that it undermines marriage, that
fundamental American institution.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But if Congress is sincere in trying to make the
laws more equitable, it ought to look at the many ways in which
federal law also punishes single people, just because they are
single.
</P>
<P>
   A close examination would show that, in many cases, federal law
gives married couples a break while limiting a tax benefit for
singles, who may have greater needs. In other cases, Congress has
made it hard for singles who want to marry to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is a system of penalties and bonuses in federal
law that, for better or worse, hinges on one's marital status.
Fairness _ or at least equal treatment _ often gets lost in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT A: The Capital Gains Tax
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers handed homeowners a big gift last year by cutting
their exposure to capital gains taxes on the sale of a home. But in
a little-noticed move, Congress for the first time made marital
status a significant element of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   A married couple can earn $500,000 on the sale of their
principal residence without paying any capital gains tax, while a
single person starts to pay taxes after $250,000 in profits.
</P>
<P>
   But a single person can face a greater challenge in buying and
maintaining a home than a two-income couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``A house costs the same whether you are single or married,''
said Dorothy Langer, a management consultant who lives on Beacon
Hill, and who is not married. ``A roof costs what a roof costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If single people paid lower property taxes, there might be
something to talk about with this. But they pay the same real
estate taxes'' as married people. Applying marital status to the
capital gains tax ``is tremendously unfair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Roberts, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said
the law makes a certain amount of sense. Every person gets the same
$250,000 exemption from the tax. A married couple is merely
claiming $250,000 for each spouse.
</P>
<P>
   But the law can create tax problems for older people, whose
homes may have appreciated significantly over time. ``A married
couple owns a home and someone dies, and all of a sudden a person
is single and has lost the tax exemption for $250,000 on the sale
of a home,'' said David Certner, who follows tax issues for the
American Association of Retired Persons. ``That's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT B: Scholarship credits:
</P>
<P>
   Some singles also bristle at how Congress structured the ``Hope
Scholarship Credit'' last year, the much-touted measure that offers
up to $1,500 to people paying for the first two years of college.
</P>
<P>
   The credit helps anyone with up to $100,000 in annual income _
if they're married. Single people lose the benefit at $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   That means a $95,000-a-year lawyer can claim some of the credit,
if he or she is married to a stay-at-home spouse. At the same time,
a single mother working overtime to earn $51,000 gets nothing at
all.
</P>
<P>
   That single mom may well need the credit more than the lawyer,
said James Colliton, a former Internal Revenue Service attorney who
now teaches law at DePaul University in Chicago. ``If I'm a
divorced person trying to send a kid to college, I might not get
any help. But married people with much more income might get help
from the government,'' he said. ``It seems unfair to me.''
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT C: Social Security
</P>
<P>
   If Congress is sincere about correcting the marriage penalty in
the income tax, it might also revisit the rules regarding Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Income from Social Security is taxed at two thresholds. Once a
single person reports $25,000 in annual income, or $32,000 for
married people, taxes must be paid on half of the Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At the second threshhold threshold _ $34,000 for singles and
$44,000 for couples _ taxes must be paid on 85 percent of Social
Security income.
</P>
<P>
   That can create a big marriage penalty for older people who want
to marry, said Certner of the AARP. Two retirees earning $20,000 a
year who marry would move from paying no tax on Social Security
income to a tax on 85 percent of that income.
</P>
<P>
   These and other Social Security rules ``are contributing to
seniors living in sin, which is a growing phenomenon,'' said Edward
McCaffrey, a law professor at the University of Southern California
and author of the book ``Taxing Women.'' When McCaffrey makes radio
appearances, he said, seniors often call with complaints about this
facet of Social Security law.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau reports that unmarried seniors are in fact
living together more often. In the decade ending in 1996, the
number of unmarried seniors of the opposite sex living together
rose 165 percent, to include 105,000 households, compared with an
80 percent increase for the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT D: Marriage and the Earned Income Tax Credit
</P>
<P>
   Many low-income people could also benefit from Congress's new
interest in helping single people marry. Just as the income tax
confers a marriage penalty on some people, so does the Earned
Income Tax Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Someone earning the minimum wage, or about $10,700 a year, could
claim a refund of nearly $2,300 under the low-income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   But two people in the same situation who married would not claim
double that amount. Instead, they would get only about $1,830 _ a
marriage penalty of nearly $2,800, or a whopping 13 percent of
their combined salary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is probably impossible for Congress to remedy all
these marriage penalties and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   But these quirks in the law are worth noting, because they
underscore the fact that it is hard to write a tax law that takes
money from everyone equally, or a tax break that benefits all
groups equally.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress moves to fix the marriage penalty in the income tax,
single people should pay attention or they may lose out. Many of
the proposed solutions increase the disparity that exists among
some singles and some married people in tax law.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican
of Texas, guided a marriage penalty provision through the Senate as
an amendment to the tobacco bill. Gramm didn't end the penalty. He
merely gave a tax cut to all married couples who report up to
$50,000 annual income.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: an eye-popping $46 billion over 10 years. One-third of
the money was to come from a higher tax on tobacco. But the rest
would come from general revenues. And that would likely shift the
responsibility for paying for government more squarely on the
shoulders of single people.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gramm's bill would have helped married people who
don't pay a penalty _ and many of them do not. In fact, 52 percent
of married couples receive a marriage bonus _ that is, they pay
lower income taxes in marriage than they would if they had remained
single.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, in other words, would use the tax money paid by single
people (and others) to reduce the tax bill for couples who already
find a tax advantage in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In similar fashion, poor people who want to marry would get
little benefit from several of the other solutions to the marriage
penalty. Unless Congress writes a specific provision enhancing the
Earned Income Tax Credit, poor married people will be left out when
the lawmakers ease the burden on married couples, as will many of
the working poor who want to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to craft rules that don't have a marriage
penalty or bonus,'' said Iris Lav of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities. ``But if there is going to be marriage penalty
relief for higher-income people, you should have it for
lower-income people.''
</P>
<P>
   Colliton, the DePaul professor, said that ``married people are
getting treated better in the tax law, and single people haven't
awakened to that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is precedent for them to do so. In 1969, complaints
from singles _ who then paid higher taxes than married people with
similar incomes _ led to a signficant rewriting of the tax code.
``We could see a political backlash like that again,'' said
Colliton, ``as single people say, `Wait a minute. What about us?'''

SEARCHING FOR TRUTH IN THE PATRICIA SMITH CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACK THOMAS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ In the four weeks since Patricia Smith was asked to
resign after she was caught fabricating characters in her Metro
column, the staff of The Boston Globe has been engaged in
relentless soul-searching and has exhausted itself, and perhaps
some readers, too, in a public debate over the failure of the
newspaper in its mission to present the news frankly, fairly, and
especially without deceit.
</P>
<P>
   After Smith conceded in June that she had embroidered portions
of four columns, the editor, Matthew V. Storin, announced her
resignation and pledged that the newspaper would publish a critical
review of her work dating to January 1996, when evidence of
counterfeit quotations prompted Storin to tighten editing policies
for columnists. This is the report he promised.
</P>
<P>
   In an interim accounting June 30, Storin disclosed that, in
addition to the four columns to which Smith had confessed
fabrication, an examination of 196 columns written since January
1996 had turned up another 20 that contain names for which the
Globe can find no verification. At the same time, editors continue
to be suspicious of an additional 28 columns written in 1995. That
brings to 52 the number of columns by Smith with elements that
cannot be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Because the passage of time makes it difficult to authenticate
names, Storin invited Smith to assist in the effort to provide
readers with an honest accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through her attorney, John Williams of Palmer &AMP; Dodge,
Smith declined to identify which characters are real and which are
products of her imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was informed by Patricia Smith's attorney that she will not
cooperate with further reviews of her columns,'' said Storin. ``Her
attorney said he had advised her not to assist. He did not say
why.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspicious references range from a single character mentioned in
an otherwise factual column to columns composed entirely of
fictitious people. Without Smith's cooperation, however, it is
impossible to sift fact from fiction. In 20 suspect columns after
January 1996, researchers have been unable to authenticate 36
people. They may exist. They may not.
</P>
<P>
   The review of Smith's work was orchestrated by Louisa Williams,
managing editor/administration, who divided the columns among three
editors besides herself: Helen Donovan, executive editor; Gregory
L. Moore, managing editor; and Thomas F. Mulvoy Jr., managing
editor/news operations.
</P>
<P>
   Of 196 columns, 149 were validated at once because characters
were obviously genuine _ the principal of a school, for example, or
the head of a government agency. The remaining 47 were forwarded to
the Globe library, where researchers used such tools as telephone
records, newspaper articles and voter reigstration but were unable
to authenticate 20 columns.
</P>
<P>
   A reading of all 52 unverified columns reveals no pattern for
her deceit, no persistent political agenda, not even a clue as to
why she would make up characters and quotations other than the
possibility that she was lazy, intellectually indifferent, or, as
she said in her column of apology, because of her ambition to
achieve too much in too little time. One thing is certain: lacking
traditional newsroom training, she seemed unable to grasp the
discipline and standards that city editors drill into young
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   So skilled is Smith with words she was able to fall back on her
flair for colorful phraseology to disguise the fact that her
characters were not real. She enhanced their credibility by her
Dickensian appetite for detail: Tito Morris, or ``T-Money,'' for
example, is 18, smoking a Kool cigarette and talking about his
blackness. Is he real? Maybe. But maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, while it was skill with words that enabled her to
get away with her guile, in the end, it was skill with words that
exposed her, for she was unable to resist making up quotations so
lyrical that some colleagues became suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Although she wrote aggressively from the African-American
perspective, Smith cannot be accused of a pattern of fabricating
racist white characters. Among those undocumented, only two appear
racist: a white truck driver named Marty Finneran of South Boston,
who denounces affirmative action and what he refers to as coloreds
with no qualifications; and in a 1995 column that strains
credulity, Smith writes of a tourist, Frank Levit of Canton, Ohio,
who wears a Cleveland Indians hat and uses a red marker to draw
circles on a map of Boston to make sure he doesn't wander into
dangerous black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   What have we learned? Storin says he is drawing up tighter
guidelines about the use of anonymous sources and that he is making
an inventory of the Globe's process for checking facts to ensure
that even in routine stories, simple data such as names and
addresses are verified.
</P>
<P>
   For Smith, the bad news came on June 17 at a fateful lunch with
Moore at the Royal Sonesta in Cambridge. It was eight days before
her 43rd birthday, and as the Globe's Mark Jurkowitz recounted:
``After Smith sat down, she told Moore what her horoscope said that
morning: `Be careful in dealing with your boss today.
Misunderstandings could lead to the loss of a job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, was that true? Or had she made up another expedient
quotation? A call to the library reveals that while 52 of her
columns may contain fabrications, when it came to her horoscope,
Patricia Smith told the truth.

ELECTION YEAR MAY BE GOOD FOR HEALTH INSURANCE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who still doubt the need to overhaul the health
insurance system, consider the case of Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   She is a Massachusetts resident. She is 34 years old. She has
multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Because its symptoms can come without warning, Elizabeth needs
immediate care and easy access to a neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   She receives neither with her health maintenance organization.
Instead, she recently had to go though a monthlong tangle of
paperwork before she could see her neurologist. After she had
received three steroid treatments, her HMO reneged on an earlier
agreement to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth could not afford these expensive treatments. She made
dozens of phone calls with no results, until she finally reached
the president of the HMO to tell her story. The insurer finally
paid the bill. But her future is still uncertain. When symptoms
recur, as is likely, and she goes untreated for as long as she did
this last time, risk of neurological damage will be even higher.
</P>
<P>
   If health insurance was overhauled on the state as well as the
national level, Elizabeth would not have had to do battle with her
own HMO to simply get the services she was paying for _ and
required.
</P>
<P>
   There are two key bills, one in Congress and the other in the
Massachusetts Legislature, that would provide much of the needed
change in payment for health care. And what happens with these
bills, particularly the one before Congress, may determine the
political health of the Democrats and the Republicans after the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that some Republicans support the bill. But most of
the backing comes from Democrats. By being on the right side of the
tobacco bill, which the public wanted and the GOP killed, and the
Democratic-lead health insurance bill, which the public wants but
the GOP leadership is also trying to kill, Democrats are likely to
increase their shot at regaining control of the US House, and
maintaining at least the status quo in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   After all, a single issue can turn around an election _ just as
the economy has determined the fate of many a congressional
election.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, there is the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation
sponsored by Democratic Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts
and Tom Daschle, the minority leader, of South Dakota; and
Representatives John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, Greg Ganske, an
Iowa Republican. The proposed bill essentially guarantees consumers
basic rights _ such as having the doctors, not insurance companies,
making treatment decisions; giving patients the right to see
specialists when needed; the right to emergency room care when
needed; the right to appeal health care decisions; and the right to
sue HMOs or managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is strong congressional support for the measure,
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and fellow Republican Representative
Dennis Hastert of Illinois introduced ``patient protection''
legislation which, some Democrats argue, does more to protect the
HMOs than the patients. Other Democrats argue that the GOP bill,
whatever form it takes, is an 11th-hour attempt to latch on to an
issue that is resonating with the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   To counter the GOP's counteroffensive on the Democratic-led
overhaul attempt, the national AFL-CIO last week launched a
nationwide campaign, including radio and televison ads, to push the
Democrats' legislation and to expose the GOP's thinly veiled
efforts to deep-six true change.
</P>
<P>
   As AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said last week about the
Gingrich-backed bill, ``Instead of giving America's working
families a bill of health care rights, the Republican leadership is
attempting to sell us a bill of goods.'' Not one to mince words,
Sweeney said further, ``It is time for Speaker Gingrich to get out
of the pocket of the health insurance industry and give America's
families what they want and need; quality health care and real
protection from greedy HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Massachusetts front, reform advocates are working to save
a bill that has been dormant in a State House committee for more
than a year. The Ominbus Managed Care Bill includes a dozen
consumer protections, such as disclosure of treatment options for
patients, independent external appeals, referral to out-of-network
providers, general standards for emergency room serviuce, and a
prohibition on physician financial incentives.
</P>
<P>
   A report released last week by the Families USA Foundation noted
that while Massachusetts ranks second in terms of HMO penetration _
with 52 percent of the state's residents enrolled in an HMO _ it
has only one of the 13 patient protections: a law that prohibits
health plans from penalizing providers for discussing all possible
treatment options with patients. Some 46 states offer that
protection.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, even some HMO executives would prefer to see some
version of reform bill passed now rather than see the issue become
a hot topic in this fall's legislative election. They know things
could get a lot worse for HMOs if some of their friends in the
legislature are defeated because of the bill's delay.
</P>
<P>
   But time is running out for this bill, which has been in Ways
and Means since June 1997. The legislature is expected to recess
before the end of this month. Most health care reformers in
Massachusetts point to House Speaker Thomas Finneran as the reason
for the delays. After much pressure from health care reformists, a
vote to reactive the bill may come up next week. When it comes to
health care reform, better late than never.
</P>
<P>
   As for reform's critics, especially GOP members of Congress, it
may already be too late _ for their political survival.

THE DOLE-CELLUCCI DISCONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Paul Cellucci, Massachusetts' acting governor, wants to raise
the minimum wage. So far, he's got nothing to show for his efforts.
Two years ago, Bob Dole, as the US Senate's Republican majority
leader, refused to raise the national minimum wage. Congress went
ahead and did it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Different politicians, different times, different elections.
What Cellucci and Dole have in common, though, is the price to be
paid on the campaign trail for failing to control their respective
legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are many advantages to holding office. But
during an election year, delivering the goods is not always one of
them. Politicians beware: Better an outsider than a legislator be.
Scott Harshbarger, Patricia McGovern, Brian Donnelly, and Joseph D.
Malone make no claims to influencing or winning results from the
Massachusetts Legislature _ nor will they be scrutinized to that
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always dangerous to raise expectations when you don't
know in advance you can meet them,'' said Charles O. Jones,
professor emeritus of political science at the University of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, a look at recent history in Washington may be
instructive for those seeking insight into the Bay State race for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, the GOP nominee for president in 1996, proudly proclaimed
he was a doer, not a talker. His 36 years in the Senate and the
House, and his election as their leader by his peers, made him the
ultimate political insider.
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike Dole, Cellucci is a veteran of legislative
maneuvering. A Beacon Hill fixture for more than 20 years, he
served in both the House and the Senate, including a leadership
role as assistant Republican leader in the Senate. He moved into
the spotlight when William F. Weld chose him as his running mate 6
1/2 years ago. Last summer, Cellucci became acting governor when
Weld resigned to pursue the ill-fated ambassadorship to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dole once did, Cellucci has proudly noted his expertise in
working behind the scenes with a legislative body, his longtime
friendships with lawmakers, and his knowledge of lawmaking. But
Dole provides the cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   The US Senate became even noticeably unruly once Dole began
running for the GOP nomination for president. Phil Gramm, the Texas
Republican, was constantly trying to embarrass Dole on the Senate
floor, jockeying for an edge in the primaries. After he was
dispatched from the race in New Hampshire, and Dole seemed the
likely nominee, the Democrats started taking their whacks at him.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative master Dole was met by another parliamentary
wizard, Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Dole returned from the campaign
trail with plans to move a slew of bills to President Clinton's
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was forced to yank an immigration bill from the
Senate floor to avert two votes he didn't want to take: One, a
Kennedy amendment to raise the $4.25 hourly minimum wage by 90
cents; the other, to put Social Security trust funds off-limits for
balancing the budget.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Republicans weren't being too helpful to Dole,
either. Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina was pushing for an
amendment to the immigration bill that would have prohibited
illegal immigrant children from attending public schools. While
Dole told voters in California that he supported a state's right to
bar those children, he didn't want to actually vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the minimum wage increase, however, that caused Dole the
most problems. As the proposal gained in popularity around the
country and in Congress, more and more senators planned to offer
minimum wage amendments to any and every bill brought to the floor.
It became harder and harder for Dole to find a bill that could be
debated without the clutter of other uncomfortable issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an embarrassment to the Senate, an embarrassment to
the Congress,'' Kennedy railed against Dole, who was juggling the
demands of both the Senate and his own presidential interests.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Dole bowed to the gridlock and to the continuing
embarassment to his legislative acumen. He retired from the Senate
to take his presidential campaign on the road, away from the
filibusters and the points of order and the motions to table.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is not an option for Cellucci, who is
campaigning as the incumbent governor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Legislature will not be sending him his $1.4 billion
tax cut that would have reduced the income tax rate from 5.95 to 5
percent. Instead, the Democrat-controlled House and Senate have
crafted a $700 million cut that they say is targeted to
lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has said he will back the tax cut, contending that
Democratic lawmakers would not have given taxpayers any of their
money back if he hadn't been pressing for a larger package from the
start. Malone, the state treasurer and Cellucci's opponent in the
GOP primary, charges him with taking ``crumbs'' rather than
rallying the public to fight for what is rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Still to be determined is whether Cellucci will have the
opportunity to sign a minimum wage raise, a so-called
``brownfields'' environmental cleanup measure, and a bill to impose
life sentences for all second-time sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   As a Republican governor with a Democrat-controlled Legislature,
says political scientist Jones, Cellucci has to campaign both for
himself and for his initiatives, as well as find votes from both
sides of the aisle if he is to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an election pending, unless they judge that you're so
damn popular outside, unless you're an Eisenhower or a Bill Weld _
then there's no particular reason with an election coming up to go
along with you,'' says Jones.
</P>
<P>
   For Dole, a prospering electorate didn't much care about what he
had to say, and felt no strong reason to dump Clinton. Cellucci,
too, may well benefit from a strong economy, rather than be hurt by
a weak legislative scorecard.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall H. Wittman, director of congressional relations at the
Heritage Foundation, calls the legislative maneuverings more inside
than ``inside baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it be on Capitol Hill or in a state house, it is
totally uninteresting to a content electorate,'' Wittman says.
``They only focus on the inner goings on when it's a time of
economic peril. Otherwise, you have far more interesting things to
be interested in, like where your summer vacation is going to be
and where you're going to buy a new car.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Cellucci, who often appears in a defensive crouch,
would likely say hallelujah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said last July that the principal task in front of me was to
keep the economy of Massachusetts in high gear, and I don't think
anyone can argue, a year later, that the economy of Massachusetts
is not in high gear,'' Cellucci said recently.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is up to the voters.

NEW YORK WINE: GREAT BODY, GOOD FOR THE HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE BARNES  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the mail we find the claim that red wines made
from grapes grown in New York state offer coronary benefits beyond
those of other reds.
</P>
<P>
   Studies suggest that the regular consumption of red wine, in
moderate amounts, helps reduce the risk of heart disease as a
result of antioxidants in the wine. New York reds have higher
levels of a certain heart-helping compound, called resveratrol,

   For all you nighttime dog-walkers out there, here's a
combination flashlight and leash handle all in one, called the
Night Rover. The device, which resembles the spray nozzle for a
garden hose, functions as an ``illuminated leash handle,''
according to its manufacturer, the Sabaka Co.
</P>
<P>
   Simply snap the person-end of most leashes into the front of the
flashlight: You've got a comfortable grip with which to control
your lunging, investigatory canine, and a handy thumb switch to
control the bright-beamed illumination, all with one hand.
Available in red or yellow with black trim, the flashlight will
accommodate leashes up an inch in width; thick, padded leather
leashes may not fit, however. Order the $15 Night Rover by calling
800-559-9980.

   The bagel is 315 years old, or so says information sent along by
Lender's Bagels, which sells more than a billion of the things
annually. Bagel lore: A Viennese baker, grateful that the King of
Poland had saved Austria from a Turkish invasion, fashioned a hard
roll in the shape of a stirrup to commemorate the Polish king's
favorite pastime, horseback riding.
</P>
<P>
   In the centuries since, bagels have had uses as varied as
teething rings and hot street-corner snacks popular during long
Russian winters. Immigrants brought bagels to America a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the bagel has become one of the most popular
items in the bread-and-roll category. To celebrate its 12th annual
Bagfelfest, held next weekend at the Lender's plant in Mattoon,
Ill., Lender's will try to create a record-setting, 650-pound
blueberry bagel that will be boiled for four hours and baked for 12
hours in a specially built oven.

HOW DOES GEOTHERMAL HEAT WORK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In New York City, I understand there are two houses heated by
heat drawn up from deep underground. Can I do this to my house?
</P>
<P>
   J.H., Quincy, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We're not sure about your house, J.H., but geothermal heat
pumps are certainly feasible for Quincy and most other areas. In
fact, there's a good example of geothermal heating near you. The
heated swimming pool at the Lincoln Hancock Elementary School gets
its warmth from a geothermal heat pump system.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. Water from underground is either brought to
the surface from a well or pumped through a loop of pipe buried in
the ground. The water isn't all that hot _ only about 50 degrees
Fahrenheit in Massachusetts _ but that's enough to get things
started.
</P>
<P>
   The water is run past the coils of a refrigerator. The
refrigerant inside the coils, trifluorochloromethane (also known as
R-22), boils at a very low temperature, between 15 and 25 degrees,
depending on the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Now remember the Second Law of Thermodynamics: Heat will flow
from warmer objects to cooler, not the other way. Enough of the
heat from the 50-degree water flows into the cooler R-22 to start
it boiling, which changes some of the liquid refrigerant to a gas.
</P>
<P>
   The vapor is collected and pumped to a compressor, which
squeezes it. The pressure heats everything to about 160 degrees.
The heat can then be sent to any heating appliance, such as a home
heating system, or water heater.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-degree water, which cooled down when the R-22 absorbed
some of its heat, is pumped back underground.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually a bit of a misnomer to call it geothermal heat,
says James Bose, director of the Division of Engineering Technology
at Oklahoma State University; it's really solar energy. The pipes
bringing up the water go down only 30 or 40 feet in some cases. At
that depth, and even deeper, the heat from the mantle of the Earth
is responsible for only a degree or two; the rest comes from the
sun warming the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The heat a geothermal system giveth, it also taketh away. In
buildings with ductwork that can collect indoor air and send it
past the refrigerant coils, heat pumps can also serve as air
conditioners. Instead of passing warm water over the coils, the
warm air from the building is blown over them. The refrigerant
doesn't care where the heat is coming from; it just absorbs some of
it and starts to boil.
</P>
<P>
   And by absorbing some of the heat, it cools the air, just as an
air conditioner would. The boiling refrigerant goes to the
compressor again, and gets heated again.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where the geothermal part comes in. Remember that
50-degree water from underground? This time, instead of passing
over the refrigerator coils to give up its heat, closed pipes carry
the water past the heated vapor in the compressor, where it absorbs
most of the heat. The warmed-up water is pumped back underground,
and the earth, cooler than the water, absorbs the heat that has
been transferred out of the air in the building.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Orio, president of Water and Energy Systems Corporation of
Concord, N.H., says there are thousands of geothermal heat pump
systems in all sorts of buildings in New England. Most use existing
wells for their water supply.
</P>
<P>
   When the thermostat for a house or water heater calls for heat,
it triggers the well's pump to send up some water, and starts the
whole process, he says. When there's enough space, the closed pipe
carrying the water underground can be run horizontally, instead of
vertically.
</P>
<P>
   Even though heat pumps use a fair amount of electricity to
circulate the water and run the compressor, they still cost less to
operate than traditionally-fueled systems. A 1993 EPA report called
``Space Conditioning: The Next Frontier,'' rated them the most
cost-effective and environmentally benign way to heat or cool a
building in five of the six cities tested, including Burlington,
Vt., and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Orio says the average installation cost in a home in New England
is about $13,000. With rebates offered by most utility companies on
installation expenses, and the saving in fuel costs compared with
natural gas, oil, or electric heat, he says the average geothermal
heat pump system pays for itself in about six years.

A MEASURE OF CAREGIVERS' STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Jackson, 83, doesn't complain when asked how he manages to
provide 24-hour care for his wife Hermie, who is 85 and has severe
Parkinson's disease. ``I begin to feel the stress, but I can deal
with it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Claire Wohlgemuth, a geriatric nurse who recently took on
the Jacksons as patients, was worried that he was headed for
exhaustion in his determination to honor his promise never to put
his wife into a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlgemuth and a social worker arranged adult day care for
Hermie Jackson one morning a week and a health aide to help
transfer her between bed and wheelchair, mornings and evenings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those few things reduced the burden significantly and gave Mr.
Jackson some breathing room,'' Wohlgemuth says.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors often need ``a heads-up on the possibility that a family
caregiver is becoming quite stressed, or you end up having two
patients instead of one,'' observes Mariette A. Young, former
president of the Massachusetts Medical Society Alliance, an
organization of physicians' wives.
</P>
<P>
   Young and her colleagues have devised a simple self-test for
family caregivers to unmask stress and alert physicians. The
Alliance hopes to distribute it widely to doctors' offices when
it's completed.
</P>
<P>
   The test urges family caregivers and doctors to seek help if
they answer ``true'' to statements such as:
</P>
<P>
   _I can't get enough rest.
</P>
<P>
   _I don't have enough time for myself.
</P>
<P>
   _I don't get out much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   _I have a hard time getting along with the person I care for.
</P>
<P>
   _I don't feel I have the knowledge to give care as well as I'd
like.
</P>
<P>
   _My own health is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Young and others also urge caregivers to be easy on themselves,
recognize their own limits, change their routines often, focus on
one good thing that happened each day, make time and space for
themselves, develop a ``buddy system'' for support, consider
joining a support group, and distinguish between complaining that
relieves or merely increases stress. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Above all, they say, caregivers should acknowledge their
feelings of anger, frustration, and sadness, and recognize that
they're normal.

<P>
   Psychologist Janice Kiecolt-Glaser and her virologist husband
Robert Glaser at Ohio State University have also found ``hard''
evidence of immune impairment.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, caregivers were 24 percent slower to heal than
non-caregivers after the researchers made small skin wounds.
Caregivers had lower levels of an immune-system chemical called
IL-1b, important in wound-healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a demonstration of an important health outcome for
caregivers,'' Kiecolt-Glaser says. ``For older adults wound healing
may be a particularly important issue, because they require more
surgery. It tells us that chronic stress will matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio State group has also shown that caregivers respond less
adequately to flu vaccines _ even when they got a higher vaccine
dose or a booster shot.
</P>
<P>
   This finding could be important, Kiecolt-Glaser notes, since
influenza-associated pneumonia is the fourth leading cause of death
among people over age 75. ``Response to flu vaccine is an important
health issue for older adults. But it also gives us a window into
caregivers' response to infectious disease in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only may caregivers suffer adverse health effects while they
are caring for a sick relative or friend, but the psychological
effects outlive the caregiving. As long as two years after the
death or nursing home placement of the care recipient, former
caregivers had rates of depression equivalent to current caregivers
_ and markedly different from non-caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   This may reflect, Kiecolt-Glaser thinks, disruption of social
supports. ``Over five to 10 years of caregiving, people's lives
shrink, their networks and their activities are neglected,'' she
says. ``With an older person, those are networks that can't be
easily or quickly rebuilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope the mounting evidence may punch through a wall
of indifference surrounding caregivers' plight. ``A lot of things
in life are difficult and stressful, but you're unlikely to get
much of a social response unless you can show real, measurable
consequences,'' says Richard Schulz, a University of Pittsburgh
authority on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of concern is evident in many ways. Federal and state
governments offer little support for respite care or adult day
care. Managed care companies thrust more post-hospital care burdens
on families. Good home care, which typically costs $20 an hour, is
out of reach for all but the well-to-do, and social policy dictates
that families ``spend down'' to poverty levels to qualify for
costly nursing home placement. Doctors and other professionals
often don't think to ask family caregivers how they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fraying patchwork of services, help, and invaluable
emotional support, are available if stressed-out caregivers think
to ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families are doing amazing things on their own,'' says Claire
Wohlgemuth, a geriatric nurse-specialist at Boston Medical Center.
``They often don't even realize that `Gee, maybe I could get
someone to help me with these things.'''

KENNEDY'S DESTRUCTIVE HATE CRIMES BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1988, Congress passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act. In
1994, it passed the Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act and the
Violence Against Women Act. In 1996, it passed the Church Arson
Prevention Act. Now, saying that Congress must do still more,
Senator Edward Kennedy proposed yet another federal statute, the
Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's bill would expand federal criminal jurisdiction to a
degree never before contemplated. It would overlap with hate-crimes
laws already in force in 41 states. It would give US attorneys the
authority to prosecute violent crimes _ from simple assault to
murder _ which have always been illegal in every state. It would
stretch the definition of ``hate crime'' far beyond what most
Americans understand that term to mean; for example, it would turn
every rape into a federal ``hate crime'' against women.
</P>
<P>
   And why is so tremendous an increase in federal power necessary?
Two words, says Kennedy: Jasper, Texas. The sickening murder there
last month ``shocked the conscience of the country,'' he told the
Judiciary Committee a few days ago. ``A strong response is clearly
needed.'' To drive home his point, the daughter of James Byrd Jr. _
the black man butchered so monstrously in Jasper _ was brought to
Washington to testify in favor of Kennedy's bill.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing a new federal hate crime law can supply
that isn't already in the Texas criminal code. ``A strong
response''? Prosecutors in the Jasper case will seek the death
penalty if the men charged with killing Byrd are convicted. How
much stronger a response did Kennedy have in mind? There is no
state in the union where prosecutors would ignore so
stomach-churning a hate crime, or fail to demand the harshest
punishment available. Far from proving that a vast expansion of
federal prosecutorial powers is urgently needed, the horror in
Jasper demonstrates that it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   What minorities have to fear most is not white-supremacist hate
crimes going unpunished. It is ``ordinary'' violent crime, the
great bulk of which is black-on-black. One of the nation's leading
scholars of crime and race, Harvard Law professor Randall Kennedy,
writes: ``It makes sense to suppose that local law enforcement
officials will probably allocate more of their scarce resources to
the crime that is a Page 1 cause celebre than to the crime that
never makes it past the back pages of the local press.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not a problem Ted Kennedy cares about. Liberal
politicians of his stripe find it a lot sexier to denounce hate
crimes that cross racial, ethnic, religious, or sexual lines than
to deal seriously with punishing violent crime in general. Even
though it is violent crime in general that causes most of the
bloodshed and mayhem in America. Of the roughly 20,000 homicides,
30,000 rapes, 150,000 robberies, and half a million aggravated
assaults for which police will make arrests this year, only a tiny
fraction would qualify as hate crimes. What do we gain by shining a
spotlight on that fraction and eclipsing the rest?
</P>
<P>
   The recent rash of hate crime laws would be understandable if
crime motivated by bigotry and racism was out of control. It isn't.
A few years back, the Minnesota Department of Public Safety
reported that there had been 425 bias crimes statewide the year
before, a finding that led the district attorney in St. Paul to
decry the ``massive increase in hate crimes.'' Yet those 425
criminal attacks accounted for just two-tenths of 1 percent of all
the violent crime reported in Minnesota that year. Check the
numbers for the other states; the results will be the same.
</P>
<P>
   The blood of bias-crime victims is no redder than that of
``ordinary'' victims. The daughter of a man murdered because he was
black sheds tears just as hot as the daughter of a man murdered
because he had $20 in his pocket. By singling out hate crimes for
special statistical and prosecutorial attention, lawmakers in
effect declare some victims _ and some victims' grieving loved ones
_ more equal than others.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when Americans are under constant pressure to splinter
into groups _ to see themselves first and foremost as members of an
aggrieved race, class, or gender _ the last thing they need are
more laws emphasizing their differences and calling inordinate
attention to bias and hatred. Kennedy's bill furthers a deeply
destructive trend: an insistence on casting violent offenders not
merely as criminals who threaten society's well-being, but as
various kinds of bigots _ racists, sexists, gay-bashers,
Jew-haters. This is profoundly wrong. The purpose of criminal codes
is not to protect blacks from whites, Jews from skinheads, women
from misogynists, gays from straights, or immigrants from
nativists. It is to protect all of us from lawbreakers.
</P>
<P>
   Every single crime that would be covered by Kennedy's
legislation is already a crime. Each one can already be prosecuted.
Each can already be punished. ``Hate Crimes Prevention'' has a fine
ring to it, but this bill would prevent nothing except unity. What
it would promote is balkanization, class warfare, and identity
politics. Of all the ways to memorialize James Byrd, that has to be
the worst.

31-YEAR-OLD SETS $1M RETIREMENT GOAL

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I turned 31 last December. I have a little money _ $5,500 _
in the 401(k) plan of a former employer. I also have a $1,000 CD. I
am beginning a new job next week, and I plan to save $300 a week of
my pay; once the pool has built up to $2,500, I will open a mutual
fund account with Scudder. I will be eligible to join my employer's
401(k) plan after one year's employment, and plan to contribute 15
percent of my salary. If my goal is to retire at age 60 with $1
million, how much money do I need to put aside to reach my goal?
</P>
<P>
   M.N., Brockton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The answer, of course, depends on a lot of assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to follow the investment program you outlined, you
would need to put in $597.43 a month, based on 10 percent average
annual portfolio gains, to reach $1 million by age 60. If you went
with a more conservative portfolio, which produced 8 percent
average returns, the figure would leap to $881.43 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let these numbers upset you. The point in saving for
retirement is to establish a percentage of earnings that you will
save, allowing the dollar amount of your regular savings to
increase as your earnings do.
</P>
<P>
   Put the first $2,000 of your savings during the next year into a
Roth IRA. If you do not anticipate that you can make the maximum
contributions once you join the 401(k) after a year's employment,
save the remaining $1,100 in the bank. Once you are eligible to
join the 401(k), contribute the maximum until you've moved that
$1,100 into the 401(K).
</P>
<P>
   Once that is done, you can then reduce your 401(k) contribution
to whatever level you have chosen. (If you plan to contribute the
maximum allowed to the 401(k) anyway, I suggest you eventually get
that $1,100 into an IRA or another tax-deferred savings plan.)
</P>
<P>
   I strongly urge you to go with a diversified stock portfolio,
disregarding the state of the market for about the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 73, and I have been retired for 15
years. Among our assets are shares of a common stock that has
reduced its dividend. This stock was accumulated over a 30-year
period through an employee purchase plan. Is there a way to
transfer any or all of these shares to some other income-producing
fund without paying capital gains excessively? The situation is
further complicated by the loss of eight years of purchase
rec-ords.
</P>
<P>
   J.S., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Unless the shares are in a tax-deferred savings plan that was
set up by the company, I'm afraid the taxman's bite will be
inexorable. If you simply signed up to buy shares through a payroll
deduction plan, receiving a new certificate for additional shares
on a periodical basis, you'll have to pay capital gains taxes if
you sell. However, the capital gains rates have been reduced, so
the bite my not be that terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Since these shares were purchased through your employer, perhaps
your old company's personnel department can help you determine your
cost basis. And even if they do not have records for your
particular purchases, you can figure from the dates on the
certificates during which period the shares were purchased. You can
determine from the company _ or its transfer agent if the company
can't supply the rec-ords _ what the high and low prices were
during each period.
</P>
<P>
   You could then sell the shares, citing the low price for each
certificate as your cost basis, and thus determine an estimated tax
basis for the shares sold. This is, of course, an imperfect method,
since it is likely that you usually purchased the shares somewhere
in the middle of the price range rather than the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But it will allow you to look the taxman in the eye and swear
that you are paying the full tax due _ and probably a few bucks
more.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both 55 and we plan for me to retire in 10
years. My present income is about $100,000 a year, which includes a
Navy retirement. Our savings include $88,000 in a 401(k) to which I
contribute $800 a month, $81,000 in IRA and SEP-IRA accounts, to
which $2,500 a year is added, and $20,000 in taxable investments,
to which I add $140 a month. We also achieve $400 monthly profits
from a house rental. Is it possible that my investments will be
sufficient to provide $50,000 in supplemental income in the year
2008? Is the portfolio a mess? I know the annuities and money
market accounts are barely keeping up with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   L.B., Chula Vista, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My tally, based upon an assumption of 8 percent average
annual returns and ongoing contributions at current levels, shows
the total pool growing to $614,998 by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
   To support $50,000 annual withdrawals without drawing on
principal at that point, you would have to achieve better than 8.1
percent returns, and that seems to be stretching it.
</P>
<P>
   If the $400 monthly income from your rental property is added to
the formula, you could expect to have $687,077 in 10 years, and a
sequence of withdrawals designed to deliver $50,000 would require a
return of nearly 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, unless you change some of the investments, average
returns of 8 percent are quite unrealistic. For example, of the
$81,000 in IRAs, only $17,000 is in stock funds, with the rest in
money markets, annuities, and bonds. If you can escape the
annuities without significant penalty, move that money, plus the
money market fund account, into a solid balanced fund such as Dodge
and Cox Balanced and Vanguard Balanced Index.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for your 401(k) investments: Of that $88,000,
$58,000 is in a Fidelity money market fund. I'd put that money in
something like Fidelity's Spartan GNMA fund or another
intermediate-term bond fund. You might use 24-month dollar-cost
averaging to establish the position if you're very cautious.

MANY SKEPTICAL JAPAN WILL ACCEPT A PAINFUL CURE 
</HEADLINE>

 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Ever since voters angry over a slumped economy clobbered
Japan's ruling party in elections last week, pundits the world over
have prognosticated on how the defeat might force Tokyo to revamp
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Japan's economy has been in a rut for most of the
1990s, and few outsiders paid much attention. But ever since a
severe financial crisis struck much of Asia last summer, causing
currencies to tank, governments to fall, and millions across the
region to lose their jobs and savings, accusing eyes have turned on
Japan as the root of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   If the region's largest economy would restart its long-stalled
engine, the argument goes, it could drag the rest of Asia out of
the doldrums with it. But if a sputtering Japan continues to delay
the pain of economic overhaul, many analysts say, markets will
attack its currency and asset prices, sparking a domino collapse
across Asia _ and a world recession that could reach as far as Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the task ahead for whoever replaces outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the end of this month critical, not
just for Japanese discomforted by their worst recession in 23
years, but for Asian neighbors suffering far worse _ hunger, mass
layoffs, and currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The larger questions for Japan's next leader are whether to
delay fundamental reforms to avoid suffering at home, and whether
to give in to overseas pressure to spend his way out of this slump
_ an approach that will balloon a deficit that is already the
biggest in the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking Japan to get their economy up by throwing
money at it, but the real problem is the underlying corporate
structure is rotten to the core,'' said Craig Chudler, Japanese
equities strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``It's rather callous
and ignorant of other countries. ... If Japan had low levels of
debt, you could say, `pump the prime.' But now it's a question of
ruining Japan's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this possibly short-sighted approach is exactly
what Japan's friends are pushing for, hoping that a Japan that
imports and invests more abroad will boost neighbors and shrink its
sensitive trade surplus with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Southeast Asia and South Korea, which had to accept
bailout packages and are being forced by the International Monetary
Fund to restructure ailing economies, Japan has the largest
reserves in the world, one of the highest savings rates, and hardly
any overseas debt, giving it a cushion to put off needed overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies need to make grassroots changes, and people will
need to accept those changes and realize, `no pain, no gain.'... We
are going to have to experience hard times in order to recover,''
said Kenichi Enatsu, a business professor at Waseda University in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles began when Japan's high-flying economy, held up as
a model for America in the 1980s, hit a wall with the bursting of
the overheated ``bubble economy'' at the start of this decade.
Stock prices peaked here in 1989 with the Nikkei index around
40,000. Today, the Nikkei is below 17,000. The collapse of inflated
asset values and real estate prices this decade has reduced
personal and corporate wealth and also hit the banking sector with
a tsunami of unpaid loans _ more than half a trillion dollars
worth.
</P>
<P>
   The economy fell into recession at the end of last year and is
expected to contract this year. Tax increases last year squelched
demand, including for imported goods. That hurt Asia, since Japan
is the second-largest market after China for regional exports, and
China's largest export market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Facing US pressure, Japan last month agreed to deregulate and
open several aspects of securities and construction markets, and to
eliminate laws that hinder foreign companies from establishing
major retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who say Japan owes it to Asia to take drastic
steps to lift the region out of its morass.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the bubble burst here, they did the same things across
Asia _ overlending, overborrowing, and overbuilding,'' said Ronald
Bevacqua, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Ltd. ``It's no
coincidence that the Asian crisis began last year, 1 1/2 years
after the Japanese yen began to devalue and immediately after the
tax increases that sent this economy into recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks Japan should be held responsible for
Asia's woes, since many regional economies brought problems on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan didn't make'' former Indonesian leader ``Suharto's
family line their pockets, or make Malaysia build the tallest
building in the world,'' said Richard Jerram, chief economist here
for ING Baring Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Japan was in rotten shape six years ago, nobody
particularly cared because Asia was fine and the US economy was
recovering,'' he added. ``Now there's a perception that weakness in
Japan causes weakness in Asia _ and Brazil and Moscow, what have
you. It's as if Japan were responsible for Holland getting knocked
out of the World Cup and the El Nino effect. It's become flavor of
the month to blame the world's ills on Japan's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Teizo Taya, an economist and former director
of the US-Japan 21st Century Committee, attributes the lingering
slump here to protectionism _ of sagging companies by the
government, of unneeded employees by companies, and of bankrupt
creditors by lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Chudler agreed that the government has ``babied'' companies by
using public money to boost their sales and giving unprofitable
firms tax breaks to stay in business. The government also pays
companies to keep workers employed. ``It's like welfare without the
stigma of staying home and watching TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the wrongheaded approach of stimulus without
underlying reforms, Taya said, and you have a recipe for disaster:
``It's like giving liquor to an alcoholic.'' And after a $124
billion stimulus package announced three months ago, ``we simply
don't have the money anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped all three candidates for prime minister
from talking about huge stimulus packages. Front-runner Keizo
Obuchi suggested a 10 trillion yen ($7.2 billion) budget Friday,
likely to be financed through deficit bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Japan Ltd., says other
worse-hit Asian nations will probably recover before Japan because
they have run out of cash and are being forced to restructure. With
its vast reserves, Japan need not act immediately, and that
ultimately could hurt Japan more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can count the number of years on one hand before Japan
faces a hard landing,'' Shipley predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is the collapse of an economic system, an
economy that has relied on overseas demand for growth,'' he said,
``and I don't see any of these politicians doing anything about it.
Financial markets are going to do it for them. Markets will
downgrade Japanese assets until they are so cheap that investors
will buy them and companies will face restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that a collapsed Japan would lead to world
recession. Chudler noted that even as Asia deteriorates, most US
companies have surpassed expectations for second-quarter earnings.
``This could be the greatest thing to happen to the US,'' he
asserted. ``Inflation has fallen and we didn't have to raise
interest rates, because worldwide commodities prices have been kept
down'' by the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   If this continues, ``people are going to say, `Who cares about
Japan?' Then maybe Japan can go back to dealing with its domestic
political and economic systems and figure it out themselves. That's
the healthiest solution.''

LITERARY BOOT CAMP FOR WRITERS TO HONE THIER SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORDEN STATE PARK, Wash. _ The beach beckons, with the sun
glistening off the crescent of sand that kisses Admiralty Inlet,
the saltwater beyond alternating between azure and aquamarine and
the imposing snow-capped cone of Mount Baker standing sentinel on
the horizon. Summer in the Northwest is seldom more dazzling than
this.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest concentration of people in this blessed place on
the edge of Port Townsend is not on the beach soaking up sunshine
or snatching up seashells. They are sitting in the cool darkness of
the old Joseph F. Wheeler Theater, where a solitary figure,
sometimes a man, sometimes a woman, stands at a simple lectern on
stage and talks about the delights and frights and disciplines of
the imagined word.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Port Townsend Writers' Conference, 25th anniversary
edition, where 140 people from Key West to Hawaii gather for 10
summer days and nights devoted to the intensive study of writing.
This is more intellectual boot camp than lazy days summer camp. The
intent and earnest attendees endure stark barracks quarters and
dreary mess-hall food that strongly recall the distant past of this
turn-of-the-century artillery post.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the writing life is not supposed to be some loll in a
hammock, so this conference's rigors may be a most appropriate
reflection of the devotions required in pursuit of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to be too easy,'' admits Jan Wesley, whose
tousled blond looks, weathered leather jacket, blue jeans and host
of silver bracelets bespeak her Los Angeles home and her work in
the film industry. ``I wanted a kick in the ass here, both in terms
of inspiration and to jump-start my own writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley is a typical Port Townsend attendee. She is a woman in
her late 40s _ more than three quarters of the students here are
women, year in and year out, and most seem to be in their 40s.
Wesley has been willing to leave normal life and its obligations
behind in the hope that 10 days away and an investment of nearly
$1,000 will somehow provide what she needs to finally spark
progress toward her long-simmering dream of becoming a serious
writer.
</P>
<P>
   So Wesley sits in a morning class in the old post schoolhouse
and dutifully records the sage but witty advice of poet Marvin
Bell, who has written 13 well-praised books. Bell is a writers'
conference veteran whose graying bearded presence recalls the late
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. He is enumerating a baker's
dozen tips on being a successful writer but is also injecting so
many puckish asides that what he says delights almost as much as it
instructs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things matter _ if you want to write about eternity,
don't write about eternity; write about your cup of coffee,'' Bell
advises. ``It's poetry, it's only poetry _ you have to have both
attitudes. Poetry comes out of life, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is one of 11 faculty members at this summer's conference
(which ended July 19), put on by Centrum, the small but ambitious
non-profit arts organization headquartered at the fort.
</P>
<P>
   These 11 faculty members are writers of stature with books and
fellowships, prizes and professorships to their credit, which is
why the faculty has long been one of Port Townsend's big draws. The
list of writers who have taught here in the past reads like a
literary honor roll, including such notables as Raymond Carver,
Margaret Atwood, Kenneth Rexroth, Alice Walker, Carolyn Kizer, Tom
Robbins and Tobias Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ransom did not have such grand dreams a quarter century
ago, when Fort Worden was becoming a state park and conference
center after doing duty as a treatment center for juveniles. What
Ransom and two compatriots (Joe Wheeler, Donn Trethewey) were
trying to do then was find something that could use some of the
fort's facilities but not require the purchase of much additional
equipment, something preferably in the arts that might snare some
grant money.
</P>
<P>
   A dance festival and a writer's conference were what they came
up with, with the writer's conference closely modeled on what
Ransom had observed when he worked as a waiter two years before at
the Breadloaf Writers' Conference in Vermont. There was only a
handful of such conferences at the time. Port Townsend's later
emergence as one of this country's leading writing conferences,
amid what is now a glut, probably owes more to its early founding
than to its decidedly modest beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom, who served as the conference's director in its fledgling
years, has returned this summer as an instructor, part of a faculty
alumni contingent brought back for the anniversary by current
director Sam Hamill. Ransom has gone on to publish novels and
collections of poems, while also working as a teacher (now at The
Evergreen State College), just as many other writers must do to put
something in the checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom remains a firm believer in the value of writing
conferences: ``One of the big boosts that comes from these
conferences is from seeing that ordinary people do this _ they
demystify writing. And I also believe that if you give me students
here for six hours a day for two weeks, I can give them what I can
teach in a quarter at school. Conferences are superb, especially
for busy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Their time at Port Townsend is busy as well. The crowded daily
schedule quickly becomes implanted in attendees' brains: 8 a.m.
breakfast; 9 a.m. lecture by an instructor; 10:30 a.m. class for
two hours; 12:30 lunch; early afternoon conferences with
instructors; 3 p.m. lecture by an instructor; 6 p.m. dinner; 7:30
p.m. reading by an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of exhilaration and exhaustion flows through both
students and instructors, what with all the events and classes to
attend, the writing to complete or critically assess, the stories
to share in free moments at this sudden gathering of strangers with
like devotions.
</P>
<P>
   As Jane Hirshfield, a 45-year-old poet and instructor from Mill
Valley, Calif., puts it: ``To be in a community of people of shared
passions is a tremendous gift. It is exciting to be able to step
out of our own rooms once a year and find yourself among people who
get as excited about semicolons as you do. A lot of writers can go
all year on the energy that comes from that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that does not come easy. The central moment for many
students at the conference is submitting one's own writing for
critique by 15 or so fellow students and the instructor. This is
private and often intensely personal work suddenly turned naked
public entity, a time for flushed faces and churning stomachs or
worse. Tears are sometimes seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings you up against all your self-doubts and your
impossible standards and you have to confront those, day after
day,'' says Robyn Johnson of Stanwood, an aspiring poet whose
regular life revolves around the financial concerns of directing
the Everett Parks Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come here wanting to perform,'' observes Bruce
Elkin of Saltspring Island, B.C., who is attending for the second
time. ``But when they're criticized, they don't know how to take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouragement can be profound. Elkin's previous instructor at
Port Townsend three years ago implied he ``should go into law
enforcement instead of writing,'' advice that the 55-year-old
consultant ultimately discarded, but not without much
soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, fellow students and instructors try to be
encouraging, especially since rejection is such a frequent
companion in the writer's trade. So constructive criticism usually
abounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling how many hours of hard writing may be
spawned when instructor Annick Smith of Missoula advises one
student, ``This is a powerful, promising start; this has all the
things to make you go on.'' Or when instructor William Kittredge _
who is team-teaching the non-fiction class with Smith, his longtime
partner _ advises another student, ``This gets at some deep-seated
and difficult stuff and I admire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such encouraging words answer a deep craving for aspiring and
beginning writers, which is why many keep coming back to Port
Townsend. Fifteen percent of this year's attendees have been here
before, including Karen Seashore from Sandpoint, Idaho, a
51-year-old former teacher who has left her husband and two teens
at home to attend Port Townsend for the seventh straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place to study like this in my town,'' Seashore
says. ``And I find what I want here _ the faculty is approachable
and I have 10 days without phones or family, amid the fellowship of
writers and the beauty of this place, the bluff, the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The considerable charms of Port Townsend and its Olympic
Peninsula surroundings do add to the allure of the writer's
conference. This town of 8,275 people manages to be arty but not
artificial, a working community with a paper mill and handsome
Victorian buildings in various states of renovation, an enviable
place that seems to be just isolated enough to avoid turning all
cutesy-touristy.
</P>
<P>
   Port Townsend, despite much growth and grumbling, is still not
Aspen or Carmel or La Jolla or even La Conner. But the city remains
well-known in the national arts community, in part because it is
home to Copper Canyon Press (also situated at the fort), which is
probably the country's pre-eminent publisher of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   But the writer's conference is only one of many nationally
recognized workshops and festivals put on by Centrum, a perennially
cash-strapped outfit that somehow manages to mount a non-stop
parade of events throughout the year, everything from classical
music to jazz to fiddle tunes to country blues, events that give
Port Townsend a rich cultural life that many cities 10 times its
size could envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centrum and Copper Canyon are both really well-known back
East,'' says Alison Swan, a 36-year-old editor and reviewer from
Saugatuck, Mich. ``And I think this conference has been fabulous. I
definitely feel recharged by being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the writer's conference are not without their
complaints. Many students wish there were more social activities
with the faculty, while the faculty members wish they had more time
when they were not buried under an avalanche of student papers to
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism, too, is sometimes voiced in private about Hamill, the
conference director, whose introductions of writers at the readings
and lectures are so brusque and insider-enigmatic that they border
on being rude. Some repeat attendees, both students and faculty,
say they yearn for the more civil days past when students
themselves introduced the writers, especially since all these
events are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill is widely respected for being co-founder and editor at
Copper Canyon Press, as well as a much-praised poet and translator
of Chinese literature. But his sandpaper personality does rub many
people the wrong way, especially when he turns stern camp counselor
on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 150 of us here and I have had reports of yelling
problems between some of you and parties at 2 a.m.,'' Hamill
lectures at one point. ``If you can't be kind, be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such moments are quickly forgotten, though, once the readings
begin and the magic of well-chosen words spills off the stage and
drifts out into the summer air.
</P>
<P>
   John Balaban, a 54-year-old poet from Miami, gives a stunning
reading to hushed silence and frequent bursts of applause. He reads
not only his own work, but also poems in Vietnamese and poems he
has translated from Vietnamese, including those from a decade of
work he has devoted to one obscure Vietnamese woman poet who lived
in the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is the central theme of Balaban's work _ he was a
conscientious objector during the Vietnam War who served in Vietnam
as a field representative for the Committee of Responsibility to
Save War-Injured Children. His humanity courses through his poems,
a strong current of caring, and the audience is hanging on his
every word as Balaban builds to the close of his poem, ``Words for
My Daughter'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know the worst and be free from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know the worst and still find good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, as you play nearby or laugh
</P>
<P>
   ``with the ladies at Peoples Bank as we go around town
</P>
<P>
   ``and I find myself beaming like a fool,
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect I am here less for your protection
</P>
<P>
   ``than you are here for mine, as if you were sent
</P>
<P>
   ``to call me back into our helpless tribe.''

jurors for the O.J. Simpson trial that she landed a contract to
write ``Reading People,'' in which she shares the secrets of what
the book's dustjacket calls her ``amazing skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing truly amazing about her skills is that a
publisher was willing to pay her to write about them. The book's
subtitle promises much: ``How to Understand People and Predict
Their Behavior _ Anytime, Anyplace.'' Here's a typical Dimitrius
insight: ``Extremely self-deprecating behavior ... makes a powerful
statement about a person's self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, no?
</P>
<P>
   You can open the book to just about any page and find similar
tips. Dimitrius notes that she studied psychology, sociology,
physiology, communications, linguistics, statistics. She has a PhD
in criminal justice. That's nice, but ``Reading People'' owes less
to higher education than it does to basic common sense. Your mother
could have written this book, if she'd cared to, assuming she had
some connection to the Simpson trial and a good agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest people are generally relaxed and open,'' Dimitrius
writes. ``Dishonest people aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing. Truly.
</P>
<P>
   By now, just about everybody even remotely connected to the
Simpson trial has churned out a book about it. In the introduction
to ``Reading People,'' Dimitrius writes that she didn't want to do
another behind-the-scenes, dirt-dishing quickie. She didn't want to
apply her amazing skills to an analysis of those involved in the
trial. That would have been too interesting. Nor, apparently, did
she want to write a book about jury selection, which also might
have been interesting. She's been a consultant in hundreds of
trials, some of them almost as high profile as the Simpson case.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted instead to write a book that would ``make a
difference in people's lives,'' a book that offered advice such as
this: ``... sizing up someone's friends and associates will give
you a pretty reliable indication of his or her character.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Mom.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be a great deal of money to be made in belaboring
the obvious, apparently because, to a lot of people, the obvious
isn't so obvious. They don't know what to think. Some don't know
how to think at all. Common sense isn't that common. So there may
be an audience for Dimitrius's book among people who haven't got a
clue.
</P>
<P>
   As she notes in her first chapter, people are relying more and
more on forms of technology to communicate and losing the knack of
sizing up other people face-to-face, assuming they knew how to do
it in the first place. ``If you want to become a better
people-reader,'' Dimitrius writes, ```you must make a conscious
effort to engage other people.''
</P>
<P>
   That advice seems obvious to the point of being simple-minded.
But maybe Dimitrius knows her audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``How people read you will make a tremendous difference in your
life,'' reveals Dimitrius, amazing again in a chapter titled,
``Looking in the Mirror: Reading How Others Are Reading You.'' This
chapter will be of particular interest to anyone who wants to
create an image that will help him or her get a job, get a date, or
even get off scot-free.
</P>
<P>
   Although she warns against putting on a ``false front,'' she
also writes, ``... there's no question that learning to project
yourself in a certain way can help you manipulate others.'' Read
yourself as you would read others, she advises. Then make the
necessary changes to get the desired results. It's sort of the
Golden Rule of self-promotion.

JOSEPH PERKINS IS AARP`S NEW POINT MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Smiling warmly and moving briskly, Joseph Perkins, new president
of the American Association of Retired Persons, is doing what he
does a lot these days. And what he seems to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   He walks into a room full of people concerned about
aging-related issues _ in this case, an advocacy group called the
Senior Health Care Coalition, meeting at the AARP's regional office
in Boston _ schmoozes a bit, pumps a few hands, and then makes a
short, low-key but heartfelt pitch for the twin themes of his
administration: the need to modify but retain the essential
features of the Social Security system and Medicare, and the
importance of volunteer work and community involvement by older
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security is not in a financial crisis, and its fiscal
problems can easily be solved,'' says the 69-year-old Perkins,
himself a Social Security recipient, ``but there is a large cohort
that doesn't like programs such as Social Security and Medicare for
philosophical reasons and wants to shift risk from the government
onto the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidency of AARP is an unpaid position, and Perkins notes
that much of the association's work is done by more than 100,000
volunteers. ``My mantra is `choose involvement,''' he says. ``I
work for no pay, but I don't work for nothing. Work gives meaning
and purpose to life, and I wouldn't have retired unless I had
plenty of volunteer work to do.'' It's a message that
volunteer-dependent groups such as the Senior Health Care Coalition
appreciate and applaud. And it's also one obviously meant to
counter the common charge that AARP is the ``selfish seniors''
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The first AARP president from New England, Perkins grew up in
Salem, Mass. and graduated from Northeastern University. After
serving in the Navy, he went to work at Polaroid Corp. in 1959 and
was an industrial engineer before transferring to the company's
human resources department as its first benefits manager. He
retired four years ago and now resides in Danvers.
</P>
<P>
   During his two-year term, Perkins believes, Congress will most
likely determine the future makeup of Social Security and Medicare.
``These will probably be the most challenging years of my life,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the AARP, the board of directors approves all organizational
policies and has fiduciary responsibility, and Perkins does not
direct its day-to-day operations. ``I don't get into
administration; that's the job of Horace Deets, the chief executive
officer,'' he says. ``As the volunteer head, I'm a symbol and a
spokesman with a bully pulpit to get the AARP message out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most members of the AARP board of directors, I'm right
out of middle America,'' Perkins says, ``and at Polaroid I was a
middle manager supervising a staff of five people.'' Gray-haired,
soft-spoken, and a conservative, unpretentious dresser (a typical
outfit includes chinos and a blue button-down oxford cloth shirt),
Perkins still looks very much the middle manager.
</P>
<P>
   It was through his work as a retirement manager that Perkins
first became involved with AARP. ``When I took the job, Polaroid
was still a relatively young company, and only about 50 people had
retired,'' he recalls. The retirement trickle soon swelled to a
stream, and Perkins introduced innovative programs such as ``tryout
retirement,'' which allowed employees to take three-month
pre-retirement leaves to see how they might like the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was in the early '80s, when AARP realized that about a
third of the membership was still in the workplace,'' Perkins says.
Considered a national authority on voluntary retirement planning,
Perkins was asked to volunteer his expertise to AARP. He became a
member of the national board of directors in 1990. ``I was the
first New Englander and one of the first businessmen on the
board,'' he says. ``Traditionally, it had been composed of retired
educators.''
</P>
<P>
   Being the top officer of AARP involves much more than his old
job, Perkins acknowledges. ``AARP is mammoth, an 800-pound
gorilla,'' he says. ``It's a hard organization to run, because
we're not focused on just one thing _ we're not like the National
Rifle Association.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1956 as an offshoot of the National Retired Teachers
Association, AARP is the largest dues-paying organization in the
country, with about 32 million members age 50 and up. A nonprofit
social welfare organization with the aim of ``enhancing the quality
of life for individuals as they grow older,'' AARP offers its
members _ who pay annual dues of $8 _ a range of benefits and
services, including discounts on hotel accommodations, prescription
medicines, and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Its critics are quick to point out that AARP is wealthy as well
as large. Besides about $230 million in annual dues, the
association receives millions of dollars in royalties from the
companies whose products and services it endorses.
</P>
<P>
   And the AARP members-only mutual fund, managed by Scudder, has a
$15 billion portfolio. Perkins notes, however, that AARP spends
large sums on research and educational programs, as well as raising
money. ``We have an operating budget of close to $500 million a
year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   There are 23 state and five regional AARP offices around the
country. Both the Massachusetts office and the 10-state
Northeastern regional headquarters are in Boston. As president,
Perkins will visit all the offices at least once during his two
years. He will also make many trips to Washington for meetings at
AARP national headquarters and will represent the association at
congressional hearings. ``I think that I'll fly out of Logan
(International Airport) at least 40 or 50 times this year,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its vigorous support of the Social Security system
and other social programs _ support that it backs up by lobbying
Congress and state legislatures, and with grassroots mobilization
of members _ critics of AARP claim that it's more a partisan
political pressure group than a nonpartisan social welfare
organization. Perkins says the charge is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think advocacy is mostly what AARP does, but less
than 20 percent of the budget is spent on it,'' Perkins says. What
critics call lobbying to preserve costly entitlements is actually,
he insists, an effort to educate the public about important but
often misunderstood programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social Security and Medicare are well run, with administrative
costs of less than 2 percent, and people need to learn more about
them,'' he says. AARP supports some modification of Social
Security, such as changes in benefits and age limits, Perkins
notes, but opposes proposed major overhauls such as means testing.
``If we had means testing, wealthier people wouldn't be involved
and we'd end up with another welfare program,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever changes are made to Social Security and Medicare,
Perkins says, they are unlikely to affect him or others his age.
``I'm not fighting to save these programs for myself,'' he says.
``It's for my children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins's wife of 45 years, Mary-Jane, died in 1995. He married
his present wife, Helen, last year. ``We have a blended family of
eight children and 16 grandchildren,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Though without salary, the job of AARP president is not without
benefits and perquisites. All of Perkins's travel expenses are
picked up by the association, for instance, as are those of his
wife if she goes with him.
</P>
<P>
   When his presidential term is up and he steps out of the
national spotlight, Perkins says, he'll continue to volunteer at
the local level, something he has found rewarding. ``I'll go back
to doing retirement counseling for North Shore Elder Services,'' he
says. ``That's where I met my wife _ she was a client.''

MCDONALD'S LOBSTER IS TASTY, IF FROZEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ordinarily, we'd never think of ordering lobster at McDonald's,
but the restaurant chain's latest promotion made us curious.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's billboards feature a giant lobster roll overflowing
with succulent real lobster for less than four clams _ $3.99 before
tax, to be exact. That's a third of what most other restaurants
charge.
</P>
<P>
   And while anyone with a brain knows that food pictured in an ad
usually bears no resemblance to the food in real life, we had to
admit the billboard lobster roll looked pretty appetizing.
</P>
<P>
   What we found in real life was a lobster roll that didn't live
up to the size of its advertising counterpart, but otherwise was
reasonably satisfying. The bun wasn't toasted, which is the way we
like it, and the lobster wasn't the tastiest we've ever had. But
the lobster wasn't weighed down with mayonnaise and, as promised,
it was mostly knuckle and claw meat from real North American
lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot better than I thought it would be,'' said Jimmy
Doulos, the executive chef at Jimmy's Harborside in Boston and an
expert on lobster and how it is prepared. ``This is actually very
surprising. I figured it would be a white mass of mayonnaise with a
couple of pieces of celery and two little pieces of orange lobster
sticking out.''
</P>
<P>
   By our calculations, the McDonald's lobster roll has 2.5 ounces
of lobster meat, far less than the lobster rolls sold by most other
restaurants. Yet on a per-ounce basis the price is still
reasonable, at $1.59 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's Roast Beef &AMP; Seafood in Saugus sold us an $11.50 takeout
lobster roll with 7 ounces of meat, which works out to $1.64 an
ounce. Jimmy's Harborside, a full-service restaurant with a great
view, sells a lobster roll with 5 ounces of meat for $13.70, or
$2.74 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's was tight-lipped about how it was able to sell its
lobster roll for so little. No one from the company, based in Oak
Brook, Ill., would talk with us, and its local public relations
firm would only send us a fact sheet with limited information.
</P>
<P>
   After taste-testing the McDonald's lobster roll for us at their
restaurant, Doulos and his sister Kim, who is vice president at
Jimmy's Harborside, said there was no question the McDonald's
lobster had been frozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's night and day, in terms of taste, with fresh versus
frozen,'' said Kim Doulos. She said frozen lobster doesn't taste as
sweet and also tends to be saltier.
</P>
<P>
   The public relations firm subsequently confirmed that McDonald's
buys frozen lobster for its sandwiches, although its fact sheet
referred only to the company's ``fresh lobster roll.'' An official
at the public relations firm said the reference to a fresh lobster
roll meant that the sandwiches were prepared on a daily basis at
each restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   By buying frozen lobster in bulk for its 300 restaurants in
Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, McDonald's
could buy it for as little as $13 a pound, Jimmy Doulos said. Each
pound would provide enough meat to make six sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jimmy's pays about $26 a pound for its fresh
lobster meat. Jimmy's buys the more prized tail meat, in addition
to knuckles and claws, and serves lobster in big tasty chunks. We
felt that the Jimmy's and Kelly's lobster rolls were far superior
to the McDonald's roll, but then again they should be _ that's
their specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Doulos said she thinks McDonald's is smart to offer a
lobster roll as a summer promotion. It's the type of sandwich that
will draw adults who might bring in their children for Happy Meals
with much higher profit margins, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the taste of this is pretty good,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't be afraid of buying it.''
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Ale recall taps consumer fears
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Barbara Eachus heard about a recall of Bass Ale, she had
some reason to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Eachus, a retired British vice consul, had thrown a party July 1
when she served Bass Ale, but she wasn't sure whether the bottles
she bought were among the 7,000 cases of 12-ounce bottles that were
recalled. But if they turned out to be, she worried, what about the
health risks?
</P>
<P>
   The brief Reuters wire story that ran in the Globe Wednesday
said simply that recalled bottles contained a ``chemical coolant,''
along with the ale.
</P>
<P>
   We made some phone calls and have been able to put her fears to
rest. First of all, the 7,000 cases of 12-ounce bottles that were
recalled July 14 were sold in six-packs and contained these
production codes on the bottom left of the front label: 22D8, 25E8,
1F8, 28D8, 8E8, 26E8 and 2F8.
</P>
<P>
   Eachus's bottles did not have those codes.
</P>
<P>
   As for anyone who did drink the recalled ale, the US distributor
of Bass Ale says there are no health risks, and state public health
officials here agree. Elaine Kruger, chief of environmental
toxicology at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said
the substance in the recalled ale, propylene glycol, is commonly
used as a food additive and is considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   Angus McKay, chief financial officer of Guinness Import Co., the
US importer of Bass Ale based in Stamford, Conn., said consumers
may detect contaminated bottles because propylene glycol makes the
ale taste terrible. He added that a mechanical failure in one of
the production lines caused some of the propylene glycol to seep
into the ale.
</P>
<P>
   McKay said that most of the recalled bottles were distributed in
the New York and Los Angeles areas, but that about 370 bottles were
distributed by a Boston company. He would not name the company.
</P>
<P>
   Upon reflection, Eachus said she shouldn't be surprised that her
Bass Ale bottles didn't cause any harm. ``I drank one of these
bottles, and I'm alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

   The Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group recently drew
attention to retailers' growing practice of charging customers a
restocking fee when they return an item, but as a couple of readers
pointed out, the consumer group failed to mention one major store
that is bucking that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. doesn't charge a restocking fee for any of
its goods, including computer equipment. But the good news at Sears
for consumers doesn't end there. Sears' 0 percent financing offer
is also superior to what most other retailers are offering.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City, for example, recently advertised a 0 percent deal
featuring no interest payments for six months. But the buyer was
required to make minimum monthly payments of 4 percent, or $20,
whichever was higher. And at the end of the six months, the buyer
had to pay the full price of the item or face interest charges
retroactive to the date of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, by contrast, requires no minimum monthly payments on its
0 percent financing plans, and at the end of the six-month period,
interest charges are imposed as if the purchase had just been made.
There are no retroactive interest charges.

IT'S NOT HOW FAST YOU SWIM, IT'S HOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes calories by stroke text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a hot summer day at the lake, and you're in the mood for
some exercise. A vigorous swim seems just the ticket to work off
all those hamburger-and-potato salad calories without working up a
sweat, and even though you're not a great swimmer, you're sure you
can make it to the other side of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   But which stroke, you wonder, will give you the best workout?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a stroke of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have good swim skills, you shouldn't be doing
it,'' says Karen Leonard, national director of SwimAmerica, the
learn-to-swim program of the American Swim Coaches Association.
``If you took five swimming lessons when you were eight and now
you're 48, it's probably not very realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're a regular exerciser and consider yourself fit,
it's probably best to forget about swimming to the far shore.
Because technique is such a big factor, the performance of
world-class swimmers is 70 percent a matter of stroke efficiency
and only 30 percent due to fitness, says Terry Laughlin, founder
and director of Total Immersion Swimming in New Paltz, N.Y. For the
less-skilled, the ratio is closer to 90-10.
</P>
<P>
   Your three trips a week to the gym will only get you so far in
the water, and almost certainly not far enough: Even if you don't
swallow half the lake trying to breathe, your choppy crawl will
exhaust you in minutes and turn your workout into a slow, deflating
dogpaddle back to the pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never get the aerobic benefits of swimming,'' explains
Jane Katz, an aquatics teacher and author, ``because they're
exhausted and they quit.''
</P>
<P>
   If, however, you're a strong enough (we won't say good enough,
because that goes back to technique, and we're assuming you don't
have much) swimmer to stay afloat, a session of backstroke,
breaststroke or crawl can definitely give you what you're looking
for if you stay safely close to shore. You may not be fluid, but
all that extra flailing around against the resistance of the water
brings its share of fitness benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Says Glenn Mills, senior coach for Total Immersion Swimming,
which runs swim clinics across the country: ``People get into the
water and struggle so much that bad swimmers tend to get a better
workout than good swimmers.''
</P>
<P>
   For a good workout, he advises that you pick a starting spot,
swim 20 strokes, turn around, and try to return in fewer than 20
strokes. That teaches you to become more streamlined and efficient.
``If you just try to go faster all the time, that's when you just
start to struggle and thrash around in the water,'' says Mills, a
member of the 1980 US Olympic team. Rest for 30 seconds, then
repeat. When that feels comfortable, try going 30 strokes before
returning in fewer than 30.
</P>
<P>
   A slow crawl (which produces a heart rate that keeps you in the
best fat-burning zone and actually burns more calories than a fast
crawl) and the backstroke are tied in calorie-burning potential at
780 an hour for a 170-pound man. But beginners struggling with
breathing techniques might prefer the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the recreational swimmer getting into a lake, the most
important thing they can acquire is confidence,'' says Mills, ``and
confidence means being able to breathe whenever you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The sidestroke also makes it easy to breathe because your head
is always out of the water, but it offers the least cardiovascular
workout. Its long glide phase is designed to keep the heart rate
down while performing life-saving tasks or swimming long distances.
An especially vigorous sidestroke might burn 540 calories an hour,
according to some estimates, but one respected coach doubts that
many recreational swimmers could push themselves above 300 an hour
_ akin to a moderate walking pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sidestroke is fine for everyone who doesn't care about
burning many calories but would simply enjoy a relaxing workout,''
says Alex Primilsky, who formerly coached Olympic athletes in
Ukraine and now is head swim coach at the Charles River Park Health
and Swim Club in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   You can also do the breaststroke with your head up out of the
water. ``You're not supposed to,'' says Katz, ``but nobody's going
to shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't master any of the strokes well enough to raise your
heart rate to the point where you're breathing hard, you might want
to try getting your swim in without swimming at all. A run in
chest-high water could burn 600 calories an hour if you include
intervals in which you pick up the pace, says Katz, a professor of
health, physical education and athletics at the City University of
New York. For the best workout, try to stay in water that comes up
to your chest; any shallower and you start to lose its resistance,
any deeper and buoyancy begins to take over. Wearing water footwear
might not be a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   Another good water exercise, she says, is to tread water with
your legs pedaling as if you're on a bicycle and your arms tracing
underwater circles that form a figure 8. For the most
cardiovascular benefit, keep your body as high as possible in the
water. If you add swim fins, the extra resistance will give you an
exercise session worth 900 calories an hour, ``if you can do it for
an hour,'' says Katz, ``which you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're swimming or doing non-swimming water exercises,
it takes 20-30 minutes at a hard-breathing tempo, plus at least
five minutes of easy warmup and cooldown, for optimum
cardiovascular benefit.
</P>
<P>
   If you're frail or out of shape, walking in chest-high water
will work all your major muscle groups, and adding arm movements in
the water similar to swimming strokes will increase the overall
intensity. Don't lean forward and put your chest in the water,
though, or you'll begin to float and use less effort.
</P>
<P>
   Save that until after the workout.

 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A lot of ordinary folks quietly do heroic duty every day caring
for frail elders at home. But not without a cost, in terms of
stress and health problems, that researchers are just beginning to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Marjorie Innis. She's 70 and afflicted with an immune
disease called sarcoidosis that makes her short of breath, an
endocrine disorder that affects her metabolism, severe arthritis,
and high blood pressure. But she wouldn't think of putting her
blind, 103-year-old father, Victor Juba, in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The care I give him he wouldn't get there,'' says Innis, who
worked for 29 years in nursing homes and hospitals. Besides, she
adds, ``It's a pleasure taking care of my father. The kids that
don't help out, they don't know what they're missing. But some
days, you know, you feel bad. Sometimes I get a little discouraged.
With anybody it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Innis's understatement masks some real issues, says geriatrician
Sharon Levine of Boston Medical Center, who is unable to arrange
for occasional ``respite care'' to relieve Innis because her father
is an undocumented alien from Trinidad who does not qualify for
Medicaid. ``If her father is up at night, because he has mild
dementia, she doesn't sleep for two or three nights,'' Levine says.
``People like Marjorie are all going to heaven without stopping at
Go.''
</P>
<P>
   Depression, burnout, poor diet and neglect of their own health,
social isolation, anxiety, and guilt at taking an hour for
themselves, exasperation that can lead to elder abuse _ all are
amply documented among family caregivers, an unseen army of
conscripted ``health care workers'' who do vital work in one of
every four American families.
</P>
<P>
   The toll is nothing new, although it is beginning to get overdue
attention. What is new are studies documenting the physical effects
of the chronic stress that afflicts many family caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, scientists have found unmistakable evidence of
immune-system impairment among family caregivers. Their blood
pressure is also more likely to spike to higher levels in response
to stress.
</P>
<P>
   They more often have metabolic disorders marked by obesity and
insulin resistance, similar to the so-called Syndrome X that puts
people at risk of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   It all suggests that America and other rapidly aging societies
should ask themselves: Who cares for the caregivers? And what
happens when the caregiver gets sick?
</P>
<P>
   The implications reach far beyond individual families, Peter
Vitaliano of the University of Washington points out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family caregivers save society billions of dollars a year by
keeping loved ones in their homes,'' says Vitaliano, a research
psychologist at the forefront of documenting caregiver stress.
``With the baby boom generation increasing in age _ and we know
that Alzheimer's disease is correlated with age _ this is
incredibly scary: Who is going to take care of all these people
with dementia?''
</P>
<P>
   Alzheimer's and other dementias are only a piece of the current
and future care-giving problem, but the long-term, escalating
stress of caring for a dementia patient represents the extreme end
of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Studying caregivers of Alzheimer's patients, Vitaliano and his
coworkers tracked how their blood pressure changed under stress
compared to non-caregivers, a measure of heart disease and stroke
risk. To measure and induce stress, they asked subjects to talk for
five minutes about their spouses; those who made the greatest
number of critical comments were called high-stress.
</P>
<P>
   Among highly stressed caregivers with high blood pressure, blood
pressure shot up 28 points during this ``expressed emotion'' test,
but non-caregivers who were also hypertensive had a spike of only
21 points _ a significant difference.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, anti-hypertension drugs did not protect
caregivers against blood pressure spikes, while non-caregivers were
at least partially protected. ``If you're caregiver who is
hypertensive, you're wired to be at risk for problems,'' Vataliano
says, probably because some people produce higher levels of stress
hormones under conditions of chronic stress.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Washington group has also found intriguing
gender differences.
</P>
<P>
   Men _ who account for fewer than one family caregiver out of
three _ ``are much more at risk for deleterious physical reactions
from caregiving than women,'' Vitaliano reports, perhaps because
that role is unfamiliar to men. The harmful effects include
immune-system impairment and insulin resistance, a risk factor for
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen may offer one explanation for the
difference. &UR;  &LR; Post-menopausal caregivers on estrogen replacement
therapy are protected against some of the bad effects of stress,
the Washington state researchers have found. They are more likely
to have low levels of ``good'' HDL cholesterol, high levels of
blood fats called triglycerides, insulin resistance, and impaired
immune function.
</P>
<P>
   Both male and female caregivers are more prone to obesity than
non-caregivers, research shows, but among women the problem is
especially common among individuals who have high levels of what
psychologists call ``controlled anger,'' a state associated with
chronically elevated levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and
epinephrine.

 SAN FRANCISCO: ... into the script.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Enhancing the emotional bonding among the cast was the fact that
when a cast member was killed, that was the end of him for that
shoot. ``The guys were sent back home after we staged their death
scenes,'' Spielberg says, ``which of course heightened the sense of
loss. It was the most nervous and anxious time I've ever spent as a
filmmaker. At the end of filming, I would go drinking with these
guys. I never do that. I always go home to my family after
shooting. But here the bonding was that intense because of the
harrowing experience we had together. And we shot so fast that
there was no time for them to go back to their trailers between
setups and be civilians. They would just stretch out with full
packs on the grass and take catnaps.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no blue skies in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' only gray
ones. Spielberg had his cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, who also
did ``Schindler's List,'' extract color from the film to convey its
bleakness. But the blood _ and a lot of it is spilled _ is vivid
red. ``I know some will object to the horrific nature of what
happened, but I felt an obligation to make it as hard and as tough
as it was. I felt it would have been a dishonor to do it any less
tough,'' Spielberg says. ``I had a line I was not willing to cross.
Believe it or not, no matter how intense you feel the film is, I
could have gone much, much farther, but I chose not to.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Spielberg himself has ever come to battle, he
candidly admits, was when he drove to the Los Angeles airport to
claim the body of a friend killed in Vietnam and drive it to Forest
Lawn Cemetery for burial. ``That was a terrible, terrible
experience,'' he says, ``and my only real experience with loss in
any war. That war compelled everyone to be a little more honest and
truthful about war. Consciously, I couldn't make a serious war
movie without having learned about what war is like from
television. I was I-A. The only reason I got out of Vietnam was the
lottery. I watched other kids my age fighting. I was just waiting
for my induction letter. Then came this miracle, the lottery. I
drew number 295. Otherwise, I would have gone and served. I didn't
want to go. I didn't believe in the war. But I didn't have the
courage of my convictions to protest. I just sat there every day in
Jewish dread.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg's favorite war movie is Lewis Milestone's ``All Quiet
on the Western Front.'' He greatly admires William Wellman's
``Battleground,'' John Ford's ``They Were Expendable,'' and Samuel
Fuller's ``The Steel Helmet.'' But, he says, they were compromised
by propagandistic imperatives. ``I met Wellman. He said the studios
were censoring him left and right,'' Spielberg says. ``Fuller said
censorship drove him to Europe, to Paris, to live. He called them
sons of bitches.'' But wait. As head of film production at
DreamWorks, where he calls the shots, doesn't that make Spielberg
one of the SOBs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am, I am,'' he says, grinning ruefully, befitting his status
as a man who produces, develops, and greenlights films and TV shows
_ or not. He's an artist. But he's also management, and very good
at it, diversifying into video games, restaurants, and other
enterprises, which lately include philanthropy. Since ``Schindler's
List,'' he has subsidized the recording of oral histories of
Holocaust survivors. In low-profile fashion, he also heads the
Starlight Foundation, providing computer links to hospitalized
children. Spielberg has succeeded in reaching the filmmaker's holy
grail, defined when Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and Charlie
Chaplin founded United Artists so that they could control their own
films. How does Spielberg do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I compartmentalize my life,'' he says, ``so I don't look in
the mirror each morning and call myself a ... hypocrite. My
complete and utter priority is to my family. (Spielberg and his
wife, actress Kate Capshaw, have seven children.) My second
complete and utter devotion is as a director. Not a producer, not a
developer, not a studio head, a director. My third priority is
running DreamWorks with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before DreamWorks, I ran Amblin Entertainment for 14 years,
which was just like DreamWorks, except I didn't have 1,800 people,
I had about 57. At DreamWorks we'll only have 25 or 30 films in
development a year and we'll make 9 or 10. What I didn't want to do
was run a major studio and make 25 or 30 films a year, only seven
of which I'd be proud of and the rest you wonder why you got up in
the morning. One of the great things about calling your own shots
is that I can schedule my films for the summer, when my family can
be with me. That was why we shot `Saving Private Ryan' in Ireland
last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, every night I am home at 6. I'm up at 6:15 every
morning. I do carpool and make breakfast _ pancakes and waffles _
every morning of the school year. My first dropoff is my son at the
bus stop at 7. Then I feed the rest of the kids and take three more
to school at 8. It's fun, it's the best.'' Spielberg says he and
Capshaw and their children go to the movies because they prefer to
see them with audiences. He grimaces, looking pained, when it's
suggested that because of his wealth and influence he has only to
snap his fingers to exercise his will. He still feels pressure
every time he makes a movie, he says, still feels he has to prove
himself. ``All of my films, I feel like I'm making `Sugarland
Express,''' his first feature.
</P>
<P>
   Going to the movies with his family comes with an unpleasant new
wrinkle, Spielberg admits, ever since the arrest and conviction of
a stalker fixated on him. ``We look over our shoulders all the
time,'' he says. ``I never looked over my shoulder as much as I
have since the felonious stalking incidents _ plural, 'cause he
tried to get into our house three times. Now I feel like I'm one of
the bodyguards of my family. I'm always watchful for my kids. ... I
have security, more now than I ever had before, and I don't like
it. It rounds off the top of your quality of life because every
time you see your security man, it reminds you that you're exposed
and not living, you know, a totally free life.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Private Ryan'' has been launched, Spielberg, Capshaw,
and their family will take a vacation before Capshaw begins
shooting ``Love Letters'' in Massachusetts in September. Until
then, Spielberg plans to keep things as low-key, low-profile, and
domestic as possible, exchanging his filmmaker's hat for his dad's
hat. ``You know, my mom and dad didn't have any nannies. We have a
lot of help. We have three nannies for seven kids. My mom and dad
had nobody. My mom raised all four of us _ myself and three younger
sisters _ all by herself. My dad was a workaholic, he was always at
the office, sometimes on weekends. My mom still operates a kosher
restaurant, the Milky Way. She's the youngest 77-year-old I ever
saw. I'm trying to be as good a dad as my mom was to us. I come
from an old-fashioned domestic work ethic. I don't know how to be a
dad other than the way my mom was a mom.''

LITERARY BOOT CAMP FOR WRITERS TO HONE THIER SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Photo available through Wieck Photo Database)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORDEN STATE PARK, Wash. _ The beach beckons, with the sun
glistening off the crescent of sand that kisses Admiralty Inlet,
the saltwater beyond alternating between azure and aquamarine and
the imposing snow-capped cone of Mount Baker standing sentinel on
the horizon. Summer in the Northwest is seldom more dazzling than
this.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest concentration of people in this blessed place on
the edge of Port Townsend is not on the beach soaking up sunshine
or snatching up seashells. They are sitting in the cool darkness of
the old Joseph F. Wheeler Theater, where a solitary figure,
sometimes a man, sometimes a woman, stands at a simple lectern on
stage and talks about the delights and frights and disciplines of
the imagined word.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Port Townsend Writers' Conference, 25th anniversary
edition, where 140 people from Key West to Hawaii gather for 10
summer days and nights devoted to the intensive study of writing.
This is more intellectual boot camp than lazy days summer camp. The
intent and earnest attendees endure stark barracks quarters and
dreary mess-hall food that strongly recall the distant past of this
turn-of-the-century artillery post.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the writing life is not supposed to be some loll in a
hammock, so this conference's rigors may be a most appropriate
reflection of the devotions required in pursuit of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want it to be too easy,'' admits Jan Wesley, whose
tousled blond looks, weathered leather jacket, blue jeans and host
of silver bracelets bespeak her Los Angeles home and her work in
the film industry. ``I wanted a kick in the ass here, both in terms
of inspiration and to jump-start my own writing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wesley is a typical Port Townsend attendee. She is a woman in
her late 40s _ more than three quarters of the students here are
women, year in and year out, and most seem to be in their 40s.
Wesley has been willing to leave normal life and its obligations
behind in the hope that 10 days away and an investment of nearly
$1,000 will somehow provide what she needs to finally spark
progress toward her long-simmering dream of becoming a serious
writer.
</P>
<P>
   So Wesley sits in a morning class in the old post schoolhouse
and dutifully records the sage but witty advice of poet Marvin
Bell, who has written 13 well-praised books. Bell is a writers'
conference veteran whose graying bearded presence recalls the late
Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead. He is enumerating a baker's
dozen tips on being a successful writer but is also injecting so
many puckish asides that what he says delights almost as much as it
instructs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little things matter _ if you want to write about eternity,
don't write about eternity; write about your cup of coffee,'' Bell
advises. ``It's poetry, it's only poetry _ you have to have both
attitudes. Poetry comes out of life, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell is one of 11 faculty members at this summer's conference
(which ended July 19), put on by Centrum, the small but ambitious
non-profit arts organization headquartered at the fort.
</P>
<P>
   These 11 faculty members are writers of stature with books and
fellowships, prizes and professorships to their credit, which is
why the faculty has long been one of Port Townsend's big draws. The
list of writers who have taught here in the past reads like a
literary honor roll, including such notables as Raymond Carver,
Margaret Atwood, Kenneth Rexroth, Alice Walker, Carolyn Kizer, Tom
Robbins and Tobias Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ransom did not have such grand dreams a quarter century
ago, when Fort Worden was becoming a state park and conference
center after doing duty as a treatment center for juveniles. What
Ransom and two compatriots (Joe Wheeler, Donn Trethewey) were
trying to do then was find something that could use some of the
fort's facilities but not require the purchase of much additional
equipment, something preferably in the arts that might snare some
grant money.
</P>
<P>
   A dance festival and a writer's conference were what they came
up with, with the writer's conference closely modeled on what
Ransom had observed when he worked as a waiter two years before at
the Breadloaf Writers' Conference in Vermont. There was only a
handful of such conferences at the time. Port Townsend's later
emergence as one of this country's leading writing conferences,
amid what is now a glut, probably owes more to its early founding
than to its decidedly modest beginnings.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom, who served as the conference's director in its fledgling
years, has returned this summer as an instructor, part of a faculty
alumni contingent brought back for the anniversary by current
director Sam Hamill. Ransom has gone on to publish novels and
collections of poems, while also working as a teacher (now at The
Evergreen State College), just as many other writers must do to put
something in the checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Ransom remains a firm believer in the value of writing
conferences: ``One of the big boosts that comes from these
conferences is from seeing that ordinary people do this _ they
demystify writing. And I also believe that if you give me students
here for six hours a day for two weeks, I can give them what I can
teach in a quarter at school. Conferences are superb, especially
for busy people.''
</P>
<P>
   Their time at Port Townsend is busy as well. The crowded daily
schedule quickly becomes implanted in attendees' brains: 8 a.m.
breakfast; 9 a.m. lecture by an instructor; 10:30 a.m. class for
two hours; 12:30 lunch; early afternoon conferences with
instructors; 3 p.m. lecture by an instructor; 6 p.m. dinner; 7:30
p.m. reading by an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   A mixture of exhilaration and exhaustion flows through both
students and instructors, what with all the events and classes to
attend, the writing to complete or critically assess, the stories
to share in free moments at this sudden gathering of strangers with
like devotions.
</P>
<P>
   As Jane Hirshfield, a 45-year-old poet and instructor from Mill
Valley, Calif., puts it: ``To be in a community of people of shared
passions is a tremendous gift. It is exciting to be able to step
out of our own rooms once a year and find yourself among people who
get as excited about semicolons as you do. A lot of writers can go
all year on the energy that comes from that.''
</P>
<P>
   But that does not come easy. The central moment for many
students at the conference is submitting one's own writing for
critique by 15 or so fellow students and the instructor. This is
private and often intensely personal work suddenly turned naked
public entity, a time for flushed faces and churning stomachs or
worse. Tears are sometimes seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings you up against all your self-doubts and your
impossible standards and you have to confront those, day after
day,'' says Robyn Johnson of Stanwood, an aspiring poet whose
regular life revolves around the financial concerns of directing
the Everett Parks Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come here wanting to perform,'' observes Bruce
Elkin of Saltspring Island, B.C., who is attending for the second
time. ``But when they're criticized, they don't know how to take
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Discouragement can be profound. Elkin's previous instructor at
Port Townsend three years ago implied he ``should go into law
enforcement instead of writing,'' advice that the 55-year-old
consultant ultimately discarded, but not without much
soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, fellow students and instructors try to be
encouraging, especially since rejection is such a frequent
companion in the writer's trade. So constructive criticism usually
abounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling how many hours of hard writing may be
spawned when instructor Annick Smith of Missoula advises one
student, ``This is a powerful, promising start; this has all the
things to make you go on.'' Or when instructor William Kittredge _
who is team-teaching the non-fiction class with Smith, his longtime
partner _ advises another student, ``This gets at some deep-seated
and difficult stuff and I admire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Such encouraging words answer a deep craving for aspiring and
beginning writers, which is why many keep coming back to Port
Townsend. Fifteen percent of this year's attendees have been here
before, including Karen Seashore from Sandpoint, Idaho, a
51-year-old former teacher who has left her husband and two teens
at home to attend Port Townsend for the seventh straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no place to study like this in my town,'' Seashore
says. ``And I find what I want here _ the faculty is approachable
and I have 10 days without phones or family, amid the fellowship of
writers and the beauty of this place, the bluff, the water.''
</P>
<P>
   The considerable charms of Port Townsend and its Olympic
Peninsula surroundings do add to the allure of the writer's
conference. This town of 8,275 people manages to be arty but not
artificial, a working community with a paper mill and handsome
Victorian buildings in various states of renovation, an enviable
place that seems to be just isolated enough to avoid turning all
cutesy-touristy.
</P>
<P>
   Port Townsend, despite much growth and grumbling, is still not
Aspen or Carmel or La Jolla or even La Conner. But the city remains
well-known in the national arts community, in part because it is
home to Copper Canyon Press (also situated at the fort), which is
probably the country's pre-eminent publisher of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   But the writer's conference is only one of many nationally
recognized workshops and festivals put on by Centrum, a perennially
cash-strapped outfit that somehow manages to mount a non-stop
parade of events throughout the year, everything from classical
music to jazz to fiddle tunes to country blues, events that give
Port Townsend a rich cultural life that many cities 10 times its
size could envy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Centrum and Copper Canyon are both really well-known back
East,'' says Alison Swan, a 36-year-old editor and reviewer from
Saugatuck, Mich. ``And I think this conference has been fabulous. I
definitely feel recharged by being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the writer's conference are not without their
complaints. Many students wish there were more social activities
with the faculty, while the faculty members wish they had more time
when they were not buried under an avalanche of student papers to
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism, too, is sometimes voiced in private about Hamill, the
conference director, whose introductions of writers at the readings
and lectures are so brusque and insider-enigmatic that they border
on being rude. Some repeat attendees, both students and faculty,
say they yearn for the more civil days past when students
themselves introduced the writers, especially since all these
events are open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill is widely respected for being co-founder and editor at
Copper Canyon Press, as well as a much-praised poet and translator
of Chinese literature. But his sandpaper personality does rub many
people the wrong way, especially when he turns stern camp counselor
on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 150 of us here and I have had reports of yelling
problems between some of you and parties at 2 a.m.,'' Hamill
lectures at one point. ``If you can't be kind, be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Such moments are quickly forgotten, though, once the readings
begin and the magic of well-chosen words spills off the stage and
drifts out into the summer air.
</P>
<P>
   John Balaban, a 54-year-old poet from Miami, gives a stunning
reading to hushed silence and frequent bursts of applause. He reads
not only his own work, but also poems in Vietnamese and poems he
has translated from Vietnamese, including those from a decade of
work he has devoted to one obscure Vietnamese woman poet who lived
in the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam is the central theme of Balaban's work _ he was a
conscientious objector during the Vietnam War who served in Vietnam
as a field representative for the Committee of Responsibility to
Save War-Injured Children. His humanity courses through his poems,
a strong current of caring, and the audience is hanging on his
every word as Balaban builds to the close of his poem, ``Words for
My Daughter'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know the worst and be free from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know the worst and still find good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Day by day, as you play nearby or laugh
</P>
<P>
   ``with the ladies at Peoples Bank as we go around town
</P>
<P>
   ``and I find myself beaming like a fool,
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect I am here less for your protection
</P>
<P>
   ``than you are here for mine, as if you were sent
</P>
<P>
   ``to call me back into our helpless tribe.''

   WRITERS-WORKSHOP (Fort Worden State Park, Wash.) The beach
beckons, with the sun glistening off the crescent of sand that
kisses Admiralty Inlet, the saltwater beyond alternating between
azure and aquamarine and the imposing snow-capped cone of Mount
Baker standing sentinel on the horizon. Summer in the Northwest is
seldom more dazzling than this. But the largest concentration of
people in this blessed place on the edge of Port Townsend, Wash.,
is not on the beach soaking up sunshine or snatching up seashells.
They are sitting in the cool darkness of the old Joseph F. Wheeler
Theater, where a solitary figure, sometimes a man, sometimes a
woman, stands at a simple lectern on stage and talks about the
delights and frights and disciplines of the imagined word.

   TV-POV (Seattle) Dr. Maren Monsen had been working in the
emergency room just a few weeks when she first had to pronounce
someone dead. The training manual instructed her to check the
patient's breathing and pulse, but it was silent on matters of her
own heart.``It was the first time I had ever been alone in a room
with someone who was dead,'' she later reflected. ``In emergency
medicine we're taught to intervene and be in control. . .. For
doctors, death means failure.'' In time, the young
physician/filmmaker, who hails from Seattle, came to question the
assumption that life must be sustained at all cost. After seeing
patients linger in high-tech misery, she began to wonder: At what
point does life become a fate worse than death? Monsen takes
viewers along on a personal odyssey in her film, ``The Vanishing
Line,'' airing on PBS. The hour-long film is part of public
television's annual summer P.O.V. series, an award-winning showcase
for independent nonfiction films with a distinct point of view.

BOYS TO MEN: A DIFFICULT PATH IN TODAY'S SOCIETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Will boys continue to kill in our nation's schoolyards and
cafeterias? Will they keep turning guns on themselves in
ever-increasing numbers? Will depression among young males continue
to rise along with school dropout rates and the number of students
labeled learning-disabled?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a resounding yes, says William Pollack, author of
``Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons From the Myths of Boyhood,''
recently published by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack argues that boys need help in trying to understand what
it is to be a man today. The psyches of boys are both consciously
and unconsciously being split in half, he says, and that is
literally driving them crazy. Boys become torn between trying to
uphold society's traditions of what it means to be male and trying
to be modern, sensitive and able to talk about feelings. In other
words, he says, we want our boys to be New Age guys and still be
cool dudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys are in crisis,'' says Pollack, who has spent the past 20
years working with men and boys as codirector of the Center for Men
at McLean Hospital in Belmont. ``There is the national crisis of
school violence, homicides, drug use, suicide, date rape, and
school failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there is the other crisis _ what I call the silent
crisis. This crisis involves boys who look fine from the outside _
boys who look like the boy next door _ boys no one ever imagines
would kill anyone or harm themselves. But inside, these same boys
feel isolated, alone, and disconnected.''
</P>
<P>
   The link between these two crises, says Pollack, who is also on
the faculty of the Harvard Medical School, is that these silent and
confused boys are adhering to the old-boy code in a society that is
changing but one that remains unwavering in it's view of how to be
a real man _ strong, stoic, fearless, never showing pain or
grieving openly.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most traumatic experience for many young boys,
Pollack says, is their early separation from their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers, even many who question the process, are pushed by
fathers and society into cutting the apron strings that tie sons to
them. As early as age 5 or 6, boys are expected to be independent
in school, at camp, and at other activities. This causes many boys
to feel vulnerable, and that in turn makes them feel shame. So they
often retreat, withdraw, and mask their true feelings. With no
outlet, Pollack says, these emotions build, and some boys finally
snap, with tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, women said they wanted full rights in work
and sports and did not want to be in gender straitjackets
anymore,'' says Pollack, the father of a daughter. ``We began to
listen and hear girls' voices. This has been a very positive thing.
But there has been no similar revolution for boys. They have not
been given a new agenda to go along with the shift that women have
experienced. This puts boys under a lot of pressure. And instead of
dealing with this shift, trying to make it workable, parents have
handed it down to the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   When the second gender revolution does come, says Pollack, it
should produce a different kind of boy, and this will be good for
girls. Girls will be able at last to find boys who share their new
confidences and can communicate on a more emotional and personal
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to start listening to our boys,'' says Pollack,
who cites the cries for help preceding the string of suicides in
South Boston last summer. ``All those boys talked about feeling sad
within several weeks or up to the day they killed themselves. There
were concerns, but nobody did anything about it. It wasn't until
after the fourth kid killed himself that people woke up and began
to listen. When a boy expressed sadness or exhibited signs of
depression, he was hospitalized _ his warning signs were taken
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack says that while girls communicate verbally, boys express
their emotions through action rather than words. By understanding
the pattern of how boys deal with emotional pain or blows to
self-esteem, says Pollack, parents can understand how and when to
talk to boys about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``A boy in pain will initially retreat,'' says Pollack. ``He
wants to be silent and alone. It's what I call the timed silent
syndrome. But eventually, the boy will want to talk, and parents
have to recognize that moment. Sometimes the communication is
linked to action _ let's take a ride or let's go get some ice
cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Fathers tend to have a different kind of nurturing, says
Pollack. Both parents must understand the contrasting parenting
modes. Mothers should be allowed to hug and kiss their boys without
fathers admonishing them for ``making them into sissies.'' And
mothers have to understand that roughhousing between fathers and
sons is good because it helps boys to set limits, shows them how to
calm down after being wound up, and teaches them how to manage
their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack spends a great deal of time in his book refuting three
myths about boys. He calls the first the ``boys will be boys''
myth. The basis of that one is that testosterone controls a boy's
behavior, that testosterone makes boys horrible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testosterone does not determine a boy's behavior,'' says
Pollack. ``Boys are as much a product of nurture as they are of
nature. It is not testosterone that makes a boy pick up an AK-47.
Those six boys who killed (at their schools in recent months) did
so because of their upbringing, traumas in their lives, being
unable to talk about their feelings and express their vulnerability
and neediness.''
</P>
<P>
   The second myth is ``boys should be boys.'' Pollack says there
is no ``should'' to being a boy _ there are many ways to be
masculine. These can include sensitivity, a close maternal
attachment, and activities that are not traditionally considered
masculine.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things do not make a boy any less manly in
adulthood,'' says Pollack. ``Boys need not remain in the gender
straitjacket that society has put them in: tough, dominant,
macho.''
</P>
<P>
   The final myth is that ``boys are toxic,'' meaning that boys are
psychologically unaware and emotionally unsocialized creatures. But
boys, says Pollack, are just as caring as girls. Their patterns of
behavior may be different, but they ``are as capable of being
sensitive and empathic as girls,'' says Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern of Pollack's is the educational system. He says
boys are twice as likely as girls to be labeled as
learning-disabled, that they constitute up to two-thirds of our
special-education classes, and in some schools are 10 times more
likely to be diagnosed with serious emotional problems, such as
attention-deficit disorder. Recent studies show that not only is a
boy's self-esteem more fragile than a girl's and that a boy's
confidence as a learner is below that of a girl's, but a boy also
is more likely to be suspended from school or to drop out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys,'' says Pollack, ``are forced into passivity in schools.
In kindergarten they are taught to sit quietly in chairs. But young
boys need more time for physical action. They learn at a different
pace than girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past 20 years, we've learned how to teach girls. Now
we need to do the same for boys. And we've got to do it soon, or
there will be more tragedy. Let's not concentrate on whether young
schoolyard killers should be tried as adults. Let's concentrate on
the causes _ on education and making mental health services more
available for our boys.''

HOW THE ISRAELITES INVENTED OUR CIVILIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN DEZELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GIFTS OF THE JEWS 
How a Tribe of Desert Nomads Changed the Way Everyone Thinks and
Feels 
By Thomas Cahill. Nan A.Talese/Doubleday. 291 pp. $23.50. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Cahill has done for the Jews what he did for the Irish of
the Dark Ages in ``How the Irish Saved Civilization'': chosen from
among the extraordinary characters and marvelous episodes of a
people's history, arranged them artfully, and served them up on a
celebratory platter.
</P>
<P>
   In this second volume of his projected ``Hinges of History''
series, Cahill credits the Jews not just with saving Western
civilization, but inventing it _ at least what's worthwhile about
it. The ancient Israelites gave the world monotheism; a sense of
history and destiny; and the concepts of individuality and justice.
Absent the latter, such seminal documents as the Declaration of
Independence would never have existed, Cahill argues. ``There is no
way that it could ever have been `self-evident that all men are
created equal' without the intervention of the Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill recounts the early history of the Israelites as told in
the first five books of the Bible, beginning with the story of
Abraham, who followed God's directive to ``go forth'' from Sumer.
At the outset of his journey, Abraham was a polytheist ``a believer
in many (and conflicting) gods and godlets _ bad tempered forces of
nature and the cosmos who could be temporarily appeased by just the
right rites and rigamarole.'' By the time he makes his way to the
mountaintop to sacrifice his beloved son, Isaac, he has come to
understand that the voice that speaks to him is that of a singular,
all-powerful, unknowable presence _ the monotheistic god of Western
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``wayyelekh Avram'' (Abraham went) comprises ``two of
the boldest words in all of literature,'' the author contends.
Abraham's sojourn to an unknown destination marks a radical break
with a civilization that considered life random and cyclical. His
quest is a recognition of personal destiny _ that ``we are not
doomed, not bound to some predetermined fate; we are free.'' Later,
when Moses leads the enslaved Israelites out of Egypt, he acts with
a sense of ``corporate'' destiny; that of the people of Israel.
``Taken together, these two great escapes give us an entirely new
sense of past and future _ the past as constitutive of the present;
the future as truly unknown.'' For the first time in human
consciousness, according to Cahill, history is real.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill's historic synthesis is lucid, eminently readable, and
often entertaining, but it is more than a vernacular retelling of
an ancient tale. A longtime director of religious publishing at
Doubleday, the author studied Jewish scripture, learned Hebrew, and
spent time in the Middle East desert before writing this book. He
exalts his ancient subjects; their hearts, minds, and experiences
resonate in his compelling contemporary narrative.
</P>
<P>
   We are there among the ``motley band of escaped slaves''; the
``dusty ones,'' the idol worshipers who trudged with Moses through
the Sinai. We are awed by the power of what is inscribed on the
tablets Moses carries down from the mountaintop. The Ten
Commandments, which the Bible describes as ``Ten Words,'' may well
have been ``utterly primitive, basic injunctions on the order of
No-kill,' `No-steal,' `No-lie' ... memorizable by even the simplest
nomad, his ten fingers a constant reminder of their centrality in
his life,'' Cahill tells us. Viscerally, we understand.
</P>
<P>
   The commandments, a ``code of codes,'' rules that ``require no
justification,'' remain ``reasonable, necessary, even unalterable
presents'' to this day, he contends. The Fifth Commandment, ``Thou
Shalt Not Kill,'' has been scrutinized, and debated throughout
history. ``But whether you are president of the joint Chiefs or of
the Fellowship of Reconciliation, a supporter of Right to Life or
of Naral, Jesse Helms or Helen Prejean, you would hardly urge the
scrapping or suppression of this commandment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cahill's rhetorical flourish is not unlike that of an erudite,
showman-like academic _ the popular college professor who draws
capacity crowds to lectures illuminating obscure or time-worn
topics. He can be hyperbolic and glib. Even readers wholly
sympathetic to his fundamental premise may have difficulty buying
his argument that ``we can hardly get up in the morning or cross
the street without being Jewish.'' And, surely, not all of the
legacies of other ancient civilizations have disappeared into the
mists of time, as Cahill suggests. Consider, for example, the
Greeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Cahill's clearly voiced, jubilant song of praise to
the gifts of the Jews is itself a gift _ a splendid story, well
told.

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Matt Damon's body is in flux again.
</P>
<P>
   A string bean for one role, a slab of beef for the next, Damon
is bordering on gaunt for ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' the movie he
is shooting this summer. Even so, he wants to drop another 5
pounds. That would put him 25 pounds under the stocky soldier he
plays in the World War II gorefest ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which
opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks, who stars with Damon in the Steven Spielberg movie,
has suggested boxing to drop the pounds, but Damon is worried about
pumped-up pecs, since Mr. Ripley is more gentleman than Army man.
So he's sticking to a regimen that has worked before: a
1,200-calorie-a-day diet, with an hour of sweating on the
Stairmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Still, putting on the pounds and taking them off are a snap
compared with the vicissitudes of fame, which has finally hit after
a dozen or so movies. Damon finds star worship both bewildering and
hilarious, especially some of the freebies that come his way these
days. For instance, to thank him for promoting ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' DreamWorks Inc., the studio that made the movie, sent him a
wicker basket crammed with skin-care products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still kind of a one-bar-of-soap guy,'' Damon says,
laughing as he reads the labels on shampoo, sunscreen, and
everything in between. ``That's a good way to promote a war film:
Everyone gets a basket of moisturizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon's well-scrubbed, all-American look serves him well in his
second stint as a soldier and stand-up son from Iowa farm country.
(He previously played an addicted Gulf War veteran in ``Courage
Under Fire.'') It serves him well in real life, too. Despite the
floppy hair, familiar from ``Good Will Hunting,'' and the wide
white smile, which can give way on-screen to a serious scowl, Damon
doesn't stand out instantly in a room. For starters, he's smaller
than expected. Mostly, though, he's happy to go unnoticed, a
decidedly un-Hollywood attitude that he understands may be almost
as difficult to maintain as actual anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame doesn't help you as an actor at all,'' Damon says. ``OK,
it does help you get the next part, which is a big part of being an
actor. But in creating any kind of role, it's like any knowledge I
had up until I was 27 is all the knowledge of human behavior I'll
ever have. It's starting to feel like if I walk into a room, my
presence might slightly change the behavior of the people I want to
watch. I can't be a fly on the wall anymore, which is a really big
part of the puzzle, observing people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, however, Damon is the one being observed. He is, after
all, Hollywood's young man of the moment. That means he is
surrounded by, as he puts it, ``smoke and mirrors'' during movie
tours where people with headsets and walkie-talkies track his every
movement and helpful publicists ask whether he wants the cakes
removed from his hotel suite rather than risk ruining his diet for
``The Talented Mr. Ripley.'' It also means that while he doesn't
appear on-screen until the final third of the nearly three-hour
``Saving Private Ryan,'' he commands his own round table for press
interviews while the other actors (except Hanks) double up for
theirs. Then again, Damon is Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of his newfound clout appears to impress Damon, though
he acknowledges that it can cow other people, particularly
strangers. After he shared an Academy Award for writing ``Good Will
Hunting'' with best friend Ben Affleck, and earned a nomination for
his acting in their movie about life in South Boston, his opinion
suddenly matters in Hollywood, even when it shouldn't. He says he
doesn't want to be cited as an expert on anything, that he doesn't
want to become one of those guys who pontificate on important
issues of the day just because someone sticks a microphone in his
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really making an effort,'' he says. ``The model I look at
is in the mid-'80s, when Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson were
at the height of their fame, the two biggest guys in the world, and
Michael Jackson couldn't leave the house and you could bump into
Bruce Springsteen at the bar and shoot the (breeze) with him.
Hopefully there's that option.''
</P>
<P>
   But Damon, at 27, already has been at the Hollywood game long
enough to understand how it works. He's gaped at stars and
understands being gaped at. He understands that people repeat what
he says just because his face is on movie billboards _ because he
was guilty of the same behavior when he was starting out. His words
have weight now, whether he wants them to or not. With an
embarrassed shrug, he recalls telling his family everything Denzel
Washington said to him while the two were shooting ``Courage Under
Fire.'' Robin Williams, who won an Oscar for ``Good Will Hunting,''
got the same treatment. Now it's Damon's turn, and he's getting his
comeuppance. He knows stories are being told about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be on the other end of it can really hinder your
development, and it probably has and it probably will more, so I
have to be vigilant about trying not to let that happen,'' says
Damon, adding that his mother worries about ``my own development as
a person _ that I'm not totally losing it because there's a lot of
unrealistic projection that goes on with strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously Damon, comfortable enough with his sudden star status
to forgo the suit coat from early in his career and wear a black
baseball cap to a press meet-and-greet, isn't easygoing about
everything.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he worries about his privacy, since he was boyishly
upfront about loving actress Minnie Driver on camera and off until
he realized that the press was even more eager to cover their
breakup. Damon doesn't discuss his private life anymore, and
doesn't once mention Winona Ryder, the best friend of Affleck's
girlfriend, Gwyneth Paltrow, and the woman he is supposed to be
seeing in the rare moments he is in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the hard way because I was raised to be very open
about feelings and what was going on,'' Damon says. ``My biggest
fear was to be guarded. That was always a bad sign that you weren't
working out whatever issues you had. That's a huge lifestyle
adjustment for me, to not just tell anybody what's going on with my
life. ... Suddenly everyone's gossiping about you. It's just the
glare of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon isn't complaining, though. He's too well-mannered for
that. (``People are really nice,'' he quickly adds. ``It's not a
hardship.'') It also helps that he also kept the same friends from
before anyone knew his name and has a built-in sounding board in
his best pal, Affleck.
</P>
<P>
   His buddy's own success _ Damon says Affleck wins the big-budget
summer sweepstakes because he got his own action figure for
``Armageddon'' _ helps keep Damon's in perspective. The two shared
a place in Somerville before Damon got the starring role in last
year's ``The Rainmaker''; then they lived together in LA. Now, with
back-to-back-to-back films taking him to Memphis, San Francisco,
Boston, New York, Pittsburgh, and more than a few cities in
between, Damon is homeless, living in hotels and short-term rentals
while his stuff is stored in his mother's basement in Cambridge.
But Affleck, his costar again in the upcoming ``Dogma,'' plans to
join him in Italy, where ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' is filming
this summer and where they hope to get some writing done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely it would be harder to go through this without
Ben,'' Damon says. ``To see it happen to him makes it more real,
too. It's great to be able to talk to him about what's going on
because so much of it is weird and trippy and a little unhealthy
and creepy.''
</P>
<P>
   Damon says he hopes he learned some lessons in humility from
Hanks while they waited in the trenches for Spielberg to get camera
angles and the lighting just right. Damon _ repeating another
star's stories again _ says Hanks talked about the roles he'd
passed on, movies that went on to make millions, and how he had
known he wasn't right for them. Instead, he went with his gut, had
to feel it in his heart. Fame aside, that's how Damon says he wants
to build both his career and his life in the limelight.

ROGER DALTREY WITH STRINGS: IT'S STILL ROCK 'N' ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' says Roger Daltrey _ now being earlier this
month, and Daltrey being in Denver at the time _ ``I am at the top
of a very tall diving board, about to leap into a tank that is
about 2 foot deep, and it's flaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Daltrey, the once and future (?) singer of the Who, is on a romp
through Metaphor Land. ``If I can jump through flaming hoops, do
three triple-somersaults, or whatever ...''
</P>
<P>
   He's not really joining the circus, but he is rolling the dice
with the British Rock Symphony, a 60-piece group (classically
trained, most of them 20-somethings), the 15-member New York Boys
Choir, and a six-piece rock band. Oh yeah, there's a laser show,
too. The whole aggregation, on a 28-date US tour, will play music
from the Who, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, and
Pink Floyd. Classic rock, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Daltrey knows what you might be thinking: Symphonies and rock
'n' roll often mix like oil and water. Classical fans think it's
slumming; rock fans think it's pretentious. Daltrey was the rock
guy back in 1973 when Lou Adler commissioned the London Symphony
Orchestra to do the Who's ``Tommy.'' ``It was all right for the
time,'' says Daltrey. ``I mean, it didn't try to be `rocky.' It was
the first time I had ever sung with an orchestra. The only way I
can give you an analogy of what it feels like is that a rock 'n'
roll band is like lying on a bed of nails when you're onstage, and
with this orchestra, it was like sitting on an old soft sofa.''
</P>
<P>
   This show comprises five suites _ a Love Suite, a Universe
Suite, a Celebration Suite, a Rebellion Suite, and a Peace Suite.
Daltrey, one of six vocalists, performs eight to 10 songs.
</P>
<P>
   He knows what kinds of slings and arrows to expect if it fails:
He'll be labeled pompous, overblown, misguided.
</P>
<P>
   Daltrey, though, is asking you to trust him on this one. ``This
one is very much a bed of nails,'' he says. ``When it kicks, it
kicks. It really is rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Why trust him? You might be remembering a few not-so-special
Daltrey solo albums or maybe a few episodes of ``Highlander,'' the
TV show in which he starred. You may shudder at the Hollywood
Reporter's review noting it was ``nostalgic fun for baby-boomers.''
(Is that what rock has become?)
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _He loathes the work of Andrew Lloyd Webber and hopes some of
the young musicians on this tour become composers and ``erase''
Lloyd Webber's ditties from our memories.
</P>
<P>
   _``I still hate schlock music,'' Daltrey says. ``I love Tony
Bennett _ when he does the old standards you hear them properly.
They're as great as they ever were. But if you hear them badly,
it's schmaltz, and I hate that. I hate it as much as I ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   _Four years ago, he toured in a ``Roger Daltrey Sings the Songs
of Pete Townshend and the Who'' show that bombed at the box office,
but was a tremendous concert. Then there was the Who's
``Quadrophenia'' tour, which was a rollicking success, commercially
and artistically.
</P>
<P>
   Says conductor-pianist Keith Levenson of the audience for this
production, ``We want to take away all their preconceived notions.
I don't think this sounds like a symphonic rock show, I think it
sounds like a rock show with an orchestra.'' Levenson has worked on
other stage shows such as ``Daltrey Sings Towns-hend'' and
Broadway's ``Dreamgirls'' and ``Chess.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, Daltrey admits, a case of ``joining someone else's
show.'' David Fishof _ the man behind Ringo Starr's All-Starr Band
tours, the Monkees reunion tour, the ``Dirty Dancing'' tour, and
others _ put the package together before he signed up the star
vocalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to sing,'' says Daltrey, 54, who's always defined
himself as a working musician. ``And as Pete (Townshend) is writing
his memoirs at the moment ... but we're talking regularly and you
never know. If he starts writing good material, something might
happen in the future. But if I give (singing) up for any length of
time, it will go. That's one reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another is that these young people I'm taking out on the road,
these music students and this housing-project choir, have the
opportunity to see America, when some of the kids from the projects
haven't even been on an airplane. The musicians, they come up to me
and say, `We're playing an instrument we love and we're playing the
music we like, at last.' What could be better? Who knows where it
will end up?
</P>
<P>
   ``And, plus, I'm getting well paid. Everyone needs to earn a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the classical musicians, Levenson says, ``They're finding out
there's much more inside this music than they ever thought there
was. Classically trained students are always told to stay away from
rock, but if the orchestration is good enough _ I mean, there's
more difficult playing in (Led Zeppelin's) `Kashmir' than in a Bach
invention. It can be quite a challenge, becoming part of a huge
rock band.''
</P>
<P>
   Daltrey says the musicians have been working hard on the show.
He acknowledges that his voice isn't quite what it was. ``It's
harder to get to the real high notes,'' he says. ``But considering
how much pounding it's had for so long, it's amazing I can even
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the material, he's approaching it by ``trying to do them
as though they're my songs. Obviously, I've got to start from the
original. They will develop on the road, I'm sure, as you get more
comfortable with them.'' He's still not comfortable with ``My
Generation'' _ ``too hokey ... We'll solve the problem or we'll cut
it out. We can all fall flat. If the show's a dud, the show's a
dud. But if it's a great show, it's a great show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've done is a gamble,'' says producer David
Fishof, 41. ``You take some of the gamble away when you add a star
to it, but it's still a big gamble. It's something I've always
wanted to do. I got the idea from traveling with Ringo. We've done
four tours, and every musician always says `Can we do a Beatles
tune?' I said `People want to hear this stuff, sung by other
people.' I always wanted to hear it symphonically with a rock
band.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishof, a Brockton native who works in New York, says the
British Rock Symphony is his biggest production. When Daltrey
signed on, Fish-of says the singer told him, ```It can't be
schmaltzy.' I totally agreed with him. It's got to be totally rock
'n' roll. We tweaked it and tweaked it. If you love symphonic
music, or if you love rock 'n' roll, all your guitar licks and
violins are there. You can fill every hole of every song. (The
symphony members) are recent graduates of the Royal Acamedy in
London _ incredible musicians who have the energy to knock out
these rock 'n' roll tours. It's not like the Moody Blues hiring a
local orchestra. You will notice a difference. Roger is like their
father and Keith is the den mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To hear strings play 32 bars of `Penny Lane,''' adds Levenson,
``there's not necessarily a schmaltz factor if it's not played
schmaltzy. It's an attitude more than anything else. I could play
you `Won't Get Fooled Again' angry or schmaltzy. It's what I bring
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   And a set list? Well, the show lasts about 2 1/2 hours and may
include: the Beatles' ``Norwegian Wood,'' ``Penny Lane,'' ``As My
Guitar Gently Weeps,'' ``With a Little Help From My Friends,''
``Let It Be,'' and ``Hey Jude''; the Who's ``5:15,'' ``Who Are
You,'' ``You Better, You Bet,'' ``Pinball Wizard,'' ``See Me, Feel
Me,'' ``Love Reign O'er Me,'' ``Won't Get Fooled Again,'' ``Baba
O'Riley,'' ``Behind Blue Eyes,'' and ``I Can See for Miles''; Led
Zeppelin's ``Kashmir,'' ``Whole Lotta Love,'' ``Stairway to
Heaven''; the Rolling Stones' ``You Can't Always Get What You
Want,'' ``Jump-in' Jack Flash,'' ``Street Fighting Man,'' and
``Ruby Tuesday''; Pink Floyd's ``Comfortably Numb,'' ``Money,'' and
``Another Brick in the Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Levenson, 38, who was interviewed after the fourth show, said,
``It's getting better and better. We've been playing with the order
of the show and how we build it. Adding a star as big as Roger has
been wonderful and has created the situation of lining up the show
so they get enough of him at the right time, enough Beatles ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a very intricate crossword puzzle,'' says Fishof.
</P>
<P>
   The Townshend-penned Who material, Daltrey says, has ``an
in-built energy within the way Towns-hend wrote. That was clear
with the `Quadrophenia' tour of last year. I mean, we weren't all
jumping as high, Pete wasn't playing electric guitar all the way
through, but when you listened to the music _ which is what I
always wanted to be: a musician _ that energy was exactly the same
as the day we first performed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' adds Daltrey, ``I think, what have I got to prove
anymore? I can't be in the best rock 'n' roll band in the world. At
my age, rock 'n' roll is a different experience. The music you made
then is just as good, but when you play it now, it's just as good
in a different way. You can't pretend it's the same.''

   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``The Education of Little Tree''  &LR; _ This is a
great little family film about a Cherokee orphan forced to make his
way in the world too soon. The cross-cultural message _ as the boy

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Spirit of Mickey''  &LR; _ The collection of Mickey Mouse
material includes bits from dozens of the royal rodent's films, and
clearly establishes him as the figure most responsible for the
Disney empire. The tape is bright, cheery, and, ultimately, a bit
boring. Unlike Donald Duck, whose temperamental personality lends
itself to drama, Mickey's too good for his own good.

   &UR; ``Great Expectations''  &LR; _ The passion to update classic stories

 &HT;    WITH BUDGET CUTS, COAST GUARD MUST TIGHTEN BELT AGAIN
 &HT;    Corrects figure in 3rd graf to $71 million.
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 26.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doing more with less has become a mantra at the
208-year-old Coast Guard, and next year's budget may bring little
relief.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton requested about $4 billion this year for the
agency, which is burdened with aging equipment and a work force
that has shrunk nearly 10 percent since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   While many members of Congress decried the administration's
request as too low - especially the amount for drug interdiction
efforts - a House Appropriations subcommittee has recommended
budgeting $80 million less than the administration's request. The
cuts came in a number of categories, the biggest of them $71
million for operating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Jack O'Dell, spokesman for the Coast Guard, said that while
budget negotiations still have a long way to go, the agency could
be reaching a critical point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can live with the budget as it was recommended,'' he said.
But if any more cuts are made, he said, ``then we face some major
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dell echoes a growing fear inside and outside the Coast Guard
that budget constraints will translate into reduced services. The
agency is responsible for rescuing stranded boaters, cleaning up
oil spills, and enforcing fishing, drug and immigration laws on the
high seas.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the General Accounting Office, Congress's investigatory
arm, found that the Coast Guard has assumed increased
responsibilities over the past five years while shrinking its work
force and operating with a budget that has risen about 1 percent a
year after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to deal with budget constraints, the Coast Guard
has decommissioned old aircraft and cutters and cut 4,000 jobs in
four years. In addition, it has reduced staffing levels at 20 of
285 stations, although Congress opposed a 1995 proposal to close 23
stations. The Coast Guard Reserve has dipped to about 7,400
members.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking budgets have meant more work for the Coast Guard's
remaining 34,000 men and women and have increased pressures on
local and state marine agencies.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dell said the Coast Guard has run out of ways to stretch its
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing left,'' he said. More budget cuts would leave
the agency no choice but to curtail services, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress have come to the aid of the agency, but
mostly to support the fight against illegal drugs _ a politically
potent issue.
</P>
<P>
   House members earlier this year lobbied to increase the Coast
Guard budget by $233 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Wayne Gilchrest, R-Md., who chaired hearings on the matter,
said President Clinton's plan to cut the Coast Guard's drug
interdiction budget made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am at a loss to understand how the administration could
significantly cut funding for a program that has worked so well and
had such positive results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest House Appropriations plan increases the Coast Guard
budget for drug-fighting activities to $406 million, about $74
million more than requested by the administration and about $34
million more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, efforts were also made to increase the Coast
Guard budget. An amendment to a failed tobacco measure would have
doubled the Coast Guard and Customs Service's budgets for anti-drug
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R.-Ga., who introduced the amendment, will
likely try to attach it to another measure or introduce it on its
own later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Final decisions on the Coast Guard budget will likely be made by
September, O'Dell said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Appropriations subcommittee on transportation's
recommendations for the 1999 Coast Guard budget include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $2.7 billion for general operating expenses
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $21 million for environmental compliance and restoration.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $684 million for retirement pay.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $69 million for reserve training.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  $12 million for research and development.

SEARCHING FOR TRUTH BY THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the half-year since his film ``Pi'' had its first splashy
screening at the Sundance Film Festival, Darren Aronofsky has heard
his full-length-feature debut compared with works by Hitchcock and
Kafka, and mentioned in the same company as such cult classics as
John Frankenheimer's ``The Manchurian Candidate'' and David Lynch's
``Eraserhead.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Aronofsky keeps the hype in check, boiling the
film down to a simple descriptive line: ``This is a film about God,
math, and bad-ass Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pi'' arrives in Boston Friday about 2 1/2 years shy of the
year 2001, but its lifeblood is a world awash in pre-millennial
tension. At its core is Max Cohen, a brilliant young mathematician
(played by Sean Gullette, a Newton native) obsessed with numbers.
He is immune to anything _ love, friendship _ that cannot be
calculated. He believes everything can be understood through
numbers, that every secret within the universe can be deciphered
through the hidden knowledge of numbers. When his computer produces
a 216-digit number for no apparent reason, Max garners the
attention of everyone from Wall Street speculators to Hasidic Jews
who believe that number may contain the true name of God.
</P>
<P>
   Aronofsky's self-described ``millennial fever'' has manifested
itself in this stark, disturbing film, which he both wrote and
directed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is asking why right now. `The Celestine Prophecy' and
`The Bible Code' are huge bestsellers, so something is going on,''
said Aronofsky, as he savored a cup of coffee during a recent visit
to Boston. ``People are waiting for the meteorite to hit the earth,
waiting for disaster and death and destruction. Or they're looking
for spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like the idea of trying to find God through numbers; I
like the idea of everything in the universe being represented by
numbers,'' he said. ``Numbers describe the world and the universe,
they describe distances and space and time and measurements. Maybe
if you took those numbers you can actually find the underlying
order beneath it all, and maybe that order is God.''
</P>
<P>
   For all its attention to the exactitude and science of numbers,
Aronofsky believes his film is about the ``search for
spirituality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Max is looking for meaning, looking for order. Everyone is
always questioning why we're here, what the meaning of life is, and
that's exactly what Max is doing. He's just doing it in his own
way,'' he said. ``That's why I think the film is relevant. Everyone
is wondering what the hell we're doing on this planet. Are we just
moss hanging on to a piece of dirt floating in some endless
universe, or is there some higher purpose going on?''
</P>
<P>
   Aronofsky has been fascinated by the spirituality of numbers
since he was in high school. There, he learned about Pythagoras,
the Greek scholar whose ideas about numbers and humankind earned a
cult following, a secret society of mathematicians. Pythagoras even
authored a failed gospel, the Golden Verse, about 500 years before
the birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think mathematicians are kind of cool, and I think they're
underrated,'' Aronofsky said. ``I'm not a math genius, but when the
movie was done I realized there are a lot of similarities between
Max Cohen and me. Everyone is searching for meaning, whether it's
in self-help books, yoga, working out, or late-night TV. A lot of
my films (short works made before `Pi') have had a repeated theme
about searching for meaning in an existential world.
</P>
<P>
   ``An old girlfriend pointed out to me that all my films were
about looking for God,'' he said. ``And then she dumped me.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sundance in January, the film received a standing ovation
from the 1,200 in attendance, a moment Aronofsky called ``the
greatest of my life.'' The film, which cost $60,000, was bought by
distributor Live Entertainment. Aronofsky was named best director
in the festival's dramatic section.
</P>
<P>
   At the festival, some began calling Aronofsky's film ``the
anti-`Good Will Hunting,''' he said. Like ``Pi,'' that
Oscar-winning film revolved around a mathematical genius, but the
comparisons stop there. ``Pi'' is not an easily accessible,
feel-good film, yet Aronofsky was wary of making a film mainstream
audiences would find too remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never want to lose an audience member. Ultimately, my job is
to entertain,'' he said. ``I'm not making movies for myself; I'm
making movies for audiences. Within that I need to find my
pleasure. The bottom line is it has to play for an audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Aronofsky, 29, didn't intend to be a filmmaker. At Harvard
(where he met Gullette), he studied social anthropology, eventually
graduating with a degree in general studies. But it was his
roommate, an animator, who sparked Aronofsky's interest in
filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would end up with a bunch of papers at the end of the year,
and he would end up with a movie. I was like, `Uh, there's
something wrong going on here,''' he said with a laugh. ``I'm sort
of a dilettante. I'm an OK artist, I'm an OK photographer, I'm an
OK writer. I'm not really good at any of them, but I'm OK, and
being a director pulls those skills together.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be said that Aronofsky's earliest film education came
at the local moviehouse in his native Brooklyn. As a kid, he spent
his fair share of time at the old 77-Cent Theater there. For 77
cents each, he and his parents could see two second-run features.
</P>
<P>
   The film that had the greatest impact was ``Saturday Night
Fever.'' Being from Brooklyn, Aronofsky found kinship on the screen
watching John Travolta play Tony Ma-nero, the Brooklyn kid who
finds himself on the flashing dance floor of a disco.
</P>
<P>
   ``That movie was so important in Brooklyn because it re-put
Brooklyn on the map,'' Aronofsky recalled. ``We were in elementary
school, and it affected everything we did. We all listened to
disco, we all wore Sergio Valentes and Jordache, and we would act
out the scenes. I love that stuff, it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Brooklyn's multiracial Coney Island _ the
world-famous Cyclone has a cameo in ``Pi'' _ Aronofsky wanted his
first film to reflect New York's diversity. He didn't want to make
another film with the whitewashed New York of Woody Allen or
television shows like ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were allowed to have Jews in the film, and not only Jews,
but bad-ass Jews. You don't often get to see that portrayal, and
that portrayal was very important to me,'' said Aronofsky, who
lives in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Jewish guys I grew up with in Brooklyn, there was no
difference between them, the Greek guys, the Italian guys, the
black guys. We were all part of hip-hop culture, we were all
dealing drugs, getting arrested, drinking, and doing graffiti,'' he
said. ``Making a New York film, it was very important to make a
multicultural picture. You don't get to see that, and that's the
New York I grew up in, and that's the New York I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Aronofsky is working on a film adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s
``Requiem for a Dream,'' which he describes as a ``hard-boiled,
twisted journey into the mind of addiction.'' He also is planning a
science-fiction film that he guarantees ``will be the most
terrifying film you've seen in the last 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Aronofsky's agenda does not include any
angst-laden films about 20-somethings, or anything that apes the
rhythms of Quentin Tarantino or Kevin Smith. He prefers prowling
the shadows of human existence and conflict, and he just doesn't
think he can find those in a frothy romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them and enjoy them, but that's not the right project
for me right now,'' he said. ``Right now, I'm dealing with some
stuff, and since I can't afford therapy, I have to deal with it in
some other way.''

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
!! 1/2 ``Broadway Damage''  A group of friends search for
meaningful relationships in New York while, of course, overlooking
obvious possibilities within their own circle. An occasionally
charming gay romantic comedy, not unlike its main characters _
pleasant, inoffensive, with absolutely nothing in its pretty little
head. (Unrated) (Renee Graham)
<TEXT>

   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; (FR) &LR; !!! &UR; 1/2 ``The Mask of Zorro''  &LR; The old Zorro, Anthony Hopkins,
teaches the new Zorro, Antonio Banderas, everything he needs to
know to rid 19th-century Mexico of post-colonial evil. This
splendid swashbuckler (actually filmed in Mexico) is the sexiest,
most acrobatic, most atmospheric ``Zorro'' in the long history of
the franchise, which began in 1920 with the exuberantly gymnastic
Douglas Fairbanks Sr. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! &UR; ``Marie Baie des Anges''  &LR; This is the film that the
controversial ``Kids'' tried and failed to be. In Manuel Pradal's
bold debut feature (featuring a cast of nonprofessional actors),
disillusioned and dangerous French youth wander aimlessly toward a
lethal end. (R) (Renee Graham)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; (FR) &LR; !!! &UR; ``There's Something About Mary''  &LR; Lowbrow gross-out humor
from bad-taste kings Peter and Bobby Farrelly (``Dumb and
Dumber''). But you won't be able to keep from laughing, especially
at Matt Dillon's sleazy gumshoe hired by smitten but consummately
gauche Ben Stiller to track down pretty Cameron Diaz, a magnet for
obsessives. There's scarcely a bodily function, especially the
unseemly ones, that doesn't make the final cut. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! &UR; ``Whatever''  &LR; Susan Skoog makes an impressive directorial debut
with this coming-of-age film set in 1980s New Jersey, but very much
in the here and now, especially when her ambitious protagonist,
terrified of discovering that she's ordinary, tries to get through
the tedious propect of spending the summer at home before going off
to art school in the fall. Lisa Weil, lips curled down so she won't
seem too eager or vulnerable, is a fresh, complex, endearing
heroine. (R)

MCDONALD'S LOBSTER IS TASTY, IF FROZEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ordinarily, we'd never think of ordering lobster at McDonald's,
but the restaurant chain's latest promotion made us curious.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's billboards feature a giant lobster roll overflowing
with succulent real lobster for less than four clams _ $3.99 before
tax, to be exact. That's a third of what most other restaurants
charge.
</P>
<P>
   And while anyone with a brain knows that food pictured in an ad
usually bears no resemblance to the food in real life, we had to
admit the billboard lobster roll looked pretty appetizing.
</P>
<P>
   What we found in real life was a lobster roll that didn't live
up to the size of its advertising counterpart, but otherwise was
reasonably satisfying. The bun wasn't toasted, which is the way we
like it, and the lobster wasn't the tastiest we've ever had. But
the lobster wasn't weighed down with mayonnaise and, as promised,
it was mostly knuckle and claw meat from real North American
lobsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot better than I thought it would be,'' said Jimmy
Doulos, the executive chef at Jimmy's Harborside in Boston and an
expert on lobster and how it is prepared. ``This is actually very
surprising. I figured it would be a white mass of mayonnaise with a
couple of pieces of celery and two little pieces of orange lobster
sticking out.''
</P>
<P>
   By our calculations, the McDonald's lobster roll has 2.5 ounces
of lobster meat, far less than the lobster rolls sold by most other
restaurants. Yet on a per-ounce basis the price is still
reasonable, at $1.59 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's Roast Beef &AMP; Seafood in Saugus sold us an $11.50 takeout
lobster roll with 7 ounces of meat, which works out to $1.64 an
ounce. Jimmy's Harborside, a full-service restaurant with a great
view, sells a lobster roll with 5 ounces of meat for $13.70, or
$2.74 an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's was tight-lipped about how it was able to sell its
lobster roll for so little. No one from the company, based in Oak
Brook, Ill., would talk with us, and its local public relations
firm would only send us a fact sheet with limited information.
</P>
<P>
   After taste-testing the McDonald's lobster roll for us at their
restaurant, Doulos and his sister Kim, who is vice president at
Jimmy's Harborside, said there was no question the McDonald's
lobster had been frozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's night and day, in terms of taste, with fresh versus
frozen,'' said Kim Doulos. She said frozen lobster doesn't taste as
sweet and also tends to be saltier.
</P>
<P>
   The public relations firm subsequently confirmed that McDonald's
buys frozen lobster for its sandwiches, although its fact sheet
referred only to the company's ``fresh lobster roll.'' An official
at the public relations firm said the reference to a fresh lobster
roll meant that the sandwiches were prepared on a daily basis at
each restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   By buying frozen lobster in bulk for its 300 restaurants in
Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, McDonald's
could buy it for as little as $13 a pound, Jimmy Doulos said. Each
pound would provide enough meat to make six sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Jimmy's pays about $26 a pound for its fresh
lobster meat. Jimmy's buys the more prized tail meat, in addition
to knuckles and claws, and serves lobster in big tasty chunks. We
felt that the Jimmy's and Kelly's lobster rolls were far superior
to the McDonald's roll, but then again they should be _ that's
their specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Doulos said she thinks McDonald's is smart to offer a
lobster roll as a summer promotion. It's the type of sandwich that
will draw adults who might bring in their children for Happy Meals
with much higher profit margins, she noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, the taste of this is pretty good,'' she said. ``I
wouldn't be afraid of buying it.''

Ale recall taps consumer fears
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Barbara Eachus heard about a recall of Bass Ale, she had
some reason to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Eachus, a retired British vice consul, had thrown a party July 1
when she served Bass Ale, but she wasn't sure whether the bottles
she bought were among the 7,000 cases of 12-ounce bottles that were
recalled. But if they turned out to be, she worried, what about the
health risks?
</P>
<P>
   The brief Reuters wire story that ran in the Globe Wednesday
said simply that recalled bottles contained a ``chemical coolant,''
along with the ale.
</P>
<P>
   We made some phone calls and have been able to put her fears to
rest. First of all, the 7,000 cases of 12-ounce bottles that were
recalled July 14 were sold in six-packs and contained these
production codes on the bottom left of the front label: 22D8, 25E8,
1F8, 28D8, 8E8, 26E8 and 2F8.
</P>
<P>
   Eachus's bottles did not have those codes.
</P>
<P>
   As for anyone who did drink the recalled ale, the US distributor
of Bass Ale says there are no health risks, and state public health
officials here agree. Elaine Kruger, chief of environmental
toxicology at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said
the substance in the recalled ale, propylene glycol, is commonly
used as a food additive and is considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   Angus McKay, chief financial officer of Guinness Import Co., the
US importer of Bass Ale based in Stamford, Conn., said consumers
may detect contaminated bottles because propylene glycol makes the
ale taste terrible. He added that a mechanical failure in one of
the production lines caused some of the propylene glycol to seep
into the ale.
</P>
<P>
   McKay said that most of the recalled bottles were distributed in
the New York and Los Angeles areas, but that about 370 bottles were
distributed by a Boston company. He would not name the company.
</P>
<P>
   Upon reflection, Eachus said she shouldn't be surprised that her
Bass Ale bottles didn't cause any harm. ``I drank one of these
bottles, and I'm alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
At Sears, it really is 0%
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group recently drew
attention to retailers' growing practice of charging customers a
restocking fee when they return an item, but as a couple of readers
pointed out, the consumer group failed to mention one major store
that is bucking that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. doesn't charge a restocking fee for any of
its goods, including computer equipment. But the good news at Sears
for consumers doesn't end there. Sears' 0 percent financing offer
is also superior to what most other retailers are offering.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City, for example, recently advertised a 0 percent deal
featuring no interest payments for six months. But the buyer was
required to make minimum monthly payments of 4 percent, or $20,
whichever was higher. And at the end of the six months, the buyer
had to pay the full price of the item or face interest charges
retroactive to the date of purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, by contrast, requires no minimum monthly payments on its
0 percent financing plans, and at the end of the six-month period,
interest charges are imposed as if the purchase had just been made.
There are no retroactive interest charges.

SBC SEES AMERITECH ACQUISITION AS DOOR TO THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SANFORD NOWLIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Edward E. Whitacre, the chief executive of SBC
Communications Inc., made clear his plans for building a global
powerhouse when he testified before a U.S. Senate panel on the
proposed merger of SBC and Ameritech Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our merger is a critical step toward removing the word
`regional' from the way SBC is described and giving this country a
global competitor,'' Whitacre bluntly told the Senate Judiciary
Committee's antitrust subcommittee in May.
</P>
<P>
   With the deal to acquire Chicago-based Ameritech, SBC appears
poised to emerge as one of the world's telecommunications powers,
due in large part to its growing overseas holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio-based company's $62 billion merger with
Chicago-based Ameritech _ the largest in telecom history _ is
awaiting federal regulatory approval. If it passes muster, the
combined companies would have operations in 24 countries, covering
much of Europe and pockets on every continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key arguments SBC has made for the merger is that,
in order to compete on a global scale, they need that additional
size and girth,'' said Jeffrey Kagan, president of Marietta,
Ga.-based Kagan Telecom Associates. ``That's a compelling
argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimate the value of Ameritech's overseas investments
at $7 billion to $10 billion, and SBC's at $7 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   Merging with Ameritech would represent a ``quantum leap'' for
SBC's international presence, said J. Cliff Eason, president of
SBC's international operations.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true in Europe, where SBC has investments in
only three countries and Ameritech is active in 15.
</P>
<P>
   While both companies have sizable overseas holdings, their
territories have little overlap. Switzerland and France are the
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger is approved, ``you end up with such a large
company that they would have the ability to do even more
international deals,'' said Barry Sine, a telecom analyst for
Toronto-based TD Securities Inc. ``SBC has been somewhat
conservative up to this point, but as a larger company, an
international start-up business would dilute their earnings less.''
</P>
<P>
   However, some analysts said SBC's digestion of Ameritech, which
could take up to a year to receive regulatory approval, could slow
its new foreign investment for a while as it builds a stronger
company in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything SBC has going on, it will be interesting to
see if they have the bench strength'' to deal with new overseas
investments,'' said Glenn James, an international telecom
specialist with Atlanta's Deloitte Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   SBC's first international investment came in 1990 when it joined
in a consortium with France Telecom and Mexico's Grupo Carso to buy
a stake in Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), Mexico's national phone
company, which was being privatized.
</P>
<P>
   Since SBC's initial investment in Telmex, the Mexican company
has invested $12 billion to modernize its networks, greatly
increased its number of cellular customers and improved its
customer service record.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex, which now faces open competition, has dropped its
waiting list for a new phone line to less than 30 days. In 1990, it
took two years for the monopoly to provide phone service to
customers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Eason, SBC has emulated elements of its first foray
in international telecom in subsequent overseas ventures.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is to seek an active role in its investments
whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   SBC, the parent of Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., serves as
Telmex's strategic consultant and has 30 managers in Mexico
overseeing operations. Likewise, when it bought an 18 percent stake
in Telkom South Africa, the country's national phone system, SBC
sent 50 managers to oversee operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can send money,'' Eason said of the hands-on approach.
``We're not an investment bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing partners carefully is another philosophy SBC developed
from its Telmex investment. Its Mexican partner, the diversified
Grupo Carso, brought valuable insight about the way Mexico's
business and government sectors work, Eason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our local partners add a lot of value to the deal,'' Eason
said. ``Grupo Carso has just been a textbook example of a perfect
partnership.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said SBC has shown exceptional savvy in choosing
partners for its overseas deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been a bit more cautious and a little bit more
deliberate than the other (regional Bells),'' Sine said. ``But
they've also been a little bit more creative in choosing partners,
which has paid off for them in places like Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   In Switzerland, SBC is teaming with six Swiss electric utilities
in diAx, a company that offers long-distance and cellular service.
</P>
<P>
   SBC brought its telecom expertise to the table. The utilities
were able to provide the access to rights-of-way and real estate
where the group could install its fiber-optic network.
</P>
<P>
   Although SBC has chosen its partners wisely, analysts said the
company, and the other regional Bells, will need to develop their
future international holdings in less of a scattershot manner.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the companies jumped at hot opportunities with
little regard to where on the globe they fell.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, SBC's overseas investments _ which include two in
the Far East, two in Latin America, three in Europe, one in the
Middle East and one in Africa _ look like they may have been chosen
by hurling a dart at a map.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our international strategy was we didn't have a strategy,''
Eason said. ``It was very opportunistic. We just followed the
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   That is changing. SBC is concentrating its efforts on finding
international investments that complement its existing operations,
Eason said. One such market is Brazil, a market that would
strengthen SBC's foothold in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be cheap,'' Eason said. ``I don't think you can
bargain shop in Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservative spending has been one of the hallmarks of SBC's
overseas investment. Eason said SBC has avoided the ``auction
mentality'' that has overtaken competitors such as BellSouth Corp.,
the regional Bell with the largest Latin American holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say BellSouth has a great Latin American strategy,''
Eason said. ``It's true, but they're paying out the gazoo for it.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eason said SBC also has its eye on the emerging telecom markets
of China and Africa, which so far have not attracted the attention
that Europe, Latin America and the ``tiger economies'' of the
Pacific Rim have.
</P>
<P>
   SBC is one of 14 partners investing in a $1.1 billion
fiber-optic cable being placed undersea between the United States
and China.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its year-old investment in South Africa, SBC
could take on further investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks there also have been indications that SBC may be
increasing its presence in South Korea, which is in the midst of a
recession. SBC officials declined comment on whether it plans to
further invest in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   However, analysts said the current economic turmoil in Southeast
Asia could allow SBC to make a low-cost purchase there as other
companies look to unload their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logic tells you if they like (South Korea) for the long term,
now may be a good time to buy,'' said Dave Otto, head of research
for St. Louis-based brokerage Edward Jones.

MANY SKEPTICAL JAPAN WILL ACCEPT A PAINFUL CURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.  R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Ever since voters angry over a slumped economy clobbered
Japan's ruling party in elections last week, pundits the world over
have prognosticated on how the defeat might force Tokyo to revamp
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Japan's economy has been in a rut for most of the
1990s, and few outsiders paid much attention. But ever since a
severe financial crisis struck much of Asia last summer, causing
currencies to tank, governments to fall, and millions across the
region to lose their jobs and savings, accusing eyes have turned on
Japan as the root of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   If the region's largest economy would restart its long-stalled
engine, the argument goes, it could drag the rest of Asia out of
the doldrums with it. But if a sputtering Japan continues to delay
the pain of economic overhaul, many analysts say, markets will
attack its currency and asset prices, sparking a domino collapse
across Asia _ and a world recession that could reach as far as Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the task ahead for whoever replaces outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at the end of this month critical, not
just for Japanese discomforted by their worst recession in 23
years, but for Asian neighbors suffering far worse _ hunger, mass
layoffs, and currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The larger questions for Japan's next leader are whether to
delay fundamental reforms to avoid suffering at home, and whether
to give in to overseas pressure to spend his way out of this slump
_ an approach that will balloon a deficit that is already the
biggest in the industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are asking Japan to get their economy up by throwing
money at it, but the real problem is the underlying corporate
structure is rotten to the core,'' said Craig Chudler, Japanese
equities strategist at Salomon Smith Barney. ``It's rather callous
and ignorant of other countries. ... If Japan had low levels of
debt, you could say, `pump the prime.' But now it's a question of
ruining Japan's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this possibly short-sighted approach is exactly
what Japan's friends are pushing for, hoping that a Japan that
imports and invests more abroad will boost neighbors and shrink its
sensitive trade surplus with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Southeast Asia and South Korea, which had to accept
bailout packages and are being forced by the International Monetary
Fund to restructure ailing economies, Japan has the largest
reserves in the world, one of the highest savings rates, and hardly
any overseas debt, giving it a cushion to put off needed overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies need to make grassroots changes, and people will
need to accept those changes and realize, `no pain, no gain.'... We
are going to have to experience hard times in order to recover,''
said Kenichi Enatsu, a business professor at Waseda University in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles began when Japan's high-flying economy, held up as
a model for America in the 1980s, hit a wall with the bursting of
the overheated ``bubble economy'' at the start of this decade.
Stock prices peaked here in 1989 with the Nikkei index around
40,000. Today, the Nikkei is below 17,000. The collapse of inflated
asset values and real estate prices this decade has reduced
personal and corporate wealth and also hit the banking sector with
a tsunami of unpaid loans _ more than half a trillion dollars
worth.
</P>
<P>
   The economy fell into recession at the end of last year and is
expected to contract this year. Tax increases last year squelched
demand, including for imported goods. That hurt Asia, since Japan
is the second-largest market after China for regional exports, and
China's largest export market worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Facing US pressure, Japan last month agreed to deregulate and
open several aspects of securities and construction markets, and to
eliminate laws that hinder foreign companies from establishing
major retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who say Japan owes it to Asia to take drastic
steps to lift the region out of its morass.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the bubble burst here, they did the same things across
Asia _ overlending, overborrowing, and overbuilding,'' said Ronald
Bevacqua, economist at Merrill Lynch Japan Ltd. ``It's no
coincidence that the Asian crisis began last year, 1 1/2 years
after the Japanese yen began to devalue and immediately after the
tax increases that sent this economy into recession.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone thinks Japan should be held responsible for
Asia's woes, since many regional economies brought problems on
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan didn't make'' former Indonesian leader ``Suharto's
family line their pockets, or make Malaysia build the tallest
building in the world,'' said Richard Jerram, chief economist here
for ING Baring Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Japan was in rotten shape six years ago, nobody
particularly cared because Asia was fine and the US economy was
recovering,'' he added. ``Now there's a perception that weakness in
Japan causes weakness in Asia _ and Brazil and Moscow, what have
you. It's as if Japan were responsible for Holland getting knocked
out of the World Cup and the El Nino effect. It's become flavor of
the month to blame the world's ills on Japan's economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Teizo Taya, an economist and former director
of the US-Japan 21st Century Committee, attributes the lingering
slump here to protectionism _ of sagging companies by the
government, of unneeded employees by companies, and of bankrupt
creditors by lenders.
</P>
<P>
   Chudler agreed that the government has ``babied'' companies by
using public money to boost their sales and giving unprofitable
firms tax breaks to stay in business. The government also pays
companies to keep workers employed. ``It's like welfare without the
stigma of staying home and watching TV,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the wrongheaded approach of stimulus without
underlying reforms, Taya said, and you have a recipe for disaster:
``It's like giving liquor to an alcoholic.'' And after a $124
billion stimulus package announced three months ago, ``we simply
don't have the money anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped all three candidates for prime minister
from talking about huge stimulus packages. Front-runner Keizo
Obuchi suggested a 10 trillion yen ($7.2 billion) budget Friday,
likely to be financed through deficit bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Japan Ltd., says other
worse-hit Asian nations will probably recover before Japan because
they have run out of cash and are being forced to restructure. With
its vast reserves, Japan need not act immediately, and that
ultimately could hurt Japan more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can count the number of years on one hand before Japan
faces a hard landing,'' Shipley predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is the collapse of an economic system, an
economy that has relied on overseas demand for growth,'' he said,
``and I don't see any of these politicians doing anything about it.
Financial markets are going to do it for them. Markets will
downgrade Japanese assets until they are so cheap that investors
will buy them and companies will face restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that a collapsed Japan would lead to world
recession. Chudler noted that even as Asia deteriorates, most US
companies have surpassed expectations for second-quarter earnings.
``This could be the greatest thing to happen to the US,'' he
asserted. ``Inflation has fallen and we didn't have to raise
interest rates, because worldwide commodities prices have been kept
down'' by the Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   If this continues, ``people are going to say, `Who cares about
Japan?' Then maybe Japan can go back to dealing with its domestic
political and economic systems and figure it out themselves. That's
the healthiest solution.''

THE HIDDEN COST OF BEING SINGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Arise, you single people _ you divorcees, you
confirmed bachelors, and the otherwise unmarried! In the name of
family values, Congress is out to grab your wallet!
</P>
<P>
   As many people know by now, Congress this year seems intent on
addressing the ``marriage penalty,'' that quirk in the tax law that
forces some married couples to pay more in taxes than they would if
they remained single and earned the same income.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a man and a woman who each earn $37,500 a year
would pay a total of $11,000 in taxes if they were living together
without being married. If they married, the tax bill would jump
$1,400, to $12,500. Lawmakers, particularly Republicans, say this
penalty is unfair, and that it undermines marriage, that
fundamental American institution.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough. But if Congress is sincere in trying to make the
laws more equitable, it ought to look at the many ways in which
federal law also punishes single people, just because they are
single.
</P>
<P>
   A close examination would show that, in many cases, federal law
gives married couples a break while limiting a tax benefit for
singles, who may have greater needs. In other cases, Congress has
made it hard for singles who want to marry to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is a system of penalties and bonuses in federal
law that, for better or worse, hinges on one's marital status.
Fairness _ or at least equal treatment _ often gets lost in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT A: The Capital Gains Tax
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers handed homeowners a big gift last year by cutting
their exposure to capital gains taxes on the sale of a home. But in
a little-noticed move, Congress for the first time made marital
status a significant element of the tax.
</P>
<P>
   A married couple can earn $500,000 on the sale of their
principal residence without paying any capital gains tax, while a
single person starts to pay taxes after $250,000 in profits.
</P>
<P>
   But a single person can face a greater challenge in buying and
maintaining a home than a two-income couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``A house costs the same whether you are single or married,''
said Dorothy Langer, a management consultant who lives on Beacon
Hill, and who is not married. ``A roof costs what a roof costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If single people paid lower property taxes, there might be
something to talk about with this. But they pay the same real
estate taxes'' as married people. Applying marital status to the
capital gains tax ``is tremendously unfair,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Roberts, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said
the law makes a certain amount of sense. Every person gets the same
$250,000 exemption from the tax. A married couple is merely
claiming $250,000 for each spouse.
</P>
<P>
   But the law can create tax problems for older people, whose
homes may have appreciated significantly over time. ``A married
couple owns a home and someone dies, and all of a sudden a person
is single and has lost the tax exemption for $250,000 on the sale
of a home,'' said David Certner, who follows tax issues for the
American Association of Retired Persons. ``That's a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT B: Scholarship credits:
</P>
<P>
   Some singles also bristle at how Congress structured the ``Hope
Scholarship Credit'' last year, the much-touted measure that offers
up to $1,500 to people paying for the first two years of college.
</P>
<P>
   The credit helps anyone with up to $100,000 in annual income _
if they're married. Single people lose the benefit at $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   That means a $95,000-a-year lawyer can claim some of the credit,
if he or she is married to a stay-at-home spouse. At the same time,
a single mother working overtime to earn $51,000 gets nothing at
all.
</P>
<P>
   That single mom may well need the credit more than the lawyer,
said James Colliton, a former Internal Revenue Service attorney who
now teaches law at DePaul University in Chicago. ``If I'm a
divorced person trying to send a kid to college, I might not get
any help. But married people with much more income might get help
from the government,'' he said. ``It seems unfair to me.''
</P>

   EXHIBIT C: Social Security
</P>
<P>
   If Congress is sincere about correcting the marriage penalty in
the income tax, it might also revisit the rules regarding Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Income from Social Security is taxed at two thresholds. Once a
single person reports $25,000 in annual income, or $32,000 for
married people, taxes must be paid on half of the Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At the second threshhold threshold _ $34,000 for singles and
$44,000 for couples _ taxes must be paid on 85 percent of Social
Security income.
</P>
<P>
   That can create a big marriage penalty for older people who want
to marry, said Certner of the AARP. Two retirees earning $20,000 a
year who marry would move from paying no tax on Social Security
income to a tax on 85 percent of that income.
</P>
<P>
   These and other Social Security rules ``are contributing to
seniors living in sin, which is a growing phenomenon,'' said Edward
McCaffrey, a law professor at the University of Southern California
and author of the book ``Taxing Women.'' When McCaffrey makes radio
appearances, he said, seniors often call with complaints about this
facet of Social Security law.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau reports that unmarried seniors are in fact
living together more often. In the decade ending in 1996, the
number of unmarried seniors of the opposite sex living together
rose 165 percent, to include 105,000 households, compared with an
80 percent increase for the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   EXHIBIT D: Marriage and the Earned Income Tax Credit
</P>
<P>
   Many low-income people could also benefit from Congress's new
interest in helping single people marry. Just as the income tax
confers a marriage penalty on some people, so does the Earned
Income Tax Credit.
</P>
<P>
   Someone earning the minimum wage, or about $10,700 a year, could
claim a refund of nearly $2,300 under the low-income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   But two people in the same situation who married would not claim
double that amount. Instead, they would get only about $1,830 _ a
marriage penalty of nearly $2,800, or a whopping 13 percent of
their combined salary.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is probably impossible for Congress to remedy all
these marriage penalties and bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   But these quirks in the law are worth noting, because they
underscore the fact that it is hard to write a tax law that takes
money from everyone equally, or a tax break that benefits all
groups equally.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress moves to fix the marriage penalty in the income tax,
single people should pay attention or they may lose out. Many of
the proposed solutions increase the disparity that exists among
some singles and some married people in tax law.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, Senator Phil Gramm, Republican
of Texas, guided a marriage penalty provision through the Senate as
an amendment to the tobacco bill. Gramm didn't end the penalty. He
merely gave a tax cut to all married couples who report up to
$50,000 annual income.
</P>
<P>
   The cost: an eye-popping $46 billion over 10 years. One-third of
the money was to come from a higher tax on tobacco. But the rest
would come from general revenues. And that would likely shift the
responsibility for paying for government more squarely on the
shoulders of single people.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gramm's bill would have helped married people who
don't pay a penalty _ and many of them do not. In fact, 52 percent
of married couples receive a marriage bonus _ that is, they pay
lower income taxes in marriage than they would if they had remained
single.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, in other words, would use the tax money paid by single
people (and others) to reduce the tax bill for couples who already
find a tax advantage in marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In similar fashion, poor people who want to marry would get
little benefit from several of the other solutions to the marriage
penalty. Unless Congress writes a specific provision enhancing the
Earned Income Tax Credit, poor married people will be left out when
the lawmakers ease the burden on married couples, as will many of
the working poor who want to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to craft rules that don't have a marriage
penalty or bonus,'' said Iris Lav of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities. ``But if there is going to be marriage penalty
relief for higher-income people, you should have it for
lower-income people.''
</P>
<P>
   Colliton, the DePaul professor, said that ``married people are
getting treated better in the tax law, and single people haven't
awakened to that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is precedent for them to do so. In 1969, complaints
from singles _ who then paid higher taxes than married people with
similar incomes _ led to a signficant rewriting of the tax code.
``We could see a political backlash like that again,'' said
Colliton, ``as single people say, `Wait a minute. What about us?'''

   This episode started when a pilot with California's Department
of Fish and Game (DFG) picked up a signal from a ground-based radio
transmitter, identifying it as the same frequency emitted by a
radio collar banded on an endangered marbled murrelet.

   It seemed a breakthrough, since the rare murrelet had apparently
vanished for months without a sign, and the signal was loud and
clear, pinpointing the location to a meadow east of Eureka. A
ground crew was dispatched for a search, as part of an ongoing
study by the DFG of the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was the murrelet still alive?'' wondered Paul Wertz of the
DFG. ``Had it been killed by a raptor that had taken the bird,
transmitter and all, to its nest?''
</P>
<P>
   The search crew hiked deep into remote country, guided by the
coordinates of the signal provided by the pilot, and ended near a
spot called Murphy Meadow, near a heavily forested area. They
suddenly emerged from forest, and there, standing on the edge of
the meadow, was a 500-pound elk.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out the elk was wearing a radio collar transmitter
with the same frequency as that used in the murrelet study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd lost track of that elk years ago,'' said Tim Burton, DFG
wildlife biologist. He assumed the elk had died or the collar had
stopped working. Instead, the elk had migrated 75 miles to new
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Burton was asked if 500-pound elk and 10-inch murrelets are
easily mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, they're both kinda brown,'' he said.

   This is why Jet Skis and other similar personal watercraft will
likely face sweeping bans in the next year:
</P>
<P>
   Dangerous: Jet Skis and similar personal watercraft account for
11 percent of all registered vessels in America but are involved in
35 percent of boating accidents. In California, they make up 16
percent of registered vessels but are responsible for 45 percent of
all boating accidents and 55 percent of all boating-related
injuries, according to California's Department of Boating &AMP;
Waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Air polluters: The amount of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides
released to the air by Jet Skis and outboard motors is about 25
percent of that from California's 25 million automobiles, and two
hours of exhaust emissions from a Jet Ski is equivalent to the
emissions over 130,000 miles of driving from a 1998 automobile,
according to the State Air Resources Board.
</P>
<P>
   Water polluters: Every two hours, Jet Skis emit 3 to 5 gallons
of its fuel/oil mix into the water, that is, 20 percent of its
consumption of 15 to 20 gallons is used for cooling, and is
released into the water unburned, according to the Bluewater
Network.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   California game wardens call themselves ``The Thin Green Line,''
because when it comes to abuse of fish and wildlife they are often
the only line between right and wrong, and they are spread plenty
thin, with each warden responsible for at least 600 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the DFG was able to hire 22 wardens who graduated from
its Cadet Academy, bringing the number to 54 new game wardens added
to the force in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   This is a direct result of Gov. Pete Wilson enhancing the DFG
budget by $3.7 million for law enforcement operations.

BUYING TESTIMONY IS SELLING JUSTICE, SAYS COURT

   No deals. The federal government can't promise a witness
leniency in exchange for his or her testimony. That's what a
three-judge panel of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver
said to federal prosecutors on July 1. The ruling sent shock waves
through federal law enforcement agencies and offices of U.S.
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   It is a well-reasoned ruling, but it didn't last long. On July
10, the court issued an order to vacate the ruling and ordered a
rehearing of the case before the entire 12-judge appellate court in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the shock waves bounced back, built up as high as a
tsunami to drown out the three judicial voices of reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Tenth Circuit Court's decisions affect Wyoming, Colorado,
Utah, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma, but the influence of such a
decision reaches the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The case, U.S. vs. Singleton, involves the transport of cocaine
from California to Wichita, Kansas. Sonya Singleton, allegedly one
of the drug dealers, was charged with multiple counts of money
laundering and conspiracy to distribute cocaine. Before trial, her
attorney moved to suppress the testimony of Napoleon Douglas, an
alleged co-conspirator, because Douglas had been promised leniency
in return for his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Singleton's attorney asserts that the federal government's
promise of leniency violates the ``bribery of witnesses'' section
of the U.S. Code.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Title 18, Section 201(c)(2), states in plain English
``Whoever directly or indirectly, gives, offers, or promises
anything of value to any person, for or because of the testimony
under oath ... or to be given by such a person as a witness upon a
trial ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not
more than two years, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court notes in its July 1 ruling that the government
had promised not to prosecute Douglas ``for any other violations of
the Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act stemming from his
activities currently under investigation, except perjury or related
offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers argued that dropping charges isn't really
``anything of value.'' Nonsense, said the court, facing fewer years
in jail is something ``of value.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the request to narrow the construction of the law so
that it doesn't apply to federal prosecutors, the court simply
states: ``Courts may not create their own limitations on
legislation, no matter how alluring the policy arguments for doing
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also argued that the opening word, ``Whoever,''
in Section 201(c) of the U.S. Code does not refer to the federal
government. The court disagrees. It contends that there are only
two classes of cases in which inclusive language does not apply to
the government _ those that would limit its sovereign rights or
prerogatives and those that would create an absurdity if applied to
the government, like a speed limit applied to a police car in
pursuit of a suspect. Neither exception fits the bribery of
witnesses section of the U.S. Code.
</P>
<P>
   The court made short shrift of the government's position: ``The
anti-gratuity provision of Section 201(c)(2) indicates Congress's
belief that justice is undermined by giving, offering, or promising
anything of value for testimony. If justice is perverted when a
criminal defendant seeks to buy testimony from a witness, it is no
less perverted when the government does so. ... Further, the
interests of the United States as sovereign militate in favor of
applying Section 201(c)(2) against federal prosecutors. The
sovereign's interests are in the enforcement of its laws and the
just administration of its judicial system; applying Section
201(c)(2) to all parties in that judicial system advances both
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court harkens back to Magna Carta's basic principle
_ ``the king is subject to the law.'' The U.S. Constitution is
founded on that same principle _ the government is not above the
law.
</P>
<P>
   The court might have gone further into Magna Carta. Section 40
states: ``To no one will we sell ... justice,'' a principle
essential to any meaningful court of law. Buying testimony is
selling justice.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel of the appellate court is well aware that
they are challenging a prosecutorial practice that has been in
vogue for nearly 40 years: ``No practice is more ingrained in our
criminal justice system than the practice of the government calling
a witness who is an accessory to the crime for which the defendant
is charged and having that witness testify under a plea bargain
that promises him a reduced sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 1 ruling suppresses Douglas' tainted testimony as
illegal and sends the case back down to the trial court for a new
trial without his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how long it has been done, buying testimony is
antithetical to any notion of justice.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 150 years in this country, suspects had been beaten,
starved and threatened with death or denied medical aid in order to
get a confession _ until the U.S. Supreme Court took a firm stand
against such brutal practices in Brown vs. Mississippi, 1936. In
that case, a black man was whipped with his belt in the basement of
police station and then hung with it until he lost consciousness,
then revived and the process repeated _ until, at last, he could
take no more and signed a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Confessions gained through the use of physical or psychological
pain are unreliable. A person signs a confession in order to stop
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the beating is the suspect's reward for signing a
confession. In a sense, it is bought testimony _ ending the beating
is something ``of value.''
</P>
<P>
   The July 1 ruling was right. And a long-standing government
practice has finally been called what it is _ wrong. The full Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals should stand firm on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   If the full court agrees with the July 1 ruling, it may make law
enforcement more difficult, but it will help preserve this nation's
belief in justice and fair play.

 &HT;    STUDENT GROUP PLANS CAMPAIGN AGAINST ALCOHOL-RELATED DEATHS
 &HT;    By DANIELLE SHOOK
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alcohol-related deaths among teenagers fell by as
much as 5 percent in the past year, according to a student activist
group committed to combating underage drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday at the Capitol, SADD (Students
Against Destructive Driving) announced a plan to further decrease
the amount of underage drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   It includes:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Forwarding party fliers that circulate around schools to local
police.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Holding alcohol-free dances to show students that they don't
have to drink to have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dramatizing drinking-related deaths by having students wear
black, paint their faces white and avoid speaking to anyone during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   to symbolize their death due to drinking and driving.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, SADD said it planned to ask legislators to lower
the national legal limit for drivers' blood alcohol content to 0.08
percent, which 15 states now observe, from 0.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The group said that last year, the number of deaths among
teenagers in alcohol- related incidents fell to 2,209. By the year
2000, the group said, it hopes to see this number further decrease
to 2,000.

   &UR; IMMIGRATION SERIES &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   Last of three articles on the changing identity of American
immigrants:
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE (Chinantla, Mexico) _ Almost every migration
story is the psychodrama of a family. For the Cruz family of
Chinantla, Mexico, it is also the story of a town, a global village
in the most literal sense. Like many modern immigrant families,
those from Chinantla straddle a border, abetted by newly
inexpensive air fares, international phone cards, and, now, by a
new Mexican law that allows them to retain their Mexican
nationality as American citizens and even confers it on their
American-born children. But since their town, too, transcends a
border, the Chinantecans' connection between here and there is
particularly vibrant. They live divided between Chinantla and New
York, but consider themselves one group, 2,500 here, 2,500 there.
The story of Chinantla is an especially magical one, the
multigenerational saga of a pueblito that has been bled of its
working-age population through a half-century of emigration. Yet
Chinantla has not faded but flourished, a would-be ghost town kept
alive by emigrants who consider the place a state of mind, an
affair of the heart and their spiritual anchor. By Deborah Sontag.

   SCI-AMERICAS-CUP (Undated) _ Challengers who hope to capture the
America's Cup from New Zealand in 2000 already have begun extensive
research and testing programs directed toward designing and
building the fastest sailboats in their class. Months, even years,
before construction begins on the new boats, teams of naval
architects, designers, computer scientists, model builders and
engineers engage in a technological competition to create machines
that can complete a two-hour race a few minutes or seconds ahead of
rivals. By Warren E. Leary. (2000 words)

   SCI-AIDS-PIOT (Undated) _ Dr. Peter Piot, the head of the United

deadliest viruses in Africa and strives to improve the welfare of
impoverished people. Now as chief coordinator of the global war on
AIDS, Piot combines a scientific expertise, an avid interest in
history, and a political will that once led him to march against
NATO headquarters in Brussels to protest Belgium's possible entry
into the Vietnam war. By Lawrence K. Altman.

<P>
   SCI-BUTTE-POLLUTE (Butte, Mont.) _ So much copper was dug from
the mountain that Butte, Mont., was built on, it was dubbed the
Richest Hill on Earth. Now the copper is largely gone, and the bill
for a century's worth of mining has come due. The mountains and
waterways around Butte are so contaminated they comprise the
largest Super Fund complex in the country. The pollution is so
widespread and difficult to deal with that companies have been
forced to look for new ways to clean up problems. Butte now is on a
determined search to find ways to clean up one of the largest
messes on Earth. By Jim Robbins.

   SCI-SCRUFFY-PHYSICISTS (Undated) _ Cops carry badges, doctors
wear stethoscopes, royalty wield fly whisks and scepters, and
prominent citizens of France display the rosette of the Legion
d'Honneur in their buttonholes. For physicists, however, there has
been another (albeit subtle) way to proclaim membership in a
professional community that scorns conventional social images.
Physicists often get into the habit of looking somewhat scruffy,
and scruffiness in itself is a badge. But now, that image is under
attack as a professional journal calls for the physicists to clean
up their acts if they want to be taken seriously. By Malcolm
Browne. (1000 words)

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAXTER STATE PARK, Maine _ George Lankton was raising a roof in
the form of a tarp strung from trees. Kristen Haberin was cooking
soup in a one-burner propane stove.
</P>
<P>
   They had been on the road for hours, and about mid-morning they
had passed out of Maine's well-worn tourist route along the craggy
coast and entered the outback region of the state known as the
``North Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Fewer cars along the road now. As they pushed north the seafood
restaurants and factory outlet stores gave way to a country store
about every 10 miles _ half a day's ride by wagon, which was the
transportation when these little all-purpose stores were the only
commercial enterprises in the vast and brooding landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the road itself ended, and for a dusty, rumbly hour
the couple were driving the gravel packed roads and passing town
line signs that read ``T3-R9'' (for township location).
</P>
<P>
   Now Heberin and Lankton had their soup and looked out at the
sky. Most views showed an improvement from the morning's overcast,
but on one side, blocking out the sky for a mile above them, rose
the dark immensity of Katahdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've camped all over, but never this far away,'' said
Haberin. The couple, from Coventry Conn., had always heard of
Katahdin (Kette-Adene, Abenaki for ``Greatest Mountain), the
5,267-foot high northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail. Last
week they made the long push upcountry to see it and the camp
around it.
</P>
<P>
   Where hundreds of thousands of tourists annually visit Mt.
Washington in New Hampshire's White Mountains _ which features an
auto road and cog railway to the top, with endless tourist
amusements and shopping spread around the base _ only a fraction as
many get into Maine's mile high peak and the vast outback beyond
it, about 300 miles north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly outside of Greenville (west) or Millinocket (east), the
paved roads abruptly give way to gravel-packed logging roads, and
for the next hundred miles (Katahdin is actually central Maine) the
land becomes a wild uninhabited chain of lakes, rivers, mountains,
and dense forest land. Under state control, it is called the
Allagash Wilderness Waterway, replacing the older North Woods tag,
which natives still use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who come up here are pretty serious outdoorsmen,
but not all,'' says ranger Pete McFarland. ``Sometimes people climb
up Katahdin underestimating how big it is and what a long climb it
can be. They get up there drenched with perspiration, then a shower
comes up and thw wind blows, and they're up there shivering and too
tired to climb down.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, park rangers had to call in a helicopter rescue
for a woman who, shortly after knee surgery, tried to take on
Katahdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looks so pretty up there a lot of people get
deceived,'' said another ranger at the Baxter station. Indeed, the
trek up to Katahdin's summit can be accomplished by most reasonably
healthy people. Yet, rangers point out, the turnaround climb is a
seven-hour proposition, and any trek up the mountain should be
carefully prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Katahdin and Baxter State Park, though a large tract in itself
at 315 square miles, is only one relatively small corner of the
North Woods, which even in high season (after black flies and
before the snow) are sparsely populated by generally only the
hard-core outdoors enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Jack Richards and his 16-year-old son Jack Jr., come
to canoe. From the southernmost point of the Allagash at Telos
Landing on Telos Lake to Allagash Village on the St. John River 98
miles to the north, lies perhaps the longest single organized canoe
trip in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to get out there very far before you know
you're alone,'' says the senior Richards, who has made several such
treks with his son, but never covered the whole distance. ``Some
one of these summers, we have to plan the whole thing and just go.
Or it's always going to be out there nagging on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, like the Connecticut couple, hike and ride mountain
bikes, though the latter activity is controlled by the park
service, which guards strictly against environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take mountain bikes up to the Allagash,'' says
Lankton. ``But they won't let you on the trails up there _ with
good reason. So we'll ride the logging roads down here.''
</P>
<P>
   Over 90 percent of the North Woods is owned by pulp paper
companies, which have checkpoints to log in visitors to the region.
So, too, Baxter checks in all cars and asks people their plans _
simple safety precautions, they say, in case people get lost. At
any one time a thousand people are in the park overnight, and the
rangers know the inevitable call can come any night _ someone lost
on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But down in the lowlands, where hundreds of miles of logging
roads crisscross the forests and bogs, getting lost is as easy as
forgetting the last three forks in the road. The very logging roads
that make almost every lake and mountain accssible by car can
quickly become as tractless and confusing as the wilderness itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been lost on these roads before,'' admits Harlan Reed, a
fishing guide with a camp on the Penobscot River. ``At least when
you're in a canoe you know where the river's going and it's pretty
hard to get lost. Even hiking trails aren't bad. But these roads in
the woods _ you can drive all day and get more lost every mile you
go.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the great draws of the region is the wildlife. Black bear
(the state university's fighting symbol, despite the shyness of the
animal), coyote, white-tail deer, and jackrabbits are common
animals. The woods ring with the call of loons and the
white-throated sparrow _ a bird heard only brielfly in lower New
England during the spring migration north.
</P>
<P>
   But the one animal everyone wants to see has become the
unofficial state symbol _ moose. ``If I talk to 50 campers a week,
49 of them will ask how do they get to see a moose. The state even
has a book out about it,'' says Reed, who has been coming to the
North Woods most of his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Maine's vast outback, spotting moose is as easy as
rising at dawn and staking out a bog or small stream. Evening hours
are also good. After years of clear-cutting the pine forests by
loggers, what is left are growing hardwood thickets which state
biologists term ``the great salad bowl'' for moose.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the visitors center at Baxter is a blackboard on which
visitors log in latest moose sightings, such as one last week ``7/8
_ Really huge bull moose at Abol Stream.''
</P>
<P>
   While the fishing in some areas is excellent _ indeed, Penobscot
River brown trout fishing is legendary, as is Moosehead _ it is at
best only part of the picture for most travelers to the Maine
backcountry.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking, canoeing, and kayaking are the most popular activities.
But on the two big rivers that flow out of Moosehead (the largest
lake in the continental US contained within the borders of a single
state) the last remaining whitewater in the northeast gave rise 25
years ago to the rafting business.
</P>
<P>
   Purist outdoor enthusiasts have scoffed at using the rivers for
amusement park rides for casual visitors. But with low
environmental impact, rafting has come to be viewed in a more
benign light by most over the years as simply another recreational
use of the rivers, and good clean fun.
</P>
<P>
   Since Wayne Hockmeyer founded Northern Outdoors 23 years ago on
the Penobscot as well as the Kennebec, Dead River in Maine, and the
Hudson in New York, an offbeat amusement has grown into a sport
that draws tens of thousands each year.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical summer day, about 1,000 rafters will bump, splash,
and scream their way down through famous rapids known as Cribworks
and Magic Falls before the rafts are landed in a wilderness setting
for a cookout. Then the afternoon session, followed by a video
showing of the days' activities, gives rafters a full day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a family myself,'' says Jim Yearwood, manager and
part-owner of Northern Outdoors, ``and I'd consider this a very
affordable vacation. We sometimes combine rafting with days of
kayaking, fishing, rock climbing and hiking.''
</P>
<P>
   Such packaged trips appeal often to groups who want to vacation
together at a group rate, says Yearwood, with planning left to
professionals. Registered Maine guides working for Northern
Outdoors accompany the trips on the river and into the backwoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a safe way to experience the wilderness in all aspects,''
says Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   Rafting took grew so fast through the last two decades on the
few whitewater rivers left in the northeast that the state had to
step in and regulate the numbers. The current limit allows 1,000
rafters on the river weekdays and 800 on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   In the decade from 1985 to 1995, rafters on Maine's three
northern rivers increased from 44,540 to 80,337 annually, according
to state figures. ``We've settled in at about that figure now,''
says Yearwood, exaplining that the several rafting outfitters had
to work out schedules and quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Some old-timers in the outback still consider rafting a rather
frivilous activity, compared to traditional uses such as fishing
and canoeing. The highly packaged rafting trips, they say, are
little more than thrill-seeking ammusements compared with the
subtler, more traditional ways to appreciate the northern
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it helps bring in money,'' says Ron Ewell, a logger who
has spent his life between Quebec and Millinocket. ``But it sure
has changed the river. We used to have river drives with timber,
and now it sometimes looks as thick as that with these rafts.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one has viewed rafting as a serious threat to the
wilderness here. Not compared to the potential development of
Moosehead Lake, where one of the principal land owners, South
Africa Pulp and Paper, is trying to sell off nearly 100,000 acres
of forest land this summer, including 60-miles of Moosehead Lake
shorefront.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the high-flying '80's, realty developers did manage to
besmirch some of the land around Moosehead with unimpeded and
haphazard building in the ``vacation home'' market.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, if South African Pulp and Paper, and others,
do unload its wilderness land to investors, state and federal
planners in Maine vow to fight for regulations and protection of
the North Woods.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in the Moosehead Messenger in Greenville, the
gateway town to the wilderness, calls for the public puchase of the
land ``to protect ourselves from the whims of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a sense of the inevitable. Says Paul Deitz, a new
landowner along the Moosehead shore, as he looked out over the lake
from the top of Squaw Mountain one evening last week:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too beautiful here, too easy to reach, and there's
so much of it ... everyone wants a piece of a place like this. Once
the people start coming and it catches on, there'll be no stopping
them.''

REDS ALERT STILL ON, BUT WINNING ORIOLES MAY REMAIN INTACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN SHEA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It wasn't long ago that the Baltimore Orioles
and the Cincinnati Reds were calling every general manager in
baseball, begging them to take a pricey veteran or two off their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   The fire sales were to be in full force by now, with the July 31
trade deadline right around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   At least that was the talk at the All-Star break, when both
teams were looking to 1999 and beyond. But a funny thing happened
on their way to oblivion. They began winning.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Baltimore beat the California Angels 7 to 4,
clinching its 10th victory in 11 games. The Reds had a 10-game
winning streak going into the weekend, but lost three straight
games to the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody had three days (over the break) to decide
how they wanted to improve their own games and try to be better,''
Orioles pitcher Mike Mussina said. ``People are arbitrarily picking
next week or the week after next as a deadline for when we need to
show something. I think we've decided that we have to play better
baseball for ourselves. We know we can play better. We were
extremely upset with the way we played for the first three months
of the season, and this is a good start for the second three
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr. and manager Ray Miller have campaigned against a
dismantling of the team, but the Orioles have several potential
free agents, including multimillionaires Roberto Alomar and Rafael
Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   They have no shot at a division title, but the Orioles are
thinking the wild card is realistic.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds, meanwhile, haven't changed their plan to break up the
roster. General manager Jim Bowden said the focus is still on
slashing the payroll, rebuilding the roster and forming a winner
before the opening of the Reds' new ballpark in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing great and I'm proud of the way our young kids
have shown enthusiasm, heart and character,'' Bowden said last
week. ``And our schedule, after Aug. 7, is very much in our favor.
But we will not deviate from our plan. We're not going to change
just because we are winning.''
</P>
<P>
   That means Bowden still wants to unload pitcher Pete Harnisch,
shortstop Barry Larkin, outfielder Reggie Sanders and third baseman
Willie Greene. Harnisch would be a nice fit with the San Francisco
Giants, but they're among several interested teams. The list also
includes the Padres, Astros, Angels, Red Sox and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds themselves have shown interest, having offered Harnisch
a two-year, $6 million extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on both _ signing him and trading him,'' Bowden
said. ``Whichever thing works out best for the club quickest is
what we'll do. Mark this down: He will either be signed by us
before July 31 or he will be traded. I hate to lose free agents
without getting something in return.''

 &HT;    BOMBING SURVIVOR ENDS TREATMENT AS NEW TERROR ATTEMPT UNSETTLES
ISRAEL
 &HT;    With photo placed in the International folder on the Cox Server
and available from the New Yory Times News Service.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In terms of geopolitics, this week's attempted car
bombing on a crowded Israeli street was yet another reminder of
Middle East volatility.
</P>
<P>
   For Israeli grocery store cashier Shoshana Katsav, it was an
echo of her own personal ``disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Katsav was buying pastries for a beach trip a year ago when two
Palestinian suicide bombers sent fire and nails ripping through
Jerusalem's Mahaneh Yehuda produce market.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen Israelis died and more then 70 were seriously injured.
Katsav and her daughter were near the blast. Her daughter,
13-year-old Hadass, was hospitalized for a month. Katsav, 45,
nearly died.
</P>
<P>
   She was in a coma three months and hospitalized more than five.
Her family sat by her side around the clock in shifts.
</P>
<P>
   She credits a Palestinian doctor for much of what is widely
considered a miraculous recovery.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Katsav, a mother of four and grandmother of two,
finished her intensive outpatient hospital rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Israelis had quietly marked the one-year
anniversary _ according to the Hebrew calendar _ of the July 30
market bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis Sunday also saw Israeli, Palestinian and U.S.
negotiators try, yet again, to restart the stalled peace process.
And, they almost faced another tragedy, when a Palestinian man
failed in igniting what police said was a van full of explosives on
Jerusalem's main street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything came rushing back to me, the screams, the
destruction, all the pictures. Yesterday was very emotional,''
Katsav said about the news of Sunday's attempted bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing attempt closed downtown streets for hours and
unsettled this little nation.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav is still recovering from the year-old Mahaneh Yehuda
bombing, which blasted apart windows and awnings and scattered the
market with broken fruit and body parts.
</P>
<P>
   She suffered second- and third-degree burns on her hands, arms,
legs, chest and back. One arm was severely burned and broken, and
doctors considered amputation. Her body and head were punctured by
nails, and she could not breathe on her own.
</P>
<P>
   The first doctor to receive her at Jerusalem's Shaare Zedek
Hospital was Salah Odallah, one of a handful of Palestinian doctors
there and the co-director of the intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Odallah said doctors asked Katsav her name and she responded
``Miriam,'' which is her mother's name.
</P>
<P>
   Unconscious and on a respirator, she was sedated for the pain
and allowed to let slip into a coma _ a practice sometimes used
with severe burn victims.
</P>
<P>
   Odallah, who told her family that Katsav had maybe only a 5
percent chance of living, said the fact that he is Palestinian was
never an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was normal,'' said Odallah, who has treated other
terror victims over 15 years at the hospital. ``I gave her
everything I could. I spoke with (the family) several times, day
and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think I have to give (terror victims) more
interest . . . so they can know that not all Palestinians are
terrorists,'' Odallah added.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the people who did (the bombing),'' she said. ``But it
doesn't involve all Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Katsav has gone to another hospital -- at Hebrew
University -- for physiotherapy, she returns to Odallah for advice
on medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital staff gave her a small going-away party Monday before
she went home to Pisgat Zaev, a Jewish neighborhood that is near
Jerusalem but in West Bank occupied territory.
</P>
<P>
   She will return for once-a-month follow up visits. For a year,
she will wear tight, stocking-type garments on her arm, legs and
torso to reduce the scarring that restricts her movement.
</P>
<P>
   She may need more surgery -- she's had more than she can count
-- to repair two fingers that she cannot move.
</P>
<P>
   Tami Yosha, one of the occupational therapists that has
retrained Katsav to walk, eat and dress, said she was always
cheerful in therapy. That concealed the fact that she suffered the
same emotional trauma as others who went shopping and almost died.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav is in a support group with other victims of the bombing
and will continue psychological therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still foggy. I'm trying to recall (what happened),''
Katsav said. ``Only now are people starting to tell me what
happened to me. I can only hear a little at a time because I'm not
ready.''

NEW PARKS FROM THE GRASS ROOTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Tenn., Mass., Pa.)   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea of a national park as a wilderness set aside for
recreation for everyone began with Yellowstone in 1872, before
there was a National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 126 years later, the service has jurisdiction over 376
places _ memorials and monuments, land and houses, historic sites
and the like _ embracing over 83 million acres. But in the last 15
years, in an ``ambitious experiment,'' as the Park Service calls
it, Congress has given the service a vastly different task: Helping
grass-roots groups preserve history, landscape, canals and rivers
or anything else that seems to them to embody the special qualities
of where they live and work.
</P>
<P>
   Designated Heritage Areas or Corridors, or in one case, a
Heritage Route, these 15 places can contain active industrial
artifacts _ working steel mills, for example _ and historic
buildings adapted to new uses, like a cotton mill being used to
store apples.
</P>
<P>
   Except where an existing federal site falls within the area's
boundaries, the federal government does not own or manage any of
these sites. They remain private or public _ whatever they were
before Congress accorded them heritage status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each National Heritage Area is a settled landscape that tells
the story of its residents,'' the Park Service says. ``Over time
the land and local environment have shaped traditions and cultural
values in the people who live there. The residents' use of the land
has in turn created and sustained a landscape that reflects their
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   These areas are mostly east of the Mississippi; the farthest
west are the Cane River Creole National Heritage Area in Louisiana
and the Silos and Smokestacks Agricultural Heritage Partnership in
northeast Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, they document the industrial revolution in
the United States, but they cover a wide spectrum of national life,
from the Civil War and the Creole culture in the Louisiana Purchase
to the demise of the China trade in New England.
</P>
<P>
   In describing what common thread links such diverse places _
some ready for tourists and others preparing _ David Barna, a Park
Service spokesman, said: ``The park system has preserved natural
areas, Indian history, sites from the Revolution, the War of 1812
and the Civil War. But from the late 1800s forward, most historic
sites are not part of the Park Service. From the vantage point of
2050, citizens might well ask us, `Why didn't you save significant
sites of the Industrial Revolution?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Designation as a heritage area, Barna said, helps save more
recent examples of the national history, plus recreational features
like boat landings, without throwing vast tracts into Park Service
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Congress began the effort in 1984, when it gave
heritage-corridor status to the Illinois and Michigan Canal, built
in the 1830s and 40s over the Indian portage route between Lake
Michigan and the Illinois River. This venture turned Chicago from a
crossroads into Carl Sandburg's ``stormy, husky, brawling city of
big shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   The 61-mile canal strip is the most established of the heritage
areas, with recreational facilities and brochures. Congress added
to the list in 1986, 1988 and 1994. In 1996, in an omnibus bill, it
designated nine new areas. Two of these, the Tennessee Civil War
area and the coal history area in West Virginia, while authorized
and outlined, are not ready to provide guidance for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Little about a heritage area is tidy. Judy Hart of the National
Park Service, program leader for the heritage areas, said they are
``too broad and too rich'' to be made into national parks. Dr.
James K. Huhta of Murfreesboro, Tenn., who testified in Congress
for the Tennessee Civil War Heritage Area, said there were many
advantages to examining a heritage through large regional themes
rather than in a battlefield or individual houses or parks. Huhta
said that his project divided Tennessee into five areas where major
themes could be demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   For example: the lives of blacks from 1850 to 1870, including
slavery; the Underground Railroad; the Civil War and emancipation
and the women whom the Civil War left as widows, or with disabled
husbands and sons.
</P>
<P>
   The Coal History area in 13 counties in West Virginia was also
designated in 1996, but work continues to establish it.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina corridor, a string of 14 counties in the
west, another from the class of '96, is open for business. The
corridor, estimated by its administrators to include a quarter of
the state, starts in the mountains and runs down along the Savannah
and Edisto Rivers to the Low Country. The area includes a salt
marsh, horse farms, potteries, craft shops and Boone Hall
plantation, with slave cabins still standing.
</P>
<P>
   Boone Hall, north of Mount Pleasant, began operating as a
plantation in the 17th century. The main house was replaced in
1935, but the slave cabins, of handmade brick, date from the late
18th to early 19th century. The ``slave street'' is one of the few
identified in the state. Boone Hall opened as house museum in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what drives people to organize and seek congressional
authorization is the possibility that heritage tourism will
strengthen the local economy by bringing in travelers and possibly
new businesses. These days, designation brings modest financial
help.

 UNDATED: financial help.

<P>
   Ms. Hart said each of the areas designated in 1996 was able to
request $1 million a year allocated by Congress, up to $10 million
over 15 years. Not all have received money, she said, and some will
never present plans that will enable them to draw their full
portion.
</P>
<P>
   The sites all get counsel and information on organization. Those
areas that have brochures, for example, have usually designed one
to match National Park fliers, with color maps and pictures,
although local organizations have paid the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers Valley in eastern
Connecticut, authorized in 1994, encompasses 850 square miles, more
than a sixth of the state's total of 4,845. With 25 ``hill and
mill'' towns, it likes to style itself ``the last green valley'' in
the megalopolis between Boston and Washington. The area includes
the 1776 Nathan Hale Homestead and the Prudence Crandall Museum,
which was the first New England school for black American girls in
1833.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of tracing American history through this valley
developed in the mind of one woman, Marjorie L. Hoskin, before
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hart of the National Park Service said typically the
heritage process began with two people at a kitchen table, and grew
exponentially until a working group had formed.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Davidge, a volunteer for Quinebaug-Shetucket, said that at
first she had never seen many rivers in her own area because they
were behind mills or in very deep cuts. Cargill Falls, she said,
drops 55 feet, creating huge water power. Looking at it, she said,
``you can see why the textile industry moved from England to New
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinebaug-Shetucket has been disbursing small grants to
applicants. An example is the Mill Re-use Initiative. These
projects must be endorsed by the towns where the mills are. The
owner of the Morse Cotton Mill in Putnam, built around 1846, got
$10,000 to restore the stucco exterior.
</P>
<P>
   This building, now known as Quinebaug Apple Storage, rents space
to orchards to store fruit. The owners of the Fitness Factory, a
gym in one building of the 1920s Prym Mills, got $10,000 for a new
roof.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all hammers and nails. Sally Rogers, a singer in
Pomfret, got $15,000 to create songs based on oral histories in the
area, write a curriculum guide and carry out other musical
projects. One song, ``The Airline Route,'' was based on
advertisements for the New England Limited, which once crossed the
state. A piece of the line's route has been converted to the Air
Line State Park Trail, running northeast from Willimantic to
Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The valley's annual walking weekend coincides with Columbus Day,
with dozens of guided walks and tours throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Essex Heritage Area in eastern Massachusetts enfolded two
existing federal sites, the Salem Maritime National Historic Site
and the Saugus Ironworks. The former includes the Custom House,
wharves, homes and other maritime buildings. The latter is on the
site of the first integrated ironworks in North America, dating
from 1646-68. A reconstructed blast furnace, a forge and a rolling
mill are part of the works.
</P>
<P>
   Three main themes are developed in the area: the early
settlement of America by Europeans, the rise and decline of
maritime industries and early development of the shoe and textile
industries. Annie Harris, director of the heritage area, which is
defined by the Essex County lines, said that the 500-square-mile
county was one of the oldest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Often those answering the information phones at heritage areas
can provide guidance not available in print. August Carlino, the
executive director of the Rivers of Steel area around Pittsburgh,
said that his area included working steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie's first mill, the Edgar Thomson Mill, is still
operating, Carlino said, turning out sheet steel for household
appliances. The working mills, he said, are usually reluctant to
offer tours, but sometimes these can be arranged through the
heritage area office.
</P>
<P>
   The Ntional Parks Index for 1997-99 includes a list of the
heritage areas and their mailing addresses. The index, an
illustrated 128-page paperback, is available for $6.50 from the
government Printing Office, Post Office Box 371954, Pittsburgh, Pa.

VISITING LIMERICK  
 VEGETARIANS IN FRANCE  
 CRUISING THE GREAT LAKES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JULY 26) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAY CORMIER (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)My son will be studying in Limerick, Ireland, this
year. When would be the better time to go there, Christmas or early
April? What are some outstanding places to visit? _ Joan Murphy,
Manalapan, N.J.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The timing of your trip may depend on what you want to do as
well as how much of a bargain you are looking for, according to
Ruth Moran of the Irish Tourist Board.
</P>
<P>
   Since Christmas in Ireland is much less commmercial than in the
United States, she says, many businesses and attractions could be
closed for several days around Christmas. So that week may offer a
quieter time to spend with your son and to experience Irish life.
On the other hand, air fares will be at peak as will other costs,
since many Americans visit relatives in Ireland at that time.
</P>
<P>
   As for early April, it is in the shoulder season _ between the
rush of St. Patrick's Day celebrations and the main tourist season
_ and may be more affordable. Tourist attractions should be less
crowded, too.
</P>
<P>
   Limerick, the fourth largest city in Ireland, is famous for King
John's Castle, erected on King's Island in 1210 and a prime example
of Norman architecture. Visitors can watch archeological digs
there. Inside is a visitor center that presents ``The Story of
Limerick.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the island is the impressive St. Mary's Cathedral, where
a sound and light show is offered in the summer. You can cross the
Thomond Bridge to see the Treaty Stone, where the 1691 treaty
between England and Ireland was signed.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunt Museum moved its more than 2,000 objects last year to
the 18th-century Custom House. The museum has an important medieval
collection (including the Antrim cross of about A.D. 800), and
works by artists as diverse as Leonardo and Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the city are the thatched-roofed village and three
medieval abbeys of the Adare Heritage Center. And about 10 miles
out of the city is Bunratty Castle and Folk Park. The castle is
considered the most complete and authentic medieval castle in
Ireland, and the folk part is a living recreation of a 19th-century
village.
</P>
<P>
   You also might want to take a day trip northwest to The Burren,
an area of unusual limestone outcroppings and caves. The area's
soil and climate somehow allows plants found in the Arctic, Alpine
and Mediterranean regions to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   For more information contact the Irish Tourist Board, 345 Park
Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10154; (800) 223-6470, fax (212) 371-9059. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)My husband and I are going to Paris and Reims in
September and would like to visit a Michelin two- or three-star
restaurant. I am a vegetarian, though, and I wonder whether any
would accommodate me. _ Susan Dunnington, Westerly, R.I.(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Alain Arnaud, a spokesman for Michelin, notes that there are
two vegetarian restaurants in this year's guide to France, both of
them in the first arrondissement of Paris, which includes the
Louvre. Although neither has any stars, the fact that they are in
the guide means you should expect a good meal at them.
</P>
<P>
   Both restaurants, Entre Ciel et Terre, and La Victoire Supreme
du Coeur, use milk and eggs but not fish. They are nonsmoking
establishments that attract quite a few business executives and
office workers, especially for lunch, and a few ``baba cool,'' or
old hippies, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Entre Ciel et Terre, 5 Rue Herold, which has a wooden floor and
beams, seats 38. Its menu lists two- and three-course dinners for
about $11.50 and $14.50, and includes vegetable platters, tabbuleh,
lasagna and omelets; phone (33-1) 45.08.49.84.
</P>
<P>
   La Victoire Supreme du Coeur, 41 Rue Bourdonnais, (33-1)
40.41.93.95, seats 60, including some on the sidewalk. Its decor is
modern, with metal chairs with colored cushions. Meals cost about
$12 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   But don't give up on dining in better-rated restaurants.
Patricia Wells, the restaurant critic for The International Herald
Tribune, says that almost any good restaurant in France,
particularly Michelin-starred restaurants, would be happy to
accommodate vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some even have from time to time all-vegetable menus _ though
there may be some meat stock or chicken stock here and there,'' she
said. ``I am sure that a pure vegetarian would have no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Vegetarian travelers can also turn to the World Guide to
Vegetarianism, an Internet site at www.veg.-org/veg/Guide/. This
lists restaurants by region, sometimes with comments from patrons. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Are there cruises on the Great Lakes? Richard Caime,
Orlando, Fla.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There seems to be growing interest in cruising the Great
Lakes. Last year, a new ship, the 14,000-ton Columbus, became the
largest to cruise the lakes (there are limitations because of the
locks). She has 205 cabins for up to 420 passengers, a swimming
pool, a restaurant large enough for single-seating service and
other amenities of ocean liners.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus sails the lakes _ all of them, usually visiting
three or four per cruise _ mainly in late summer and fall. This
year's cruises, 10 days starting Sept. 24 in Chicago and 12 days
departing Detroit Oct. 3, are pretty much sold out at rates of
$1,510 to $3,680 per person double occupancy, according to
Christopher Wright of Mariport Group, the booking agent.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's schedule calls for five sailings from Aug. 24 to
Oct. 5, from various ports. Information: Mariport Group, 41
Parkhill Road East, Post Office Box 1758, Cambridge, Ontario N1R
7G8; (519) 624-5513, fax (519) 624-5569.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller ship sailing the Great Lakes is the 100-passenger
Nantucket Clipper, which has a 12-day cruise on the St. Lawrence
River and Lakes Erie and Ontario starting Aug. 4. Fares are $2,900
to $4,920. Contact Clipper Cruise Line, 7711 Bonhomme Avenue, St.
Louis. Mo. 63105; (800) 325-0100, fax (314) 727-6576.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Le Levant, a new 90-passenger yacht, is to make four
eight-day cruises on the lakes, starting and ending in Toronto and
Chicago, on June 29, July 6, Sept. 15 and Sept. 22. Rates are
$3,395 to 5,595. Contact Classical Cruises, 132 East 70th Street,
New York, N.Y. 10021; (800) 252-7745, fax (212) 774-1545.
</P>
<P>
   The 10,000-ton Seabourn Pride will sail on Lake Ontario going
from Boston to Toronto and back to New York from Sept. 27 to Oct.
19, 1999. Rates per leg: $7,490 to $17,690. Seabourn Cruise Line,
55 Francisco Street, Suite 710, San Francisco, Calif. 94133; (800)
929-4747, fax (415) 391-8518.

 (HLW)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The following sentence, in its entirety, appeared in The New
York Times Magazine last month: ``Which begs the question of
whether Upper East Side residents might be wise to refrain from
walking their corgis in the neighborhood for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   I tore it out to use in an excoriation of sentences without
clear subjects. (Famous fumble rule: ``No sentence fragments.'')
But the Rev. Darrell Berger, minister of the Fourth Universalist
Society in New York, found a greater sin:
</P>
<P>
   ``This sentence fragment uses ` &UR; begs the question &LR; ,''' he
writes, ``in the sense of a question that begs to be asked, usually
because it is obvious to all. However, I am plagued by my logic
course of some years ago, which taught me that  &UR; begging the
question &LR;  is nothing of the kind. Rather,  &UR; begging the question &LR;  is
a logically invalid form of argument that uses the point to be
proven as part of the argument for its proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen. Readers have been protesting this misuse of a term about a
concept set down by Aristotle, a student of Plato Cacheris, in his
book on logic written about 350 B.C. (Here comes mail on B.C.E.)
His Greek term  &UR; en archei aiteisthai &LR;  was translated by the Romans
as  &UR; petitio principii &LR; , and rendered into English in 1581 as
 &UR; begging the question &LR; . In whatever language, it described the
fallacy known as ``the assumption at the outset.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 1988 book, ``Thinking Logically,'' Professor James
Freeman explains: ``An argument  &UR; begs the question &LR;  when the
conclusion, in the same or different words, or a statement
presupposing the conclusion, is introduced as a premise. The case
for the conclusion ultimately depends on accepting the conclusion
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Meyers, who taught logic at Hunter College in New York,
gives an example of  &UR; begging a question &LR; : ``Lying is wrong because
you shouldn't say things that aren't true.'' There's no logic to
it; such an argument takes you around the barn, which is why it is
known as ``circular reasoning.'' You can argue that lying is wrong
because deception undermines moral values, or even that lying is
wrong because it can get you in trouble, but when you say that
lying is wrong because it's wrong, you're nothing but a
question-beggar, an illogical sidestepper of the issue and a
corrupter of all that is precious in Aristotelian thought.
</P>
<P>
   This demands that a question be asked: since readers have sent
me half a dozen examples of misuse of this phrase, in The New York
Times, no less, can it be that common usage has changed the
meaning? Put another way: When does an error become correct?
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you argue: ``Common usage makes it correct because
that's the way most people talk.'' I say that  &UR; begs the question &LR; 
because ``the way most people talk'' is the definition of ``common
usage.'' You could logically argue that ``common usage makes it
correct because language is changing constantly'' or that ``common
usage makes it correct because rigid prescriptivists have been
shown to be the laughingstocks of linguistics,'' but you cannot
argue in a straight line that ``common usage is correct because
it's common usage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dictionaries have long reported that  &UR; to beg &LR;  no longer means
only ``to ask for a handout'' or ``to entreat humbly,'' as in ``I
 &UR; beg &LR;  to differ.'' It also means _ especially in the phrases  &UR; to
beg the question &LR;  or  &UR; to beg the point &LR;  _ ``to take for granted, to
assume without logical proof.'' And beyond that, ``to avoid the
issue; to sidestep the argument.'' (Sentence fragments are OK when
used for stylistic emphasis.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder,'' wonders Ms. Meyers, not begging but asking, ``has
such frequent misuse of the technical term  &UR; to beg the question &LR; 
made it somehow a proper use of the phrase? Or does such usage
remain mistaken?''
</P>
<P>
   Stay on those ramparts, logical thinkers _ hold the fort for
Aristotle, the English language and St. George! To use  &UR; to beg the
question &LR;  as a synonym for ``to call for the question'' is a
mistake. Why? It's a mistake because it is in error. (That's
 &UR; begging the question &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOW THAT SUPPORTER
</P>
<P>
   During his televised joint news conference with China's
president, Jiang Zemin, in Beijing, President Clinton corrected
himself in a way that demonstrated a concern for precision in the
meanings of words.
</P>
<P>
   After Jiang raised the subject of Tibet's Dalai Lama, Clinton
said: ``President Jiang pointed out that he (the Dalai Lama) has a
few followers of Tibetan Buddhism even in the United States and
Europe. But most of his followers have not given up their own
religious faith. He has followers who are Christians _
 &UR; supporters &LR; , excuse me, not  &UR; followers &LR; , supporters _ who are
Christians, who are Jews, who are Muslims, who believe in the unity
of God and who believe he is a holy man.''
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; follower &LR;  is one who accepts a master or guide; for 800
years, the word has connoted spirituality, as in an adherent to a
religious cause or a disciple of a charismatic leader.
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; supporter &LR;  ( &UR; portare &LR;  is Latin for ``to carry,'' as in
 &UR; portable &LR;  or  &UR; porter &LR; ) is one who upholds another person's
principles and authority. Its overtones are more political than
spiritual: ``So was Thomas Becket,'' wrote Hobbes in ``Leviathan,''
`` ... supported against Henry the Second, by the pope.'' A
religious group  &UR; follows &LR;  its leader; a political party  &UR; supports &LR; 
its leader.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's point was that the Dalai Lama's Buddhist  &UR; followers &LR; 
had not given up their religious faith, but that in a larger group
he also had political  &UR; supporters &LR;  in other religions who respected
him as a ``holy man.''
</P>
<P>
   To lump together those who are Buddhists and those who promote
the free exercise of Buddhism as  &UR; followers &LR;  would have been a
mistake. The president moved quickly to correct himself and in so
doing drew a nice distinction.

SCRUFFY IS BADGE OF PRIDE, BUT SOME PHYSICISTS LONG FOR COOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(HLW) 
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cops carry badges, doctors wear stethoscopes, royalty wield fly
whisks and scepters, and prominent citizens of France display the
rosette of the Legion d'Honneur in their buttonholes.
</P>
<P>
   Even scientists sometimes like to proclaim their occupations
with visible symbols, although finding unobtrusive ways to display
(and celebrate) one's calling is becoming harder with the passing
years.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when scientists, technicians, architects and
engineers carried slide rules protruding from their jacket pockets.
Slide rules were useful for making rough-and-ready calculations, of
course, but they were also emblems of professional identity. Using
all the scales on a good slide rule required some knowledge of
logarithms, algebra and trigonometry, and the mere possession of
one of these elegant instruments (especially a top-of-the-line
Keuffel &AMP; Esser) was thought by some to suggest intelligence and
education.
</P>
<P>
   But with the advent of electronic calculators, slide rules
vanished, and no substitute icon of professional status was
available; plastic pocket protectors bulging with marking pens make
rotten badges.
</P>
<P>
   For physicists, however, there was another, albeit subtle, way
to proclaim membership in a professional community that scorns
conventional social images. Physicists often get into the habit of
looking somewhat scruffy, and scruffiness in itself is a badge.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have noticed that a hint of limited means
characterizes meetings of physicists, as it did at an international
conference of particle physicists in Japan last month. A handful of
university department chairmen wearing jackets and ties generally
turn up at such gatherings, but for most of the other participants,
the dress is faded jeans, sneakers or climbing boots, sport shirts
(frequently worn under backpacks stuffed with papers and books) and
sometimes, baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Caps emblazoned with the logo of the John Deere tractor maker
are sometimes seen around physics meetings these days, although the
most famous of physicists' headgear was Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer's
trademark porkpie hat, worn while he was director of Los Alamos
National Laboratory developing the first atomic bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The impoverished look of many physicists, particularly young
ones, is not merely an affectation. Good jobs in physics _ the kind
that lead to university tenure _ are few, and scientists living on
post-doctoral fellowships often have trouble making ends meet. The
cost of travel to a physics conference leaves little money for
frills, and casual style is not merely an expression of Caltech
physics chic; it is dictated by very tight budgets.
</P>
<P>
   But the simple attire favored by many physicists has come under
assault. In a letter published this month by the magazine Physics
Today, Dr. Jeremy Levy of the University of Pittsburgh has called
upon colleagues to clean up their act, not only by modernizing the
conference gadgetry used at their meetings but by dressing to look
like influential citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long,'' Levy wrote, ``we have neglected our own shabby
appearance, all the time wondering why enrollment in our discipline
is dropping. We need to educate the public about the significance,
the importance and the fascination of fundamental and applied
physics research. And we need to look cool doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy is not alone in this view. In his book on the art of oral
scientific presentation, ``Dazzle 'Em With Style,'' Dr. Robert R.H.
Anholt of Duke University's Medical Center wrote that proper attire
is as important for job applicants in the sciences and speakers at
scientific meetings as white coats are for doctors making their
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although most physicians do not need to wear a white coat
unless they are in the habit of frequently spilling their coffee,''
he wrote, ``many patients would feel uncomfortable if the attending
physician did not wear one. The white coat is part of the
professional image.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy deplored a perceived shortage at physics meetings of
Internet facilities, laser pointers, liquid-crystal projection
displays and other up-to-date devices, saying that these deficits
have a negative effect on the public image of physicists. ``We have
discovered and invented so many wonderful things, yet we look and
act like losers,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But style critics like Levy overlook an important aspect of
professional shabbiness of attire: It has become a part of the
scientist's public persona.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century ago, Arthur Conan Doyle, a medical doctor who
avidly followed developments in science, endowed one of his
fictional characters, Professor Summerlee in ``The Lost World,''
with a stereotypical image that still resonates. ``Among his minor
peculiarities,'' Doyle wrote of Summerlee, ``are that he is
careless as to his attire'' and ``unclean in his person.''
</P>
<P>
   This was hardly true of famous physicists in the early part of
the 20th century, at least when they posed for photographs. Lord
Rutherford, Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli and other giants of the
profession appear impeccably tailored. Even Albert Einstein in
early photographs is dressed in dark suits with starched wing
collars and a watch chain.
</P>
<P>
   But fashion changed.
</P>
<P>
   In Einstein's later life the world began to see the
tousle-haired creator of relativity theory wearing a sweatshirt,
pedaling a bicycle or roguishly sticking out his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's admonition to physicists to dress better is likely to
have a mixed reception.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists, having spent as many years pursuing an education and
an apprenticeship as have medical doctors, often find themselves
with ill-paid jobs and lacking the prestige society accords to
healers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people have no idea what physicists do, and their public
image, physicists acknowledge, needs polishing. But physics is a
kind of priesthood, in which a semblance of poverty is more a badge
of pride than a dishonor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay much attention to clothes,'' a young experimenter
remarked, ``but I'd look silly wearing a suit at a physics meeting,
even if I had room for one in my suitcase. I guess we care more
about substance than image.''

   IMMIGRATION SERIES (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   Last of three articles on the changing identity of American
immigrants:
</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE (Chinantla, Mexico) _ Almost every migration
story is the psychodrama of a family. For the Cruz family of
Chinantla, Mexico, it is also the story of a town, a global village
in the most literal sense. Like many modern immigrant families,
those from Chinantla straddle a border, abetted by newly
inexpensive air fares, international phone cards, and, now, by a
new Mexican law that allows them to retain their Mexican
nationality as American citizens and even confers it on their
American-born children. But since their town, too, transcends a
border, the Chinantecans' connection between here and there is
particularly vibrant. They live divided between Chinantla and New
York, but consider themselves one group, 2,500 here, 2,500 there.
The story of Chinantla is an especially magical one, the
multigenerational saga of a pueblito that has been bled of its
working-age population through a half-century of emigration. Yet
Chinantla has not faded but flourished, a would-be ghost town kept
alive by emigrants who consider the place a state of mind, an
affair of the heart and their spiritual anchor. By Deborah Sontag.

   The house in Liverpool where Paul McCartney and his family lived
in the 1950s and 60s has been acquired by the National Trust and
will open to the public on Wednesday. Paul was 13 in 1955 when the
family moved to 20 Forthlin Road, a small three-bedroom house,
where the Beatles practiced and wrote their earliest songs.
</P>
<P>
   It was rented from the Liverpool City Council by Jim and Mary
McCartney, who lived there with Paul and his younger brother,
Michael.
</P>
<P>
   The house was restored with the help of photographs taken by
Michael. Some of them, including one of Paul and John Lennon in the
front room working on ``I Saw Her Standing There,'' will be
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   While the McCartneys lived at Forthlin Road, the group evolved
from the Quarrymen to the Silver Beatles and finally to the
Beatles. ``Love Me Do,'' their first single, was written there. The
family moved in 1964, at the height of Beatlemania, partly because
of the attention of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Until Oct. 31, the house will be open noon to 5 p.m. Wednesday
through Saturday. There will be six tours a day, with a maximum of
14 people a tour. From Nov. 7 to Dec. 12, it will be open Saturday
only, with five tours from noon to 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets must be bought in advance. Visitors will take a minibus
from Speke Hall, a 1490s half-timbered National Trust property
three miles away. For reservations, call (44-151) 486-4006. For
information: (44-870) 900-0256. Admission, by credit card only, is
about $7.40, $4 for children, and includes access to the garden at
Speke Hall. &QL;

<P>
   Visitors to the two most popular attractions in Virgin Islands
National Park, on the island of St. John, must now pay fees. On
June 1, the National Park Service began charging $4 a person for
travelers over 16 who visit Trunk Bay, the long beach famous for
its snorkeling trail, and $4 for the ruins of the Annaberg Sugar
Mill. Entry to the rest of the 14,000-acre park remains free. Local
residents may buy an annual pass for $10 a person or $15 a family.
</P>
<P>
   The new fees caused controversy because entry fees were
specifically ruled out when the park was established in 1956 with a
gift of 5,000 acres from Laurance Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   The Virgin Islands park imposed the fees as part of a three-year
National Park Service program to pay for repairs and improvements.
Entrance fees have been instituted in parks that had been free, and
other fees, particularly for automobiles in the most popular parks
in the West, have been increased.
</P>
<P>
   Individual parks get to keep most of the yield; the Virgin
Islands fees will be used to improve toilets and showers, hire
lifeguards and expand ranger programs.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Winegar, a spokesman for the Park Service Southeast region,
said this month that Carnival Cruise Line had threatened to stop
its shore trips to the Virgin Islands park. After the fees began,
the line shifted its snorkeling trips outside park waters, Russell
Berry, the park superintendent, said. But the line's passengers
continued to join excursions to the sugar mill, paying $2 a person,
as do all cruise passengers visiting through local shore-excursion
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a Golden Age passport, which normally admits a car of
visitors free, a visitor to Trunk Bay or the mill will still pay
$2. The park office is on St. Thomas; call (340) 775-6238.

   The Italian sculptor Bernini was probably the most important
artist in Rome in the 17th century, prolific in his output as a
sculptor, architect and designer of spectacles. An exhibit running
to Sept. 20 at the recently restored Borghese Gallery in Rome is a
good reminder of why Bernini's star shone so brightly during that
era.
</P>
<P>
   The show coincides with the 400th anniversary of Bernini's
birth, and the site is appropriate because Bernini's most notable
early sculptures were done for Scipione Cardinal Borghese, nephew
of Pope Paul V and one of the most discerning art collectors of his
time.
</P>
<P>
   The Borghese Gallery is the permanent home of four of these,
including ``Daphne and Apollo'' and ``The Rape of Proserpine,'' and
other works on loan from American and European museums have joined
them at the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Moving through the villa's grand rooms, visitors can study
Bernini's development as a sculptor emulating the art of antiquity.
His ``Goat Amalthea With Young Jupiter and a Faun,'' was mistaken
for a Roman original for many years. There is also a series of
self-portraits, and Bernini's ``David.''
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni Lanfranco, also patronized by Cardinal Borghese,
painted the vault of the loggia in the villa with the fresco
``Council of the Gods.'' The exhibit contrasts this with a series
of paintings that originally decorated the Chapel of the Holy
Sacrament in the Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls, which for
many years had been dispersed among different museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Borghese Gallery, 5 Piazzale Scipione Borghese, is open

   The troubled history _ and luxurious life _ of Russia's last
czar, Nicholas II, and Empress Alexandra will go on view Saturday
in the inaugural presentation of the First USA Riverfront Arts
Center in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Imperial Family of
Tsarist Russia,'' which runs through Dec. 31, includes nearly 700
objects drawn from the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg,
the State Palace Museum of Tsarkoye Selo in Pushkin and the State
Archives of the Russian Federation, many of which have never before
left Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Other objects, including the Coronation Egg by Karl Faberge,
come from the Forbes Magazine Collection in New York. A 190-foot
panorama of Moscow painted in 1896 to document Nicholas' coronation
festivities has not been shown whole in this century, having been
stored at the Hermitage.
</P>
<P>
   After a short introductory audiovisual presentation, there will
be 14 galleries dressed up to replicate the palace parlors and
state rooms of the last of the Romanovs, the 300-year-old dynasty
that ended with Nicholas' abdication and execution.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view will be the gilded state carriage Alexandra rode to
the coronation, the imperial throne, court gowns and military
uniforms, jeweled regalia and furniture, and icons, vestments and
artifacts of the Russian Orthodox Church.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanovs' history is told through material from the State
Archives, which were virtually closed during 70 years of Soviet
rule. For the first time, visitors can see the family's diaries,
letters and photographs, and many items from their captivity in
Yekaterinburg in the Urals _ including a bayonet used in their 1918
murders.
</P>
<P>
   The First USA Riverfront Arts Center is at 800 South Madison
Street, an old shipbuilding warehouse in downtown Wilmington
converted as part of a river redevelopment project. Dated and timed
tickets can be bought in advance from (888) 395-0005. Tickets are
also sold at the door if space is available. Tickets cost $12.50,
$11 for ages 62 and above, $7.50 for college students, and $4 for
school children.

   Q. Is there an international agency that coordinates satellite
launchings?
</P>
<P>
   A. The United Nations keeps a registry, and a data center at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration assigns designations,
but only communications satellites are subject to practical
controls, said Dr. Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian
Center for Astrophysics.
</P>
<P>
   Every satellite must be registered to a particular country, for
reasons of liability under space law, McDowell said. A registry has
been maintained by the United Nations Secretariat since 1962, and a
registry kept by the agency's Committee on the Peaceful Uses of
Outer Space was established under a 1976 convention.
</P>
<P>
   Registry listings include a designation, determined by the World
Data Center for Rockets and Satellites at NASA/Goddard Space
Center, for each satellite. The listings include details of each
object's orbit, altitude and function.
</P>
<P>
   But McDowell said that only the International Telecommunications
Union coordinates launchings, by assigning the frequency slots for
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put up a satellite if you like, but can't broadcast
anything from it to the ground until you book frequency at that
longitude, so that it won't interfere with the next satel-lites'
transmissions,'' McDowell said. ``In practice, this must be done
years in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been thousands of launchings,'' he said, ``and lots
of little pieces are still up, including a couple of thousand
payloads and tens of thousands of pieces of space junk, mostly
really small, from things like exploded rocket stages.''

<P>
   Here's why you should care about Woody Guthrie:
</P>
<P>
   Without Woody Guthrie, there would be no Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   No Bruce Springsteen.
</P>
<P>
   No ``This Land Is Your Land.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even ``Alice's Restaurant'' (although that's another story).
</P>
<P>
   And yet Woody Guthrie, the prototypical folk singer responsible
for the revival of American protest song, isn't as well-known as he
should be. His hometown of Okemah, Okla., just hosted a weeklong
celebration of their native son to mark his birthday on July 14,
1912.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some day people are going to wake up to the fact that Woody
Guthrie and the ten thousand songs that leap and tumble off the
strings of his music box are a national possession like Yellowstone
and Yosemite, and part of the best stuff this country has to show
the world,'' opined The New Yorker's review of Woody's
autobiography, ``Bound for Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, ask the pink-haired, multiple-earringed clerk at
Borders where one might find said autobiography, and she'll answer,
``Woody Guthrie ... he was a musician, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was a musician.
</P>
<P>
   And yet even the folks who know that much don't always know what
Woody was about. He roamed and rambled the country in the 1930s,
but he wasn't some dreamy-eyed folk singer, gently strumming a
guitar as he rode the rails.
</P>
<P>
   No, Woody's guitar had the words ``This machine kills fascists''
painted on it.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous song _ ``This Land Is Your Land'' _ is not the
patriotic ditty it appears. You may know the first couple of
verses, but do you know the last?
</P>
<P>
   ``One bright sunny morning, in the shadow of the steeple
</P>
<P>
   ``By the Relief Office, I saw my people
</P>
<P>
   ``As they stood hungry, I stood there wondering if
</P>
<P>
   ``This land was made for you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, when he was slowly dying of Huntington's disease,
Woody made his son Arlo learn the radical verses of ``This Land Is
Your Land.'' The ballad's popularity was already beginning to
obscure its ironic edge _ LBJ actually suggested that it become the
new national anthem _ much like when the Republicans tried to
co-opt Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.'' as a campaign
song.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Woody would be equally misunderstood today. Take ``Christ for
President,'' one of the songs on the new album ``Mermaid Avenue,''
a collection of 15 never-before-heard Woody anthems recorded by
Billy Bragg and Wilco:
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Carpenter on the seat
</P>
<P>
   ``Away up in the capitol town
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S.A. would be on the way,
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosperity bound.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition would, no doubt, find that a pretty
nifty theme song.
</P>
<P>
   The misinformation about Woody doesn't stop there. He wasn't a
communist, although he did write a column for the party newspaper
in the 1940s. But they wouldn't take him in the party officially
because he wouldn't renounce religion.
</P>
<P>
   This will no doubt come as a surprise to one Bart Webb, who put
up a sign on his store in Okemah, Okla., protesting last weekend's
Woody Guthrie festival. ``I don't believe in what they are doing
... promoting communism and atheism,'' Webb told The Associated
Press. ``That is just what the man was.''
</P>
<P>
   (As Woody used to like to say, ``I'm not a communist, but I've
been in the red all my life.'')
</P>
<P>
   He didn't shirk war duty, either, like you'd expect a commie
pinko to. He volunteered for the Merchant Marines during World War
II, and in three years he served on three ships. All were sunk.
Woody used to sing to the crew while they were under Nazi attack.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   For perhaps the most famous folk singer in the world, Woody
really couldn't sing a lick. Biographer Joe Klein, the ``Primary
Colors'' guy, writes that listening to Woody is like biting into a
lemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ain't nobody who can sing like me, way over yonder in the
minor key,'' Woody wrote in one of the lighthearted songs on
``Mermaid Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't much of a tunesmith, either. He's credited with a
thousand or so songs, but that's primarily counting the lyrics
(which, however, must never be discounted). Woody was also a
collector of American folk song, and many of his works are original
lyrics set to the melodies that just plain folks had sung for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, but the words he wrote. Narrative ballads, ironic love
songs, silly children's songs _ and here's the crucial difference
between Woody and, say, Elton John _ songs about the oppressed,
about the working man, about politics, about religion.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson Guthrie was born 86 years ago in Okemah, Okla.,
to a couple of staunch Democrats. Father Charley was a real estate
man who fell on hard times; mother Nora early on showed signs of
Huntington's disease _ a degenerative nerve disorder _ but was
misdiagnosed and sent to a mental institution. She died there.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, Woody moved to Pampa, Texas, and lived with his Uncle
Jeff for eight years. In 1931, they embarked on a wild goose chase
from the Panhandle to the Big Bend, searching for a lost silver
mine. The 19-year-old Woody was taken with the rugged beauty of
West Texas, testimony to his lifelong love affair with the land.
``A couple of good, long, deep breaths of this early, sunny-morning
Mexican border air, and God and the devil, both, couldn't trick me
into being sad,'' he wrote in ``Seeds of Man,'' a fictionalized
account of that early adventure.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, the Dust Bowl hit, and Woody saw the haunted faces of
fellow Okies in the news, refugees gone to California. He followed
them. U.S. 66, the route made famous by John Steinbeck's Joads as
well as others, ran right near town. As he left Pampa, he penned
the trademark song that would later become a national hit for the
Weavers: ``So Long, It's Been Good To Know Ya.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Woody was one of the lucky ones. He got a job _
not picking fruit, but at a politically progressive radio station.
His fellow migrants, meanwhile, were being exploited by land owners
and growers, something that Woody chronicled in ``Do Re Mi'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, if you ain't got the do re mi, folks, you ain't got the do
re mi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why you better get back to beautiful Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas,
Georgia, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is a garden of Eden, a paradise to live in or to
see
</P>
<P>
   ``But believe it or not, you won't find it so hot
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ain't got the do re mi.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time that American unions started to organize,
and Woody's songs changed to chronicle not just the plight of the
workers but their efforts to band together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus Christ was a man who traveled through the land
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard-working man and brave
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to the rich, `Give your goods to the poor'
</P>
<P>
   ``So they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``When the love of the poor shall one day turn to hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the patience of the workers gives way
</P>
<P>
   `` `Would be better for you rich if you never had been born'
</P>
<P>
   ``So they laid Jesus Christ in his grave.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1930s, Woody moved to New York along with a young
actor and fellow communist sympathizer named Will Geer (better
known for his later work as Grandpa on ``The Waltons''). Woody fell
in with the left-winging, folk-singing crowd, landed a gig with CBS
radio and started to become famous.
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't keep from roaming and rambling, back to
California, to the Pacific Northwest, back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded a series of interviews for the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded some 150 songs for Folkways Records.
</P>
<P>
   He published his autobiography when he was just 31 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He lost a daughter in a fire. (He'd lost a sister the same way
back in Okemah.)
</P>
<P>
   He had a son and named him Arlo.
</P>
<P>
   And he never forgot the working man. In 1947, 111 coal miners
were killed in Centralia, Ill., after an inspector had declared the
mine unsafe and been ignored by owners and government officials.
Woody wrote ``The Dying Miner'':
</P>
<P>
   ``A half and an hour ago,
</P>
<P>
   ``Way down in this tunnel of coal,
</P>
<P>
   ``Gas caught fire from somebody's lamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the miners are choking in smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was on the other side of the country from migrant
workers, he continued to write about them. In 1948, after a
planeload of Mexican workers crashed in California and a news
report referred to the deceased as ``just deportees,'' Woody penned
``Deportees,'' perhaps his last great song:
</P>
<P>
   ``We died in your hills and we died on your deserts
</P>
<P>
   ``We died in your valleys and died on your plains
</P>
<P>
   ``We died in your trees and we died in your bushes
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides of the river we died just the same.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?
</P>
<P>
   ``To fall like dry leaves and rot on your topsoil
</P>
<P>
   ``And be known by no name except `deportees?' ''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   By the 1950s, Woody was beginning to act a little odd.
Irrational. It was the onset of Huntington's, the disease that
killed his mother. He was 40 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, most of them spent in the hospital,
Huntington's finally took him on Oct. 3, 1967. He was 55. Survivors
included three ex-wives (one of whom he'd married in Mexico in what
was probably a Huntington's-induced burst of dementia), six
children and a thousand songs. The latter need vigilance and care
if they are to survive.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, a young folk singer named Phil Ochs made a pilgrimage
to see Woody as he lay, paralyzed, in a hospital bed. Afterward,
Ochs penned the tribute song ``Bound for Glory:''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they sing out his praises on every distant shore
</P>
<P>
   ``But so few remember what he was fightin' for
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, why sing the songs and forget about the aim
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote them for a reason, why not sing them for the same?''
</P>

   ``Woody is just Woody. Thousands of people do not know he has
any other name. He is just a voice and a guitar. He sings the songs
of a people and I suspect that he is, in a way, that people. Harsh
voiced and nasal, his guitar hanging like a tire iron on a rusty
rim, there is nothing sweet about Woody, and there is nothing sweet
about the songs he sings. But there is something more important for
those who will listen. There is the will of the people to endure
and fight against oppression. I think we call this the American
spirit.''

   _ Woody Guthrie

<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We seem to be on the cusp of a minor Woody Guthrie resurgence:
</P>
<P>
   _ On Saturday a bronze statue of Woody was unveiled in Okemah,
Okla., 86 years and four days after he was born there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Earlier this month, Elektra Records released ``Mermaid
Avenue,'' a collection of 15 songs recorded by British folk singer
Billy Bragg and American alt-country band Wilco. Woody wrote down
the words _ but not the tunes _ while living on Mermaid Avenue on
Coney Island after World War II. Woody's daughter Nora Guthrie,
curator of the Woody Guthrie Archive in New York, approached Bragg
about setting the songs to music. The album has been hailed by
critics as one of the year's best.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woody is on one of four folk-singer stamps issued on June 26,
along with Huddie ``Leadbelly'' Ledbetter, Josh White and Sonny
Terry.
</P>
<P>
   _ In December, the Smithsonian will launch a traveling exhibit
on Woody's life and legacy, including home movies, diaries,
drawings, lyrics, photographs and recordings, including the
landmark interviews Woody taped in 1940 with folklorist Alan Lomax
for the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The essential Woody:
</P>
<P>
   _ Beginning in 1944, Woody recorded more than 150 original and
traditional songs for Folkways Records. In 1987, the Folkways
archives were acquired by the Smithsonian, and they are now
available on the Smithsonian/Folkways label. (800) 410-9815 or
www.si.edu/folkways.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woody's 1943 autobiography is ``Bound for Glory'' (New
American Library, 1995). It was made into a 1976 movie starring
David Carradine.

   _ Joe Klein (yes, that Joe Klein) wrote the authorized biography
``Woody Guthrie: A Life'' (Ballantine Books, 1982).

SINGER TRAVELS FROM ENGLAND TO OKEMAH, OKLA., TO PAY HOMAGE

(EDS: Accompanies BC-WOODY-GUTHRIE and BC-GUTHRIE-FACTS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   Just as Woody Guthrie was the chronicler and conscience of his
time and place (America of the 1930s and '40s), singer Billy Bragg
has done as much in the 1980s and '90s for his native Britain and
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   And now Bragg has completed the circle with the release of
``Mermaid Avenue,'' a collection of previously unrecorded Guthrie
songs performed by Bragg and the American country band Wilco. The
Okie who put ``This Machine Kills Fascists'' on his guitar meets
the protest-singing Brit who penned the lyric, ``Here comes the
future and you can't run from it. If you've got a blacklist, I
wanna be on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bragg crossed an ocean to come to hot and humid
Okemah, Okla., from England (where temperatures were in the upper
50s). The reason: to honor the late Guthrie in his hometown on his
birthday. Bragg was scheduled to play in front of 600 people at the
Crystal Theatre in downtown Okemah. You could say it was a sellout,
but the hootenanny was donations-only, so that wouldn't be quite
true. The show was part of a week of activities honoring Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a special day. The (festival organizers) here
in Okemah are trying to do something important,'' Bragg said the
afternoon before the concert. ``They're trying to get the people of
Okemah to honor their most famous son.''
</P>
<P>
   This son didn't just hang around Okemah, Bragg said. He ``left
Okemah and went off to the wide world and connected with it and now
the world is coming back to Okemah'' to give him his due praise.
</P>
<P>
   But are Guthrie and his music with a social conscience still
relevant today? Yes, says Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in your country for a few weeks, and with (the
racial killing in) Jasper and the Klan marching through the town,
this is an America Woody would recognize.''

<P>
   ``I told you to take one cookie, Madeline, not three!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jed, don't push your little sister! It's not nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids hearing these admonitions are having problems with
self-control, and their parents are trying to help them recognize
and rein in their behavior. Since no child is born with the ability
to curb her impulses and desires, teaching self-control is
something that parents spend a lot of time doing. In fact,
sometimes it feels as if no sooner is one explosion taken care of
than another seems ready to occur.
</P>
<P>
   But without control over her body, feelings, thoughts and
actions, your child wouldn't be able to concentrate or learn, to
give or receive affection and love, or to build and enjoy a life of
pleasure and accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   So what can you expect of your youngster at every age? When
should you start teaching self-control? And how do you do it?
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at how your child learns to control her
behavior as she grows:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Four to 18 months &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Although your baby begins life with so little control, many of
the things that you do help him to gain control as he grows. When
your 4-month-old cries because he's hungry and you call out to him
before you reach him, he begins to think, ``When Mommy talks to me,
that means she's coming to bring me nice, warm milk!'' That
reassuring thought helps him develop enough self-control to stop
crying for a minute or two until you arrive.
</P>
<P>
   When you lay your 6-month-old down on his tummy and encourage
him to roll over onto his back, you're helping him learn to control
his large muscle groups. As his mastery over his body expands,
he'll figure out the mechanics of crawling (sometime between 7 and
9 months).
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect behavioral control to come with bodily control.
On the contrary, the power of mobility (first crawling, then
cruising, then walking) is so thrilling that it's likely to spark
all sorts of impulsive, uncontrolled behavior. Now your little one
can approach and avoid objects and people at will. Instead of
crying and pointing at the stuffed bunny that he wants, he can go
and fetch it himself. This new ability is likely to be so exciting
that your child will go after and get into everything that catches
his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Around his first birthday, your youngster is likely to begin
tackling language. Not only will this give him yet another means of
getting what he wants -- calling out ``Buh! Buh!'' when he wants a
banana but can't reach it himself -- but it will likely add fuel to
the fire of his desires.
</P>
<P>
   So remember that while your baby is gaining control over his
body and mastery over language, he's still driven by wants and
needs and a voracious curiosity. He isn't able to comprehend yet
what appropriate (or safe) behavior entails, nor does he have the
sophisticated self-control necessary to practice it. So he'll need
your understanding, guidance and watchful eye to help him learn and
to keep him safe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eighteen months to 3 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world is so stimulating and new to your toddler that she
will likely want more than she can handle. Just as her eyes can be
bigger than her stomach (``I want more French fries''), her wishes
may be greater than her abilities (``I want to climb up the slide
by myself'').
</P>
<P>
   Your toddler is also developing a mind of her own. Combine that
with her increasing physical ability, and there will be times when
her impulses and desires get her into trouble (unrolling all the
toilet paper, writing on the walls with lipstick, observing out
loud that a neighbor has no hair).
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, it's your job to convince your toddler that it's in
her best interest to control her behavior -- while understanding
how difficult it is for one so young to actually accomplish this.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule of thumb: If you don't give your toddler clear
messages, she will not understand what it is you want, and she
won't be able to take control of herself. That's why it's essential
at this age to establish clear expectations (``You need to use your
words, not your hands, when you are angry'') and to offer praise
when they have been met (``I am so proud of you for telling Sally
to give back the puppet, even though I know you wanted to hit
her'').
</P>
<P>
   When those expectations are not met, address your toddler's
uncontrolled behavior with a response that encourages self-control
(``Words help; hitting hurts'') or discourages the lack of
self-control (``We'll have to end this playdate if you bite your
friend'').
</P>
<P>
   To assist your toddler further in understanding the goal of
self-control, it helps to talk about ``being the boss of your
body.'' For example, if your child is on the verge of having a
tantrum in the supermarket, you might say, ``You've got to be the
boss of your body and stop whining, or we'll have to leave right
now, before we buy blueberries.'' A child this age loves to be the
boss, so linking this wish with your expectations can give self
control a real boost.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three to 6 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Between ages 3 and 6, your child will get a great many of his
unruly impulses under control, and the times when he bites a friend
or throws a fit in the grocery will become less frequent. But as
his thinking ability evolves and he forms his first social
relationships with peers, a whole new array of complex emotions
will develop to challenge his budding self-control. These feelings
include envy (``Why can't I be as tall as Sean?''), competitiveness
(``I did my puzzle much faster than Joseph did!''), and jealousy
(``I don't want Alex to play with anyone but me'').
</P>
<P>
   Your preschooler needs your help to put these feelings into
perspective (``Some boys grow very quickly, but you're growing,
too, at just the right speed for you''), modify his feelings (``The
important thing is that you did your puzzle really well; it doesn't
matter how anyone else did''), and regulate their intensity (``I
know you like Alex so much that sometimes you want him all to
yourself. But both you and Alex need to play with other friends,
too'').
</P>
<P>
   Now your preschooler is ready to begin mastering the
self-control skills needed to take part in group activities.
Attending preschool, participating in a library story hour, or
joining church or temple services gives your child an opportunity
to practice sitting quietly, paying attention and following
directions which will serve him well when he begins grade school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Six to 10 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As your child brings her body, her impulses, her feelings and
her behavior under better control, her mind becomes free for the
focused learning that is required of a school-age child. Now she
will need to draw upon the self control that she's developed so far
to pay attention to what the teacher is saying, follow
instructions, concentrate on what she's doing or studying, get
along in a group, tolerate frustration and persevere when she
fails.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to increase a grade schooler's self-control is to
give her plenty of opportunity to practice. That means reminding
her to plan ahead (``Have you set aside some time to write your
report? If you don't, you may not have enough time to do a good
job'') and helping her to use reason instead of emotion to solve
problems (``If you explain to Sarah why you're upset, she might
understand and do something about it, but if you lose your temper,
she'll lose hers, too -- and that will solve nothing'').
</P>
<P>
   Athletic activities, with their emphasis on good character and
sportsmanship, and homework, with its emphasis on planning and
organization, also help build your grade schooler's self-control.
You can reinforce these lessons at home by offering praise each
time your youngster succeeds in bringing a new aspect of her
behavior under her control (``Mrs. Lyndon said that you've really
been concentrating on your homework lately. You must feel good
about doing so well with your studies'').
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ten to 12 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As your child approaches puberty, he faces profound physical and
psychological changes that make him moodier, more irritable, more
sensitive and more reactive all of which challenge his
self-control. Your youngster may take offense at the slightest
criticism and waffle between being your old, familiar child one
minute and some new, unfamiliar preteen the next.
</P>
<P>
   To help your youngster get his bearings, define when
self-control is a requirement and when it's optional. You might,
for instance permit some leeway (rough language, boisterous
behavior, baggy clothes) when he's with friends but insist that he
meet your expectations (clean language, good manners, proper dress)
when his grandmother comes to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that we all have a meltdown point and that
everyone loses control sometimes. But when we help our kids learn
to take control of themselves, we give them a powerful tool to take
control of their lives.

   The mountain air is alive with sound -- with hoots and hollers,
shrilling whistles, the thrumming and trilling of drums and harps
and fiddles.
</P>
<P>
   There must be 2,000 of us here, advancing like giddy marauders
over the treeless plain. To my left the line stretches
three-quarters of a mile before it disappears beyond a grassy rise.
To my right it runs another 600 yards to a sagging wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close the holes!'' shouts a man in combat fatigues. ``Stick
together! You in the back, hurry up!''
</P>
<P>
   My head throbs and my legs are weak, but my lowlander's pride
pushes me on. We have trudged a good two miles, stumbling and
sweating, when it suddenly becomes clear what we are doing here.
</P>
<P>
   From the left comes a flash of movement as hundreds of golden,
long-necked animals race out of nowhere into the open space before
us. They are preternaturally lovely, with huge dark eyes on narrow
sculpted heads. When they reach the fence they stop and turn,
swooshing back up the slope in silent flight. But by now hundreds
more have poured over the hill, and 30 yards in front of me the two
groups meet, to stop and swirl and eddy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the chaku, or great vicuna round-up, at the Pampa
Galeras National Reserve 13,000 feet high on the western flank of
the Peruvian Andes. By mid-afternoon, some 2,500 vicunas will have
been corraled, sheared, vetted, then released back into the wild.
By the next morning, the people of the nearby village of Lucanas
will have begun to clean the fleece, and to dream about what to do
with the profits.
</P>
<P>
   The chaku is a pre-Inca custom that disappeared after the
Spanish conquest in the 1500s. It was revived 10 years ago by
conservationists who decided that it was still the best way to
harvest precious vicuna fiber without killing the animals. Now an
annual event at dozens of locations throughout Peru, the chaku is
one of the main reasons for the recovery of a creature which, a
generation ago, teetered on the verge of oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   For the Incas, the vicuna and its fleece were closely associated
with divinity. The animal -- an evolutionary uncle of the camel --
was thought to be descended from the mountain gods' own herds. The
cloth was reserved for members of the nobility; anyone else wearing
it was put to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards valued the vicuna, too, but they had none of the
Incas' genius for mobilizing large groups of people, so they
replaced the chaku with the hunting of vicunas with guns. By the
time Simon Bolivar liberated Peru in the 1820s, the ``walking gold
of the Andes'' was in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Despite bans and decrees dating back to Bolivar's time, poaching
went virtually unchecked for the next 150 years. By the 1960s,
fewer than 10,000 vicunas survived in Peru, down from a
pre-conquest population of about 2 million. ``At that point there
was no guarantee that vicunas would survive the century,'' says
Jane Wheeler, a Lima-based American biologist. ``An epidemic or a
few hard winters could have wiped them out.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the sale or purchase
of all vicuna products worldwide. But a black market still thrived,
fueled by a demand by the world's ultra-wealthy for $3,000 sweaters
and $20,000 coats. Thousands of vicunas were slaughtered every
year, usually by itinerant poachers, often with the complicity of
cash-strapped local farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in 1991, when Peru gave legal custody of
its vicunas to the mountain communities where the animals lived.
The authorities began building corrals and teaching villagers the
old techniques for trapping and shearing. Suddenly there was a
reason -- and a method -- for keeping the animals alive.
</P>
<P>
   The chaku became official policy in 1993. In 1995, CITES allowed
the country's live-shorn vicuna fiber to be sold internationally.
As hoped, the vicuna population soared. In 1994 the government
counted 66,500 vicunas in Peru; last year there were 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was in giving the campesinos the right to profit from
the sale of the fiber,'' says Wheeler. ``They quickly realized that
they could earn more by shearing the animals live than they could
by killing them and selling the hides on the black market.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from the high Andes to the high fashion ateliers
of Milan, Tokyo, and Paris. But for the conservation program to
work, the vicuna fiber has to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Bridging the two worlds is the responsibility of the
International Vicuna Consortium, composed of the Peruvian
manufacturer Incalpaca TPX and Italian textile powerhouses Lanerie
Agnona and Loro-Piana. The consortium was set up to buy, process
and market the fiber collected at the chakus. During 1996 and 1997
the consortium handled just over 2,900 pounds of clean fiber,
enough for 600 coats. Men's scarves, at $400, are the least
expensive items on the market; women's coats go from $12,000 to
well over $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian partners have sold custom-woven cloth to European
fashion houses such as Chanel and Armani. The Peruvians have had
most of their success in Japan. All are eagerly awaiting the
reopening of the American market (although the United States is a
CITES signatory, trade in vicuna fiber is still banned under U.S.
law).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invested quite a bit of money in this, and so far it
hasn't really been profitable,'' says Francois Patthey, executive
vice president of Inca Group, parent company of Incalpaca TPX.
``But the money isn't the point for us right now. If the vicuna
population figures are accurate, this is already a success story.
More than 600 mountain communities are benefiting from the
proceeds. It's a fantastic thing for the country.''

FALL TV TOUR HIGHLIGHTS, FROM `FULL HOUSE' TWINS TO A FULL MOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what does it say about the state of television programming
when, a week into the annual fall season preview, the most striking
visual thus far involved David Cross, co-star of HBO's ``Mr. Show
With Bob and David,'' turning to a roomful of journalists, bending
over, and yanking down his pants.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, there's more. HBO Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes uses the
mooning to segue into a Q-and-A session about the cable channel's
effectiveness, pointing out that Cross' glowing behind showed not a
bit of artificiality. Just like HBO movies and series, you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our programming will live up to THAT today,'' Bewkes
promised. Or should that be ``warned''?
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the envelope is now cliche in the world of cable, so
much so that a naked butt no longer constitutes emotional shock.
Thank goodness this came well after a very pregnant Jodie Foster
arrived, touting her new Showtime film, ``The Baby Dance,'' a
well-crafted, well-written story of adoption, class and love. Or we
could have experienced the first live birth at the Television
Critics Press Tour, not to mention its first serious lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that following cable was PBS, which offered a slew of
culturally rich, thoughtful programming: KERA-TV's Sylvia Komatsu
was here as executive producer of ``The U.S.-Mexican War
1846-1848''; Orlando Bagwell discussed his six-hour project on
slavery. (This, of course, presented critics with terrific
opportunities to hit the pool or hustle to that 40 percent-off sale
at Macy's.)
</P>
<P>
   ABC, meanwhile, is trying to rebound from a disastrous season in
which it scuttled one of the year's best programs (''Nothing
Sacred'') and took a PR beating from some gays and lesbians after
kicking ``Ellen'' to the curb. It waxed the proceedings by sending
giant Snickers bars to reporters' rooms. The attached note admitted
that, yes, it was a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Screenings that night included ``Maximum Bob,'' an offbeat,
hourlong comedy drama adapted from Elmore Leonard's bestselling
novel. Set in the mythical Florida town of Deep Water, it stars
Beau Bridges as Bob Gibbs, a power-hungry, slightly crooked judge
who meets his match in Liz Vassey, who practices law in
figure-flattering blouses, showing how much ``Ally McBeal'' has
raised the fashion bar in courtroom settings. Vassey is actually
the normal one. Bob's wife, Leanne (Kiersten Warren) is a local
celebrity who starred in a mermaid act until she had a near-death
experience with an alligator.
</P>
<P>
   It's better to watch ``Maximum Bob,'' which begins Aug. 4 but is
not on the fall schedule, than to try to explain it.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it sinks or swims, this is the kind of risky programming
ABC needs. Though one session introduced a very charming Rick
Schroder as the replacement for Jimmy Smits on ``NYPD Blue,''
another included the sinking ship called ``Good Morning, America,''
in which Fort Worth's Lisa McRee tried to put a positive spin on
its foundering ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning infotainment show set a standard for ratings
futility recently; it was 24 percent off its audience numbers from
a year ago. ``Today'' has increased viewership by some 8 percent,
and CBS' ``This Morning'' is gaining ground from the rear;
``GMA's'' viewers are apparently simply changing the channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the risks coming in,'' said a tired McRee, who had just
flown in from ``GMA's'' New York studios. Here is a good time to
mention that McRee's husband still lives in Los Angeles, in the
house they haven't even put on the market. Hmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Changes will continue: Weatherman Spencer Christian is out.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ABC reloads with eight new series this fall, only one
heavily favored to break out. ``Two of a Kind'' marks the return of
Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, the cutie-pie teeny weenies who
literally grew up on television's most innocuous series, ``Full
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Now preteens, they play opposites. One is into boys (Ashley)
while the other (Mary-Kate) wants to mow them down on the baseball
diamond. Their dad (Christopher Sieber) is a college professor and
single father who uses a student (Sally Wheeler) as a baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   The series isn't silly, and it's shrewdly cast. Still, the
Olsens are now confronted with having to act. Not that it matters
to Olsen fans. Lined up with ``Boy Meets World'' and ``Sabrina, the
Teenage Witch,'' this is the season's sure-shot hit.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But overall, ABC has many holes to fill. And though network
officials tried to assure critics that ``TV is Good,'' they
contradicted themselves by introducing ``Fantasy Island.''
</P>
<P>
   That series was met with laughter from most critics, and few
were all that pleased with ``Cupid,'' a drama about a man who
thinks he's the love matchmaker, or ``The Secret Lives of Men,'' a
silly sitcom about three guys spewing guy things on a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys,'' a sitcom starring comic D.L. Hughley as an
entrepreneur having difficulty living in his new all-white suburb,
got favorable notices, although he spent most of his hourlong
session fending off criticism _ fired by black critics _ for using
stereotypes in his zeal to make a well-intentioned point.
</P>
<P>
   Another ``maybe'' showcased here was a smart, sharp comedy
called ``Sports Night.'' This half-hour series dramatizes ESPN's
``Sportscenter'' much the way ``Lateline'' tried (in vain, however)
with ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   The series follows two anchors (Peter Krause and Dan Rydell).
The only familiar face is Robert Guillaume as the no-nonsense
executive producer, but this is a good thing for a series that has
created unsitcomlike characters. For a minute there, I thought I
was watching HBO. And no wonder. The series is produced by Aaron
Sorkin, who wrote ``A Few Good Men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was pretty evident from reading the script that
it wasn't like anything that was on TV,'' Krause said. ``The
writing is more intelligent, the storytelling stronger, and I found
the comedy to be actually funnier and more engaging.''
</P>
<P>
   Which means it doesn't stand much of a chance on network TV.

<P>
   If you laughed at the little Benji dog in the full-body cast in
the trailers for ``There's Something About Mary,'' you might find a
few more laughs in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you might get hit by a car and wind up in a
full-body cast yourself _ certainly preferable to sitting through
this dreck.
</P>
<P>
   Directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly's track record includes
``Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' (1994) and ``Kingpin'' (1996). The brotherly
boneheads have once again surrounded themselves with an impressive
variety of talent _ Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon, Lee Evans, Cameron
Diaz _ but that only succeeds in making audiences wonder what
possessed these people to appear in this garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller plays Ted, a high school dork whose dream date with Mary
(Diaz) is thwarted by a men's-room zipper accident. Fast-forward
more than a decade, and still-smhdten Ted hires a sleazy private
eye (Dillon) to track her down. But Dillon begins to sabotage
things when he falls for Mary, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seems this is par for the course for Mary (there's something
about her, remember?). She's got an entire platoon of obsessed
suitors/stalkers who'll do or say anything to have her.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems the Farrellys will do or say anything to make you
laugh at these idiots _ anything, that is, except stooping to, say,
wit. There's enough crass toilet humor here to make the entire run
of Comedy Central's ``South Park'' seem like it was scripted by
Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' is rated R for crude humor,
profanity, nudity and brain-damaging subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Film: ``There's Something About Mary'' Directors: Peter and
Bobby Farrelly Stars: Ben Stiller, Cameron Diaz, Matt Dillon
Length: 119 min. Rated: R Rating: 1/2 star

BUSH LOOKING MORE AND MORE LIKE A PRESIDENTIAL WANNA-BE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The would-be candidate is coy, but most Republican
strategists are dead-solid certain that Texas Gov. George W. Bush
will launch his campaign for the White House next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush downplays his presidential ambitions, his potential
opponents are bracing for the other shoe _ or, in this case, cowboy
boot _ to drop. Expectations of a Bush candidacy solidified into
near certainty among Republican insiders with the governor's recent
musings about a possible White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in The New York Times last week, Bush was
quoted as saying that his wife, Laura, ``knows she can be a great
first lady of America.'' He also offered eight reasons he would
make a good presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The list included his willingness to stand up to his opponents'
attacks, his record in Texas, his campaign talents and the
experience he gained in his father's presidential campaigns. The
interview created a buzz in GOP circles, but Bush said anyone who
thinks he was signaling his intention to run is reading too much
into his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a situation now where there's all kinds of
speculation, none of which I've encouraged,'' he said after the
article appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it seems the only politically savvy Republican who
questions whether Bush will run is George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most surprising political development to me in 1999 would
be if George Bush didn't run,'' said Tom Rath, an experienced New
Hampshire activist who has signed on with former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander for the 2000 election. ``I fully expect him.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Bush is torn about the effects of a campaign on his
family, he can at least take comfort in the fact that other GOP
hopefuls share his angst. They're worried about the effect of his
candidacy on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone assumes he'll get in and that he's the
800-pound gorilla,'' said Washington lobbyist Ed Gillespie, who is
advising Rep. John Kasich of Ohio on a likely White House bid.
``He's clearly a formidable candidate with a lot of advantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possible Republican contenders who are keeping an eye on
developments in Texas include publisher Steve Forbes, Sen. John
Ashcroft of Missouri, conservative activist Gary Bauer and House
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gingrich, who share the advantage of high name
recognition and an impressive donor base, say they will not make a
decision until next year. Bush said he expects to announce his
plans sometime after the Texas Legislature convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the appropriate time _ and now is not the appropriate time
_ I will make a very personal decision,'' he said. ``And when I
make that decision, I will stand up and tell everybody exactly what
is on my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush added that the only thing on his mind now is running for
governor. He is heavily favored in the November matchup against the
Democratic challenger, Land Commissioner Garry Mauro. Although Bush
clearly relishes the possibility of a landslide win in Texas, he
said he is not paying much attention to early presidential polls
that show him leading the GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed and have been amazed when I read my name in these
polls. It is frankly shocking,'' he said. ``There is nothing I can
do about it except smile and say, `I want to be the governor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders in Iowa and New Hampshire, the traditional
kick-off states for presidential candidates, say they have seen no
evidence that Bush is laying the groundwork for a campaign. The
first nominating contests will not be held until February 2000, but
other Republican hopefuls are actively seeking supporters in the
two politically crucial states.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have, in a sense, is a stealth war for the
activists,'' said Dennis Goldford, who heads Drake University's
political science department in Des Moines, Iowa. ``If Bush is
working on people, it's very quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rath, who aided former President George Bush in his 1992 New
Hampshire campaign, said other former Bush allies in the Granite
State seem to be waiting for a go-ahead signal from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of old friends of the family that are winking
and nodding,'' Rath said. ``I don't know that the governor himself
is doing anything. I know that there are people around who claim to
have been talked to by friends of his. This is a very elaborate
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his decision on whether to elbow his way toward center
stage or remain on the sidelines will hinge on highly personal
issues, including the possible effect on his teen-age twin
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was president,'' he said. ``I have seen the life from a
unique perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also wants to make it clear that weighing his big
decision does not keep him awake at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is to live my life to the fullest at the moment.
That is how I've lived my life in the past, and that is exactly
what I am going to do,'' he said. ``I view my life as a series of
chapters. I don't view myself staying in politics all my life. I'm
not sure what my future will hold, and I'm not worried about it.''

`ZORRO' UNMASKS BANDERAS' COMIC TALENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent interviews, Anthony Hopkins has said he was smitten by
the script for the crisply staged action film, ``The Mask of
Zorro,'' because he gets to play someone who exists from the knees
down for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hopkins gets to bend his knees that much. In the first
part of ``Zorro,'' we see so much of Hopkins' stunt double that we
wonder why the stuntman doesn't get lead billing. But it's kind of
touching to see Hopkins buckle his swash and jump into this role.
</P>
<P>
   After Don Diego De La Vega (Hopkins) is captured and loses his
wife and infant daughter to his nemesis, California Gov. Don Rafael
(Stuart Wilson), ``Zorro'' cuts to the bumbling, small-time thieves
the Murrietta Brothers, Alejandro (Antonio Banderas) and Joaquim
(Victor Rivers). They anger the authorities, and Alejandro barely
escapes with his life. (His heroic brother is not so lucky.) Diego
takes the impulsive, incompetent Alejandro and transforms him into
an instrument of revenge fit for both their purposes. Not an easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zorro'' is deeply stylized summer fun, a tribute to all the
1930s schwing!fests _ the healthy, happy swashbucklers soaring
through the air, winking slyly as they draw their blades to save
the trodden-down, as George Hamilton put it in 1981's
underrecognized farce ``Zorro, The Gay Blade.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas has become a sleek physical comedian. His wily,
satisfied smile _ he can't believe he's outwitting the governor's
men through grace-under-fire ingenuity _ is just the thing to give
unembarrassed humor to his overripe good looks. Banderas makes
spirited fun of himself, which relieves the lack of ease this
ridiculously handsome man felt in front of the cameras. He never
knew what to do with himself _ nor did his directors _ but ``Mask
of Zorro'' liberates Banderas by offering him the gift of playful
self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   Director Martin Campbell, who scraped as many of the barnacles
off the James Bond franchise as he could in ``Goldeneye,'' goes the
back-in-the-day clanging sword epics one better. Here, Campbell
employs the wide-screen precision of Hong Kong's swordplay epics,
and uses the circular motion of martial arts to add sparkling
clarity to the action.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the nimble, old-fashioned staging, you know exactly
where everyone is, and how he relates to the action, at all times.
If Richard Donner had used such precision, the fight scenes in
``Lethal Weapon 4'' wouldn't look as if they were staged in a broom
closet lit by a 20-watt bulb. (An Amblin production, ``Zorro'' also
shows the influence of ``Indiana Jones''-brand derring-do, perhaps
a corporate tribute to executive producer Steven Spielberg.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a he-movie, either. Diego's daughter (Catherine
Zeta-Jones, who's almost as ravishing as Banderas, which means
she's a real stunner) was raised by Don Rafael, his nemesis. She
has grown up to be quite a fencer, and engages Zorro in blade-play,
after having tangoed up a sweat with Alejandro in his civilian
identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zorro'' also scores points by using as Alejandro's enemy a
smug, blond lug of a gringo, Capt. Love (Matt Letscher). (The
makeup is witty, too. When we first see Wilson's Don Rafael, he
looks like the melodramatic renderings of Simon Bolivar on Cuban
cigar bands.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' is sunny and energetic, though its
bladesmanship may not hold the attention of some viewers, who might
prefer to see toe-to-toe battles staged with Glocks. And at 136
minutes, it chews up a big chunk of time. Still, this is just the
kind of movie that could make Banderas a real movie star, instead
of a perceived one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mask of Zorro'' is rated PG-13 for mild profanity, lots of
swordplay and intense action, peculiar _ and potentially upsetting
_ displays of body parts, and the slaying of a baby's mother.
</P>

EVERY GENERATION THE MYSTERIOUS LANGUAGE OF BASEBALL UNITES FATHERS
AND SONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One night about six weeks ago, while I was lying in our bedroom
watching the Texas Rangers on television, my 7-year-old son came in
with a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I watch with you?'' Patrick asked.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I said. He crawled up on the bed, where in past years
he might have watched a pitch or two, lost interest and
disappeared. But this night he wanted to know the score, and the
questions kept coming after that. What's a grand slam? An error?
Why can that man steal? What's a double play? Thus it seemed that a
watershed moment in our lives had come.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, Patrick was back beside me for the next night's
ballgame. And the game after that. Before long, he could tell you
that his favorite Ranger, catcher ``Pudge'' Rodriguez, hit after
first baseman Will Clark in the batting order, and he worried when
Pudge missed a few games with a sprained ankle. Patrick eventually
knew every player in the Rangers lineup. He cheered Rangers runs
and groaned with me when innings went sour. Then, around the fourth
or fifth inning, he would get sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to bed now,'' Patrick would say, sliding off the bed
and trudging to his room. But it was drowsiness that took him from
the game now, not lack of interest.
</P>
<P>
   My wife noticed the change, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, Patrick has become such a guy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Which was true. But something more than guyness had happened. I
had long vowed to let my son's passions and interests take him
where they may, to not try to create a replica of myself. But I
hoped nonetheless that he would come to enjoy a few of the things I
did. The outdoors, for one thing. Baseball, for another. Playing
catch. Rooting for the major-league team. Box scores. Baseball as
I've loved it since I was old enough to swing a plastic bat.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it happened through osmosis, with all the hours I've spent
watching baseball at home, studying batting averages in the morning
paper. But it happened. Patrick loved baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Pudge's ankle still hurt?'' he asked one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but he'll be back in a few games.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny how answering such a simple question can give a father
such joy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cliche, I know, the ties between baseball and fathers
and their children. But with this cliche, no matter how much you
scrub it, the golden sheen never wears off. Each generation
experiences it anew. I now know for a fact there is nothing trite
about spending evenings watching baseball with your kid.
</P>
<P>
   For baseball is more than a game. It is a language created
especially for dads. Too often, we men are struck dumb when it
comes to our children. Mothers know more intuitively which words
will penetrate young hearts and minds. Dads hem and haw, a little
bewildered by little people, at a loss as to how to relate to them.
We love our children as much as mothers, but generally have a much
harder time expressing it.
</P>
<P>
   So God gave us baseball, a language to suit all occasions.
Writer Roger Kahn, for one great example, tells of his boyhood in
the 1930s, when his father was ordered (by his mother) to explain
the birds and the bees. Kahn's father bought his son a baseball,
took him to the park, and started hitting grounders instead.
</P>
<P>
   While recovering from a boyhood case of scarlet fever, my friend
Larry Swindell memorized a slew of baseball statistics, thereby
dazzling a baseball-loving father who had pretty much ignored him
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without baseball, I never would have gotten through to him,''
Larry tells me now. ``That's why I became a baseball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   My own father worked long hours when I was a kid. He was tired
when he got home, his attention badly splintered in a family that
would grow to seven children. But there was one time when I knew I
had his undivided attention. He would take a glove, and pace off
the distance, and squat down like a catcher, pounding his mitt,
holding it up for me as a target. I had a lively left arm as a kid,
could make the air hiss as I fired the ball toward him.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I made his hand burn and he would pull off his glove
and shake it. But he looked at me approvingly as I practiced my
pitching. As a kid, those looks were more precious to me than gold.
In memory, they still are.
</P>
<P>
   Now I speak the language of baseball to my son, who is a guy. We
play catch in the street, or take batting practice at the park.
Often it is a wordless conversation between us, lying next to each
other on summer nights, pitch after pitch, inning after inning
until Patrick grows weary. We are blissfully content but always
expectant, waiting for a Rangers home run.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested to Patrick that we wait until September, when
the weather has cooled some, to attend a Rangers game in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait that long,'' he said in all of his newfound
guyness.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turns out there's no way I could wait that long, either. Patrick
had been to the ballpark several times in years past, but only as a
child, not as a guy. A toddler, for instance, cannot appreciate the
walk from the parking lot to the stadium, a happy pilgrimage with
the hundreds of other fans, or the meaty smells of the concession
stands inside, or the buzz of the pregame crowd in the bustling
concourse. A guy can.
</P>
<P>
   We rode up on two escalators that recent night at The Ballpark,
climbed to the upper deck, and finally passed through the portal,
looking down as if from the lip of a great canyon to a
spectacularly green oasis far below, where the Dodgers and Rangers
ran their pregame sprints. Patrick's jaw dropped then. Mine, too. I
think a memory was made.
</P>
<P>
   We found our seats and watched fly balls arch poetically into
outfielders' gloves, infielders pick hot shots from the dirt, a
Dodgers home run. Patrick went through a bag of peanuts, a bag of
popcorn and two Cokes by the end of the fourth inning. In the
sixth, my friend Danny bought his son D.J. and Patrick ice cream,
which they immediately applied from chin to forehead. We all lost
in the scoreboard dot race. Every so often came a breeze to soften
the hot night. We sang ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' in the
seventh-inning stretch.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that in 30 years Patrick will recall that the Rangers
lost, 4-1. But I know he will remember the night. Every so often, I
found myself watching him instead of the game, the toothless grin,
the freckles, the big blue eyes twinkling in the stadium's
artificial light. We spoke the language of baseball that night,
words that went straight to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat beside him in the ballpark, it occurred to me that
there are times when nine innings aren't nearly enough.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I told you to take one cookie, Madeline, not three!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jed, don't push your little sister! It's not nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The kids hearing these admonitions are having problems with
self-control, and their parents are trying to help them recognize
and rein in their behavior. Since no child is born with the ability
to curb her impulses and desires, teaching self-control is
something that parents spend a lot of time doing. In fact,
sometimes it feels as if no sooner is one explosion taken care of
than another seems ready to occur.
</P>
<P>
   But without control over her body, feelings, thoughts and
actions, your child wouldn't be able to concentrate or learn, to
give or receive affection and love, or to build and enjoy a life of
pleasure and accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   So what can you expect of your youngster at every age? When
should you start teaching self-control? And how do you do it?
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at how your child learns to control her
behavior as she grows:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Four to 18 months &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Although your baby begins life with so little control, many of
the things that you do help him to gain control as he grows. When
your 4-month-old cries because he's hungry and you call out to him
before you reach him, he begins to think, ``When Mommy talks to me,
that means she's coming to bring me nice, warm milk!'' That
reassuring thought helps him develop enough self-control to stop
crying for a minute or two until you arrive.
</P>
<P>
   When you lay your 6-month-old down on his tummy and encourage
him to roll over onto his back, you're helping him learn to control
his large muscle groups. As his mastery over his body expands,
he'll figure out the mechanics of crawling (sometime between 7 and
9 months).
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect behavioral control to come with bodily control.
On the contrary, the power of mobility (first crawling, then
cruising, then walking) is so thrilling that it's likely to spark
all sorts of impulsive, uncontrolled behavior. Now your little one
can approach and avoid objects and people at will. Instead of
crying and pointing at the stuffed bunny that he wants, he can go
and fetch it himself. This new ability is likely to be so exciting
that your child will go after and get into everything that catches
his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Around his first birthday, your youngster is likely to begin
tackling language. Not only will this give him yet another means of
getting what he wants -- calling out ``Buh! Buh!'' when he wants a
banana but can't reach it himself -- but it will likely add fuel to
the fire of his desires.
</P>
<P>
   So remember that while your baby is gaining control over his
body and mastery over language, he's still driven by wants and
needs and a voracious curiosity. He isn't able to comprehend yet
what appropriate (or safe) behavior entails, nor does he have the
sophisticated self-control necessary to practice it. So he'll need
your understanding, guidance and watchful eye to help him learn and
to keep him safe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Eighteen months to 3 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The world is so stimulating and new to your toddler that she
will likely want more than she can handle. Just as her eyes can be
bigger than her stomach (``I want more French fries''), her wishes
may be greater than her abilities (``I want to climb up the slide
by myself'').
</P>
<P>
   Your toddler is also developing a mind of her own. Combine that
with her increasing physical ability, and there will be times when
her impulses and desires get her into trouble (unrolling all the
toilet paper, writing on the walls with lipstick, observing out
loud that a neighbor has no hair).
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, it's your job to convince your toddler that it's in
her best interest to control her behavior -- while understanding
how difficult it is for one so young to actually accomplish this.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule of thumb: If you don't give your toddler clear
messages, she will not understand what it is you want, and she
won't be able to take control of herself. That's why it's essential
at this age to establish clear expectations (``You need to use your
words, not your hands, when you are angry'') and to offer praise
when they have been met (``I am so proud of you for telling Sally
to give back the puppet, even though I know you wanted to hit
her'').
</P>
<P>
   When those expectations are not met, address your toddler's
uncontrolled behavior with a response that encourages self-control
(``Words help; hitting hurts'') or discourages the lack of
self-control (``We'll have to end this playdate if you bite your
friend'').
</P>
<P>
   To assist your toddler further in understanding the goal of
self-control, it helps to talk about ``being the boss of your
body.'' For example, if your child is on the verge of having a
tantrum in the supermarket, you might say, ``You've got to be the
boss of your body and stop whining, or we'll have to leave right
now, before we buy blueberries.'' A child this age loves to be the
boss, so linking this wish with your expectations can give self
control a real boost.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Three to 6 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Between ages 3 and 6, your child will get a great many of his
unruly impulses under control, and the times when he bites a friend
or throws a fit in the grocery will become less frequent. But as
his thinking ability evolves and he forms his first social
relationships with peers, a whole new array of complex emotions
will develop to challenge his budding self-control. These feelings
include envy (``Why can't I be as tall as Sean?''), competitiveness
(``I did my puzzle much faster than Joseph did!''), and jealousy
(``I don't want Alex to play with anyone but me'').
</P>
<P>
   Your preschooler needs your help to put these feelings into
perspective (``Some boys grow very quickly, but you're growing,
too, at just the right speed for you''), modify his feelings (``The
important thing is that you did your puzzle really well; it doesn't
matter how anyone else did''), and regulate their intensity (``I
know you like Alex so much that sometimes you want him all to
yourself. But both you and Alex need to play with other friends,
too'').
</P>
<P>
   Now your preschooler is ready to begin mastering the
self-control skills needed to take part in group activities.
Attending preschool, participating in a library story hour, or
joining church or temple services gives your child an opportunity
to practice sitting quietly, paying attention and following
directions which will serve him well when he begins grade school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Six to 10 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As your child brings her body, her impulses, her feelings and
her behavior under better control, her mind becomes free for the
focused learning that is required of a school-age child. Now she
will need to draw upon the self control that she's developed so far
to pay attention to what the teacher is saying, follow
instructions, concentrate on what she's doing or studying, get
along in a group, tolerate frustration and persevere when she
fails.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to increase a grade schooler's self-control is to
give her plenty of opportunity to practice. That means reminding
her to plan ahead (``Have you set aside some time to write your
report? If you don't, you may not have enough time to do a good
job'') and helping her to use reason instead of emotion to solve
problems (``If you explain to Sarah why you're upset, she might
understand and do something about it, but if you lose your temper,
she'll lose hers, too -- and that will solve nothing'').
</P>
<P>
   Athletic activities, with their emphasis on good character and
sportsmanship, and homework, with its emphasis on planning and
organization, also help build your grade schooler's self-control.
You can reinforce these lessons at home by offering praise each
time your youngster succeeds in bringing a new aspect of her
behavior under her control (``Mrs. Lyndon said that you've really
been concentrating on your homework lately. You must feel good
about doing so well with your studies'').
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ten to 12 years &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As your child approaches puberty, he faces profound physical and
psychological changes that make him moodier, more irritable, more
sensitive and more reactive all of which challenge his
self-control. Your youngster may take offense at the slightest
criticism and waffle between being your old, familiar child one
minute and some new, unfamiliar preteen the next.
</P>
<P>
   To help your youngster get his bearings, define when
self-control is a requirement and when it's optional. You might,
for instance permit some leeway (rough language, boisterous
behavior, baggy clothes) when he's with friends but insist that he
meet your expectations (clean language, good manners, proper dress)
when his grandmother comes to visit.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, remember that we all have a meltdown point and that
everyone loses control sometimes. But when we help our kids learn
to take control of themselves, we give them a powerful tool to take
control of their lives.

<P>
   The mountain air is alive with sound -- with hoots and hollers,
shrilling whistles, the thrumming and trilling of drums and harps
and fiddles.
</P>
<P>
   There must be 2,000 of us here, advancing like giddy marauders
over the treeless plain. To my left the line stretches
three-quarters of a mile before it disappears beyond a grassy rise.
To my right it runs another 600 yards to a sagging wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Close the holes!'' shouts a man in combat fatigues. ``Stick
together! You in the back, hurry up!''
</P>
<P>
   My head throbs and my legs are weak, but my lowlander's pride
pushes me on. We have trudged a good two miles, stumbling and
sweating, when it suddenly becomes clear what we are doing here.
</P>
<P>
   From the left comes a flash of movement as hundreds of golden,
long-necked animals race out of nowhere into the open space before
us. They are preternaturally lovely, with huge dark eyes on narrow
sculpted heads. When they reach the fence they stop and turn,
swooshing back up the slope in silent flight. But by now hundreds
more have poured over the hill, and 30 yards in front of me the two
groups meet, to stop and swirl and eddy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the chaku, or great vicuna round-up, at the Pampa
Galeras National Reserve 13,000 feet high on the western flank of
the Peruvian Andes. By mid-afternoon, some 2,500 vicunas will have
been corraled, sheared, vetted, then released back into the wild.
By the next morning, the people of the nearby village of Lucanas
will have begun to clean the fleece, and to dream about what to do
with the profits.
</P>
<P>
   The chaku is a pre-Inca custom that disappeared after the
Spanish conquest in the 1500s. It was revived 10 years ago by
conservationists who decided that it was still the best way to
harvest precious vicuna fiber without killing the animals. Now an
annual event at dozens of locations throughout Peru, the chaku is
one of the main reasons for the recovery of a creature which, a
generation ago, teetered on the verge of oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   For the Incas, the vicuna and its fleece were closely associated
with divinity. The animal -- an evolutionary uncle of the camel --
was thought to be descended from the mountain gods' own herds. The
cloth was reserved for members of the nobility; anyone else wearing
it was put to death.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards valued the vicuna, too, but they had none of the
Incas' genius for mobilizing large groups of people, so they
replaced the chaku with the hunting of vicunas with guns. By the
time Simon Bolivar liberated Peru in the 1820s, the ``walking gold
of the Andes'' was in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Despite bans and decrees dating back to Bolivar's time, poaching
went virtually unchecked for the next 150 years. By the 1960s,
fewer than 10,000 vicunas survived in Peru, down from a
pre-conquest population of about 2 million. ``At that point there
was no guarantee that vicunas would survive the century,'' says
Jane Wheeler, a Lima-based American biologist. ``An epidemic or a
few hard winters could have wiped them out.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1975 the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the sale or purchase
of all vicuna products worldwide. But a black market still thrived,
fueled by a demand by the world's ultra-wealthy for $3,000 sweaters
and $20,000 coats. Thousands of vicunas were slaughtered every
year, usually by itinerant poachers, often with the complicity of
cash-strapped local farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in 1991, when Peru gave legal custody of
its vicunas to the mountain communities where the animals lived.
The authorities began building corrals and teaching villagers the
old techniques for trapping and shearing. Suddenly there was a
reason -- and a method -- for keeping the animals alive.
</P>
<P>
   The chaku became official policy in 1993. In 1995, CITES allowed
the country's live-shorn vicuna fiber to be sold internationally.
As hoped, the vicuna population soared. In 1994 the government
counted 66,500 vicunas in Peru; last year there were 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key was in giving the campesinos the right to profit from
the sale of the fiber,'' says Wheeler. ``They quickly realized that
they could earn more by shearing the animals live than they could
by killing them and selling the hides on the black market.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from the high Andes to the high fashion ateliers
of Milan, Tokyo, and Paris. But for the conservation program to
work, the vicuna fiber has to make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Bridging the two worlds is the responsibility of the
International Vicuna Consortium, composed of the Peruvian
manufacturer Incalpaca TPX and Italian textile powerhouses Lanerie
Agnona and Loro-Piana. The consortium was set up to buy, process
and market the fiber collected at the chakus. During 1996 and 1997
the consortium handled just over 2,900 pounds of clean fiber,
enough for 600 coats. Men's scarves, at $400, are the least
expensive items on the market; women's coats go from $12,000 to
well over $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian partners have sold custom-woven cloth to European
fashion houses such as Chanel and Armani. The Peruvians have had
most of their success in Japan. All are eagerly awaiting the
reopening of the American market (although the United States is a
CITES signatory, trade in vicuna fiber is still banned under U.S.
law).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've invested quite a bit of money in this, and so far it
hasn't really been profitable,'' says Francois Patthey, executive
vice president of Inca Group, parent company of Incalpaca TPX.
``But the money isn't the point for us right now. If the vicuna
population figures are accurate, this is already a success story.
More than 600 mountain communities are benefiting from the
proceeds. It's a fantastic thing for the country.''

   If you laughed at the little Benji dog in the full-body cast in
the trailers for ``There's Something About Mary,'' you might find a
few more laughs in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you might get hit by a car and wind up in a
full-body cast yourself _ certainly preferable to sitting through
this dreck.
</P>
<P>
   Directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly's track record includes
``Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' (1994) and ``Kingpin'' (1996). The brotherly
boneheads have once again surrounded themselves with an impressive
variety of talent _ Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon, Lee Evans, Cameron
Diaz _ but that only succeeds in making audiences wonder what
possessed these people to appear in this garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Stiller plays Ted, a high school dork whose dream date with Mary
(Diaz) is thwarted by a men's-room zipper accident. Fast-forward
more than a decade, and still-smitten Ted hires a sleazy private
eye (Dillon) to track her down. But Dillon begins to sabotage
things when he falls for Mary, too.
</P>
<P>
   Seems this is par for the course for Mary (there's something
about her, remember?). She's got an entire platoon of obsessed
suitors/stalkers who'll do or say anything to have her.
</P>
<P>
   And it seems the Farrellys will do or say anything to make you
laugh at these idiots _ anything, that is, except stooping to, say,
wit. There's enough crass toilet humor here to make the entire run
of Comedy Central's ``South Park'' seem like it was scripted by
Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' is rated R for crude humor,
profanity, nudity and brain-damaging subject matter.

`ZORRO' UNMASKS BANDERAS' COMIC TALENT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: FIXES infobox at bottom) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent interviews, Anthony Hopkins has said he was smitten by
the script for the crisply staged action film, ``The Mask of
Zorro,'' because he gets to play someone who exists from the knees
down for a change.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hopkins gets to bend his knees that much. In the first
part of ``Zorro,'' we see so much of Hopkins' stunt double that we
wonder why the stuntman doesn't get lead billing. But it's kind of
touching to see Hopkins buckle his swash and jump into this role.
</P>
<P>
   After Don Diego De La Vega (Hopkins) is captured and loses his
wife and infant daughter to his nemesis, California Gov. Don Rafael
(Stuart Wilson), ``Zorro'' cuts to the bumbling, small-time thieves
the Murrietta Brothers, Alejandro (Antonio Banderas) and Joaquim
(Victor Rivers). They anger the authorities, and Alejandro barely
escapes with his life. (His heroic brother is not so lucky.) Diego
takes the impulsive, incompetent Alejandro and transforms him into
an instrument of revenge fit for both their purposes. Not an easy
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zorro'' is deeply stylized summer fun, a tribute to all the
1930s schwing!fests _ the healthy, happy swashbucklers soaring
through the air, winking slyly as they draw their blades to save
the trodden-down, as George Hamilton put it in 1981's
underrecognized farce ``Zorro, The Gay Blade.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas has become a sleek physical comedian. His wily,
satisfied smile _ he can't believe he's outwitting the governor's
men through grace-under-fire ingenuity _ is just the thing to give
unembarrassed humor to his overripe good looks. Banderas makes
spirited fun of himself, which relieves the lack of ease this
ridiculously handsome man felt in front of the cameras. He never
knew what to do with himself _ nor did his directors _ but ``Mask
of Zorro'' liberates Banderas by offering him the gift of playful
self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   Director Martin Campbell, who scraped as many of the barnacles
off the James Bond franchise as he could in ``Goldeneye,'' goes the
back-in-the-day clanging sword epics one better. Here, Campbell
employs the wide-screen precision of Hong Kong's swordplay epics,
and uses the circular motion of martial arts to add sparkling
clarity to the action.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the nimble, old-fashioned staging, you know exactly
where everyone is, and how he relates to the action, at all tZIY.

 McGWIRE BECOMES BASEBALL'S ONE-MAN PHENOMENON  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Four years after baseball tried to ruin itself
by canceling the World Series, a larger-than-life force is helping
to erase the whole sordid episode from fans' memories.
</P>
<P>
   That force, at 6 feet-5-inches and 253-pounds, is chasing one of
baseball's most storied records in a Bunyanesque way.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is Mark McGwire's game at the moment, carrying it
around from city to city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere we go, the media writes, `The show is coming to
town,''' McGwire lamented a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, the former Oakland A's first baseman who is now with
the St. Louis Cardinals, has reached cult status. From coast to
coast come countless tales of his long home runs, each seemingly
hit harder and farther than the last. And fans are filling stadiums
just to so they can say they saw _ if not caught _ a piece of
history.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the weekend, McGwire had clubbed 42 homers, putting
him on pace to hit 71 and obliterate the single-season record of 61
set by Roger Maris of the New York Yankees in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is even more than the ascent on Mount Everest,'' said Pat
Gallagher, the San Francisco Giants vice president in charge of
marketing. ``He's going higher than that. I think that what
everybody realizes is that what they're witnessing is something
they may never see again.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's run at Maris is about much more than chasing a
major-league record.
</P>
<P>
   There are others this season with a chance to break it, like Ken
Griffey Jr. of the Seattle Mariners and Sammy Sosa of the Chicago
Cubs. But McGwire is the purest of home run hitters, out of the
mold of Hank Aaron and Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Fans show up at games hours early simply to watch him take
batting practice. The pregame swings have become as much the show _
if not more _ than McGwire's pursuit of Maris.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona earlier this season, 25,000 fans were in place to
watch McGwire take his practice hacks. (The A's average fewer than
15,000 fans per game.) At the Diamondbacks' Bank One Ballpark, each
McGwire pregame homer was detailed on the score board, with an
estimated distance provided. A Phoenix television station went so
far as to air batting practice live, with a broadcaster giving the
play-by-play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, that's psycho,'' McGwire said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants say they are expecting a spike in attendance from
between 15,000 to 20,000 per game for this week's two-game series
against St. Louis. The team plans to open the gates early Wednesday
and Thursday so fans can watch batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember anybody who was a batting-practice attraction
before this,'' Gallagher said. ``There's just an anticipation every
time he comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis teammate Tom Pagnozzi said one time for batting
practice he had ``walked onto the field and there were 18,000
people in the stands. I thought I was late for the game. It was
like a bad dream.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, 34, said the scene had gotten so out of hand that the
Cardinals' batting-practice pitcher, coach Dave McKay, feels
pressure to throw a home run ball each time. Some fans boo when
McGwire hits only a line drive during warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   It all seems such a far cry from most of the nearly 11 seasons
McGwire spent in Oakland before he was traded to the Cardinals last
year on July 31. With the A's, he blasted plenty of home runs _ 49
during his rookie year of 1987 and a total of 363 _ but he was
hardly the hitter he is now.
</P>
<P>
   Then, though he could hit tape-measure home runs, he had a
vulnerable spot. The book said he couldn't get around on an inside
fastball, so a good power pitcher, somebody like Roger Clemens,
could fire at McGwire's hands and neutralize him. Against Clemens,
McGwire had just four hits in 47 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   These days, McGwire has a shorter, more explosive swing than
ever, powered by hulking thighs and Popeye arms.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie, he carried 215 pounds. But by the '94 season he had
bulked up to 250 through hitting the weights. Now, McGwire is among
the many athletes who swear by any number of muscle-enhancing
protein powders, such as creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all this year, McGwire has been mostly even-keeled.
``I just want to be a normal guy,'' he said more than once. And he
calmly but firmly has begged off questions about Maris' record,
insisting that if he has 50 by September, then he'll talk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The media attention has been huge, and McGwire hasn't been
totally comfortable with that. During a trip through Houston in
mid-June, when a throng of journalists and stadium personnel
stretched from one dugout to the other to watch batting practice,
McGwire showed signs of frustration and aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt like a ``caged lion'' and was thinking about
skipping batting practice some days. He later backpedaled slightly,
but that was the first indication the pressure was getting to him.
</P>
<P>
   When Maris was chasing Ruth's record of 60 (set in 1927), he
became a nervous wreck, losing his hair and, by one account,
becoming ``drawn and pallid.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's presence seems to awe his colleagues as well as the
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after he hit a 485-foot home run at Cleveland's
Jacobs Field, Indians first baseman Jim Thome sent the Cardinals'
slugger a 12-pack of beer. This year, after McGwire clouted a ball
461 feet at Jacobs Field, Thome sent a case of brew to the visiting
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Thome said McGwire ``is like the Empire State Building standing
there with a bat in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Back in 1991, McGwire struggled,
hitting only .201 with 22 homers and 75 runs batted in. But '92 was
the turning point. McGwire credited A's batting coach Doug Rader
with helping him to become a more complete hitter. He finished the
season hitting .268 with 42 homers and 104 RBI, and Oakland won its
division.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McGwire remained largely a local phenomenon. He and Jose
Canseco constituted a marketing craze called ``The Bash Brothers,''
but Canseco clearly was the dominant sibling.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire shied away from publicity. He became wary of the media
after all the attention following his rookie season, and he was so
put off by a Huck Finn-persona enveloping him that he even grew a
goatee.
</P>
<P>
   While McGwire was establishing himself as a power hitter,
recurring health problems became part of his lore. He missed the
bulk of the 1993 and 1994 seasons and a chunk of '95, largely
because of problems with his left heel. And when he found himself
on the training table in the spring of 1996 with a badly injured
right heel, he thought briefly about quitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of why it's such a terrific story,'' Tony La
Russa, McGwire's manager in St. Louis and most of the years in
Oakland, said earlier this year. ``Not everything fell into place
for him.''

NEW HEART SURGERY IS LESS INVASIVE TO PATIENTS
</HEADLINE>

c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't the prospect of weeks of recovery, or a zipperlike
scar from chin to navel, that worried Glenn Moseley about his
looming open-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   What troubled the 49-year-old Hurst resident was that to repair
a clogged artery, surgeons would have to cut him open and stop his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part about being split wide open bothered me more than
anything,'' Moseley said. ``Just the idea, and the recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Dr. David Carter at Harris Methodist H.E.B. hospital in
Bedford, Texas, told Moseley about a new type of heart surgery:
minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass, known as MIDCAB.
</P>
<P>
   With the procedure, surgeons would have to make only a fist-size
incision between the ribs below the left breast. They could then
operate on his heart while it was still beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like the best way to go,'' Moseley said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of simpler, less intrusive surgery has patients
clamoring for MIDCAB, despite its relative newness as a procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Since the surgery was first performed in the United States in
1995, 15,000 to 20,000 have been done, physicians estimate. Carter
has done more than 50.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is patient-driven,'' he said. ``The patients will tell us
whether it's right for them or not. Right now, they're saying
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But MIDCAB also is criticized as being an experimental technique
that is just starting to come into its own.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, critics say, include the lack of the 20 years of
surgeons' experience with traditional open-heart surgery, the
decreased access because of the small incision, and the absence of
the bypass machine, which takes over for the heart and the lungs
and acts as a failsafe if the heart stops beating.
</P>
<P>
   MIDCAB has an estimated 95 percent success rate, comparable to
that of open-heart surgery, said Michael Mack, a heart surgeon at
Medical City Dallas who is among five U.S. physicians known for
their research of MIDCAB.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of the bypass machine also means the absence of the
machine's risks _ longterm neurological damage being the main
hazard, said John Osborne, a cardiologist at Medical City Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   MIDCAB offers significant savings in time and money, which is
especially beneficial as managed-care providers pressure hospitals
to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   MIDCAB is faster than open-heart surgery by at least three
hours. Patients typically stay in intensive care one day rather
than two or three, and their hospital stays are also shortened. The
procedure allows for a recovery time of less than two weeks,
compared with six or more weeks for the traditional surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs significantly less, in the range of $4,000 to $5,000
less,'' Carter said. The surgery also requires fewer instruments
and fewer blood units.
</P>
<P>
   Although physicians estimate that MIDCAB can be used in 10
percent to 30 percent of heart procedures, it doesn't work for
patients who are obese, need multiple bypasses, are on radiation
therapy or are extremely frail or sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not applicable to all types of cases,'' said Michael
DeBakey, 89, a world-renowned Houston heart surgeon who was a
consultant on Russian President Boris Yeltsin's heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, the medical field has been flush with inventions
of minimally invasive tools. In the 1940s, dentists tried using
tiny sandblasters to clear out tooth decay. But other technology
that was needed to use the sandblasters wasn't yet invented or
perfected.
</P>
<P>
   The trend toward minimally invasive surgery accelerated in the
late 1980s, as managed-care providers pressured hospitals to reduce
costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of this trend was development of laparoscopic
gall bladder surgery, which utilized a tiny tool and 'scope. This
allowed a surgeon to operate through a tiny incision and to ``see''
what was going on inside the patient's body through the 'scope lens
_ almost like a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole reason that people have problems after operations is
the incision necessary to get there,'' Mack said. ``With the start
of that gall bladder surgery, the trickle-down effect to other
types of surgery happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon to follow were minimally invasive obstetric, lung and
thoracic surgeries. Then came the challenge of transforming
open-heart surgery, the most invasive procedure of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``As early as 1991, people started thinking about it, wondering
if it could be done,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said, ``The problem with heart surgery is that the
techniques required are much more delicate, and it's much more
technically challenging than some of the abdominal procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   At its inception, heart surgery was minimally invasive, but only
because surgeons knew no better way to access the heart, DeBakey
said. Cutting away the sternum and part of the ribs wasn't feasible
at the time of the first procedures because surgeons hadn't
developed the techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Research into treating more complex heart conditions _ those
that require multiple bypasses, for example _ led to development of
open-heart surgery, giving surgeons better access and visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we began doing more extensive operations for more difficult
problems, we began routinely opening the chest,'' DeBakey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the idea behind the so-called minimally invasive is to
reduce the post-operative period at the hospital and to have less
discomfort after the operation,'' DeBakey said. ``We were not doing
it with that purpose in mind, originally. We were doing it in order
to correct what we needed to correct.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mack and four other U.S. surgeons took the helm of the
domestic research, Argentine surgeon Frederico Bennetti in Buenos
Aires performed the first MIDCAB surgery on a person in 1994. The
first U.S. procedure occurred the next year in New York.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) (Optional 2nd take follows)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge of MIDCAB is in keeping the tiny part of
the beating heart still long enough to operate smoothly, surgeons
said.
</P>
<P>
   Medical technology companies ``have been ingenious in coming up
with ways to stabilize the heart,'' Carter said. ``They've come up
with devices that, while the heart's still beating, will make parts
of it stand completely still.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as technology was advancing to accommodate the pursuit of a
less invasive procedure, the idea met with resistance from
traditionalists reluctant to change a procedure proven successful
for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the younger generation of surgeons is learning minimally
invasive techniques as part of training, Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with the acceptance of the consumer, if you will.
You have to learn new and different techniques that allow you to do
the same procedure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the medical supply industry say they recognize the
reason for the slow process of acceptance and implementation of the
new surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like sometimes there's an urge to simplify this area,
but it's still heart surgery,'' said Jim Weiss, spokesman for
Heartport, a California medical supply company that creates and
sells the instruments used in similar surgery. ``There's still a
lot of difficult procedures to overcome.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was a cool February morning when Carter made a 4-inch
incision in Moseley's chest to replace a clogged artery.
</P>
<P>
   A retractor was used to open the incision and the muscle walls
in Moseley's chest, leaving a fist-size hole. There, about 6 inches
deep, Moseley's heart was beating.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on top of his heart was a quarter-size yellowish glob of
fat. Smaller particles floated nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' Carter quipped, ``is the Whataburger he had for lunch
last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgery, in an operating room next to a dormant bypass
machine, went off without a hitch. Carter and his partner, Dr.
David Ammons, were finished within two hours.
</P>
<P>
   An added bonus was that Carter could sit through much of the
procedure, instead of having to lean over Moseley's body for four
or five hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few instances where surgeons get to do this,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One day later, Moseley was sitting in a chair next to his
hospital bed, receiving compliments from doctors and cracking jokes
about his health.
</P>
<P>
   This was Moseley's second heart procedure. The first was a
failed angioplasty last fall. That procedure does not require
surgeons to open the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the small scar on the left side of his chest,
Moseley pointed to a patch of bandages and said that, aside from
some general soreness, he felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   Carter had his patient walking two miles a day within two weeks.
Moseley recently passed a stress test that checks the strength of
his heart. Now he is hiking, horseback riding and rafting on
vacation with his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little sore from the incision. It's kind of tender,
but it doesn't bother me,'' Moseley said. ``It hasn't held me back
any. I'm well-pleased with the procedure.''

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

 By ABBY TANNENBAUM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From Diversion magazine. c.1996 Abby Tannenbaum 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone

 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

 &UR; By JENNIFER CRICHTON &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

   While family reunions offer a unique opportunity to reconnect

&HT;        ACTIVISTS PUSH HIV TESTING, PREVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 20 -- A coalition of AIDS advocacy groups
kicked off a new initiative Monday stressing voluntary testing and
prevention efforts to halt the spread of the HIV virus,
particularly among African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   At the second annual ``State of AIDS'' summit in Washington, the
advocates said that recent research efforts have only helped in
stopping the spread of AIDS in people who have already contracted
the disease. These AIDS ``cocktails'', introduced to patients in
1996, have left a false impression that there is a cure at hand for
the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, we got hope. In 1997, we got complacent. In 1998, we
get reality,'' said Daniel Zingale, executive director of AIDS
Action, a Washington-based group that organized the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite increased awareness of the disease, there has been a
recent uptick in newly infected people with HIV, at about 40,000 a
year, which Zingale attributed to a new level of ``risky behavior''
by homosexuals and intravenous drug users.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the growth in HIV infections comes from the
African-American community, where church leaders and activists have
had a difficult time talking about what many viewed as a gay
disease. In fact, half of all HIV infections came from drug abusers
using dirty needles or from unprotected sex with a drug abuser who
has AIDS from using dirty needles, according to AIDS Action.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, more than 60 percent of people with full-blown
AIDS are black. Nationally, 57 percent of all people with HIV, the
virus that leads to AIDS, are black, up from 30 percent in 1982,
according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates said Monday that recent efforts to break through
the silence about AIDS in the inner-city have shown some signs of
progress. ``Now the pastors are finally waking up,'' said John
Humphries, of the People of Color Network, which is working with 12
black ministers in Houston to educate parishioners about the spread
of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The groups stopped short of endorsing the combative tactics of
more radical advocacy groups, including Act Up, which had 12
members arrested Monday at a protest in the office of President
Clinton's AIDS policy coordinator. They were challenging Clinton's
decision not to provide funding for federal needle exchange
programs, and demanding that he veto a bill that would permanently
deny any exchange funding.
</P>
<P>
   They support federal funding for needle exchanges but view that
as one part of a comprehensive approach to the problem, including
expanding spots in drug treatment centers. Summit members also
pushed for a 25 percent increase in federal funding for prevention
education, which already totals $617 million a year; expansion of
voluntary, anonymous testing for HIV; an ambitious direct mailing
campaign to minorities, teaching about AIDS, and more research
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one solution,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of
CDC's National Center for HIV.

WHAT BUGS AN INSECT?  
 MAPPING MITOCHONDRIAL DNA  
 ORIGINS IN THE LEVANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A large delegation of insects flew in this week with the
following demand: They do not want to be called bugs any more.
</P>
<P>
   Bugs, they said, are icky invisible things like bacteria, or the
human errors on computer programs. Insects are a class apart,
miniature miracles of design that deserve more respect. They cited
an article in last week's Nature about navigational capabilities of
desert ants.
</P>
<P>
   The desert ant species known as Cataglyphis fortis, according to
a study by Dr. Thomas Collett of the University of Sussex in
England, has an elaborate computational system for finding its way
home.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments that deconstructed the ants' navigation skills,
Collett and colleagues found that these insects have two separate
systems to keep track of where they are.
</P>
<P>
   One is a path integration system _ they remember at each leg of
their expeditions how far they have been going and in what
direction. The other is a system of memorizing local landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   When the two systems are made to conflict by the experimenter,
for example by moving the ants, the path integration system is
temporarily ignored in favor of the local landmarks but is
continually updated so that guidance can continue when the local
landmarks are passed. If certain higher animals are that clever,
why do they so often get lost?
</P>
<P>
   Another new paean to insect ability describes their skills in
chemical warfare. The pupa stage of an insect's lifestyle, a
superior kind of teenagehood between the larva and the adult but
spent in a silent and immobilized form, is also one of high
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   Many species solve the problem by making their pupae as
inconspicuous as possible. The squash beetle, Dr. Frank Schroder of
Cornell University reports in this week's Science, has a different
strategy. Its pupa hangs out in full view, but its coating of fine
hairs secretes a devil's brew of noxious chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder and colleagues report that the chemicals, which repel
all kinds of would-be predators, are synthesized as different
combinations of the same three basic building blocks. Combinatorial
chemistry, as the technique is called, has been used by industrial
chemists only for the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   The insects made a good case that they should not be called bugs
any more. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The human occupation of the globe is the subject of two articles
in the current Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
Both rest on analysis of the DNA in mitochondria, small
energy-producing organs in the cell that have their own DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Mitochondria are inherited through the egg and their DNA escapes
the shuffling endured by the cell's DNA between every human
generation. Mitochondrial DNA thus bears a straightforward record
of human ancestry through the maternal line.
</P>
<P>
   By studying the amount of genetic variation in the mitochondrial
DNA of the Maoris of New Zealand, biologists have estimated that
the founding population must have contained about 70 women. This is
consistent with the Maori oral tradition that the islands were
reached by 8 to 10 canoes, each carrying a small number of people.
</P>
<P>
   It also confirms the view that the colonization was the result
of an organized expedition, not a single lost vessel.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is the work of Dr. Rosalind O. Murray-McIntosh of
the Institute of Environmental Science and Research in Wellington,
New Zealand, and her colleagues. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand is thought to have been inhabited about 800 years
ago. Europe too seems to have been colonized comparatively recently
_ a mere 10,000 years ago, according to Dr. Guido Barbujani at the
University of Ferrara in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   He and colleagues find a steady gradient of mitochondrial DNA
differences that starts in populations of the Near East and reaches
its limit in the populations of Northern and Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   This spread of population began around 10,000 years ago, the
scientists say, and confirms previous evidence that Europe was
probably colonized by people coming from the Levant.

 &HT;    Equifax has top managers take on more holdings
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Equifax is the latest company to require more of its
top managers to own a stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the officers listed below all purchased 1,000
shares from the company on June 1 at the market price of $37.25.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman David Mooney said the company's top 200 managers must
comply with expanded stock ownership guidelines initiated by Thomas
F. Chapman, president and chief executive officer. Previously,
those guidelines applied only to the company's top 20 managers,
Mooney said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandated stock-purchase programs make it more difficult for
investors to evaluate insider trading data, said Bob Gabele of
CDA/Investnet, which tracks insider transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find buys that may be company-induced to be much less
positive than when insiders decide on an individual basis to invest
in their shares,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Equifax insiders buying shares were James J. Allhusen,
executive vice president. He now holds 1,300 shares, worth $50,213
at Friday's price of $38.62 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas J. Bevan, executive vice president, now holds 6,276
shares, worth $242,411; John T. Chandler, vice president and chief
administrative officer, now holds 14,193 shares directly and
indirectly, worth $548,205; Lee A. Kennedy, executive vice
president, now holds 68,686 shares directly and indirectly, worth
$2,652,997.
</P>
<P>
   Philip J. Mazzilli, vice president, treasurer and controller,
now holds 18,100 shares directly and indirectly, worth $699,113;
William R. Phinney, executive vice president, now holds 18,903
shares, worth $730,128; Bruce S. Richards, vice president and
general counsel, now holds 4,762 shares directly and indirectly,
worth $183,932.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta Edmunds Zakas, vice president, corporate secretary and
director of investor relations, now holds 7,223 shares directly and
indirectly, worth $278,988.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman rewards workers
</P>
<P>
   Chih Hung Liao, the chairman of Liuski International, a national
wholesale distributor of computer hardware, sold 1,204,189 shares
June 22 at $1 each, totaling $1,204,189, reducing his stake to
7,724,864 shares. The figures aren't adjusted for a 2-for-5 reverse
stock split that took place July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The company's corporate secretary, Lynda Simpson, said the
transaction was, in effect, a ``gift transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The shares were transferred to a few employees of two of his
other computer companies in Taiwan who have helped him for a long
time,'' Simpson said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ A klaxon sounds and the sleek hull of the racing
yacht begins knifing through cool, calm waters at increasing speed.
The bow heaves as it pushes through the flat water, raising a wave
as it moves faster and sending ripples fanning from the waterline.
</P>
<P>
   People riding along feel the breeze in their faces as the hull
glides at speeds of up to 14 knots, but the motion and sensations
last only a few seconds. This dash by a 25-foot-long scale model
covers only about 800 feet and takes place in a huge water tank and
not the open ocean. But it nonetheless signals a beginning of the
next race for the America's Cup, the world's most prestigious
sailing competition.
</P>
<P>
   Challengers hoping to capture the America's Cup from New Zealand
in 2000 have already begun extensive research and testing directed
toward designing and building the fastest sailboats in their class.
Months, even years, before construction begins on the boats, teams
of naval architects, designers, computer scientists, model builders
and engineers engage in a technological competition to create
machines that can complete a two-hour race a few minutes or seconds
ahead of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   It is this competition that brings yacht builders to the David
Taylor Model Basin at the Naval Surface Warfare Center. Here, where
the Navy tows and tests models of its future destroyers, frigates
and other warships in the world's largest towing tanks, John K.
Marshall, president of the New York Yacht Club, watches as
fiberglass models of different racing hulls go through their paces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our surface warfare, so perhaps it's appropriate that
we are here,'' said Marshall, director of the Young America
campaign, a $40-million effort by the New York Yacht Club to build
the boat that wins the right to challenge Team New Zealand for the
the oldest trophy in international sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sailing is a sport, an athletic competition for which people
must train and develop their skills,'' Marshall said. ``But the
America's Cup is also a technology competition and it's always been
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, a slower boat could win with an exceptionally expert
crew. But this is no longer the case, said Bob Billingham of
America One, the group organizing the entry for the St. Francis
Yacht Club of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your boat is as fast, you can win with sailing skill,''
Billingham said, ``but you can't win with a slower boat.''
</P>
<P>
   So teams worldwide labor to refine their designs, jealously
guarding studies of hull shapes, sails and even rigging hardware to
deny the smallest secret to competitors. Yachts in this class are
so closely matched that no advantage is insignificant. Veterans
remember when an Australian challenger in 1983 snatched the cup
from the United States for the first time with help from a radical
innovation, a winged keel. The Australians kept the keel secret
until the last moment to prevent competitors from trying to copy
it.
</P>
<P>
   The first trophy was won by the schooner America on Aug. 22,
1851, in a race around the Isle of Wight, off southern England,
after 14 British yachts were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to bolster the image of American yachting at the time,
John Cox Stevens, founder of the New York Yacht Club, and a group
of his friends challenged the British, then the rulers of the seas.
The Americans won with a sleek new hull design and innovative sails
woven of cotton instead of the traditional flax, which distorted
and lost their shape in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Americans successfully defended the cup _ which rested in a
glass case at the New York Yacht Club in Manhattan _ until 1983,
when Australia II took the prize. In the next race, four years
later, Dennis Conner regained the cup with his Stars and Stripes
and the prize remained at his yacht club in San Diego until 1995,
when Team New Zealand, sailing Black Magic, defeated Conner and his
Young America.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the fastest boat requires working within the strictures
of tight rules governing the overall design of this class of
vessels. From 1958 to 1987, sailors competed for the America's Cup
in 12-Meter Class yachts. But in 1989, a multinational group of
yacht designers developed rules for a new International America's
Cup Class, which first appeared in the 1992 competition.
</P>
<P>
   The new America's Cup boats are lighter, faster, narrower and
longer and carry more sail than their predecessors, with canoe-like
bodies made of carbon fiber material instead of aluminum. The
design is based on a mathematical formula that balances a boat's
waterline length, sail area and displacement so that adding
significantly to one dimension requires decreasing others.
Generally, an America's Cup contender is about 75 feet long,
supports a mast that stands 115 feet off the water, has a keel 14
feet deep, and weighs 45,000 to 48,000 pounds. Most of the weight
is in a lead ballast bulb at the base of the keel.
</P>
<P>
   Registering to challenge New Zealand, 16 yacht clubs and
syndicates from 10 nations, including 5 from the United States,
have so far paid their $200,000 entry fees. Experts estimate that
10 or 12 of these groups will raise enough money to build at least
one boat and that perhaps 4 or 5 of the competitors will muster the
talent and expertise to produce first-rate vessels with a chance of
winning.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The competitors are to assemble in the harbor off Auckland in
October 1999 and begin a series of match races to determine the
best boat to be named the official challenger for the America's
Cup. The winning boat will then race Team New Zealand's best new
yacht in a best-of-seven series held in February and March of 2000
in the Hauraki Gulf, northeast of Auckland.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing experts say a winning team will have to spend $30
million to $40 million for a credible challenge, including up to
$10 million for research and design and $3 million to $5 million
for a custom-made boat. In addition, a set of sails made of
specially molded sheets of composite materials costs $30,000 to
$50,000, and each boat requires more than a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Tank testing of the model adds to the price: about $50,000 for a
series of tests on a single hull and set of appendages at the Naval
model basin, the New York group says, and it plans to test 20 hull
designs before it starts building actual boats.
</P>
<P>
   With private and corporate contributions, the New York group has
bought two former America's Cup competitors, which the group is
using to test new equipment and for promotional work, and plans to
build two boats, said Marshall, the New York Yacht Club president.
</P>
<P>
   Billingham, director of operations for the San Francisco group,
said that winning teams must operate multi-boat programs to test
their innovations adequately and fine-tune the performance of their
best craft. As sailors tweak a boat to get every second of
additional speed, he said, they need to test it against a
comparable vessel with well-known capability.
</P>
<P>
   Sailing experts partly attribute the U.S. loss to New Zealand in
1995 to this reason: none of the three American syndicates built
two boats, so the lack of a true two-boat program prevented them
from optimizing the performance of their craft through the racing
season.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco group, with a $30-million budget, plans to
have two new boats in the water by the spring of 1999 and test them
against each other off California before shipping them to New
Zealand that fall, Billingham said. His group has also tow-tested
hulls at the Naval model basin here.
</P>
<P>
   With such intense competition, any weight reduction or change in
hull shape, sail design, or the placement of components, like the
keel or rudder, that results in even a 1 percent increase in
performance is significant.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for an edge, several racing groups have used the Navy
complex here to test hulls and appendages, like rudders and keels,
because its size allows the use of larger models. In smaller tanks,
the waves created by the models bounce off the walls and interfere
with readings from the sensitive testing instruments, but that
problem is lessened in the Navy tank, which is 51 feet wide, 22
feet deep, 1,192 feet long and holds 9 million gallons of water.
</P>
<P>
   The models are attached to a metal carriage that spans the tank
and runs back and forth above the surface of the water carrying
boats, testing instruments and observers.
</P>
<P>
   Hulls, sometimes with appendages attached, are hooked to an
instrument called a dynamometer, which measures the precise forces
acting on the model as it heels and pitches through the water
during numerous runs at different speeds. Technicians in a
monitoring station on the carriage record hundreds of measurement
points during each run, and this information goes into computer
programs, which analyze each model's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, the teams rely on computer simulation and the
ability to test many design ideas in the cyberseas of a
mathematical model before building and trying them in the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers use sophisticated software, known as computational
fluid dynamics programs, said John Kuhn, a naval architect at
Science Applications International Corp., in San Diego, a technical
firm supporting the San Francisco group. The programs simulate the
fluid flow around hulls and appendages, like rudders, keels and
ballast bulbs, or the movement of air around masts or sails.
Results from the programs, which calculate pressure and drag, give
engineers the information they need to design components that are
then tested in tanks or wind tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   Information from these tests and the fluid dynamics programs
then go into a larger computer simulation called a velocity
prediction program, or VPP. This program combines design
specifications with environmental variables like wind, wave and
temperature to make predictions on how fast a boat will sail in
specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``A VPP integrates the work of different people working on
different parts of a boat and predicts how an overall design will
perform on water,'' said Kuhn, technical coordinator for the San
Francisco group. ``These programs are not perfect, but they help
tell you how basic elements contribute to a design.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan MacLane, technology project manager for the New York
group, said the computer simulations were getting better and
designers were seeing better matches between computer predictions
and actual performance with each competition. Still, advice from
naval architects and other experts like Bruce Farr, the principal
designer for the New York group, remains crucial in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of art in the design process,'' MacLane
said, ``with many of the improvements we are considering coming
from the intuition of designers. There is still a designer in front
of the computer screen dealing with the nuances, making very subtle
alignments in the design that produces a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Schnackenberg, who heads the design team for the New Zealand
group, said that although computational and model testing made
significant contributions to producing a boat, only full-scale
testing and analysis of a real vessel could confirm its design
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world,'' Schnackenberg said, ``we often find
full-scale results at variance with predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Team New Zealand plans to build at least one boat and use its
older championship yachts in its preparations, said Alan Sefton, a
spokesman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the teams preparing new boats are paying extra attention
to the sails and riggings, partly because of differences in these
areas that appeared in the last cup race, said Kuhn of the San
Francisco group. The mast and rigging on Black Magic, the New
Zealand boat, was set farther than those on other racers, and the
New Zealanders displayed sails with unusual shapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is looking at sails and rigging because sail
aerodynamics is one of the least understood elements of design,''
Kuhn said. ``This is where we may be able to squeeze out some more
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other experts said any group wanting to compete for the
America's Cup but had not yet started this kind of research and
planning was probably out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race,'' Kuhn said, ``has already begun.''

 &HT;    Diversification drives some Home Depot insider sales
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Home Depot's shares doubling in value over the
past 12 months, some insiders have decided to cash in a portion of
their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   One reason: a desire to diversify their investment portfolios,
said company spokesman Jerry Shields.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest recent sale was by Milledge A. Hart III, a director
of the home improvement retailer since its founding in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who is 64, sold 250,000 shares, or 14.4 percent of his
holdings, June 5 at $77.50 each, totaling $19,375,000. That trimmed
his stake to 2,968,920 shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split earlier
this month. Those shares were worth $139,539,240 at Friday's price
of $47 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Hart sold 150,000 shares at an unreported
price. At the time, the company said the sale was for estate
planning purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall L. Day, senior vice president of finance and
accounting, sold 16,500 shares, or 12.9 percent of his holdings,
June 9 at $80 each, totaling $1,320,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for portfolio diversification and estate planning,''
Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   Day, who is 54, now holds 221,918 shares directly and
indirectly, adjusted for the stock split. Those shares are worth
$10,430,146.
</P>
<P>
   K. Lynn Martineau, 41, president of the West Coast division,
exercised an option for 8,000 shares June 1 at between $24.58 and
$34 each, totaling $217,809. He then sold them at $79 each,
totaling $632,000. Martineau now holds 98,348 shares directly and
indirectly, worth $4,622,356.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Arthur M. Blank, president and chief executive,
indirectly sold 17,000 shares June 17 at $80.60 each, totaling
$1,370,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale was to fund the Arthur M. Blank Charitable Trust,''
Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   Blank, who is 55, now holds 24,256,768 shares directly and
indirectly, worth $1,140,068,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald M. Brill, chief administrative officer, gave away 740
shares June 2 at an unreported price. Brill, 54, who also is a
director, now holds 1,211,990 shares directly and indirectly, worth
$56,963,530.
</P>
<P>
   The company didn't identify the recipient.

 &HT;    Minor leagues: Diamonds in the rough
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ The arcs of theircareers _ one ascending, the
other coming down _ have intersected on a baseball diamond in this
southern city with an outfield curtain of pristine pines.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Berkman, a 22-year-old first-round draft pick, is the star
of the Jackson Generals, the minor-league team that soon may come
to Round Rock. Square-jawed and affable, Berkman is a 6-foot-1
switch hitter originally from Austin whose uncanny ability to hit a
baseball 400 feet set records at Rice University and will probably
land him in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Makarewicz, 31 _ which in baseball years is ancient _ has
played professional ball for a decade on nine different teams that
were affiliated with three different clubs. He has never made it to
The Show, as the majors are commonly called. Though he still dreams
of it, chances are he never will.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Generals come to Round Rock for the 2000 season,
as new team owner Nolan Ryan is planning, it is unlikely either
player will still be on the team. Makarewicz probably will be
coaching or at home in Orlando, Fla., with his wife and two sons.
And Berkman should be in Triple-A on the verge of fame and fortune
_ if he isn't already in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   That's because perpetual player shuffling is, like bats and
balls, an inexorable part of the minor leagues. For the most part,
minor-league players' careers are ephemeral, their lives nomadic,
their chances of making it to the majors slim.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the minors will always have young bucks like Berkman and
journeymen like Makarewicz, scripting their personal dramas in
amphitheaters of grass and dirt and outfield walls plastered with
advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   As Central Texans should soon see, minor-league baseball is as
much about baseball as it is carnival-like entertainment. For less
than the cost of a movie ticket, fans can sit so close to the field
they can overhear players' conversations, and children run the
bases after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1928, the minor leagues have been a sort of Darwinian
sieve that has sorted the ranks of players who have forgone school
and moved miles away from their families to play in cities like
Shreveport, Durham, Peoria, San Bernardino, just so they may one
day reach the pinnacle of America's pastime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really all I'm looking for _ just to say I made it to
the major leagues,'' Makarewicz said recently an hour before a game
with the Wichita Wranglers. ``And if I play well, who knows?'' In
the meantime, he is still playing the game he learned as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will he make it to the major leagues? Probably not,'' said
Generals owner Con Maloney. ``Does he know that? Yes. But as long
as he puts on a uniform he has that chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The minor leagues aren't just about guys like Makarewicz trying
to make it.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the quirky _ almost corny _ between-inning antics
like the Sumo Run, where in Jackson, two adults don bulky, padded
wrestler costumes and race through an obstacle course along the
third-base line.
</P>
<P>
   It's about guys like John Goodman, a Generals season-ticket
holder who hasn't missed a home game in five years and who proudly
keeps tabs on how many pitches Generals pitchers throw in a season.
</P>
<P>
   It's about wide-eyed kids with faces full of hot dogs and cotton
candy, cradling mitts and balls to be autographed by the players
who might one day be playing before tens of thousands in hallowed
coliseums and on television.
</P>
<P>
   And it's about people like Mary Havard, a team booster, who
welcomes the peripatetic players to Jackson and makes sure they all
have thepots, pans and bedsheets to replace those they may have
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Havard and other boosters make the trip every year to Florida
for spring training to try to pick which players may be coming to
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   And when one of ``their guys'' hits a homer, they scour the
stands collecting dollar bills for the player.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but get attached to these guys,'' Havard said
last week as she sat in the bleachers three rows behind the
Generals' dugout. ``I hate to see them go.'' But it's no surprise
the Generals are leaving Jackson. Most nights there are swaths of
open spaces in the stands at Smith-Wills Stadium, where they play.
While the capacity is 5,200, the average attendance this year is
only about 1,500. Attendance at Generals' games has ranked last in
the Texas League from 1990 to 1996 and was second from the bottom
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous loss, but it's not fair to the players and
the program to have a homestand where nobody shows up,'' Maloney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions on why the team fails to draw fans to the ballpark are
varied. Some blame the team owners for not advertising enough. The
Generals don't get much ink in The Clarion-Ledger, the local
newspaper. And on a recent night, the Generals got less than 15
seconds on one television station and no mention on another.
Driving through Jackson, a capital city of about 200,000, there is
little evidence the Generals even exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just simply the size of the market,'' Maloney said. ``The
problem is we're looking at a marketplace that has a limit of
400,000 people. In Round Rock you're talking about more than 1
million.'' Meanwhile, attendance for all of the minor leagues has
jumped from about 25 million in 1990 to nearly 35 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The rising popularity is due in part to a stadium construction
boom that started in the mid-1980s and continues today, said Jim
Ferguson, the director of media relations for the National
Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, which oversees the
minors. Since 1985, 81 minor-league stadiums have been built, and
five are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some outstanding ballparks out there,'' he said.
``And there aren't any bad seats, because you can't get very far
away from the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Tickets at most parks cost less than $6.
</P>
<P>
   For the small group of Generals regulars, the loss of their team
is heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you replace coming to the ballpark?'' said David
Blount, 30, who grew up watching the team when it was an affiliate
of the New York Mets. ``It's devastating to the core of us die-hard
fans.'' What Blount and other fans will miss is a brand of baseball
that is often laced with errors from players who, compared to their
major-league brethren, are inexperienced. Still they are
professional ballplayers, the best of the best, and their level of
play can be nearly as good as the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have this romantic notion about minor-league
baseball,'' said Michael Nash, an Austinite who weaved a trip to
see the Generals into a vacation with the in-laws in Louisianalast
week. ``Very few are making any money. They're playing for the love
of the game. This is one of the few professions where every day, or
just about, you have to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Or get demoted. Or fired.
</P>
<P>
   Few arenas in American have as much pressure as minor-league
baseball. There are a handful of major-league scouts in the stands
at every game. In an April-August season, a team roster may go
through dozens of changes, with players being upgraded another step
closer to the majors, sent back down, or released.
</P>
<P>
   It took Generals Manager Jim Pankovits eight years to make it to
the majors when he was a player. He has played or coached in about
a dozen different cities. And now at age 42, when asked about his
future, he said, ``I'm just going to take it one year at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pankovits, who played about five seasons for the Astros, knows
how hard it is to be bounced around, especially for a guy like
Donovan Mitchell, who has a wife and 2-year-old son in White
Plains, N.Y. This year alone, the center fielder has been bumped
between the Astros Triple-A affiliate in New Orleans and the
Generals nine times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard to get into a rhythm,'' Mitchell said. ``A
month ago I couldn't hit the ball. Other times, it just clicks.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows if it doesn't click for long enough, he could find
himself in Pankovits' office listening to something along the lines
of: ``The organization has decided to make a change . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It is a speech Pankovits hates to make. ``There's no easy way to
do it,'' he said of telling players they are released. ``The
thought of having to start a second career when all your life
you've been one of the best at what you're doing. At age 26 being
told you can't play baseball as a career anymore _ that's a tough
pill to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's one most have to. Only about one in 10 players who sign
a professional baseball contract ever makes it to the major
leagues, even if just for one game. At the Double-A level about one
in four makes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time the manager wants to talk to you, you know
something's going on,'' said Berkman, the first-round draft pick,
who attended Austin High School his freshman and sophomore years
before moving to New Braunfels.''If you're playing well, you want
to hear that. If you're not, it'll make your heart stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Lopez, a veteran at 29, has been called into the manager's
office several times during his career.
</P>
<P>
   A catcher, he is out for four weeks with a sprained ankle. His
wife and two daughters are back in Puerto Rico, where he grew up
playing baseball. When he was 17, he came to the States for a year
of junior college and the hope that he would be drafted. He was.
And like so many minor-leaguers, he gave up his education for a
shot at The Show.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, he said, his father asked him what he was
going to do after baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, 'I don't know. I gave up on my school.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was young. I took a risk. I took a chance. But I have no
regrets. . . . ``
</P>
<P>
   He paused, his injured leg elevated while his teammates rushed
onto the field for practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if I had to do it all over again, I would go back to
school in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I love the game, and for me it's always been just that _ a
game. And to this day I'm still playing it.''

 &HT;    Premiere's loss could be exec's gain
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The chief financial officer of Premiere Technologies,
Harvey A. Wagner, stepped up to buy 4,000 shares shortly after the
stock plunged in June, when the provider of enhanced
telecommunications services warned of a second-quarter loss. Wall
Street had expected a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good value,'' said Wagner, 57, who bought the
shares June 16-17 at between $8.94 and $9.25 each, totaling
$36,380.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who joined the company in May after nearly four years as
Scientific-Atlanta's chief financial officer, now holds 4,750
shares, worth $41,859 at Friday's price of $8.81 1/4 on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   The shares had traded as high as $35.43 3/4 on March 25. But
that was before the company's June 10 warning.
</P>
<P>
   No other insider has joined Wagner in bargain hunting. ``The
absence of other buyers at this time would cause us to take a
wait-and-see approach,'' said Bob Gabele of CDA/Investnet, which
tracks insider trading. ``Investors should never rush out to buy
just because one insider bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gabele noted that Wagner's purchase is not
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somewhat expected to see a new person building their
position in the first few months after they come on board,'' Gabele
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the stock's plunge, at least 15 law firms
have announced they plan to file class-action lawsuits on behalf of
shareholders. The lawsuits generally allege, among other things,
that Premiere Technologies made ``false and misleading statements''
about the success of recent acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the first lawsuit was filed on June 25, seeking
unspecified damages, the company said it had reviewed the
shareholder suit and ``believes (it) is completely without merit''
and ``will defend the suit vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner said Thursday the company stands by that statement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits also claim certain senior managers sold stock in
advance of warning shareholders about expected charges.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, the company's founder and current
chairman and chief executive, Boland T. Jones, sold 300,000 shares
on April 14 at $32.13 each, totaling $9,639,000. That reduced his
stake to 1,925,744 shares.
</P>
<P>
   The sale by Jones, who is 38, was for estate planning purposes,
Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing last week with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, a director, Roy B. Andersen Jr., disclosed he sold
22,400 shares June 1 at between $24 and $24.06 each, totaling
$537,606. That reduced his stake to 226,900 shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just probably needed money for something _ education,
housing, who knows,'' said Wagner, noting that Andersen, who is on
vacation and couldn't be reached for comment, also has options to
acquire more than 500,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, 49, is president and chief executive of Xpedite
Systems, which was acquired by Premiere Technologies in February.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Georgia companies:
</P>
<P>
   At ASA Holdings, John W. Beiser, president, exercised an option
for 76,800 shares June 11-26 at $36.75 each, totaling $2,822,400.
He then sold them at between $44.63 and $47.88 each, totaling
$3,583,856. Beiser now holds 299,847 shares directly and
indirectly, worth $14,317,694 at Friday's price of $47.75 on
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   At Cox Communications, Jimmy W. Hayes, senior vice president and
chief financial officer, sold 7,000 Class A shares June 24 at
$49.31 each, totaling $345,170. Hayes now holds 9,003 Class A
shares, worth $460,278 at Friday's price of $51.12 1/2 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia-Pacific Timber Co., Donald L. Glass, president and
chief executive, bought 6,000 shares June 5-23 at between $21.88
and $22.50 each, totaling $133,760. Glass now holds directly or
indirectly 68,779 Timber Co. shares, worth $1,431,463 at Friday's
price of $20.81 1/4 on the New York Stock Exchange. He also holds
10,446 Georgia-Pacific shares, worth $596,728 at Friday's price of
$57.12 1/2.

A PROMINENT SOLDIER IN THE WAR AGAINST AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(lh) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ It was November 1983, and Dr. Peter Piot, who had done
pioneering work on the Ebola virus in Africa the previous decade,
was returning to Zaire (now Congo) to get his first look at an
emerging disease, AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of his return to Mama Yemo Hospital in Kinshasa ``is
branded in my brain,'' Piot recalled last week. ``I walked into the
hospital and saw all these emaciated men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Piot's team quickly showed that the Zairian patients had
developed AIDS through heterosexual sex _ a finding that was
initially met with disbelief by medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   But Piot (pronounced PEA-ott) knew his work was important. ``I
realized AIDS would take on immense dimensions in Africa and would
change my life because here was something so complex _ sex, Africa
and the politics of AIDS,'' he said. ``But I did not realize in
what sense it would change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Piot, a 49-year-old Belgian, is executive director of the
U.N. AIDS Program, the chief coordinator of the global war on AIDS.
It is a position to which he brings scientific expertise, an avid
interest in history and a political will that once led him to march
against NATO headquarters to protest Belgium's possible entry into
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In his frequent meetings with heads of state, the bearded,
Flemish doctor tackles diplomacy with the directness of a
scientist, particularly when leaders scoff at the monstrous public
health threat they face in HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   An African leader, for example, asserted that his country was
well prepared to handle AIDS and took pride in reporting recent
tests showing he was not HIV infected. Piot then asked what the
leader would do if, injured in an accident, he needed a blood
transfusion.
</P>
<P>
   The leader, whom Piot declined to name, contended that his
country's blood supply was safe. But Piot, fresh from a visit to a
blood bank, knew better because the bank had no laboratory kits to
screen blood before transfusions. The skeptical leader called the
blood bank and learned that the blood was in fact dangerous. The
leader then summoned his health minister and ordered him to adopt
the U.N. AIDS Program's recommendations. That country's program now
works well, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor who can sway a head of state's views about AIDS was a
member of an unusually diverse class at the University of Ghent
Medical School in Belgium. More than a dozen of his classmates are
now diplomats, government officials and drug company executives. As
for Piot, he nearly dropped out of medical school because, he said,
he was so appalled by the curriculum's disregard for public health.
He stayed principally because of the fun he derived from lampooning
the faculty in a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when he had been out of medical school two years and
was researching tropical diseases in Antwerp, Belgium, Piot and his
colleagues discovered a mysterious virus that was causing a deadly
epidemic of hemorrhagic fever in Zaire. It was later named Ebola,
the horrifyingly quick virus that in 1995 caused a widely
publicized outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, this reporter shared a Flemish dish, ``water zooi,''
that Piot's wife, Greta, a psychologist, made from chicken and
vegetables that Piot grew in the garden of their French countryside
home near Geneva. The Piots recalled how their lives unexpectedly
changed directions when, at a scientific meeting in Paris in 1976,
a notice was flashed on a screen asking Piot to make an emergency
call to Belgian officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to Zaire tonight,'' Piot was told. Earlier, the same
Belgian officials had opposed sending a team to investigate the
epidemic in Yambuku, Zaire, from which Piot's team in Antwerp had
isolated the new virus. Suddenly, Piot's presence in Zaire was
needed because American, French and South African scientists were
there and the Belgians did not want to be embarrassed by not being
represented.
</P>
<P>
   Piot's wife was two months pregnant, and the trip was supposed
to last no longer than 10 days. So Piot asked: ``Tomorrow?'' The
Belgian officials agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to Antwerp, Piot found that his passport had expired and
his picture was missing because he had used it for an application.
Even so, Piot, wearing his wedding suit (his only one), boarded the
flight. A cooperative Belgian diplomat told Piot to cling to his
coattails when they arrived in Kinshasa, and Piot entered Zaire
through a VIP lounge.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the trip had little diplomatic glamour. Piot
proceeded to a missionary hospital in Yambuku, a village in a
jungle where the Ebola virus was killing more than 300 people.
Although Piot's team escaped Ebola infection, one member became so
seriously ill that he had to be taken to South Africa. His illness
could not be diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Piot was ordered to fly to a meeting to report on
the investigation. A helicopter landed in Yambuku to whisk him
away. In chatting with the pilots, he found their breath reeked of
alcohol, and Piot refused to board. An hour or so later, the
helicopter crashed, killing the two pilots and a passenger who had
taken Piot's place.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Zairian officials ordered Piot to retrieve the
rotting bodies from the jungle, saying it was his moral duty to do
so because by refusing to board the helicopter he indicated he
``knew'' it would crash.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Piot returned to Belgium, his wife was six months
pregnant, and he had a new professional focus. Excited by the field
epidemiology he had just completed, he went to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which had a maximum
security laboratory that was better equipped for work on the Ebola
virus than the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp.

 &HT;    Commentary: '90s economy brings new ballgame
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For years the laws that were supposed to govern the
economy were as inescapable as gravity: What goes up, must come
down. It's only a matter of time. But in the '90s, the economy has
been mostly one way. It has been about growth _ sustained,
continuous growth.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when the cycle was clear. The economy grew, factories
hired, consumers bought, factories expanded to keep up, hiring
everybody in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when workers became scarce, wages were raised to hang on
to the work force, and the higher cost of labor raised the price of
goods. People quit buying, the economy slowed, recession started,
and lots of talk ensued about how ``it all had to end sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, this long ride hasn't ended, and even though labor is
scarce, with unemployment nationally hovering around 4 percent, the
economy keeps on growing, though somewhat slower.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of economists have an idea about what has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we all know about certain differences between the economy
of the '90s and, say, the economy of the '70s and earlier. The
markets are bigger, because companies now sell globally and not
just locally or nationally. Even the utility holding companies like
Southern Co. are now doing huge business overseas, building power
plants and providing services for awakening economies elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference has been the increased use of computers and
other technology that has replaced a lot of work and other human
activity. This efficiency has made industries and even services
more productive and profitable, without requiring more hands and
heads.
</P>
<P>
   But economists Barry Bluestone and Stephen Rose think there is
another, perhaps more compelling, explanation for the failure of
wage pressure to show up and dampen the growth of this fascinating
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous expansions, they say, in this one great numbers
of middle-of-the-road businesses have had alternatives to beating
the bushes for new bodies in the labor force. Instead, many people
who already have jobs are jumping in to work extra hours and to
take second jobs.
</P>
<P>
   And very importantly, they have been less likely than before to
ask for wage increases. All of this has been happening at a time
when collective bargaining by unions has generally weakened across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of the authors of ``The Unmeasured Labor Force,'' a
60-page publication by the Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard
College, Bluestone and Rose: ``Corporate downsizing and the massive
layoffs that resulted are fresh in the minds of American workers,
and they fear losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This insecurity makes them reluctant to ask for wage increases
and leads many to work extra hours (instead) to build a financial
cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there are obvious exceptions to this new ``rule.'' Just
looking at the metro Atlanta economy, we see spot labor shortages
that have some businesses screaming for help. But they appear to be
mostly on the low end of the pay scale, where fast-food and other
labor-intensive businesses are clustered. The problem is
particularly acute in suburban areas like Gwinnett and Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   Another big exception would be at the high end, where some
companies battle for scarce, highly trained technical workers.
There the salaries are leaping, and big companies like Microsoft
and others are bringing in technology expertise from overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Kaufman, a Georgia State University expert on employment
issues, says the findings by the economists may be less sweeping
than they think. But he allows that the forces they cite clearly
exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons why you see some companies advertising
signing bonuses and luxury cars as a way to attract new help is
because they want to avoid a general wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `If you have 100 employees, why raise the pay scale
just to get the five more that you need?' Instead, they pay the
five new people more, mostly in a lump sum that does not commit the
company to overall higher wages.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the future, Bluestone and Rose say we need to pay closer
attention to hours worked per employee as a way to measure
tightness of the labor market, and not just traditional employment
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they say, while policy-makers may take some
satisfaction in the fact economic growth appears much more
sustainable without inflation, there are areas for concern.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when we are trying to put welfare recipients and other
hard-to-place people into the work force, we must consider the fact
they may be overmatched in competition with incumbent workers who
have strong existing work records.

 &HT;    Money Talk: Windfalls present opportunities to save for future
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Americans have long been characterized as spending
fools, people who save little and show no concern for putting money
away to secure their future.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that shortsighted view is changing. Recent
trends have suggested both baby boomers and Generation X behind
them have started saving. Mutual funds, for example, held $444
billion in 401(k) assets last year, up about 35 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, along comes a survey from the Forum for Investor Advice
showing most Americans _even those in moderate-income families _
choose to invest money that comes to them in sudden windfalls. Some
spent new-found money on homes, cars, boats or just stuff, of
course. But most saved and invested.
</P>
<P>
   The study covered 712 households that got large cash payouts,
most of them lump-sum distributions from retirement plans or
inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   It showed three out of five of those households invested all the
money, and nearly another fifth invested more than half of it. The
windfalls were significant, averaging more than $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   Financial advisers said they were gratified but not surprised.
``We've all been bombarded by information that tells us we are now
responsible for our own futures,'' said Vice President Jan Holman
of American Express Financial Advisors. ``The corporations aren't
there like they used to be, and we don't necessarily have Social
Security with us anymore. We're being forced to be more responsible
for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The aging of the often-maligned boomers seems to be another
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were selfish, they are getting more responsible,''
said Barbara Levin, executive director of the Forum for Investor
Advice. ``They are feeling more mortal. And they are more
responsible for children or for parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The windfalls themselves can make people anxious, especially
those who don't feel competent to make investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Planners have ways to deal with that, steps many of us can
benefit from:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The first thing is taking a deep breath,'' Holman said. ``If
somebody gets a windfall, it's usually a situation of surprise or a
major change in life _ the death of a loved one, for example.''
</P>
<P>
   She also warns against acquisitiveness, that urge to spend now
and save later. ``A lot of people think, `I'd buy this or I'd buy
that.' If a person counted up all those `I'd buys,' he may find
that's a lot of consumption. So you need to be objective, try to
get the emotion out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Look for help. That means either hiring a professional or
laying out a methodical do-it-yourself plan. If you want to find a
financial planner, the best way is word-of-mouth. ``I recommend
that you talk to people you trust. Maybe a mentor, a boss or
someone you know who has been successful in their investing. Ask
who they work with, and then interview a few people.''
</P>
<P>
   For a free booklet on checking them out, my favorite is ``10
Questions to Ask When Choosing a Financial Planner,'' published by
the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards. You can get a
copy by calling 1-888-237-6275, or you can read it on the Web at
http://www.cfp
</P>
<P>
   -board.org.
</P>
<P>
   Many people like a combination _ working out their own plans,
then taking them to a planner for review. With this approach,
you're looking for a coach rather than a manager. If you want to go
it alone, you can find help in the bookstore. Good choices are the
works of Jane Bryant Quinn and Kathy Kristof, ``The Consumer
Reports Money Book,'' and for beginners, ``The Rookie's Guide to
Money Management.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Sort out your goals. Write down all the foreseeable things you
want to spend money on, starting with this year's vacation and
running all the way through retirement. You'll need an organized
idea of what those goals are, your best guess at what they will
cost and when you will need the money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cover the basics. ``If you start out with a bunch of money,
the daydreams are about a Jaguar convertible,'' Holman said. ``But
I don't think a Jaguar convertible is what makes people financially
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The basics include paying off debts, like credit cards; checking
out whether you have appropriate insurance coverage and building up
an emergency fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ The last step is building your investment program. This is the
fun part but often the most frightening one. It's one thing to read
about the big winners over the last six months but quite another
thing to put down your own money on what you hope to be future
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Here you face all the old familiar questions. How long can I
leave my investments to grow? What should I put into tax-favored
investment plans like 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts?
How much market volatility can I withstand before I panic? Do I
want to buy mutual funds _ another way of paying a professional to
manage my money _ or do I dare pick my own investments?

 &HT;    Wall Street: Investors should enjoy good times, with caution
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Of all the possible hazards facing Wall Street this
year, the one hazard it won't have to deal with is politics.
</P>
<P>
   It's an election year, but for all practical purposes it's a
nonevent, assuming nothing catastrophic happens to the economy
before November.
</P>
<P>
   And why should they? Unemployment is at a near-historic low,
inflation is virtually nonexistent, interest rates _ including
mortgages _ are trending down.
</P>
<P>
   And we may even have a federal budget surplus that could result
in a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, thanks to the economy, voters are likely to stay away
from the polls in droves despite the fact every U.S. House seat and
one-third of the Senate seats will be on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, there are still lots of economic problems: poverty, job
insecurity, the gap between rich and poor, and more recently the
Asian contagion that is hurting big business.
</P>
<P>
   But voters are notoriously inactive in good economic times, and
the current expansion is just six months shy of being the second
longest in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market in stocks is the longest, surpassing the 1920s'
bull market by almost two years.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, that last fact comes close to explaining today's
complacency. The stock market's wealth effect has fueled consumer
spending and diminished the historic gap between Wall Street and
Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   Main Street is getting more like Wall Street as Americans put
more of their wealth in stocks and as workers become investors via
401(k) retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, history says 1998 will be a good year in the
stock market, since it's the midterm year of the four-year
presidential cycle, according to stock market historian Yale
Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   The two best years of that cycle are the pre-election and the
election years. The worst of the four, the post-election year, is
already behind us. So far, the script is running true to form.
</P>
<P>
   Business consultant Harry Dent Jr., in a new book, ``The Roaring
2000s,'' says the best is yet to come: We are not yet fully into
the computer age, the Internet will revolutionize our lives as
nothing else has, baby boom investing will propel the Dow Jones
industrial average to at least 21,000 by 2000 and 35,000 by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to take all these encouraging benchmarks and turn
them into warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics make the case the business expansion will eventually
run out of steam because it is so old; the stock market threatens
to crash because it is so high; consumers are vulnerable because
they have so much money tied up in securities _ and debt; and
inflation will become a problem because the economy is so good.
</P>
<P>
   There's a school of thought that we never recognize the fault
lines and cracks until after the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   These reminders that things can go wrong in the best of times
needn't put a damper on anybody's hard-won prosperity. But it might
not be a bad idea to consider them from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   There's no evidence anyone predicted the 1987 stock market
crash. What those who claim such forecasts really did was call
attention to the kinds of vulnerabilities that usually precede a
crash, and make it worse when it happens.
</P>
<P>
   That, in effect, is what cautious forecasters are doing now when
they talk of overpriced stocks, speculative rather than thoughtful
investing, record levels of consumer debt and personal
bankruptcies, and genuine problems such as the year 2000 computer
dilemma.

 GENEVA: in Antwerp.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Piot found that he was not cut out for the discipline
required in a high security laboratory. He forgot things, and had
to undress and shower before leaving the lab to retrieve them. Then
he had to go through the time consuming ritual needed to re-enter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the man who relished the freedom of working in the
African jungle was extremely uncomfortable in the confining
environment of the CDC's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, Piot and his family left for the University of
Washington in Seattle, where he specialized in sexually transmitted
diseases. In Zaire, Piot had been struck by the large number of
women who had suffered pain and had become infertile because of
pelvic inflammatory disease, a condition resulting from infections
transmitted in sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   In one of life's strange twists, a fellowship from NATO, the
very organization that Piot had protested, paid for his stay in
Seattle, where he worked with Dr. King Holmes, widely considered
the leading expert in sexually transmitted diseases, and Dr.
Stanley Falkow, an internationally recognized expert in
microbiology, who now works at Stanford University. Of his decision
to pursue a fellowship from an organization he once marched
against, he said: ``I loved the irony of it, and I highly
appreciated it. That's democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Piot was astonished at differences between the European and
American educational systems. In Belgium, he said, students were
taught to regurgitate what the faculty members said without
challenging their views. In the United States, faculty members
asked students their opinions and expected answers. When so
challenged, ``my first reaction was they must have mistaken me for
someone else,'' Piot recalled after sipping wine from a bottle
provided by his brother-in-law, Yves Catulle, a sommelier and wine
merchant in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had not trained in the United States, I probably would
have left medicine,'' Piot said. He returned to Belgium and earned
a doctorate in microbiology at the University of Antwerp in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   On learning about AIDS later that year, Piot recalled the case
of a Greek fisherman who lived in Zaire and who died in 1978 of
what Piot realized in hindsight was AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Itching to return to Africa to study the new disease, Piot
gained support from the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Md., and went in November 1983. After research at the Kinshasha
hospital, Piot's team submitted a paper on the transmission of AIDS
through heterosexual sex to the editors of The New England Journal
of Medicine. The editors rejected the paper, citing one expert who
said ``it is a well-known fact that AIDS cannot be transmitted from
women to men.'' In 1984, The Lancet published the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just weeks after speaking at the 12th International AIDS
conference in Geneva, Piot said he never dreamed that AIDS would
become ``the runaway epidemic'' that it is today in much of the
world. Overshadowing the conference were new statistics showing
that one of every four adults in two African countries, Zimbabwe
and Botswana, were infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am angry that the international community and all countries
have not done their jobs,'' he said. ``I am angry that we heavily
underestimated what was possible and how the epidemic would
evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, the World Health Organization ran the global AIDS
Program. But then Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO's director-general, was
harshly criticized as being ineffective. (Nakajima left WHO Monday
after 10 years in the position.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the United Nations created its AIDS Program, a
coordinated effort among five U.N. agencies and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Piot, who is also assistant secretary-general of the United
Nations, was chosen because ``he and his group have contributed as
much or more than any to a rigorous scientific base for sound AIDS
prevention and care policy in developing countries, always linked
to humanitarian concerns for affected populations,'' Holmes, the
Seattle expert, said. ``His political abilities are bonuses.''
</P>
<P>
   A budget of $60 million a year and a staff of 150 limit the
options of the United Nations for defeating a virus that has
infected 34 million people. Piot's main weapons are influence,
moral suasion and the leverage of expertise. He has negotiated with
industry to develop vaginal microbicides as new preventions and
helped arrange a $300 million World Bank loan to India to combat
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Piot said he left the AIDS meeting in Vancouver, British
Columbia, two years ago determined to find ways to get the new,
expensive combination drug therapies to underdeveloped nations.
Staff members thought of something the United Nations had never
done _ negotiating with industry to lower the price of certain
drugs in those areas. Piot said he was skeptical but let them
proceed. Now some AIDS drugs are available in some countries at
one-half to one-third of their cost in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Piot also has urged government, industry, researchers and
developing countries to expedite testing of experimental HIV
vaccines, particularly in areas where they are needed most.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Piot was made a baron, one of Belgium's highest honors,
and had to create a coat of arms. It centers on the disease that
has become his life's work. Birds, representing freedom, surround
hands clasped for solidarity and the red ribbon that is the symbol
for the fight against AIDS.

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ In the nearly five years since the
agreement expanded trade with Mexico and Canada, millions of new
jobs have been created for Americans. Today, the unemployment rate
is just 4.5 percent, and wages are rising. A good part of that job
growth is the result of NAFTA, which knocked down trade barriers
and allowed U.S. companies to turn Canadians and Mexicans into
voracious consumers of American goods and services. (Geewax,

   EQUIFAX-STOCKHOLDERS _ ATLANTA _ Equifax is the latest company
to require more of its top managers to own a stake in the company.
As a result, the officers listed below all purchased 1,000 shares
from the company on June 1 at the market price of $37.25. Spokesman
David Mooney said the company's top 200 managers must comply with
expanded stock ownership guidelines initiated by Thomas F. Chapman,
president and chief executive officer. Previously, those guidelines
applied only to the company's top 20 managers, Mooney said. (Luke,

   HOMEDEPOT-SHAREHOLDERS _ ATLANTA _ With Home Depot's shares
doubling in value over the past 12 months, some insiders have
decided to cash in a portion of their holdings. One reason: a
desire to diversify their investment portfolios, said company
spokesman Jerry Shields. The biggest recent sale was by Milledge A.
Hart III, a director of the home improvement retailer since its
founding in 1978. (Luke, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   PREMIER-SHAREHOLDERS _ ATLANTA _ The chief financial officer of
Premiere Technologies, Harvey A. Wagner, stepped up to buy 4,000
shares shortly after the stock plunged in June, when the provider
of enhanced telecommunications services warned of a second-quarter
loss. Wall Street had expected a profit. (Luke, Atlanta

economy before November. And why should they? Unemployment is at a

   MINOR-BASEBALL _ JACKSON, Miss. _ The arcs of theircareers _ one
ascending, the other coming down _ have intersected on a baseball
diamond in this southern city with an outfield curtain of pristine
pines. Lance Berkman, a 22-year-old first-round draft pick, is the
star of the Jackson Generals, the minor-league team that soon may
come to Round Rock. Square-jawed and affable, Berkman is a 6-foot-1

_ sustained, continuous growth. A couple of economists have an idea
about what has changed. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

EXTERMINATING THE 2000 BUG FROM HOME SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Decades ago, when computers were new and when each byte of
computer memory was precious, some programmers realized they could
save space by truncating computer dates to two digits. It was more
efficient to store dates as MM/DD/YY, instead of MM/DD/YYYY.
</P>
<P>
   If those programmers ever thought about the 21st century, they
probably assumed, reasonably, that future programmers would refine
and replace the two-digit year code long before the calendar
flipped from 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   We know now that they guessed wrong, and that the decision to
save a few bytes of memory is now notorious as a computer bug
called the year 2000 problem, also known as the millennium bug or
simply as Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K bug is a little glitch with profound, expensive and ugly
consequences. It affects most of the computers in use today,
ranging from giant mainframes to tiny embedded controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Much attention has been paid to the Y2K bug in larger computer
systems, like the ones that control the world's banks, corporate
accounting programs, data bases, air traffic control systems,
nuclear power plant security systems, communications satellites and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore gave speeches last
week to encourage a swift attack on the problem, while the New York
Stock Exchange conducted simulations to make sure the stock market
will not dissolve into chaos when the year 2000 arrives. (So far,
so good.) All told, tens of thousands of programmers around the
world are busy sifting through billions of lines of code to
identify and fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But what about personal computers? Our home computers are not
going to cause the world economy to dive into a recession or cause
planes to fall from the sky, but is there cause for concern?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, alas. With the notable exception of the Apple Macintosh,
which appears to be immune to the Y2K bug, most industry-standard
personal computers are vulnerable to some manifestation of the Y2K
bug.
</P>
<P>
   It works like this: When the calendar hits midnight on Dec. 31,
1999, the next tick of the real-time clock built into almost every
personal computer will advance the year from 99 to 00 in keeping
with the decision to render years as two digits. These clocks are
typically soldered onto the motherboard and backed up by a battery,
and keep ticking whether the computer is on or off.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the computer, the BIOS (the basic input output
system that controls the most fundamental actions of the computer),
has among its many duties the task of assigning a century to the
two-digit year number. In tens of millions of personal computers,
especially older ones, that system has been programmed to assign
the century number 19.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the clock reports 98, and the BIOS makes it 1998. Unless
the BIOS has been programmed to know better, it will report a date
of 1900 to the system clock when the computer's real-time clock
clicks over to 00.
</P>
<P>
   Newer computers come with a Y2K-savvy BIOS that substitutes a 20
for the 19, making the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Since the arrival of the IBM PC-AT computer in the early 1980s,
personal computers have had a second clock, called the system
clock, that exists only when the machine is turned on. The system
clock keeps track of the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   The operating system asks the system clock for the time, and the
BIOS for the date, and the result is what you see when you click on
the Date/Time icon in the Windows Control Panel. Then, any programs
that work on top of the operating system, like spreadsheets or
accounting packages, pick up the date from the system clock.
</P>
<P>
   Confused? So is your computer and, by extension, any program
running on it that depends on accurate dates for calculations. It
may be for calculating interest accrued, or sending invoices to
customers (``Your account is now 1,199 months past due, and with
late fees you owe us $13,584,968.07. Please remit.''), or some
other time-based transaction.
</P>
<P>
   And to add another cruel twist, a number of applications now in
use have botched the dating scheme for leap year. Because the year
2000 is divisible by 400, there will be a Feb. 29 in the year 2000
even though there was not one in 1900. As a result, programs with
the Y2K leap year bug will assign erroneous dates every day after
Feb. 28, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Older computers are especially vulnerable to Y2K problems. As a
general rule, if the computer is built around an Intel 386 or older
microprocessor, and some of the early 486s, chances are that its
BIOS is not Y2K compliant. Newer computers are more likely to have
been designed for an easy transition to the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Older versions of Windows, especially 3.1, are most likely to be
affected. Windows 98 is fully Y2K compliant, Windows 95 mostly
compliant. Microsoft has posted a Year 2000 compliance guide on its
Web site at http://www.microsoft.com/y2k/.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is of most interest to people who use the computer
for personal finance programs, accounting programs, spreadsheets or
any other important applications that make calculations based on
times and dates.
</P>
<P>
   If the computer is used mainly for games, word processing,
electronic mail or other tasks where date sequence is not critical,
the Y2K problem is at best an annoyance (on the home computer, at
least; the local bank and utility company's computers are another
story).
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the fix is as simple as resetting the computer's
system clock the first time it is turned on in January 2000. In
others, however, the only reliable relief is through a BIOS
upgrade. And the oldest PCs may not be candidates even for software
patches.
</P>
<P>
   ``No PC can be made 100 percent year 2000 foolproof,'' said Mark
S. Paxson, manager of design verification testing services at the
National Software Testing Laboratories of Conshohocken, Pa.
``However, using standard interfaces to the clock, the BIOS or the
operating system, you can be year 2000 compliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Paxson has created a utility program for DOS and Windows
computers called Ymark2000 that will analyze the capacity of
computers to make the transition to the year 2000. It is a small
program available at no charge from the National Software Testing
Laboratories web site at http://www.nstl.com/html/ymark2000.html.
</P>
<P>
   Ymark2000 will not fix a computer's Y2K bug, but it will
identify which computers are candidates for a BIOS upgrade.
Fortunately, there is still plenty of time for personal computer
owners to prepare their systems for the new century.

BUTTE BREAKS NEW GROUND TO MOP UP WORLD-CLASS MESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
(lb) 
 By JIM ROBBINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUTTE, Mont. _ So much copper was dug from the mountain this
city in the Rockies was built on, that it was dubbed the Richest
Hill on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Now the copper is largely gone, and the bill for a century's
worth of mining has come due. The mountains and waterways around
Butte are so contaminated they make up the largest Superfund
complex in the United States. The contamination is so widespread
and difficult to deal with that company scientists have been forced
to look for new solutions. Butte has, in essence, become a giant
test laboratory for cleanup technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the problem is in the city of Butte itself, which
is next to one of the largest open-pit mines in the world. The mine
was abandoned in 1979 and Atlantic Richfield Co. stopped pumping
water out of the pit in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   As maroon-colored water pours into the pit through mining
tunnels that honeycomb the remains of the mountain, and more washes
in from the surface, the water carries large amounts of sulfuric
acid and a variety of heavy metals, including zinc, nickel, cadmium
and arsenic, and especially high levels of copper. Some call this
noxious brew ``not-water.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, 342 snow geese landed on the water and never took off
again. Burns in their esophagi indicated that they died from
drinking the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically acid,'' said Michael Tuck, president of MSE
Technology Applications, a company owned by the Montana university
system and funded by grants from the Department of Energy, the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other federal
agencies. ``And it has the potential to contaminate wells and
creeks.'' The 30 billion gallons of water in the pit grows by 7{
million gallons a day.
</P>
<P>
   All this began in 1864, when a handful of fortune hunters made
camp along Silver Bow Creek in southwest Montana Territory looking
for gold and silver. But it was copper that ultimately came out of
the Anaconda Co. mine, named by a New Yorker who was inspired by a
newspaper account of the Civil War in which Gen. George B.
McClellan's forces were described as an anaconda that would wrap up
the troops of Gen. Robert E. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   As the country was being electrified, and power and telephone
lines were being strung everywhere, the demand for copper wire
skyrocketed and Butte boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Mining was soon going on everywhere, and the mess it made was
everywhere too. Thousands of miners, many of them immigrants,
crawled through thousands of miles of tunnels. Piles of ore were
concentrated by being mixed in timbers and simply set on fire _ a
process called heap roasting. Acrid smoke laden with arsenic and
sulfur would envelop the town for days. Three million cubic yards
of mine tailings were dumped along streams, and migrated along more
than a hundred miles of river.
</P>
<P>
   The fugitive nature of the metals in the Clark Fork Complex
makes them especially difficult to control. They are so widespread
in the watershed, and so concentrated, that thunderstorms have
washed the toxic metals into the river where their concentration
exceeds government water standards a thousandfold.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 60 miles from the headwaters of the Clark Fork,
the bleached bones of cattle are not the normal white color but a
vivid blue-green from the copper in them.
</P>
<P>
   And the metals kill fish. One so-called toxic pulse occurred in
July 1989 and killed 5,000 fish. Normally, a river the size of the
Clark Fork _ one of the largest in the state _ would be expected to
have 3,000 to 5,000 trout in each mile of water, but the Clark Fork
has only a tenth that many, and in some places has a paltry 80 fish
per mile.
</P>
<P>
   Serious pollution has appeared 135 miles down river near
Missoula at the Milltown Dam. A layer of heavy metals 30 feet thick
has settled behind the dam. Any attempt to remove the layer,
officials say, will stir it up and release metals into the river.
The Environmental Protection Agency and Atlantic Richfield have
decided it is best to leave the waste in place behind the dam and
monitor it.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst pollution is right in town. In 1955, Anaconda said
the poor quality of the ore made underground mining unprofitable
and began a cheaper pit-mining operation, chewing up the mountain
with giant shovels, creating a huge wound a mile deep _ the
Berkeley Pit.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was spared, and even Butte's historic uptown area would
have been consumed, had not Atlantic Richfield closed the mine when
it merged with Anaconda in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Any solution will be less than perfect. Berkeley Pit's poisonous
brew is expected to pollute the surrounding aquifer by 2022 if
nothing is done.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield plans to spend $48 million to build two
plants to treat the water indefinitely at a cost of $14 million a
year. The plan is to add lime to the water and neutralize the
sulfuric acid, allowing the metals to precipitate out. But the
process daily creates 1,000 tons of lime sludge, which would be
dumped backed into the pit or stored in a lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   MSE Technology Applications is studying other ways to treat the
water, and to remove copper and other metals in order to help
offset treatment costs. MSE looked at some 150 proposals and was
evaluating 15 that seemed most promising. The water contains an
estimated $250 million to $300 million worth of metals, but they
are so diluted that it might cost more than that to extract them by
means of current technologies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One idea that works, at least chemically, is another
precipitation scheme, in which sulfides are added to the brew. This
makes the metal ions heavier, which means the most valuable metals,
copper and zinc, precipitate out and could be sold. It would reduce
the sludge to 300 tons a day, from 1,000. ``Chemistry is
straightforward, but the economics of building a treatment plant
are another matter,'' said Mary Ann Harrington-Baker, manager of
MSE's Heavy Metals Program.
</P>
<P>
   Higher concentrations of copper and zinc in the water _ 30
percent instead of 3 percent _ would actually make a precipitation
process very profitable and offset much of the cost. ``Our two-beer
scenario is to pour acid down the mine shaft and up the level of
copper and zinc,'' joked Ms. Harrington-Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is easy to get one or two metals out of the water, a
half-dozen other elements are left as waste. When a recent story
about the problems with the pit appeared, Tuck of MSE said he was
inundated with calls from backyard inventors who said they had a
solution, including one near Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent them five gallons of pit water, and I went and watched
while he cleaned it,'' Tuck said. ``He even drank it. But he had a
gallon of sludge left over.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the valley from the pit is Silver Bow Creek, the small
meandering stream where gold was originally found. Seven smelters
lined the creek at one time. Thousands of tons of tailings laden
with heavy metals were dumped along its banks. This stream was so
polluted that 26 of its 30 miles had no fish.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Richfield moved and buried the tailings, and planned to
build a plant to treat the water with lime. Instead, engineers
designed and built a two to three acre artificial wetland, complete
with cattails. Contaminated water from the creek is pumped into a
reservoir behind the wetland and seeps through the mud at the rate
of 3 to 5 feet per day.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria in the mud consume carbon and oxygen from decaying
plants. Once they deplete the oxygen, the bacteria begin to eat the
sulfur from the acid mine drainage and make it more alkaline. As
the water becomes more alkaline, the zinc and copper precipitate
out, like the standard lime treatment. The water flows through
another artificial swamp, where it is reoxygenated, forcing out the
methane and hydrogen sulfide gases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrasted with a system with a lot of lime, it's cost
effective,'' said Sandy Stash, who directs the cleanup operation
for Atlantic Richfield in Montana. ``But it's not cheap.'' The
method has been used in other areas, but is unproved over the long
term in a harsh climate like Butte's, with its long winters.
Because the pit water must be treated indefinitely, Atlantic
Richfield hopes the system will need far less long-term
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Other biological cleaning systems have proved useful. At the
Montana Post and Pole Site near Butte, where mine timbers were
treated with creosote, engineers have experimented successfully
with mushrooms that absorb the tarlike substance from the soil, and
are harvested and hauled away. Now they are using bacteria that eat
creosote.
</P>
<P>
   But the best solution for acid mine drainage may be the
simplest. The solution, called a ``submerged bioreactor,'' is
nothing more than cow manure dumped into a mine. Engineers have
been dumping cow manure into the Lily Orphan Boy Mine near
Elliston, Mont., for five years to see whether it would neutralize
acid discharges into nearby Telegraph Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Bacteria feed on the manure, raising the alkalinity of the water
and increasing precipitation, similar to the mud in the artificial
wetland. The bacteria produce hydrogen sulfide, which combines with
the metal ions to make them easier to precipitate. The result is
clean water in the creek. The remedy may soon be used in some of
the hundreds of thousands of abandoned mines around the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' said Marietta Canty, a senior environmental
engineer with MSE who has worked on the project. ``But it's also
cost effective and it works. We have a lot of cows in Montana, so
we're all set.''

<P>
   Boarding a flight from LaGuardia to Minneapolis last Thursday,
passengers could not help but notice Ana Voog. Strikingly
attractive, with huge brown eyes, flawless skin and cropped
platinum hair, Ms. Voog, who stands 5 feet 2 and weighs 90 pounds,
also has remarkably large breasts for such a petite woman. Her
clingy white pullover bore a startling inscription: ``YES, THEY'RE
FAKE.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when she was 30, Ms. Voog, a rock musician in
Minneapolis, gave in to her longtime craving for a bust line, and
had saline breast implants _ pouches full of salt water _
surgically inserted into her chest. She went into the operating
room, she said, ``totally flat, like not even enough for a training
bra,'' and came out a D-cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most surreal thing I've ever experienced,'' Ms.
Voog said.
</P>
<P>
   Surreal or not, the experience is one that more and more
American women are seeking. Cosmetic surgery to enlarge the breasts
(which does not include reconstruction after mastectomy) is
regaining popularity after falling out of favor in 1992. That year,
the Food and Drug Administration banned silicone-gel-filled
implants amid worries about potential health problems from silicone
leaking out of the pouches. The number of operations plunged to
32,607, from a high of an estimated 120,000 to 150,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the count has been climbing back up, and exceeded 122,000
last year, according to the American Society of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons. The states with the most operations are
Florida, Texas and California, and plastic surgeons report that
women in Texas request bigger implants than those in any other
state.
</P>
<P>
   Silicone gel is still banned from most cosmetic implants, but it
has been replaced by saline implants like Ms. Voog's.
</P>
<P>
   Why the resurgence? Plastic surgeons say the interest never
died. There have always been women who wanted bigger breasts, but
many were scared away by reports that silicone might be unsafe.
Saline implants then gained acceptance as a safer alternative. Even
though the covering is made of a rubbery form of solid silicone, it
has not been linked to health problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, despite lawsuits blaming silicone implants for
autoimmune illnesses, like lupus and scleroderma, studies have not
proved the connection, and many women take that as reassurance that
implants are safe. The recent $3.2 billion settlement between the
Dow Corning Corp., a joint venture of the Dow Chemical Co. and
Corning Inc., and 170,000 women who claim to have been injured by
implants did not resolve the question of whether silicone can cause
systemic illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are feeling more sanguine about implants not
being poison,'' said Dr. Bruce Cunningham, chief of plastic surgery
at the University of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   But saline implants are not without risk: infection and
complications of anesthesia can occur, as with any surgery. Painful
scar tissue can harden the breasts, and the implants can rupture,
go flat and need replacing. They can also interfere with
mammography.
</P>
<P>
   But women are undeterred. Breast operations are just part of a
larger picture: All types of plastic surgery are on the upswing,
partly because a surge in the economy means that people can afford
the operations, even though insurance does not cover them, said Dr.
Scott Spear, professor and chief of plastic surgery at Georgetown
University. Breast enlargement surgery usually costs between $5,000
and $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roxanne Guy, a plastic surgeon in Melbourne, Fla., said that
for some, breast implants have become a statement, like a tattoo or
pierced eyebrow. ``Women are more empowered, bold, more unabashed
and free about their bodies,'' said Dr. Guy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Diana Zuckerman, a psychologist and board member of the
National Women's Health Network, does not see implants as a sign of
empowerment. In many cases, she said, they reflect an urge to
conform to an image of sexiness defined by magazines and lingerie
catalogs full of models with implants.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham said he expected to see more implant operations as
baby boomers work to defy aging.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I'm going to emphasize how young I look,''' he said,
describing the attitude. `` `Large breasts show I'm young and vital
and full and happy.' I think you will see more of that, like you'll
see more men on Harleys.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are more women getting implants, but they want them
bigger than ever, said Dr. Joel Rudin, a New York City plastic
surgeon who performs two or three breast enlargements per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are understandably concerned about appearing that they
have breast implants, so they tend to be conservative,'' he said.
``But all too frequently these same women return a year later
saying that while they're happy with their implants, they wish they
had gone a little bit bigger. And many do decide to make the
change.''

   MINOR-BASEBALL _ JACKSON, Miss. _ The arcs of theircareers _ one
ascending, the other coming down _ have intersected on a baseball
diamond in this southern city with an outfield curtain of pristine
pines. Lance Berkman, a 22-year-old first-round draft pick, is the
star of the Jackson Generals, the minor-league team that soon may
come to Round Rock. Square-jawed and affable, Berkman is a 6-foot-1

 UNDATED: the change.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few women are neutral on the subject of breast enlargement. Some
shudder at the thought of having surgery just to fill a bigger bra,
and assume that women who submit to it must lack self-esteem or
intelligence. But others see implants as one more means of looking
better, albeit a bit more extreme than hair dye, mascara and
pierced ears.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic surgery appeals to some people, said Spear, whereas
``another segment would never do it and can't see why anybody else
would. The key thing is not to let one group tell the other what
they can do.'' His patients have included doctors, lawyers and
judges, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many women want implants because their breasts shrank and sagged
after childbirth. One, a 31-year-old mother of two young children
from Wayne, N.J., who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said she
had always been ``small-chested,'' but developed ``big, beautiful
breasts'' during pregnancy and nursing. Once she stopped
breastfeeding, though, they became smaller than ever. She wanted
the big ones back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really depressed,'' she said. ``I felt inadequate when
I was intimate with my husband. It was nothing he did. I just
didn't feel feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying on clothes, especially bathing suits, she thought she
looked downright masculine. Once, hoping to look good in a
strapless gown, she resorted to using masking tape to try to create
cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   Implants took her from an A cup to a C. The operation was more
painful than she had expected, and recovery took longer, but she
thinks it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sex life is so much better because I feel so much better
about myself,'' she said. ``I feel sexy and I guess my husband
picks up on that. I buy sexy lingerie all the time where before I
never did.'' She has even created a Web site (www.implantinfo.com)
to help other women get information about implants.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Voog debated with herself about implants for 10 years before
she finally got them. She said that before the surgery, her chest
was so flat she had almost no breasts at all. ``Clothes sort of
just hung on me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now her clothes look smashing, she said, but her D-cup anatomy
is a bit more than she expected. ``I think my surgeon went a little
hog wild,'' she said. ``I think I wanted to be a C.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other surprises. For a week following the surgery,
she was in such severe pain that moving her arms became difficult,
and her boyfriend had to take care of her. Her nipples have normal
sensation, but scattered spots on other parts of her breasts are a
bit numb. And her breasts do not feel the way she had expected they
would.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they would feel natural, and they don't,'' she said.
``That was a shock. I'm self-conscious when I hug anybody because
they feel like these hard rubber balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Voog's breasts are round, high and firm looking. ``They're
just the perfect android breasts,'' she said. But her nipples are
not centered; the implants have left them high and outside.
</P>
<P>
   People respond differently to her appearance. Intellectual men,
she said, seem less inclined than before the surgery to take her
seriously. Feminists act disdainfully. Men she thinks of as
``jocks'' have suddenly become more interested in her. Some stare
at her chest instead of looking her in the eyes while talking to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond their control,'' she said. ``They become totally
dumb, like deer in the headlights.''
</P>
<P>
   She printed ``YES, THEY'RE FAKE'' on her shirt with a marker to
attend a party in Manhattan, just to head off questions, smirks and
smug remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always wondering,'' Ms. Voog said. ``I just wanted
to put it out of their minds.''

AFTER TRAGIC FIRE, BARCELONA'S OPERA RISES AGAIN

   BARCELONA, Spain _ It was neither the oldest nor the most
beautiful building in Barcelona, but when fire destroyed the Gran
Teatre del Liceu on Jan. 31, 1994, its loss was mourned here like a
death in the family. For close to 150 years, the legendary opera
house had been at the heart of Barcelona's social life. And on its
stage, generations of Catalan singers had launched their careers,
not least Victoria de los Angeles, Montserrat Caballe and Jose
Carreras.
</P>
<P>
   While smoke was still rising from the ruins, shocked politicians
hurriedly gathered in a building on the tree-lined Paseo de las
Ramblas opposite the entrance to the opera house and did what was
expected of them: they announced that the Liceu would be rebuilt.
It had happened before. Inaugurated in 1847 and destroyed by fire
in 1861, the opera house reopened just one year later. A third
nearly identical Liceu would again prove that death can be
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost three years after the first stone was laid, the new
$95-million Liceu is close to completion. Its horseshoe-shaped
auditorium is still filled with scaffolding, but the five balconies
are in place and work on gilding the ceiling is advancing. Even
metal frames to support rows of seats have been installed. The
backstage area, for the moment a series of empty cubes, has also
been expanded downward and sideways to increase storage room.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, the Liceu (pronounced lee-say-OOH) will
be reopened by King Juan Carlos at a gala next July. A full
1999-2000 opera season will start in October of next year with
``Turandot,'' the Puccini opera that was next on the program when
the fire broke out. And in preparation for the return to normality,
Bertrand de Billy, a 33-year-old French conductor who has made his
career in Germany and Austria, was named the Liceu's new music
director in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater will look the same, but in truth we will have an
opera house for the 21st century,'' said Josep Caminal i Badia, the
Liceu's general director. ``It will be able to handle all the new
audio-visual challenges. A network of cables will insure it is an
`intelligent' theater. The stage will even be able to operate as a
television studio.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the renaissance of the Liceu has gone remarkably
smoothly, that is itself noteworthy. In the tumultuous world of
opera, where dramas onstage are often overshadowed off stage by
power struggles, financial crises and grandstanding divas, the
tradition is for problems to haunt the building, rebuilding and
renovation of opera houses in Europe. No wonder so many European
opera houses resist modernization.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, President Francois Mitterrand of France decided to
construct a new opera house at the Place de la Bastille in Paris to
complement the 19th-century opera house, known as the Palais
Garnier. But his notion of offering ``popular opera'' at the
Bastille was viewed by many as cynically populist, and the new
house's design was widely criticized. After it opened in 1989, the
Bastille Opera was battered by political infighting, strikes and
mediocre productions. Only now is it finally winning over both the
public and critics.
</P>
<P>
   In Madrid, the city's 19th-century opera house, the Teatro Real,
which was forced to close in 1925 because it was literally sinking,
only reopened for opera last October after years of reconstruction
accompanied by endless setbacks. Similarly, the Royal Opera House
at Covent Garden in London is due to reopen in late 1999 after a
$367-million renovation and expansion, but its image has been badly
bruised by charges of mismanagement, exorbitant ticket prices and
elitism. And its problems are far from over.
</P>
<P>
   The most traumatic of recent operatic soap operas, though,
involves La Fenice in Venice. On the night of Jan. 29, 1996, the
opera house burned down, as with the Liceu, for the second time.
Inaugurated in 1792, La Fenice was destroyed by fire in 1836, but,
as its name suggests, it rose from the ashes like a phoenix, albeit
with its auditorium redesigned. This time, Mayor Massimo Cacciari
announced that La Fenice would be rebuilt ``dov'era, com'era,''
where it was, how it was, and would reopen in 1998.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Things were not so simple. First, there was outrage that empty
canals beside Le Fenice had prevented firefighters from dousing the
fire. Next a judicial investigation concluded that the fire was
caused by arson inspired by corruption. Then a building company
charged that the $60-million reconstruction contract did not go to
the lowest qualified bidder. That dispute has finally been settled,
but with La Fenice still a ruined shell, no date has been set for
starting construction.
</P>
<P>
   With the Liceu, there was also potential for disarray. But it
seems to have been averted by careful negotiations between all key
parties before construction began. The opera house was originally
built, and rebuilt, by Barcelona's wealthy bourgeoisie, and when it
was destroyed in 1994 it was still privately owned by some 400
shareholders. In 1981, the Catalan and Barcelona governments agreed
to take over management of the Liceu on the ground that only
through increased government subsidies could it remain one of
Europe's top opera houses. But it remained private property.
</P>
<P>
   After the fire, it became clear that building a new Liceu would
require more than the $14 million in insurance due to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were unwilling to pay the $80 million or so
difference and the leave the opera house in private hands. Finally,
the owners ceded the property to a new foundation controlled by the
central, regional and city governments and, in exchange, received
priority to buy a fixed number of tickets for each show in
perpetuity. Further, big business in Barcelona was tapped for
contributions toward the reconstruction, so that in the end the
cost to Spanish taxpayers is not expected to exceed $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the fire, there had been discussions about
renovating the Liceu. One problem was that although the theater's
entrance was on the Paseo de las Ramblas, its auditorium sat away
from the street at an odd angle, surrounded by private property.
After the fire, which destroyed only the auditorium, Caminal's
other challenge was to negotiate the purchase of some 90 adjacent
apartments so that, once demolished, the Liceu would have room to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   By the time construction began in September 1995, these
ownership problems had been resolved and the new Liceu could count
on a vastly enlarged backstage area with up-to-date elevators, as
well as new rehearsal rooms, a gift shop and a large underground
foyer that could be used for small concerts or receptions. The
theater now occupies the entire block, except for a private club
that had escaped damage in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   As reconstruction went ahead, the theater's management was eager
to show the people of Barcelona that although the building had been
destroyed, the Liceu lived on. Using its permanent orchestra and
chorus, it organized a series of recitals, concerts, operas in
concert and occasionally even full-scale opera productions in other
Barcelona theaters, notably the Teatre Victoria, the Palau de la
Musica and the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best solution,'' said Joan Matabosch, the
Liceu's artistic director. ``The orchestra and chorus only worked
six months a year and then received unemployment benefits for the
other six months. That's not the best way of keeping up their
quality and spirits. One of our aims in the coming years is to
improve the quality of the orchestra and chorus.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the fire, the orchestra's size has shrunk from 96 to 85
musicians, while chorus members have been reduced from 85 to 66.
One of de Billy's tasks as music director will be to rebuild the
orchestra and chorus to full strength. ``One reason we picked de
Billy is that he can spend a lot of time here,'' Matabosch said.
``We weren't after a big name who would just stop by here for a few
weeks a year. There's a lot of work to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   That Matabosch's time is now spent on the future is proof that
the trauma of the fire is fast fading. He said that because the
Liceu was an opera house where people would come to hear great
voices in the bel canto tradition more than to see unusual
productions, the quality of orchestra, chorus and soloists would
remain central. Yet if the Liceu is to reclaim its place among
Europe's best opera houses, he believes it must also reach out, not
only to 20th-century opera but also to avant-garde directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to please all tastes because this is a city with just
one opera house,'' said Matabosch, 36, noting that he planned to
spice the customary fare of Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, Bellini and
Donizetti with Wagner, Janacek, Shostakovich and Britten.
</P>
<P>
   Caminal still has myriad details to worry about before the new
red velvet curtain goes up next year. ``I'd like there to be little
translation screens on the back of seats,'' he explained as he
walked through the dusty auditorium, ``so people can pick their
language _ Spanish, English, French, Italian or German.'' Could he
have forgotten Catalan? ``Oh, that will be above the stage,'' he
beamed, ``in big letters.''

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ In the nearly five years since the
agreement expanded trade with Mexico and Canada, millions of new
jobs have been created for Americans. Today, the unemployment rate
is just 4.5 percent, and wages are rising. A good part of that job
growth is the result of NAFTA, which knocked down trade barriers
and allowed U.S. companies to turn Canadians and Mexicans into
voracious consumers of American goods and services. (Geewax,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED. (k, f)
</P>
<P>
   MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ Americans have long been characterized as
spending fools, people who save little and show no concern for
putting money away to secure their future. There are signs that
shortsighted view is changing. Recent trends have suggested both
baby boomers and Generation X behind them have started saving.
Mutual funds, for example, held $444 billion in 401(k) assets last
year, up about 35 percent from the previous year. (Ezell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   EQUIFAX-STOCKHOLDERS _ ATLANTA _ Equifax is the latest company
to require more of its top managers to own a stake in the company.
As a result, the officers listed below all purchased 1,000 shares
from the company on June 1 at the market price of $37.25. Spokesman
David Mooney said the company's top 200 managers must comply with
expanded stock ownership guidelines initiated by Thomas F. Chapman,
president and chief executive officer. Previously, those guidelines
applied only to the company's top 20 managers, Mooney said. (Luke,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HOMEDEPOT-SHAREHOLDERS _ ATLANTA _ With Home Depot's shares
doubling in value over the past 12 months, some insiders have
decided to cash in a portion of their holdings. One reason: a
desire to diversify their investment portfolios, said company
spokesman Jerry Shields. The biggest recent sale was by Milledge A.
Hart III, a director of the home improvement retailer since its
founding in 1978. (Luke, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   PREMIER-SHAREHOLDERS _ ATLANTA _ The chief financial officer of
Premiere Technologies, Harvey A. Wagner, stepped up to buy 4,000
shares shortly after the stock plunged in June, when the provider
of enhanced telecommunications services warned of a second-quarter
loss. Wall Street had expected a profit. (Luke, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WALLSTREET _ ATLANTA _ Of all the possible hazards facing Wall
Street this year, the one hazard it won't have to deal with is
politics. It's an election year, but for all practical purposes
it's a nonevent, assuming nothing catastrophic happens to the
economy before November. And why should they? Unemployment is at a
near-historic low, inflation is virtually nonexistent, interest
rates _ including mortgages _ are trending down. (Walker, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   Red Grooms has always worked big, making copies of New York
landmarks and other quintessential American forms. Now he's setting
one in motion. His latest project, ``The Tennessee Fox Trot
Carousel,'' is what the artist describes as a sculpto-pictorama.
</P>
<P>
   It is a working carousel with 36 whimsical figures and 28 panels
on the history and cultural life of Tennessee. The carousel even
has what the artist has named a hot-dog horse, with five clowns
from the Grand Ole Opry riding an 11-foot-long horse with four
saddles.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which has been five years in the making, is more
than just another of Grooms' fantastical projects. When it is
installed at Riverfront Park in Nashville, Tenn., in September, it
is expected to generate about $100,000 a year at $1.50 per ride,
which will help support the arts in the Nashville area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the show-business aspect of art,'' said Grooms, who was
born in Nashville and sees the carousel as his gift to his
hometown. ``The idea of charging money is appealing to me. It's all
about making a project that is enticing enough so that people will
actually pay to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   After his installation of a walk-in subway car in the old
waiting room of New York's Grand Central Station five years ago,
the artist said, he began thinking about designing a kind of theme
park in Nashville. Eventually Grooms and two friends _ Will Byrd, a
producer in the entertainment industry, along his wife, Trudy _
settled on the idea of a carousel.
</P>
<P>
   The Byrds set out to make the project happen. They took the idea
to the mayor of Nashville, Phil Bredesen, who agreed to lease them
the land in Riverfront Park for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Byrd put herself in charge of raising money for the
project. With the support of local businesses, she has raised $1.2
million of the $1.7 million needed to build and operate the
carousel. ``We are confident we will be able to raise the rest of
the money,'' Mrs. Byrd said. ``This is helping to revitalize
Nashville's downtown, and there's not a lot for children to do in
the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Grooms said he wanted to explore the ``fabulous form'' of the
carousel in a nontraditional way. ``Instead of just doing horses,
there are characters in a circular parade,'' he said. Among the
recognizable figures associated with Nashville that are part of his
carousel are Andrew Jackson, the Everly Brothers, Davy Crockett and
Kitty Wells, the first woman in the Grand Ole Opry.
</P>
<P>
   The carousel has been made by Fabricon Carousel Co. in New York.
Studies for the project will be exhibited next April at the
Marlborough Gallery on 57th Street in New York.

   Fans around the world paid homage Monday to the martial arts
star Bruce Lee on the 25th anniversary of his death at 32. At the
Hong Kong Arts Center, hundreds stood for a minute of silent
prayer. They flocked to a commemorative exhibition organized by the
Bruce Lee Club and went to the Bruce Lee Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Others went to Lake View Cemetery in Seattle, where Lee, the San
Francisco-born star of kung fu films like ``Enter the Dragon'' and
``Fists of Fury,'' is buried next to Brandon Lee, his son, who died
at 28 in a shooting accident in 1993 while in ``The Crow.''

   Seinfeld, Live
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fans who can't get enough of Jerry Seinfeld in reruns
will get a crack at the real thing beginning at 10 a.m. Thursday,
when tickets go on sale for his 10 performances from Aug. 5 to 9 at
the Broadhurst Theater. The tickets for ``Jerry Seinfeld: `I'm
Telling You for the Last Time': Live on Broadway'' may be bought
only by telephone by calling (212) 563-5544.
</P>
<P>
   The tickets are priced at $75, with a service charge of $5.50
for each ticket, and there is a limit of two tickets a person. The
final performance on Aug. 9 will be presented live on HBO. Proceeds
from the ticket sales are to go to programs benefiting New York
City public school students.
</P>
<P>
   `Town' Talk
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First it was on. Then it wasn't. Now it's on again.
The show in question is ``On the Town,'' the Leonard
Bernstein-Betty Comden-Adolph Green-Jerome Robbins valentine to New
York revived last summer by the Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York
Shakespeare Festival.
</P>
<P>
   After its presentation at the Delacorte Theater, plans for a
Broadway production were announced, then canceled. Now comes word
that ``On the Town,'' directed by George Wolfe and with new
choreography by Keith Young, will open in previews on Oct. 20 at
the Gershwin Theater. Tickets go on sale later this summer.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   There's news of trans-Atlantic traffic in the casts of
``Chicago.'' The international concert and recording star Ute
Lemper will make her Broadway debut on Sept. 8 as the hard-as-nails
Velma Kelly in the Tony-winning production at the Shubert Theater.
Ms. Lemper, who won the 1998 Olivier Award for best actress in a
musical for her portrayal in the London version, will replace Bebe
Neuwirth, who originated the role in the Broadway revival when it
opened on Nov. 14, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Grey is to enter the London production at the Adelphi
Theater for 12 weeks beginning on Aug. 17 to re-create his role as
Amos Hart, the nebbishy but lovable husband of the convicted
murderess Roxie Hart. Grey will be making his West End legitimate
theater debut, although in 1951 he shared a dressing room with a
bear act while playing the London Palladium at the bottom of a
variety show bill headlined by the singer Johnnie Ray.

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Novelists often explore what they know best, and the
same sometimes applies to filmmakers. At least it does for Barry
Levinson, who has made his hometown, Baltimore, a star in many of
his feature films.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, shooting is scheduled to begin on his latest,
``Liberty Heights,'' a story of how race, religion and class
distinctions in the same neighborhood once mixed in ways the nation
has sometimes forgotten. The idea, Levinson said in an interview,
grew out an anti-Semitic remark he read in a review of his film
``Sphere,'' with Dustin Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so ignorant,'' Levinson said of a comment about
Hoffman's role. ``But it started me thinking about the time when
all these things began to bubble up _ not with hatred but out of
complete ignorance and a lack of understanding about people who are
different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberty Heights'' is set in a west-side neighborhood that
Levinson, who is 56, knew growing up. It follows three other films
he has shot in Baltimore _ ``Diner,'' ``Tin Men'' and ``Avalon.''
</P>
<P>
   As a body of work, along with his acclaimed television series,
``Homicide: Life on the Streets,'' they have celebrated the
idiosyncrasies of a city that many of its residents nonetheless
regard as less sophisticated than its big-city neighbors,
Washington and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, projects by Levinson and Baltimore's other
cinematic son, John Waters, have helped create a dense community of
grips, carpenters, electricians, makeup artists and actors who are
ever ready for the next film or television project shot in the city
or nearby counties. And there have been scores of them in recent
years as production companies have found that Maryland's varied
architecture and geography are easily adaptable to whatever the
script requires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been discovered,'' said Michael Styer, director of the
Maryland Film Office, which promotes the state to production
companies and coordinates their efforts with local government
agencies. ``We have all the right ingredients. We're cheaper here,
and there's less hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, all or part of nearly 60 movies, television
series and pilots from virtually every major studio have been shot
in and around Baltimore. These projects include ``Broadcast News,''
``Sleepless in Seattle,'' ``True Lies'' and ``Patriot Games.''
</P>
<P>
   By Styer's estimate, projects shot in Maryland over the last 10
years alone have added $500 million to the state economy.
</P>
<P>
   Few people have done more to keep Baltimore in films and local
people working on them than Levinson, who lives in Los Angeles, and
Waters, who still lives not far from the Baltimore suburb where he
grew up.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As directors, they have embraced the city and its style,
including the nasal accent that twists vowels and mangles words,
leaving them almost unintelligible to outsiders. For example,
``cheern for them Ay's'' is the parochial way of expressing support
for the local baseball team, the Orioles _ or O's.
</P>
<P>
   In Waters' case, every film he has ever made has been set in
Baltimore, from early underground ventures like ``Hag in a Black
Leather Jacket,'' ``Mondo Trasho'' and ``Pink Flamingos''_ the
themes of which you really don't want to know _ to his more
ambitious films, including ``Hairspray,'' ``Serial Mom'' and his
latest, ``Pecker,'' which is scheduled for release this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has never filmed anywhere else,'' said Steve Yeager, a
Waters protege who recently produced a feature-length
Baltimore-based documentary, ``Divine Trash.'' It is a biographical
account of a transvestite actor known as Divine, a star of many of
Waters' films.
</P>
<P>
   One star of ``Pecker'' is the working-class neighborhood of
Hampden, one of the quirkier parts of the city. Yeager said that
Waters' production designer, Vince Peranio, had found a house for
the film in which the residents had extended their carpeting two
feet up each wall.
</P>
<P>
   Yeager said he had asked Peranio: ``How did you get them to do
that? John will love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peranio said, ``I didn't touch the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Levinson, whose production company is called Baltimore Pictures,
has relied less on satirical elements of the city than allusions to
actual people and places. The diner in ``Diner'' was a real place,
the Hilltop Diner on Reisterstown Road, a favorite family
restaurant in the 1950s. Siding salesmen were known locally as tin
men.
</P>
<P>
   To a Baltimorean, ``Avalon,'' a film about generational change,
conjured up images of the old Avalon movie theater, which was on
the edge of a once-proud neighborhood that could not hold onto its
middle class. ``Homicide'' is based on a book about the homicide
squad of the Baltimore Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not unlike a novelist who writes about people and places
that resonate within,'' Levinson said. ``So I thought I needed to
be that way, with the rhythms, the language, the characters, the
architecture. It's all part of the design. I can't separate it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he knows Waters only casually but shares his love for
the city, even if they express it in contrasting ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``He literally works in a different part of the city,'' Levinson
said, referring to Waters' preference for its kitsch and kink. ``So
his sensitivity comes from another place. We may show two aspects
of Baltimore, but that just proves how diverse the city is.''

RECORD-HOLDING BALLOONIST TO TRY A SOUTHERN CIRCUIT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Fossett, a 53-year-old Colorado commodities broker who
holds the world record for long-distance ballooning, is poised to
begin his fourth attempt to circle the world nonstop _ this time in
the Southern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett said that on Thursday, weather permitting, he would
begin his try for the last unconquered goal of long-distance
ballooning. The launching site, where his balloon Solo Spirit is
being prepared, is the municipal stadium in Mendoza, Argentina, in
the Andes foothills.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the first round-the-world balloon attempt from the
Southern Hemisphere, and Fossett hopes that the unconventional
course will enhance his chances.
</P>
<P>
   All efforts by a half-dozen ballooning teams in the last decade
to circle the world in the Northern Hemisphere have failed, mostly
for technical reasons but also because of delays in the granting of
overflight permission by various nations.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett expects to fly mostly over water, perhaps passing over
southern South Africa, but not entering the airspace of any of the
nations that previously refused him clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett faces no immediate competition from other balloonists,
although several groups are considering efforts this year. If he
completes the 20,000-mile trip, he wins the Budweiser Cup and an
accompanying $1-million prize from the Anheuser-Busch Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The Solo Spirit, like most long-distance balloons, gets its lift
from helium gas and hot air. At night, when cool air chills the
helium, the gas contracts and loses lift. To compensate, propane
burners are used to heat air in a compartment separate from the
helium cell, providing extra lift.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett plans to use the same unpressurized crew capsule he flew
in his previous three tries, but a new balloon made by Cameron
Balloons Ltd., will contain 450,000 cubic feet of helium lifting
gas _ 180,000 more than in his previous three balloons. This will
permit him to carry 40 cylinders of propane fuel for the balloon's
hot-air burners _ double the fuel he carried on previous flights.
Shortages of propane contributed to his previous failures.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett acknowledged that flying over vast distances across the
southern oceans entails some danger _ perhaps greater than the
danger he faced when he made the first solo balloon flight across
the Pacific Ocean in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``My track this time will be far from the world's main shipping
lanes,'' he said, ``and an ocean landing would be a serious
matter.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m. Monday, the temperature at Blythe, Calif., stood at 88
degrees as large amounts of water vapor in the desert air kept
nighttime readings very high. On Tuesday, tropical moisture will
continue to flow northward from the Gulf of California and the
eastern Pacific, sustaining very high humidity across the deserts
of southern California and western Arizona. As a result, widely
separated showers and thunderstorms will sprout on Tuesday
afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, scattered storms will erupt from the Sierra
Nevada to the Rockies as the uneven heating of mountains and
valleys promotes vigorous currents of rising, moist air. Little
rain will fall from some of the storms over western Colorado,
western Wyoming and Utah, raising the risk of wildfires sparked by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat from the upper Middle West will finally spread
to the southern New England and northern middle Atlantic seaboards
on winds from the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the eastern Great Lakes, scattered thunderstorms will erupt
from parts of Ohio to northwest New York as a jet-stream
disturbance lifts hot, humid air. A few of the storms will approach
severe levels, with damaging winds and hail posing a threat. Severe
storms are also possible over Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will increase over parts of the upper
Texas and Louisiana coasts as a tropical low aloft moves northwest
from the Gulf of Mexico. Clusters of thunderstorms will flare over
southern Florida as another westward-moving tropical low passes
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warmest Week
</P>
<P>
   This week is on average the warmest time of the year for much of
the nation. Even though the longest day and highest sun angle
occurred a month ago, there is a distinct lag between the maximum
input from the sun and the time when the average temperature is
highest. Most of this lag is a result of the tempering effects of
the nearby oceans, which will not reach their peak annual
temperature for another month. Right on cue, the atmosphere will
provide the hottest weather of the year over a very large part of
the country during the next few days as the jet stream retreats to
the Canadian border.

   ... what attracted him to the script: ``I'm ultimately
fascinated by human beings in this circumstance. These men were in
a world gone crazy, and here's a guy who finds himself in a
position where he's got to go kill people. And kill enough of them
so he can go home. That removes almost all historical context and
makes it a purely personal and human adventure. I don't understand
the cigar-chomping, `C'mon you s.o.b.'s, let's hit that beach' guy
and I wouldn't be interested in playing him. But a captain who's so
petrified he can't keep his hand from shaking? I know him. I think
I can relate to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ... working with Spielberg: ``I think we both felt there was a
danger. That it's a recipe for disaster to go into business with
someone who's a friend of yours. So we had to say to one another,
`Listen, you can't hurt my feelings. Don't feel you can't treat me
like you would any other actor and I don't want to feel like I
can't bring things to you that I wouldn't bring to any other
director.' We can't be in this position where we're afraid of
stepping on each other's toes. As it turned out, many times I'd go
to the set thinking I had to talk to Steven about cutting some
stupid thing and he'd already done it.''
</P>
<P>
   ... his favorite World War II movie: ``As a kid, `The Great
Escape.' There's nothing cooler than Steve McQueen jumping
fences.''
</P>
<P>
   ... winning two Oscars: ``You can't simply rest on your laurels
and think everyone is going to think the world of you just because
you've won some award, whether it's the Oscar or the Grooviest Dude
in Town. Because I've got news for you. The next year, Nick Cage
won and I was just a guy who ... they didn't even remember the year
I won. `Oh, yeah, when did you win again?' `Uh, just before Nick
Cage.'''
</P>
<P>
   ... what's important about his acting choices: ``Your life is up
there on the screen. You may think it's not going to be, but it is.
Who you are and what you were about and everything you feel is
important in your world is up there on that screen. And at the end
of it, everyone's going to have a very good idea of who you were
and what you thought was important. Whether you're Gary Oldman or
Spencer Tracy or Van Johnson or Elliott Gould.''

 &HT;    Magazines praise ``Saving Private Ryan'', Hanks
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE FACE OF WAR: This is D-Day week for ``Saving Private Ryan,''
and from all indications Steven Spielberg's epic war film will be
as successful as the Allied invasion on Omaha Beach 54 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And as gut-wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II vets cry at previews, and hardened war
historian Stephen Ambrose has to ask the projectionist to stop the
film for a few minutes because the opening battle scenes are so
intense, it's clear that Spielberg has captured the essence of war.
</P>
<P>
   So far, reviewers are unanimous in applauding the director.
Entertainment Weekly's ($2.95) Owen Gleiberman calls the movie ``a
masterpiece'' and lauds Spielberg as ``our most spectacular poet of
war.'' David Ansen of Newsweek ($2.95) and Richard Schickel of Time
($2.95) join Gleiberman in a chorus of praise for Tom Hanks and his
band of rescuers. ``Hanks is surely our age's Everyman,'' Schickel
writes, ``as compelling as any star of the classic era.''
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA'S GAME: Time hits a home run with its 11-page report on
baseball this week. Writer Joel Stein analyzes the guys chasing
Roger Maris' home-run record, author Daniel Okrent grudgingly
admits the Yankees may be as close to a perfect team as he has seen
and John Cloud pays tribute to Braves pitcher Greg Maddux as a
``gentle tamer of the brutes.'' While the sluggers are getting all
the glory, Cloud writes, Maddux quietly goes about the job of
winning. ``I could be more Hollywood,'' Maddux says, ``but that
ain't me.''
</P>
<P>
   BEST BET: If you only have time to read one magazine this week,
make it Newsweek. This week's issue is unusually packed with
interesting articles. Daniel Pedersen provides a superb overview on
bombing suspect Eric Robert Rudolph and the ongoing manhunt in
North Carolina. Rudolph is described as a true believer who
regularly rented violent action flicks from the Plaza Video in
Murphy, N.C. His one comedy: ``George of the Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine, Jerry Adler offers a vacation guide
to places where you won't be disturbed by hordes of tourists. The
Amazon, for example, or Nada Monastery in Crestone, Colo., where
you can hobnob with the seven monks and dine on vegetarian meals.
</P>
<P>
   POWER MOVES: In the August issue of Essence ($2.75), poet Maya
Angelou and Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) talk about
power and how every black woman can get it. Unless your name is
Rockefeller or Kennedy, Angelou says, power comes with
perseverance. As an example, she tells the story of how she got her
first job as a streetcar conductor in San Francisco when she was
15. Rejected at first, Angelou's mother made her go to the
employment office every day until she was hired. ``They stood over
me. They called me every name you could imagine. But finally I got
an application. Within a month I had a job.''

<P>
   ATLANTA -- Jerry Draluck saw the Camaro turn hard, tires
squealing, and point itself down the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   The straightaway _ otherwise known as Glencourtney Drive _ is
where Draluck was walking, an ordinary man out for an evening
stroll. In the suburbs, the developers either forgot the sidewalks
or assumed no one would walk when he could drive. Whatever the
case, a pedestrian walks in the street. You hug the curb, ready in
an instant to leap for cover.
</P>
<P>
   It's dangerous, taking a stroll out here. It's even more
dangerous for children, who forget that drivers routinely do 45
miles per hour in 25-mile-per-hour residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Draluck has children and he'd seen drivers like the one behind
the wheel of the Camaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``He almost came around that corner on two wheels,'' Draluck
says. ``I was about 70 yards away and he's barreling down the road.
I get in the middle of the road and just plant myself. I'm not
moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Draluck is a man who puts in a long week at his job, enjoys
taking his son to Turner Field for an occasional Atlanta Braves
game and finds satisfaction in tending to his yard. But he's fed
up.
</P>
<P>
   So are many people in suburbs where residential streets have
become road courses. This is North Fulton County, and you hear more
people talking about speeding cars than about secession. They want
speed humps if not speed bumps. They want more Stop signs. They
want the Fulton County police to enforce the posted speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've called the police,'' he says, ``and it's always the same
thing: `There's nothing we can do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The kid in the Camaro knew it. Chances are, he'd seen other
walkers holding two arms outstretched with both hands up _ the
suburban appeal to Slow Down, Dammit _ as he sped by.
</P>
<P>
   The police would tell you Draluck was a fool to put himself in
front of a moving vehicle. They don't know how angry people in the
suburbs are _ angry that speed limit signs on residential streets
mean even less than the ones on the Perimeter and the interstates.
Angry that the police are impotent to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   The kid in the Camaro slammed to a halt, his bluffed called.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Well, uh, I'm late. I'm in a hurry,' '' Draluck
says.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a week ago, but you can still hear the heat in
Draluck's words. ``I would have shaken him,'' he says. ``I wasn't
going take his head off or anything like that, but I told him we'd
seen enough of drivers like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The police may have thought Draluck a vigilante, but the driver
in the car behind the Camaro stopped and thanked him. ``He said
when he saw him take that corner, he knew he was going to take
off,'' Draluck says.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody has his top-this story. I remember the woman passing
me on a curve one morning as both of us were driving children to
Spalding Drive Elementary School. I had braked for a Stop sign and
was shifting from first to second when she laid on the horn, long
and loud. I looked in the mirror and saw her yanking the white
Honda around my left side. I was doing 25 when she roared by me. A
split-second later and she would have met another car head on.
</P>
<P>
   I remember that hard face in my mirror, a really ugly look. But
the image that's stuck with me is the back side of a child's head.
Her child. A sweet kid, probably. I imagined him thinking, ``That's
my Mom, the Jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a patrolman at the school. I didn't know if he was
reading or dozing, but he might as well have been back at the
station house. Or home in bed. There was nothing he could do, he
said, and he went back to whatever he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Christy Toltzis and her family live on Spalding Drive, at the
bottom of slight hill. A speed-limit sign near their home says 25
miles per hour. If 20 cars drove by, I asked her, how many would be
going 25 miles per hour?
</P>
<P>
   She thought a moment and said, ``Two _ if that many. Most are
going between 35 and 45.''
</P>
<P>
   And she, like most people, has seen the driver taking a bend in
the road at 50 or more.
</P>
<P>
   You can jabber all you want about ``quality of life,'' but I
don't know what the silly phrase means. Like all cliches, it
substitutes for a real thought. Does it mean traffic? Good schools?
Proximity to a mall?
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you what I think it means. It means not being able to
take a walk in your neighborhood without waving a yellow caution
flag. It means worrying that your child is going to be run over by
someone in a hurry. It means wondering why everybody out here is in
such a hurry to get nowhere.

 &HT;    As long as Hanks continues to act, there will always be
comparisons
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It's difficult to explain, but just being around Tom
Hanks makes you feel better. Even if it's only for an hour in the
studied sterility of a hotel room at the Ritz Carlton-Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   He's funny. No surprise there. He's smart. Ditto. Articulate.
Double ditto. But there's something else, something you don't
expect. Call it, a feeling of reassurance. Hanks is someone so
completely comfortable with himself that he makes you
comfortable,too.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Marshall, who directed him in ``Big'' (1988), which made
him a star and earned him his first Oscar nomination, and in ``A
League of Their Own'' (1992), which basically saved his career
after the debacle of 1990's ``The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' once
said that the quality that makes Hanks so popular is ``You want to
take care of him.'' That's the Hanks you expect. The innately
decent yet endearingly boyish star of ``Forrest Gump,'' ``Sleepless
in Seattle'' and a slew of '80s romantic comedies.
</P>
<P>
   He's there, but he's not the whole story. He's not the Hanks you
get in an interview. And he's definitely not the Hanks you get in
his new film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, directed by his longtime pal, Steven Spielberg,
Hanks plays Captain John Miller. He survives the hell of D-Day _
depicted with gut-wrenching (and spewing) fury in the film's first
half hour _ and is assigned to find one Private Ryan (Matt Damon)
whose three brothers have been killed in action. The picture is not
exactly a day at the beach _ unless you count Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The new improved and certifiably serious Tom Hanks is not
exactly a new concept. He shakes his head and laughs. ``Do you know
how many times I've read the headline, `Tom Hanks Gets Big' or `Tom
Hanks Grows Up?' I'm 42 years old. They should've dealt with it by
now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledges that Miller is ``Responsible. Mature.
Adult. All that and more. But in a lot of ways, he's defined by his
circumstances. In the first scene, he's landing on Omaha Beach. Not
exactly a place for hi-jinks.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues, ``I'm aware of the countenance I bring to whatever
movie I'm doing. I realize I'm bringing along the connection the
audience has with me as an actor every time. That's the reality.
Every actor has it. Robert De Niro. Spencer Tracy. Marky Mark. In a
weird way, they don't let you re-define yourself in every movie.
But in a very strange way, the surrealistic thing is, that you do
re-define yourself in every movie.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly re-defines himself as Captain Miller. ``He's
totally gone in this movie'' says Spielberg of his star's
``Gump''-ishly innocent persona. ``Exorcised completely.''
</P>
<P>
   He cast Hanks, the filmmaker explains, because he wanted
``someone the audience could really identify with. To me, he
represents an American who is accessible...if I had made this in
1951, I would've wanted Jimmy Stewart to play the part.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the old Jimy Stewart comparison. As familiar as ``Grows Up''
headlines. Hanks has also been likened to Cary Grant, Jack Lemmon,
Spencer Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elliot Gould! Van Johnson!'' he adds with tongue-in-cheek
enthusiasm. His own preference is Henry Fonda. ``He was always
doing something so real. So simple. So quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about all those guys was, they all made it
look so easy. Then, when you start making movies, you realize how
hard that is. Joe DiMaggio did the same thing. I met him once and I
said, I can kinda relate to that now, that thing about 'you make it
look so easy. He said, yeah, it looked easy, but it felt hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hanks does make it look easy. Not just acting, but the whole
superstar have-it-all trip. Says his ``Ryan'' co-star, Edward
Burns, ``Without being cornball, you always hope you can have his
kind of professionalism after being in the business as long as he
has. He's a great family guy. A great friend. A great mentor. He's
just special.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Howard, who directed Hanks in his first big hit, ``Splash''
and again in ``Apollo 13,'' has called him ``a no-fuss, no-muss
superstar.'' It's tempting pop-psychology to label his nice-guy
equalibrium as a reaction against his chaotic childhood. His
parents divorced when he was five. Both remarried several times and
Hanks spent a lot of his early years moving around California with
his father, who was in the restaurant business.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanks attributes it to something else entirely: the theater.
He saw his first play in high school and ``It just looked like the
most fun thing in the world.'' So the next year, he enrolled in
drama classes (he still remembers his first play: ''The Night of
the Iguana.'') His real training, however, came as a member of the
Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland. ``You're in a
company with twenty other actors. You don't have to like them, but
you have to respect them. You have to show up on time. You have to
learn your lines. And often your job is to be the guy with the
torch who says the line that allows the Army of France to move
off-stage. But even in a small role I wanted to feel as though I
was the best person up on that stage. To have someone in the
audience say, 'Oh, I liked the whole show, but I really liked that
guy who played...' Because I've been in the audience myself,
noticing that one guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that experience (at Great Lakes) has permeated my
career more than anything else. I know the importance of showing up
on time. I know the importance of respecting the way other people
work. I'm not in this for power. I'm not in this for influence. I
know I have it to a degree. But I'm not an angry guy. I'm not out
to crush anybody. And I can accept the word `no' very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ''no'' isn't a word he's heard a lot lately. The
Academy Awards said yes, twice, giving him back-to-back Oscars for
his work in ``Philadelphia'' (1993) and ``Forrest Gump.'' (1994).
His personal life _ two kids with his second wife, Rita Wilson _ is
very private, but is also a total positive. And best of all for a
still stage-struck kid, he gets to act, as much as he wants,
whenever he likes.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up this Christmas is another Ryan _ his ``Sleepless in
Seattle'' (1993) co-star, Meg Ryan. They're re-teamed in ``You've
Got Mail,'' which is loosely based on Ernst Lubitsch's 1940 pen-pal
romance, ``The Shop Around the Corner.'' Which starred, um, Jimmy
Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ooooh, yeah,'' Hanks responds in mock anger. ``Funny. No one
says Meg is the next Margaret Sullavan.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, at this point in his career, no one's saying Tom Hanks
is the next anyone. He's the first and only Tom Hanks. It's been
more than enough.

LIVING THE FAIRY TALE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ Catherine Zeta-Jones is not naturally the fairy
tale-believing sort. The 28-year-old Welsh actress is, rather, a
pragmatic, wised-up kind of person with an earthy sense of humor
and a tough hide forged by some of the crummier experiences that
can happen in show business. But Zeta-Jones is currently living out
several Hollywood fantasies _ the unexpected big break from a
powerful player, successfully reinventing herself faraway from an
unhappy previous life _ that usually only come true in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My faith has been restored in those stories you always read
about, the ones that make you whisper, `Gosh, I wish that could
happen to me','' she says with a lush British accent. ``It was
really exciting when it actually did happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The exciting event wasn't being cast in the wrong ``Titanic'' _
the TV miniseries version, not James Cameron's record-breaking
feature film _ but being spotted on that show one night by Steven
Spielberg. History's most successful filmmaker was preparing to
produce ``The Mask of Zorro,'' a big-budget-version adventure about
the venerable action hero of colonial California, and he needed a
leading lady. Zeta-Jones not only looked like an ideally beautiful
Spanish noblewoman, she exhibited the strong personality and
physical prowess the role of Elena de la Vega required. Within days
of that broadcast, Zeta-Jones was taking a meeting on the set of
``The Lost World.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just me, Steven and the dinosaurs,'' she gushes. ``Oh,
I'm sorry. I just really like stories like this! It's something I
can tell my grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mask of Zorro'' was already cast with Zeta-Jones' fellow
Welshman, Anthony Hopkins, as Elena's aristocratic father and
original Zorro, and Antonio Banderas as the young bandit who's
trained to replace him as the black-clad freedom fighter. At the
time, director Martin Campbell wanted Izabella Scorupco, the female
lead of his James Bond movie, ``GoldenEye,'' for Elena, but then
Spielberg insisted that look at the TV ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Catherine was very good in that production,''
Campbell says. ``But her hair was done back in a bun and all that,
and when she came into the office it was, `Wow!'
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was she a knockout, but she gave the best reading of
any of the actresses we tested. Then we had her test with Banderas,
and it was all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeta-Jones soon found herself in Mexico, done up in elaborate
corseted gowns, fencing like crazy and trading touchingly dramatic
lines with the Oscar-winning Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty heady stuff for an actress whose biggest American feature
role to that point had been as a kinky, secondary villainess in the
misfired superhero romp ``The Phantom.'' Like many dreams come
true, though, this one required a lot of hard work. The mostly
desert, Mexico locations were broiling hot, the clothes were heavy
and, in her case, full of constricting cinches, and the action
stuff, from a suggestively over-the-top flamenco/tango to a
climactic battle royal, was enormously demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Zeta-Jones is also a trained dancer, well-versed in
performing painful physical acts with the utmost apparent grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth suffering for it,'' she says. ``They were great
costumes. And the thing with corsets is, they don't actually make
your waist smaller, they change the whole proportion of your body.
Without the corset, it just doesn't look the same, and you'd better
have that severe shaping. But it was hard, especially during the
dancing when I had to back-bend and touch the floor, and everything
I was wearing really dug in.''
</P>
<P>
   So it must have been a relief when all that stuff flew off
during a sword fight with the masked Banderas that turned into a
saber-slashing striptease, right? Don't you believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all done with wires,'' Zeta-Jones explains. ``There
were many different outfits for different stages of the fight: one
with a cut in the shoulder, one with a cut in the leg one where it
falls apart. But it was one of those things that, during
rehearsals, we'd reach the point where they'd go, `And this is
where it all falls off,''' but no one would ever explain to me how
they were going to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin would say, `Don't worry. It will be so quick, no one
will see anything.' ... People have freeze-frame (on their video
machines), people have slow-play. In the end, the fact that Elena
had extremely long hair was really, really great.''
</P>
<P>
   Good sport, this Zeta-Jones. Especially considering that she
abandoned a thriving career in Britain to start from scratch in
America primarily because she was sick of being appreciated only
for her looks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite high-profile roles in London stage productions of ``42nd
Street,'' ``Street Scenes'' and even a Hopkins-directed adaptation
of Dylan Thomas' ``Under Milkwood,'' Zeta-Jones was almost
exclusively known for a sexy character she played in a popular TV
comedy, ``The Darling Buds of May.''
</P>
<P>
   The British tabloid press _ being the brain-dead, yet
exceedingly busy institution that it is _ insisted on
characterizing the actress herself as only a pretty face in report
after report about a love life that she never even discussed, let
alone lived. Well, OK, she was once engaged to ``Braveheart''
co-star Angus McFadyen. But the real problem was, the papers wanted
to pigeonhole her as the girl she played on ``Buds,'' which was
like death to a woman with real creative aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was making me into this tabloid sweetie and just nominally
an actress,'' says Zeta-Jones, who will only let on that she's
dating an unnamed novelist these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did I never want that, I never wanted to be a star. I
just wanted to be on the stage, want to do an actor's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeta-Jones realizes that the more competitive environment of
Hollywood presents a different set of obstacles to achieving that
goal, which she has single-mindedly pursued since leaving her
hometown of Swansea for London at the tender age of 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I have to realize that, as a 28-year-old
looking like I do, there are only certain roles that are going to
be offered to me,'' she reckons. ``You know, Hollywood operates on
this ridiculous hierarchy thing: the A list, the B list, all the
way down to the Z list. Before `Zorro,' I was way down there, but
you have to be realistic. Until I get to a certain position, I
can't call any shots. With Jodie Foster complaining about the need
for better women's roles, what hope in hell do I have of stating my
case? ``Right now, I'm always going to be cast as the romantic
interest. But what you try to do with that _ what I tried to do
with `Zorro' _ is make the best you can of it. I tried to take her
as far away from the one-dimensional-girl position as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   According to at least one informed observer, Zeta-Jones has not
only the ability but the attitude that should serve her well in the
business. ``She's very beautiful, a good actress, a wonderful
singer and dancer ... not to mention that she's Welsh,'' Hopkins
notes. ``Most importantly, she's intelligent. She seems to know
that the key to all this is keeping calm and level-headed. I think
she's already proven that, no matter what, she knows how to have a
good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Zeta-Jones is currently filming ``Entrapment,'' in which
she plays an American involved in an art-theft caper opposite
fellow Celtic golf fanatic _ and, like Hopkins, acting legend _
Sean Connery. ``Wild, isn't it?'' she says of the dream-come-true
career phase. ``It's like, `Wow, who did I please?' I must've done
some good somewhere in my life.''

   CHINANTLA, Mexico _ In the dark before dawn, when the priest
bumped his pickup truck through the small town of Chinantla,
Mexico, to wake everyone up, Monica Cruz groaned and put her pillow
over her head. In New York City, as the assistant manager of a
store, she enjoys daylong access to cappuccino. Here in her dusty
little hometown, there is not a cup of coffee to be had.

   Still, on that not quite morning, Monica, who is 30, gave in to
the priest's exhortation by loudspeaker, eased on her black sateen
jacket and headed toward the town cemetery with her oversized
candle. Other New Yorkers were slipping into the predawn stillness,
too _ a busboy from the Friars Club, a nurse from St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, a maid from the Warwick Hotel.
Under a crescent moon over adobe, they felt blissfully far from
their daily grind, their bilingual negotiations with the place
Chinantla calls simply ``over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by a wheezy brass band and firecrackers, the New
Yorkers formed a candlelit procession, in Knicks jackets and Black
Sabbath T-shirts, between old women wrapped in shawls and toothless
men pounding their canes into the dirt. Lifted outside themselves,
they cleared their minds of everything but their town's patron
saint, Padre Jesus of Chinantla, purveyor of miracles that
transcend borders. This was his day; he had brought them back from
New York by the hundreds, as he does every winter, for a week of
fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   Up the steep hill to the blue church, they sang a birthday song
to Padre Jesus, who was festooned with gifts from ``over there'':
$50 bills, expired immigration documents, a chunky gold name
necklace. ``Padre Jesus of Chinantla,'' they sang, ``please send
your blessings to the so many of us in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Monica, a native New Yorker, felt like weeping,
indulging in an operatic release of the tangled emotion that binds
her to this pueblito. But she held it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think we all have too much love for this tiny
town,'' she said later, as she lounged with her three younger
sisters _ Elizabeth, Melissa and Antonia _ at their parents' grand
brick and marble house, paid for by tens of thousands of floors
mopped, orders cooked and garments sewn in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every migration story is the psychodrama of a family, its
aspirations and frustrations, its separations and reunions, its
traditions and compromises. For some Latin American and Caribbean
immigrants, as for the Cruz family of Chinantla, Mexico, it is also
the story of a town, a global village in the most literal sense.
</P>
<P>
   Like many modern immigrant families, those from Chinantla
straddle a border, abetted by newly inexpensive air fares,
international phone cards, and, now, by a new Mexican law that
allows them to retain their Mexican nationality as American
citizens and even confers it on their American-born children.
</P>
<P>
   But since their town, too, transcends a border, the
Chinantecans' connection between here and there is particularly
vibrant. They live divided between Chinantla and New York, but
consider themselves one group, 2,500 here, 2,500 there. It might
seem paradoxical that a tiny immigrant group could hold itself
intact while assimilating into American life. But, like other
Mexicans, and also some small-town Dominicans, Haitians and
Ecuadoreans, they have negotiated a double life grounded in the
intimacy of their community.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Chinantla is an especially magical one, the
multigenerational saga of a pueblito that has been bled of its
working-age population through a half-century of emigration. Yet
Chinantla has not faded but flourished, a would-be ghost town kept
alive by emigrants who consider the place a state of mind, an
affair of the heart and their spiritual anchor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't let the town die,'' said Ramon Cruz, Monica's
father, who recently retired to Chinantla 30 years after he first
set out for New York. ``It would be like spitting in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, the Chinantecans were migratory, wandering from
Mexican state to state until they settled under the amate trees in
the mountains south of Puebla. And so the modern townspeople, too,
consider their town portable. Even as they dwell in America, the
town anchors their psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Here or there, their world is Chinantecan, a swirl of baptisms,
sweet 15 parties, soccer games and transcontinental town meetings _
all recorded by the town videographer, Vidal Ramos, who travels
back and forth, filming and selling their communal history.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the first-generation Chinantecan immigrants are
waiters and garment workers and bus mechanics. Back home, they are
big shots. They are the ones who, working out of a basement in
Brooklyn, collected the money that built the town's schools and
rebuilt its church, who financed and designed its potable water
system and illuminated its streets.
</P>
<P>
   The sons and daughters of peasants who sign their names with
inky thumbs, they are also the ones whose American children are
almost all headed to college, in college or graduates. Every
January and every summer, their children and grandchildren fill the
town square with English, baggy shorts sweeping their knees. Cries
of ``Wassup?'' float through the hot, dry air.
</P>
<P>
   Second-generation, even third-generation New Yorkers learn to be
faithful to this scrappy town in one of the poorest regions of
Mexico. Teen-age girls from Brooklyn compete every year in the
annual pageant to be Senorita Chinantla, Queen of the Mass. And,
with their superior gowns and footwear, they usually win, like
Monica's friend Patty Ramirez this year.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-hour spectacle complete with multiple costume
changes and undulating dance routines, Miss Ramirez, a senior at
Franklin D. Roosevelt High School in Brooklyn, got to wear a tiara,
carry a scepter and ride a feathered float through town for a week.
Beaming pride, she was a world away from the city school with a
population bigger than Chinantla's where, by her reckoning, she is
``a nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Many older Chinantecans keep their children's connections alive
by moving back permanently to the one place where they can be
somebody. After 30 years of dislocation, Ramon and Zoela Cruz
returned triumphant, to an eat-in kitchen, a backyard henhouse and
the sweet, bone-deep satisfaction of familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   On their return, Mrs. Cruz, who spent decades folding fabric in
a Brooklyn sweatshop, hired a maid. She opened a small store, from
which she dispenses rice and advice. Wearing elegant suits from
Macy's, she teeters along the town's rutted roads in high heels,
her hair perfectly coiffed.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who dropped out of eighth grade to work the fields, bought
his own land, on which he dabbles like a gentleman farmer. In crisp
tailored shirts and Bermuda shorts, he is Don Ramon to all, no
longer a cook at One Penn Plaza but a candidate for mayor of
Chinantla.
</P>
<P>
   When their granddaughter, Samantha Bizarro, a third-generation
New Yorker, turned 3, she was sent ``home'' to Mexico. Grandma was
supposed to fatten her up with chicken mole and bean dishes
enriched with lard. But it didn't work. She returned as skinny as
ever, still devoted to rice cakes and Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   But she had had a taste of something far richer: Chinantla.
Another generation was hooked.

ROSEMARY TURNS SAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Looks like those rumors about Rosemary Clooney's
imminent retirement are nothing but, well, rumors. At least for as
long as the legendary crooner can keep turning hard luck into homey
goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that I'm 70 years old, and I should realize it and not
do as much as I try to do some times,'' Clooney says, her warm,
husky voice instantly recognizable over the phone. ``But I feel
really well.''
</P>
<P>
   The speculation that Clooney might be hanging up her evening
wear for good started earlier this year after she fell dangerously
ill with pneumonia, at one point lapsing into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney bounced back enough to make good on a spring gig at
Manhattan's Rainbow and Stars, the landmark nightclub perched atop
Rockefeller Center's 65th floor.
</P>
<P>
   But when she opened her new cabaret act there in May, one critic
_ noting the singer's belabored delivery _ wrote in an otherwise
laudatory review that the engagement had ``the unmistakable aura of
a farewell.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, says Clooney, who'll perform Wednesday night at
the Hollywood Bowl. She allows that she may have accidentally
created the impression herself by referring to the fact that
Rainbow and Stars is closing temporarily this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `This'll probably be my last appearance here,' without
specifically saying, `because the room's gonna close.' I'm not
leavin', the room is.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Clooney's not leaving yet, though there've been times when
she seemed to have one foot out the door.
</P>
<P>
   By now the arc of her life story is well-known, having been
documented in a 1982 TV movie: Her emergence as a bouncy '50s pop
princess, singing catchy fluff like ``Come On-a My House'' and
``Botcha-me''; her stormy marriage to actor Jose Ferrer; her scary
mid-'60s decline, fed by an addiction to alcohol and painkillers;
her stint in rehabilitation at a Los Angeles hospital; her
resurrection with the help of an old pal, Bing Crosby; and her
dramatic comeback from playing desolate hotel lounges to headlining
at the country's most prestigious cabaret and pops venues.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the jazz singer and onetime movie star is as frank
and unapologetic about her troubles as she is appreciative of those
who helped her overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working the tops of Holiday Inns that went around and
around and around _ in Hawthorne, as a matter of fact. And Ventura.
Look, I worked _ I'm a working singer. That's what I did. I could
get jobs there, and that's what I did. I didn't feel any shame
about it. I felt kind of sad about the fact that I'd missed, like,
the Hollywood Bowl and places that were prestigious. I wanted to do
that again. But I didn't think that there would be a possibility.
But Bing made it possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clooney will be the piece de resistance of Wednesday night's
1998 Lexus Jazz at the Bowl series concert, performing with the
Count Basie Orchestra under the direction of Grover Mitchell, the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band and the New Orleans brass band the
Dirty Dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it's still a kick playing the Bowl, she responds
with unhesitating gratitude: ``You bet it is. You bet it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Embarked on a new life with new husband Dante DiPaolo, Clooney
believes her travails have helped her to make the transition from
pop ditties to mature standards by the Gershwins, Cole Porter and
Irving Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those (experiences) make a song take on a different
meaning,'' says the mother of five. ``It may even surprise me,
because I don't particularly rehearse `Come On-a My House,' but
even that will take on a different meaning to me and will surprise
me sometimes. I was singing `Come in From the Rain' and it was a
time when one of my children was going through some problems, and I
realized that I had absolutely changed that from a romantic song to
a song about my children.''

`HOMICIDE' EXECUTIVE GETS NO RESPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ Emmy nominations will be announced Thursday morning,
and Tom Fontana, executive producer of ``Homicide: Life on the
Street,'' is not expecting good news.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana, doing his own handicapping, said during a casual moment
at the Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour that he
thinks ``Homicide'' will again be snubbed by the members of the
Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The police drama, considered by many to be television's best
show, debuted on Jan. 31, 1993, and has yet to even be nominated
for television's top honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being an abused child,'' Fontana said. ``You expect
to be hurt, but you really want the love. It's like I deserve the
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Fontana expects ``NYPD Blue,'' ``ER,'' ``The X-Files,'' last
year's winner ``Law &AMP; Order'' and probably ``The Practice'' to take
all the nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, I'll be home that night in September,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fontana has won three Emmys, so he is in a tough spot to
criticize the institution that has ignored his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanna be Susan Lucci,'' Fontana said of the queen of the
soaps who has been nominated for the Daytime Emmys 18 times and
never taken home a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   !folo!Crystal ball:!off! Two of television's best-known
bachelors are in for a wild ride this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Helford, co-creator and executive producer of ``The Drew
Carey Show,'' revealed some unlikely pairings in the upcoming
season: Drew and arch nemesis Mimi will have sex, Mimi will have an
affair with a married man, and Oswald will get breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   And Peter Casey, creator and executive producer of ``Frasier,''
announced disheartening news for any admirers of the pretentious
radio psychologist. After inheriting ``Seinfeld's'' coveted 9 p.m.
Thursday time slot on NBC, the show will get a new look. Frasier
will be fired from the Seattle radio station but will endure and
return to the microphone after ``going through different things and
finding himself.'' &QL;

 CHINANTLA: was hooked. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life in Brooklyn: Working Hard, Saving for Chinantla
</P>
<P>
   By early summer, the fiesta had moved north, to the Brooklyn
waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   On languorous weekends, gritty Red Hook Park comes to life with
picnics and ball games straight out of small-town America _ or,
more precisely, Mexican New York. On blankets, women spoon beans
and rice onto tortillas. Vendors scoop coconut ices from
hand-painted carts and pour tamarind juice into baggies with
straws. A ragtag band, cousin to the musicians in Chinantla, clangs
its way through classics like ``Cielito Lindo.''
</P>
<P>
   Furious soccer occupies center stage at the park that is home to
the newest of the city's nine Mexican leagues, made up of 262 teams
(including two representing Chinantla) and 5,000 players. All of
this soccer reflects the mushrooming of New York City's Mexican
population, which has quadrupled since 1990, making the Mexicans
the fastest-growing immigrant group in the city.
</P>
<P>
   They are also the fourth-largest over all, after the Dominicans,
the Chinese and the Jamaicans. There are 230,000 Mexicans in the
city, and an additional 100,000 in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Under each shade tree at Red Hook Park, a different town
gathers, sketching out a map of Mexico. One recent Saturday, a
Chinantecan player arrived and shouted, ``Oye, where's Chinantla?''
Another player pointed toward the East River: ``Over there, to the
west of Atencingo, and the south of Ahuehuetitla.''
</P>
<P>
   With the warmth of summer, the Chinantecans' spirits had risen
considerably since their return in February. At that point, having
spent all their money on plane tickets and presents, on lavish goat
roasts and cockfight gambling, they faced a sobering reimmersion in
work, plus as much overtime as they could manage.
</P>
<P>
   By Memorial Day weekend, the dapper Cosme Bermejo was beaming
when the soccer jerseys he had manufactured were voted Best Team
Uniform by the Mexican League of Brooklyn/Red Hook Park. But in
February, he was not thrilled to plunge into round-the-clock
production at his Brooklyn T-shirt shop. By June, the Professor _
Arturo Simon, a former teacher _ was shouting himself hoarse at the
soccer finals, but in February, he was morosely pocketing the key
to his estate in Chinantla to work double shifts at the Friars
Club.
</P>
<P>
   And by July, Melissa Cruz, 26, was re-energized by a summer trip
to Mexico, contemplating medical school, with a gust of ambition.
But in February, right after the rush of carrying a flaming torch
in an all-night devotional run for Padre Jesus, she had grumpily
donned her nurse's whites and resumed checking heart monitors at
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   When they first returned, the townsfolk scattered to their homes
in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Long Island and New Jersey, where they
complained about feeling ``locked in'' and grew wistful about the
town square, which sits in a bowl of hills dotted with saguaro
cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, though, they were gathering again in the
alternative town centers they have created in Brooklyn: their
social club in the back of a superette, and ``the cave,'' a cellar
that features a shrine to Padre Jesus, complete with burgundy
draperies and flowers refreshed before every Sunday's devotional
service.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters live in yet another center, a little Chinantla
in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish district in Brooklyn. Almost all the
tenants in their graffiti-scarred building are Chinantecan; they
shop for tortillas around the corner at La Chinanteca, the only
store in the neighborhood that sells photographs of Padre Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinantla, which the sisters visit at least once a year, they
have their own rooms, with queen-size beds and frilly comforters.
In Brooklyn, where their parents visit them every six months, three
of the four split a $700-a-month one-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Melissa, grown women, share a flimsy mattress on a
metal frame in a makeshift room separated from the kitchen by a
curtain. Pictures of Padre Jesus, Karl Marx and Mexican balladeers
adorn the walls. (Marx _ on sale for $2 _ was an impulse purchase
when Monica was studying Marxism in college.) Books and papers are
piled high; both women are studying for master's degrees, Monica in
political science, Melissa in advanced nursing.
</P>
<P>
   The real bedroom, where their parents used to sleep, now belongs
to Antonia, 24; her husband, Claudio Bizarro, a busboy; 6-month-old
Brandon, and Samantha, a kindergartner with pigtails.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen blocks away, the fourth sister, Elizabeth, 29, a
bilingual education teacher, her husband, Cuauhtemoc Tlatelpa, a
cook who aspires to be an architect, and their 2-year-old son live
in the renovated basement of an Orthodox family's house.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual and college-educated, the Cruz sisters work better
jobs than their parents ever did, with paid vacation, sick leave
and health benefits. But, American citizens all, they still live
like new immigrants, crowded together, pooling their incomes,
sharing cooking, cleaning and child care. They are hard-wired to
scrimp on comfort and squirrel away money for the future.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder they remain attached to Chinantla, a place of
winter fiestas and summer vacations, of comfort and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, Daddy was a cook,'' Monica said. ``In Chinantla,
he's `the man.' And we're his daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beginning: Hitchhikers Set Off A Vast Migration
</P>
<P>
   Chinantla's migration started as a lark 53 years ago, when Pedro
Simon and his brother, Fermin, hitched a ride to New York City with
an Italian-American tourist they met in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, who agreed grumpily to a quick interview in January, is
now an elderly resident of Chinantla who owns the gracious house
next door to the Cruzes. His father was a quartermaster in Zapata's
army, and his daughter is a major in the U.S. Army. In his world,
he is a historic figure.
</P>
<P>
   The leading expert on Mexicans in New York, Robert Smith, a
sociologist at Barnard College in New York City and an expert on
transnationalism, believes Simon personally spawned the chain of
migration from the Mixtec region, which spans the states of Puebla,
Guerrero and Oaxaca and whose immigrants account for the bulk of
the Mexican population in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and his brother really wanted to go to Texas to pick
fruit. New York, so far from the border, was not on their map. But
they were unable to bribe their way into a bracero, or
guest-worker, contract. So they turned for help to a friend, who
introduced them to the tourist, who volunteered to drive them
across the border. Warm and generous, the man took them all the way
to Times Square, put them up in a hotel and got them jobs mopping
floors at a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The day they decided to stay in the city, Simon said, they left
their hotel feeling celebratory, only to be showered by confetti in
Times Square. It was V.E. Day.
</P>
<P>
   Relative by relative, the kinship network followed them
northward. But the first wavelet did not come until the 1960s, when
Mr. and Mrs. Cruz were young sweethearts.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz had been working in the fields in Texas, but kitchen work
in New York sounded far more appealing. Still, he never forgot his
first immigrant experience; when he opened a short-lived restaurant
in Queens, in the late 1980s, he called it ``The Bracero.''

 &HT;    Heat waves helps lift Southern's earnings
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co. reported Monday that second-quarter
profits totaled $270 million, an above-expectations 26 percent
increase due in part to the early summer heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based utility holding company said net income for
the three months ended June 30 totaled 39 cents per share. Year-ago
net income was $215 million, or 31 cents per share. Revenue were
$2.91 billion, up from $2.72 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A.W. Dahlberg, president, chairman and chief executive,
attributed the improvement to strong performance from the company's
utilities in the Southeast as well as new unregulated businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy, the subsidiary that oversees unregulated
businesses, is an ``increasingly important contributor to Southern
Company's earnings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unit reported net income of $35 million for the quarter, up
88 percent from last year's comparable period. During the past
year, Southern Energy increased to 100 percent its stake in
Consolidated Electric Power Asia and began receiving income from
investments in Brazilian and German utilities and a newly acquired
Indiana power plant.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Co.'s revenue was boosted by record second-quarter
sales of 42 billion kilowatt hours of electricity by its
Southeastern utilities. Profit did not raise as sharply because of
acceleration depreciation of plant assets by Georgia Power co., the
largest subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   For the 6 months, Southern's revenue was $5.43 billion, up from
$5.3 billion. Net income was $512 million, or 74 cents per share,
against $402 million, or 59 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Co. stock closed at $27 a share, down 12 1/2 cents.

 CHINANTLA: ``The Bracero.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most Chinantecans, the Cruzes did not cross the border like
so-called wetbacks, but flew in on tourist visas. Still, their
intention was to work, and they quickly found menial jobs. Before
long, they had two American-born daughters, Cecilia and then
Monica. Based on Cecilia's birth, they applied for legal residency,
which used to be granted routinely in similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   It was supremely important to the Cruzes that the girls be
baptized in Chinantla, so, while their residency application was
pending, they flew home. They stayed with Cruz's parents in their
squat adobe house by the ravine. The concrete floor was sprayed
with a strong fumigant, probably DDT, to combat mosquitoes and
scorpions. Little Cecilia ingested the poison in play; she fell
violently ill. Mrs. Cruz swept up the girl in her arms, and ran
sobbing through the streets to find the priest. Her dying child was
baptised at the very final moment.
</P>
<P>
   Cecilia's death was an unshakeable trauma, particularly for Mrs.
Cruz. Then, after Cecilia died, the American Embassy in Mexico City
made matters worse. It denied the Cruzes' application for
residency, suspecting fraud because they could produce neither the
child nor a death certificate.
</P>
<P>
   This embittered Cruz, who felt he was being punished for the
death of his child. Three months later, he and his wife struck out
for the United States again, with forged documents. ``We defied
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of 15 years of back and forth. Three more
girls were born, Elizabeth in Chinantla, Melissa and Antonia in New
York. They were all brought home and left with their grandparents;
their parents worked round the clock, there was no day care
available and they did not believe in it anyway. They felt their
little town was far saner for children.
</P>
<P>
   That the nuclear family had to be separated was grim fact to
most Chinantecans. The present had to be sacrificed for the future,
they felt. The family was working toward a better life, and they
had no doubts that their bonds would remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters remember their childhood in Chinantla with
great affection. They played jacks with rocks, and sold lemonade in
the town square. They dug holes in the dirt road and covered them
with plastic to trick the burros, who stumbled, sending the girls
into peals of laughter. They wore threadbare uniforms to the
one-room schoolhouse, and then threw themselves under the dining
table to do their homework.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip home, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz bought a small house of
their own. The next trip was involuntary. Cruz, to his everlasting
humiliation, was picked up by immigration agents, jailed for 15
days, and deported. The Cruzes decided enough was enough. They were
tired of being illegal, tired of working so hard. They opened a
small store in Chinantla, and swore they would never return to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as fate would have it, they got the call that, after so
many years, they were to get their green cards. Mrs. Cruz did not
want to return. ``I had lost my New York head,'' she said. But Cruz
felt they could not turn down the opportunity ``to elevate our life
style even further.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1979, and Monica was 13. Her parents sat her down and
delivered earth-shattering news: she was American, born in New York
City. She refused to believe it. ``Look at this face, this brown
face,'' she shouted. ``Is this not a Mexican face?'' She ran away
into the hills and hid under an amate tree.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest sister, Antonia, who was only 6, bubbled over with
excitement. She announced that the next time she returned to
Chinantla she would be blonde. (And indeed she was.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it was a green van that came to take us away,''
Melissa said. ``I remember driving off and a long line of dogs
following us, barking. We were all crying. My father said something
like, `Look forward, not back.' And then it was like fingers
snapped and we were landing at Kennedy. The chapter in Chinantla
was closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so they thought.
</P>
<P>
   The Divisions: One Community, But Tensions, Too
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday morning in her Bensonhurst apartment, Elbia Cruz,
the sisters' aunt, wore curlers and an ``I Love Chinantla''
T-shirt. She welcomed a reporter she had never met with kisses on
each cheek, and homemade tostadas. Then she worked herself to tears
expressing a disdain shared by many Chinantecans for those
immigrants who do not love New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say New York is a pigsty,'' said Ms. Cruz, a retired
housekeeper. ``They say we work like slaves here. I say my thanks
to God and to New York every night. We made ourselves here. And we
remade Chinantla. Were it not for New York, Chinantla would be
dead. Like a corpse.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, it was clear that the only way for a Chinantecan
to survive financially was to leave Chinantla. This reality
produced a collective pang of conscience, and a kind of unspoken
social contract emerged. Leaving could not be solely for the
betterment of the individual but for that of the town as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinantecan defines himself by what he gives to his
town,'' said Adan Lazaro, 44, a bell captain at the Princeton Club
and president of the Mexican-American Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Chinantecans tithed a portion of their
earnings to their town. They formed the New York Committee, which
developed a census of Chinantecan immigrants. When they were
raising money for a specific project, they divided up addresses and
crisscrossed the metropolitan area on what they called ``la
colecta.''
</P>
<P>
   Their first present was a brick floor for the town square so
feet would not get muddy during the winter fiesta. The immigrants
offered it, Smith said, as ``humble expatriates simply wishing to
do something from New York for their hometown.'' Over the years,
however, the committee grew into a kind of shadow municipal
government, which believes its ``cave'' in Brooklyn to be the
town's real center of power, said Smith, who has studied Chinantla
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The committee consists only of men, by now in their 50s, but it
has spawned at least five subcommittees that are more inclusive.
One raises money for and plans the annual 300-mile torch run from a
cathedral in Mexico City to the church in Chinantla. Another plans
the simultaneous torch run that takes place in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The committee meets on Sundays, its members snaking an extension
cord down into the cave so they can watch soccer on television. As
if it was a uniform, the men wear blue jeans and black leather
jackets. Sometimes they gather around a cellular phone for
conferences with the municipal government; sometimes they videotape
their meetings and send the tapes south.
</P>
<P>
   For the potable water project, the New Yorkers raised $100,000
in small donations, and breathlessly tracked the work through
teleconferences with contractors and weekend trips to Chinantla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority has been to give this little town its most basic
needs,'' said Abel Alonso, the committee's president. ``We have
changed the physiognomy of the town.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's motto is immortalized on an ink stamp: ``To
Chinantla and its future: The absent ones are always present.''
</P>
<P>
   To the official government of Chinantla, the motto has the faint
ring of a threat. But that has to be ignored, said Dr. Francisco
Calixto, the mayor, because, ``We have no other source of income
besides New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers send about $2 million a year home to Chinantla,
according to Smith. Scores of American pension checks and Social
Security checks also arrive every month to help support retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Calixto obstinately describes the relationship between
the town and its expatriates as if it were a simple cultural
exchange and not a mutual dependency. ``We send tacos there,'' he
said, ``and they bring hamburgers here.''

 CHINANTLA: hamburgers here.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the behest of Manuel Bartlett, the governor of Puebla state,
Calixto traveled to New York in 1996 to embrace the immigrants _
and give them a shopping list of municipal improvements they might
consider financing. But there are tensions between those who live
here and there about what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers want to preserve the town's charm, and the
locals want to modernize. The expatriates grew furious when some
cobblestone streets were paved, and when the church's antique pews,
with their rippled wood, were smoothed so they would supposedly be
more comfortable. (When several of Calixto's relatives were hired
to do the work, the relationship between the mayor and the New
Yorkers soured.)
</P>
<P>
   There are also tensions about who should have power, who should
get credit, and who really needs help, the town or the immigrants.
Calixto said he intends to sponsor Mexican Spanish classes for the
expatriates' ``poor children,'' who are being ``infected'' by
Caribbean Spanish. He lamented the teen-agers lost to gangs and the
respiratory problems developed in New York sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who lives in Chinantla knows about failed trips to the
North. There is a sad sack of a homeless man who has barely budged
from a park bench since his return, and a young couple who
contracted AIDS and came back to die.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the cellular phones and satellite dishes that have plugged
the town into the outside world, the mayor thinks that they should
be the silent advocates of caution to those who would sell their
little houses and venture north unprepared for hardship.
</P>
<P>
   The Compromises: Small-Town Girls Trapped in the City
</P>
<P>
   At Chinantla's one hotel, where rooms cost $8 a night and the
management promises ``nothing will sting you,'' two young men
dressed like Brooklyn homeboys discussed their flight from New
York. Richard Calixto was mockingly indignant. The American woman
sitting beside him on the plane had asked what he did for a living,
interrupting herself to say, ``Let me guess! Dishwasher!''
</P>
<P>
   Calixto, 30, is a cost analyst for a real estate firm. He and
his wife, who is also Chinantecan, own a travel agency in Brooklyn,
too, catering to Mexicans. They sold $100,000 worth of discount
tickets to Chinantecans returning for the winter fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   The Calixtos belong to an elite of Chinantecans whose businesses
help those in New York maintain connections with home. Calixto, the
American-born son of Manhattan hotel workers, credits his parents
for taking him back to Mexico for high school. Like many
Chinantecan parents, they wanted to protect him from the vices of
New York, and he believes they did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it changed my whole life coming down here,'' he said.
``It centered me. If I stayed in New York, I don't know what would
have become of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters, though, were following a reverse route when
they returned to New York for the second half of their childhood in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   At first they savored the luxuries of the developed world. They
reveled in indoor showers after a lifetime of crouching beneath
upturned pots of bracing well water.
</P>
<P>
   But they also mourned the loss of their small-town freedom. They
bounced off the walls of their family's first residence, outdoorsy
girls trapped in an efficiency apartment.
</P>
<P>
   While their parents worked, they looked after one another. They
were so close, and so accustomed to cramming into one tiny room
with their two bunk beds, that when they briefly lived in a
five-room apartment they refused to split up.
</P>
<P>
   Before day broke, their mother would leave for work at a garment
factory whose name she has erased from her memory. Their father
would sleep late because he always worked a late shift as a cook,
first at the former Copacabana, then at the One Penn Plaza
restaurant, cooking Buffalo wings and spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters competed to get 97s and 98s on tests. Their father
hovered and lectured, drilling them in geography and world
politics. He did not tolerate television watching. He did not let
the girls date. They were very good girls, and remain loyal to this
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents gave us everything, and they gave up everything
for us,'' Melissa said. ``All they wanted us to do was go to school
and make a better person of ourselves, and not end up doing the
jobs they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first eight years, they could not afford a single trip
to Mexico. Then, when their father landed the One Penn Plaza job,
which paid union wages, they began the custom of regular visits
home. On one of those trips, Elizabeth met her future husband,
Cuauhtemoc, a Chinantecan.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Antonia, the youngest and always the rebel, who
married first. She met her husband, Claudio, then a new immigrant
from the state of Morelos, at a volleyball game organized by a
Chinantecan youth group.
</P>
<P>
   Antonia had infuriated her parents by dropping out of high
school when she got engaged. Still, her wedding party was a
declaration of just how far the family _ and the community _ had
come. Cruz rented the Roseland Ballroom and invited le tout
Chinantla, as well as half of neighboring Piaxtla, and some of
nearby Tehuitzingo.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth, the most studious sister, waited until she completed
her master's degree in bilingual education to marry Cuauhtemoc.
Befitting the very serious bride, it was a more subdued event,
although the groom did dress like a gaucho.
</P>
<P>
   After their wedding, Elizabeth, the only daughter born in
Mexico, forced herself to become a U.S. citizen. Raising her hand
for the pledge of allegiance, she panicked at what she considered a
betrayal of her identity. She mouthed the words while thinking to
herself, ``I'm doing this for my husband,'' who obtained a green
card through their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Melissa joke that all the Chinantecan boys are taken
and that they will have to range farther afield. But they are in no
hurry, for their ambitions, if at times scattered, are great.
</P>
<P>
   Monica, an on-again, off-again graduate student in political
science at the CUNY Graduate Center, wants to go to law school and
practice public interest law, either in New York or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa, the nurse, intends to write her master's thesis on
rural public health issues in Chinantla; then, she wants to go to
medical school. ``Imagine,'' she said, ``a doctor in the house!''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, both fantasize about returning to Mexico and
opening a cafe/bar in Puebla; next fall, in between academic
subjects, they will be studying bartending.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat on a crate between bottles of hot sauce and bags of
rice in her store in Chinantla, Mrs. Cruz was asked if she was
proud of how far her family had come in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   She pursed her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two are still single, and they don't have all their diplomas
yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a demanding immigrant mother, the jury is still out.

 CHINANTLA: still out. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Legends: Finding Comfort In Padre Jesus
</P>
<P>
   Every Chinantecan home in the New York area has a photograph of
Padre Jesus, and some have wooden replicas of the statue. The
legend is passed on as a bedtime story to children in Winnie the
Pooh pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1700s, missionaries carrying a wooden statue of Jesus
passed through Chinantla heading south. They laid the icon down
beneath a tree, ate salt-encrusted tortillas, and took a nap. When
they were ready to continue their journey, they could not budge the
statue. But when they sought help from the townspeople, they were
stunned to discover that the Chinantecans could lift Padre Jesus
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   This inexplicable phenomenon was considered a sign from above
that the statue should be left in the blue church on the hill. And
from that time on, Padre Jesus, now of Chinantla, was considered
the town's patron saint, and the town put itself in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Arturo Simon's wife, Rosalba, now an ace garment worker at
sweater factory in Brooklyn, cut off her shimmering knee-length
hair and gave it to Padre Jesus before she and her husband
emigrated.
</P>
<P>
   And Elizabeth Cruz, belly bulging with her first child, lowered
herself to her knees in her Brooklyn apartment and crossed herself
before his photo. It had been a difficult pregnancy and she was
confined to bed. ``If we survive,'' she promised, ``I will bring my
baby to you in Chinantla to be baptized.''
</P>
<P>
   By early this year _ ``miracle of miracles,'' she said _
Elizabeth was sending out engraved invitations, inviting all of
Chinantecan New York to the biggest baptism party of the season, on
her parents' terraced patio in Chinantla during the winter fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   Rites of Passage: `Does Time Move More Slowly Here?'
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the party, skinned goats swung from the trees
in the backyard. Old women were sifting through bags of rice,
plucking out dirt. The four Cruz sisters were stringing the patio
with baby blue streamers and setting out long banquet tables and
plastic chairs bearing the Corona beer logo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it just me, or does time move more slowly here?'' Antonia
asked her husband, Claudio, who shrugged. Claudio was a one-man
exercise in contrasts, wearing a cowboy hat, boots, a tooled belt
that said Mexico and a Baby Bjorn baby carrier, with baby Brandon,
straight from yuppie New York.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen college-age women arrived to help with the
preparations. Leticia Lopez, a business major at Berkeley College
in Paramus, N.J., turned her face to the sun, and sighed, rubbing
her Fila sneaker in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the sky back there was like this, nice and blue,'' she
said. ``It's so nice and quiet here, too. People don't go through
the same crazy routine: wake up, go to school, go to work, go home,
eat dinner, go to sleep. Down here, life has time to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, the boy of honor, 2-year-old Christian de
Jesus, was plunked into the official town barber's chair, at the
Esthetic Clinic, for a $1 baptism-special buzz cut.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., the ubiquitous town band showed up to parade
Christian and his parents through Chinantla. Christian was dressed
in a white captain's suit with gold braiding. A toy saber hung from
his side. Holding his parents' hands, he climbed the steep, rocky
path to the church.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted by the anticipation, Christian fell sound asleep just
as the ceremony began. As his godfather, his Uncle Claudio, held
him in his arms, the priest, in green robes, poured cups of water
over his closed eyes. His parents' faces crumpled; tears spilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my promise has been fulfilled,'' Elizabeth said.
</P>
<P>
   When they arrived home with the first party guests, Melissa was
still in her jeans and T-shirt, grungy from a marathon cleaning.
``You better go take a shower,'' said a cousin from Mexico City.
``You look like an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Melissa waited until the cousin had moved on, then wrinkled her
nose and said, ``Well, I am an American!'' She hesitated, then
added, ``Sort of,'' and her friends, the college-age women, smiled
knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're _ what are those dogs called? _ mutts,'' Leticia said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Chinantecans are not conflicted about their
identities. They know instinctively that their attachment to
Chinantla is healthy, that it gives them a rich identity, and a
keen, even enviable sense of community in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But they do maintain a kind of jokey banter that reflects some
tension. When the sisters' uncle settled into an armchair with a
bottle of tequila to narrate the tale of their grandfather's role
as messenger for Zapata, Antonia rolled her eyes. ``I hate it when
he gets so Mexican,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Antonia's husband, at her request, wore the Baby Bjorn
to the cock fights, their uncle rolled his eyes. ``All this
kowtowing to the wives, it's so un-Mexican,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While they all idealize Chinantla, most of the young people know
in their guts that it would be difficult to live permanently in
such a small, conservative society, where eyebrows are raised when
a female office worker at Town Hall lights up a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   For the baptism party, Monica felt compelled by her parents to
stuff herself into a short, tight black dress, pantyhose and high
heels. But she was terribly uncomfortable and looked it. She stood
apart from the party, venturing forth to hug her father once in a
while. She felt a little out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite spot in the world,'' she said. ``I count
the days until my next trip down here. But I'm afraid I've outgrown
it a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnestly, her sister Melissa says that if she had to make a
choice, she would rather live a tranquil life in Chinantla. In the
next breath, though, she acknowledges that her loyalty will never
have to be put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky,'' she said. ``We really don't have to choose
between here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   In their father's will, the family house in Chinantla is left to
all the sisters, and they are forbidden to sell. So they will have
a key to Chinantla forever, and the freighted privilege of two
homes, two worlds. &QL;

DAUGHTER'S ROLE IN MURDER-FOR-HIRE CRIME IN TEXAS COMES INTO
QUESTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Mother's sentencing is July 27) 
 
By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ The attention was focused on three central
characters: A promising young student, gunned down for breaking up
with his girlfriend; the jilted girl's mother, twice convicted of
paying for the crime; an aged folk healer who acted as intermediary
to murder.
</P>
<P>
   But in a recent trial, federal prosecutors raised a question
that has haunted the dead man's family, friends and other
acquaintances in this border community for more than five years:
What role might Cristina, the lovelorn daughter, have played?
</P>
<P>
   ``The daughter must have known something about this,'' said
Johan Flick of Houston, one of the jurors who convicted Dora
Cisneros after 5 1/2 days of testimony in May. ``It's just hard for
me to believe the daughter didn't know this was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cristina Cisneros, who was 16 at the time of Joey Fischer's
murder, has never been charged with any crime, though prosecutors
have suggested she tried to provide her mom a false alibi for the
day of the killing. They won't comment on whether they hope to
charge her in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, friends, former teachers and another
ex-boyfriend say Cristina, now 22, is doing as well as perhaps can
be expected. As her mother awaits sentencing next week for
arranging the murder, Cristina reportedly is keeping a low profile
at the University of Texas branch in San Antonio, doggedly pursuing
a degree in architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to get away from the notoriety of it,'' said a
Brownsville merchant whose children were classmates of Cristina
Cisneros. ``Poor kid, she is trying to make a life for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's trying to fade into the background quietly, trying to
find a dark corner.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`WHEN WAS SHE INVOLVED?' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joey Fischer's murder was a hard crime to hide from. Those
involved were prominent, which made for juicy local gossip. The
national media were enthralled by the facts: Joey's father was a
local business executive; Cristina's dad was a surgeon. Cristina's
mother, upset over a soured high school romance, paid a
``curandera,'' or folk healer, to find the hitmen.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the end of Dora Cisneros' federal trial in May _ her
1994 state murder conviction was overturned on appeal _ federal
prosecutors told a Houston jury that the woman had involved her
daughter in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In final arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mervyn Mosbacker
said the younger woman attempted to provide an alibi for her mother
on the morning of Fischer's death. He said that as nefarious as the
murder-for-hire crime was, it was worse that Dora Cisneros involved
Cristina by bringing her along when she dropped off the $3,000 to
pay the hitmen who killed Joey Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina has refused repeated requests for interviews. But her
mother's attorney countered in a recent interview that he can
explain away the supposed discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Brownsville still view Cristina as an innocent
victim of her mother's scheme. But others are not convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``My question is, `When was she involved?''' asked Buddy
Fischer, father of the 18-year-old victim. ``Did her mother tell
her on the day Joey was killed and when they went to pay the
`curandera'? Or was Cristina involved in the plotting?''
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said the chronology Cristina has given of the morning
his son was murdered does not square with actual events.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just too many things that don't add up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Called as a hostile witness by the government during the
murder-for-hire trial in May, Cristina testified her mother took
her to a doctor's appointment on the morning of March 3, 1993, the
day Fischer was gunned down in the driveway of his home in Rancho
Viejo, a country club community north of Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina told the federal jury that she and her mother left the
doctor's office three hours later _ around 11:30 a.m. _ picked up a
prescription, went to lunch, after which her mother dropped her off
at home so she could drive her car to school.
</P>
<P>
   But her testimony was at odds with her mother's ``curandera''
and the San Antonio house painter she had used to line up the
hitmen. The painter told the jury he picked up the money from the
folk healer and paid the killers before lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, an employee at the doctor's office testified that
the pair left the office no later than 10:15 a.m. Records at a
Brownsville bank show that bank personnel escorted Dora Cisneros to
her safe deposit box at 10:28 a.m. At the trial, defense attorneys
noted the date on the safe deposit form had been marked over, and
contended it actually was from a visit the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted after the trial, two members of the Houston jury panel
said they didn't accept Cristina's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious to me and many others she had a selective
memory,'' said juror Flick, a design engineer in the University of
Houston physics department. ``She would not remember certain
things, what was in favor of the prosecution. I think her standard
(reply) was, `I don't remember, I don't recall.' And the few
questions that were in favor of her mother, she would remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Flick said Cristina acted immaturely. Her poor performance on
the witness stand, he said, put him on notice that, ``Hey, there is
something wrong here.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another juror, who asked not to be identified, said Cristina's
testimony ``did not help the (defense) situation one iota'' and
bordered on perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was flippant, that this is just a fun time, and she was
even laughing at things like it wasn't serious,'' the juror said.
``But underneath, you could tell she was told what to say and what
exactly not to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But the juror expressed regret that a young woman would be drawn
into such a sordid crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The daughter was part of it, and that's the sad part _ her
life is ruined,'' the juror said. ``Because if anybody knows who
she is and what her mother did, would anybody want to have anything
to do with her?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the trial, defense attorney David Botsford told the jury that
Cristina Cisneros had been nervous while on the stand, a natural
reaction to the stress of having her mother on trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Botsford, who also is handling Dora
Cisneros' appeal, denied that Cristina lied for her mother.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The alibi is not an alibi, it's the truth,'' he said. ``Mrs.
Cisneros had not gone in (the safe deposit area) on the day in
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical records, he said, along with the testimony of the
doctor's employee and the owner of a nearby restaurant, prove Dora
Cisneros and her daughter were occupied most of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina, he said, ``signed in before 9, had X-rays (for a foot
injury) and was there until the latter part of the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Botsford said the two key witnesses against Dora Cisneros _ folk
healer Maria Mercedes Martinez and house painter Daniel Garza _
gave different accounts of the time the payoff was made when they
testified in 1994 in state court in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the state trial, Maria Martinez testified the money was
delivered to her before 9 o'clock, and Garza picked it up at
9:30,'' the lawyer said. ``Now, at federal trial, the time is
pushed (back), and Garza said he did not pick up the money until
very late in the morning, until noon. So he changed the time frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not like very credible people,'' Botsford said of the
witnesses, both of whom are serving time for their roles in the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Dora Cisneros faces up to life in prison when she is sentenced
in Houston on July 27 by U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`A GOOD FRIEND OF OURS WAS KILLED' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A month after Joey Fischer's murder in March 1993, Cameron
County law officers arrested Dora Cisneros in downtown Brownsville
after she delivered a second payment to the ``curandera,'' who was
to pass it on to the hitmen. But the woman was by then cooperating
with police; a tape recorder caught Dora Cisneros asking if there
was any evidence against her.
</P>
<P>
   Her arrest on murder-for-hire charges hit Brownsville like a
bolt of lightning. After all, Dora Cisneros was the daughter of a
well-regarded family of landowners and had been educated at a
private college. She was married to Dr. David Cisneros, a
Brownsville surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had reared six children, three boys and three girls,
and provided them with good educations. One became a dentist,
another was attending medical school.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Cisneroses' eldest son was killed in a car accident
while still in high school in the 1970s, an untimely death that is
said to have been devastating to Dora Cisneros. Many say her son's
death may have been a factor in her overprotection of Cristina, her
youngest daughter, and her obsession with Cristina's love life.
</P>
<P>
   Dora Cisneros' arrest also meant the abrupt end of Cristina's
courtship with York Saldivar, one of Joey Fischer's best friends at
St. Joseph Academy, the upper-class Catholic high school they all
attended. He had begun dating Cristina a few months after she broke
up with Fischer and before his murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit calling her,'' recalled Saldivar, who said loyalty to
Fischer caused him to sever the relationship after the arrest.
``And she never called me. It was like I didn't know her. We just
ceased to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Saldivar, 23, and now a senior at Concordia University in
Austin, described his ex-girlfriend as ``a kind, outgoing person
who gets along well with everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was supportive, the perfect girlfriend,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He said that although they never discussed her breakup with
Fischer, Cristina seemed genuinely and deeply upset by his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was crying and upset and stuff. The only thing that came
up was how could it have happened,'' Saldivar said. ``I tried my
best to comfort her. Obviously, you could tell she still loved him.
... Her emotions were still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, perhaps, many of her classmates from St.
Joseph now shun her.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people wanted to avoid her completely. It was painful
to see her,'' said Veronica Garza, a close friend of Fischer's who
attended kindergarten, grammar and high school with him. ``You'd
look at her and say, `Your mother supposedly killed Joey.'''
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get much better when she tried to get away. Three
weeks after her mother's arrest, on April 23, 1993, Cristina
Cisneros left St. Joseph Academy and transferred to a public
school, Homer Hannah High, where her older sister was assistant
principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids at St. Joe just cut her off, or she wouldn't have
left,'' said Garza. ``She wouldn't have felt pressured to leave St.
Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   At the new school, Cristina seemed to make few friends and kept
mostly to herself, classmates and school officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, she was a St. Joe kid'' and considered an outsider,
a counselor recalled. ``She was here a very short time. She was
just biding her time and just wanted to fade in with the crowd. She
seemed fine, and she acted like nothing had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there were reports Cristina had entered the high school
under an assumed name, Brownsville school officials say she
registered under her own name and graduated June 6, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The high school's 1994 yearbook includes a picture of Cristina
among the graduating seniors. It is the face of an attractive,
dark-haired young woman with a cheerful smile wearing a bright
floral print dress. Her extracurricular activities were listed as
tennis and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't have any friends,'' said Jennifer Carinhas, who was
vice president of the Hannah senior class. ``She was pretty much an
outsider. She didn't speak to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   After high school, Cristina took six semesters of undergraduate
classes at Texas Southmost College and the University of Texas at
Brownsville, earning 41 hours and declaring a major in
architecture, university officials confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   She did well in trigonometry, a course key to architecture
studies, recalled Steven Benton, a math professor at
UT-Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do remember her and she was a good student,'' he said. ``She
was really hard-working and did well in my class.''
</P>
<P>
   Benton described Cristina as a ``pleasant and attentive''
student who never required additional help with the course work.
The professor was unaware she was related to Brownsville's most
infamous mother.
</P>
<P>
   Cristina transferred to UT-San Antonio in the fall of 1995, and
she is a senior in the college of science and engineering,
university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she rarely is seen in Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   Saldivar, the former boyfriend, said just the mention of her
name haunts some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of her, and what her mom did on her behalf, a good
friend of ours was killed,'' he said. ``So the grudge and the anger
is still there, and won't ever go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see her, I'm going to think of Joey.''

<P>
   CHINANTLA, Mexico _ In the dark before dawn, when the priest
bumped his pickup truck through the samll town of Chinantla,
Mexico, to wake everyone up, Monica Cruz groaned and put her pillow
over her head. In New York City, as the assistant manager of a
store, she enjoys daylong access to cappuccino. Here in her dusty
little hometown, there is not a cup of coffee to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on that not quite morning, Monica, who is 30, gave in to
the priest's exhortation by loudspeaker, eased on her black sateen
jacket and headed toward the town cemetery with her oversized
candle. Other New Yorkers were slipping into the predawn stillness,
too _ a busboy from the Friars Club, a nurse from St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, a maid from the Warwick Hotel.
Under a crescent moon over adobe, they felt blissfully far from
their daily grind, their bilingual negotiations with the place
Chinantla calls simply ``over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifted outside themselves, they cleared their minds of
everything but their town's patron saint, Padre Jesus of Chinantla,
purveyor of miracles that transcend borders. This was his day; he
had brought them back from New York by the hundreds, as he does
every winter, for a week of fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   Up the steep hill to the blue church, they sang a birthday song:
``Padre Jesus of Chinantla, please send your blessings to the so
many of us in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think we all have too much love for this tiny
town,'' Monica, a native New Yorker, said later, as she lounged
with her three younger sisters _ Elizabeth, Melissa and Antonia _
at their parents' grand brick and marble house, paid for by tens of
thousands of floors mopped, orders cooked and garments sewn in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every migration story is the psychodrama of a family, its
aspirations and frustrations. For the Cruz family of Chinantla,
Mexico, it is also the story of a town, a global village in the
most literal sense.
</P>
<P>
   Like many modern immigrant families, those from Chinantla
straddle a border, abetted by newly inexpensive air fares,
international phone cards, and, now, by a new Mexican law that
allows them to retain their Mexican nationality as American
citizens and even confers it on their American-born children. They
live divided, 2,500 in Chinantla, 2,500 in New York, but consider
themselves one group.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the first-generation Chinantecan immigrants are
waiters and garment workers and bus mechanics. Back home, they are
big shots. They are the ones who, working out of a basement in
Brooklyn, collected the money that built the town's schools and
rebuilt its church, who financed and designed its potable water
system and illuminated its streets.
</P>
<P>
   The sons and daughters of peasants who sign their names with
inky thumbs, they are also the ones whose American children are
almost all headed to college, in college, or graduates. Every
January and every summer, their children and grandchildren fill the
town square with English, baggy shorts sweeping their knees. Cries
of ``Wassup?'' float through the hot, dry air.
</P>
<P>
   Many older Chinantecans keep their children's connections alive
by moving back permanently to the one place where they can be
somebody. After 30 years of dislocation, Ramon and Zoela Cruz,
Monica's parents, returned triumphant, to an eat-in kitchen, a
backyard henhouse and the sweet, bone-deep satisfaction of
familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   On their return, Mrs. Cruz, who spent decades folding fabric in
a Brooklyn sweatshop, hired a maid. She opened a small store, from
which she dispenses rice and advice.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who dropped out of eighth grade to work the fields, bought
his own land, on which he dabbles like a gentleman farmer. In crisp
tailored shirts and Bermuda shorts, he is Don Ramon to all, no
longer a cook but a candidate for mayor of Chinantla.
</P>
<P>
   When their granddaughter, Samantha Bizarro, a third-generation
Mexican-American, turned 3, she was sent ``home'' to Mexico.
Grandma was supposed to fatten her up with chicken mole and bean
dishes enriched with lard. But it didn't work. She returned as
skinny as ever, still devoted to rice cakes and Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she had had a taste of something far richer: Chinantla.
Another generation was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Working Hard, Saving for Chinantla
</P>
<P>
   Each time they return from Chinantla, the townsfolk scatter to
their homes in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Long Island and New Jersey,
where they complain about feeling ``locked in'' and grow wistful
about the town square, which sits in a bowl of hills dotted with
saguaro cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, though, they are gathering again in the alternative
town centers they have created in New York: their social club in
the back of the Garcia Superette on Church Avenue in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters live in yet another center, a little Chinantla
in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn. Almost all the
tenants in their graffiti-scarred building are Chinantecan; they
shop for tortillas around the corner at La Chinanteca, the only
store in the neighborhood that sells photographs of Padre Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinantla, which the sisters visit at least once a year, they
have their own rooms, with queen-size beds and frilly comforters.
In Brooklyn, where their parents visit them every six months, three
of the four split a $700-a-month one-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Melissa, grown women, share a flimsy mattress on a
metal frame in a makeshift room separated from the kitchen by a
curtain. Books and papers are piled high; both women are studying
for master's degrees, Monica in political science, Melissa in
advanced nursing.
</P>
<P>
   The real bedroom, where their parents used to sleep, now belongs
to Antonia, 24; her husband, Claudio Bizarro, a busboy; 6-month-old
Brandon, and Samantha, a kindergartner with pigtails.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen blocks away, the fourth sister, Elizabeth, 29, a
bilingual education teacher, her husband, Cuauhtemoc Tlatelpa, a
cook who aspires to be an architect, and their 2-year-old son live
in the renovated basement of an Orthodox family's house.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual and college-educated, the Cruz sisters have better
jobs than their parents ever did, with paid vacationd, sick leave
and health benefits. But, American citizens all, they still live
like new immigrants, crowded together, squirreling away money for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder they remain attached to Chinantla, a place of
winter fiestas and summer vacations, of comfort and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, Daddy was a cook,'' Monica said. ``In Chinantla,
he's `the man.' And we're his daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   A Family Journey, Founded on tourist Visas
</P>
<P>
   Like most Chinantecans, the Cruzes did not cross the border like
so-called wetbacks, but flew in on tourist visas in the 1960s.
Still, their intention was to work, and they quickly found menial
jobs. Before long, they had two American-born daughters, Cecilia
and then Monica. Based on Cecilia's birth, they applied for legal
residency, which used to be granted routinely in similar
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   It was supremely important to the Cruzes that the girls be
baptized in Chinantla, so, while their residency application was
pending, they flew home. Then tragedy struck. While playing on the
cement floor of her grandparents' adobe house, Little Cecilia
ingested a poisonous fumigant and fell fatally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Her death was an unshakeable trauma, particularly for Mrs. Cruz.
Moreover, after Cecilia died, the American Embassy in Mexico City
denied the Cruzes' application for residency, suspecting fraud
because they could produce neither the child nor a death
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   This embittered Cruz, who felt he was being punished for the
death of his child. Three months later, he and his wife struck out
for the United States again, with forged documents. ``We defied
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of 15 years of back and forth. Three more
girls were born: Elizabeth in Chinantla, Melissa and Antonia in New
York. They were all brought home and left with their grandparents;
their parents worked round the clock in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters remember their childhood in Chinantla with
great affection. They played jacks with rocks, and sold lemonade in
the town square. They wore threadbare uniforms to the one-room
schoolhouse, and then threw themselves under the dining table to do
their homework.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip home, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz bought a small house of
their own. The next trip was involuntary. Cruz, to his everlasting
humiliation, was picked up by immigration agents, jailed for 15
days and deported. The Cruzes decided enough was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as fate would have it, they got the call that, after so
many years, they were to get their green cards. Mrs. Cruz did not
want to return. But Cruz felt they could not turn down the
opportunity ``to elevate our life style even further.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1979, and Monica was 13. Her parents sat her down and
delivered earth-shattering news: she was American, born in New York
City. She refused to believe it. She ran away into the hills and
hid under an amate tree.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest sister, Antonia, who was only 6, bubbled over with
excitement. She announced that the next time she returned to
Chinantla she would be blonde. (And indeed she was.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it was a green van that came to take us away,''
Melissa said. ``I remember driving off and a long line of dogs
following us, barking. We were all crying. My father said something
like, `Look forward, not back.' And then it was like fingers
snapped and we were landing at Kennedy. The chapter in Chinantla
was closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so they thought.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One Community, But Divisions, Too
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, it was clear that the only way for a Chinantecan
to survive financially was to leave Chinantla. This reality
produced a collective pang of conscience, and a kind of unspoken
social contract emerged. From the beginning, Chinantecans tithed a
portion of their earnings to their town. They formed a committee
and developed a census of Chinantecan immigrants. When they were
raising money for a specific project, they divided up addresses and
crisscrossed the metropolitan area on what they called ``la
colecta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority has been to give this little town its most basic
needs,'' said Abel Alonso, the committee's president. ``We have
changed the physiognomy of the town.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's motto is immortalized on an ink stamp: ``To
Chinantla and its future: The absent ones are always present.''
</P>
<P>
   To the official government of Chinantla, the motto has the faint
ring of a threat. But that has to be ignored, said Dr. Francisco
Calixto, the mayor, because, ``We have no other source of income
besides New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers send about $2 million a year home to Chinantla,
according to Smith. Scores of American pension checks and Social
Security checks also arrive every month to help support retirees.
</P>
<P>
   But there are tensions between the two communities about what
should be done in Chinantla. The New Yorkers want to preserve the
town's charm, and the locals want to modernize. And there are also
tensions about who should have power, who should get credit, and
who really needs help, the town or the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Small-Town Girls Trapped in the City
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters returned to New York for the second half of
their childhood in the late 1970s. At first they savored the
luxuries of the developed world. They reveled in indoor showers
after a lifetime of crouching beneath upturned pots of bracing well
water.
</P>
<P>
   But they also mourned the loss of their small-town freedom. They
bounced off the walls of their family's first residence, outdoorsy
girls trapped in an efficiency apartment.
</P>
<P>
   While their parents worked, the sisters competed to get 97s and
98s on tests. When home, their father hovered and lectured,
drilling them in geography and world politics. He did not tolerate
television watching. He did not let the girls date. They were very
good girls, and remain loyal to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents gave us everything, and they gave up everything
for us,'' Melissa said. ``All they wanted us to do was go to school
and make a better person of ourselves, and not end up doing the
jobs they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first eight years, they could not afford a single trip
to Mexico. Then, when their father landed the One Penn Plaza job,
which paid union wages, they began the custom of regular visits
home. On one of those trips, Elizabeth met her future husband,
Cuauhtemoc, a Chinantecan.
</P>
<P>
   But Antonia, the youngest, married first. She met her husband,
Claudio, then a new immigrant from the state of Morelos, at a
volleyball game organized by a Chinantecan youth group.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth, the most studious sister, waited until she completed
her master's degree in bilingual education to marry Cuauhtemoc.
After their wedding, Elizabeth, the only daughter born in Mexico,
forced herself to become a U.S. citizen. She mouthed the words
while thinking to herself, ``I'm doing this for my husband,'' who
obtained a green card through their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Melissa joke that all the Chinantecan boys are taken
and that they will have to range farther afield. But they are in no
hurry, for their ambitions, if at times scattered, are great.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat on a crate between bottles of hot sauce and bags of
rice in her store in Chinantla, Mrs. Cruz was asked if she was
proud of how far her family had come in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   She pursed her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two are still single, and they don't have all their diplomas
yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a demanding immigrant mother, the jury is still out.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Comfort In Padre Jesus
</P>
<P>
   Every Chinantecan home has a photograph of Padre Jesus, and some
have wooden replicas of the statue. When she was pregnant with her
first child, Elizabeth Cruz lowered herself to her knees in her
Brooklyn apartment and crossed herself before his photo. It had
been a difficult pregnancy and she was confined to bed. ``If we
survive,'' she promised, ``I will bring my baby to you in Chinantla
to be baptized.''
</P>
<P>
   By early this year _ ``miracle of miracles,'' she said _
Elizabeth was sending out engraved invitations, inviting all of
Chinantecan New York to the biggest baptism party of the season, on
her parents' terraced patio in Chinantla during the winter fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the party, skinned goats swung from the trees
in the backyard. The four Cruz sisters were stringing the patio
with baby blue streamers and setting out long banquet tables and
plastic chairs bearing the Corona beer logo.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen college-age women arrived to help with the
preparations. Leticia Lopez, a business major at Berkeley College
in Paramus, N.J., turned her face to the sun, and sighed, rubbing
her Fila sneaker in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the sky back there was like this, nice and blue,'' she
said. ``It's so nice and quiet here, too. Down here, life has time
to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, the boy of honor, 2-year-old Christian de
Jesus, was plunked into the official town barber's chair for a $1
baptism-special buzz cut.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., the town band showed up to parade Christian and his
parents through Chinantla. Christian was dressed in a white
captain's suit with gold braiding. A toy saber hung from his side.
Holding his parents' hands, he climbed the steep, rocky path to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted by the anticipation, Christian fell sound asleep just
as the ceremony began. As his godfather, his Uncle Claudio, held
him in his arms, the priest, in green robes, poured cups of water
over his closed eyes. His parents' faces crumpled; tears spilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my promise has been fulfilled,'' Elizabeth said.
</P>
<P>
   A Healthy Attachment, Despite Cultural Tensions
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Chinantecans are not conflicted about their
identities. They know instinctively that their attachment to
Chinantla is healthy, that it gives them a rich identity, and a
keen, even enviable sense of community in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But they do maintain a kind of jokey banter that reflects some
tension. When the sisters' uncle settled into an armchair with a
bottle of tequila to narrate the tale of their grandfather's role
as messenger for Zapata, Antonia rolled her eyes. ``I hate it when
he gets so Mexican,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Antonia's husband, at her request, wore the Baby Bjorn
to the cock fights, their uncle rolled his eyes. ``All this
kowtowing to the wives, it's so un-Mexican,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While they all idealize Chinantla, most of the young people know
in their guts that it would be difficult to live permanently in
such a small, conservative society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite spot in the world,'' Monica said. ``I
count the days until my next trip down here. But I'm afraid I've
outgrown it a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnestly, her sister Melissa says that if she had to make a
choice, she would rather live a tranquil life in Chinantla. In the
next breath, though, she acknowledges that her loyalty will never
have to be put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky,'' she said. ``We really don't have to choose
between here and there.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m. Monday, the temperature at Blythe, Calif., stood at 88
degrees as large amounts of water vapor in the desert air kept
nighttime readings very high. On Tuesday, tropical moisture will
continue to flow northward from the Gulf of California and the
eastern Pacific, sustaining very high humidity across the deserts
of southern California and western Arizona. As a result, widely
separated showers and thunderstorms will sprout on Tuesday
afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, scattered storms will erupt from the Sierra
Nevada to the Rockies as the uneven heating of mountains and
valleys promotes vigorous currents of rising, moist air. Little
rain will fall from some of the storms over western Colorado,
western Wyoming and Utah, raising the risk of wildfires sparked by
lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat from the upper Middle West will finally spread
to the southern New England and northern middle Atlantic seaboards
on winds from the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Over the eastern Great Lakes, scattered thunderstorms will erupt
from parts of Ohio to northwest New York as a jet-stream
disturbance lifts hot, humid air. A few of the storms will approach
severe levels, with damaging winds and hail posing a threat. Severe
storms are also possible over Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Showers and thunderstorms will increase over parts of the upper
Texas and Louisiana coasts as a tropical low aloft moves northwest
from the Gulf of Mexico. Clusters of thunderstorms will flare over
southern Florida as another westward-moving tropical low passes
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warmest Week
</P>
<P>
   This week is on average the warmest time of the year for much of
the nation. Even though the longest day and highest sun angle
occurred a month ago, there is a distinct lag between the maximum
input from the sun and the time when the average temperature is
highest. Most of this lag is a result of the tempering effects of
the nearby oceans, which will not reach their peak annual
temperature for another month. Right on cue, the atmosphere will
provide the hottest weather of the year over a very large part of
the country during the next few days as the jet stream retreats to
the Canadian border.

 &HT;    CLINTON URGES CURFEWS THAT DOUBTERS SAY IS UNPROVEN
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday continued his
long-running public campaign for local curfews for teenagers, even
as some experts are citing new evidence that the measures have
little, if any, impact on youth crime.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to teachers gathered in New Orleans, Clinton urged
cities to ``follow the example'' of that city by establishing
curfews to keep youths under 18 off the streets late at night. The
president said New Orleans had achieved ``impressive results,'' in
part because violators are taken ``to somebody who can help them if
they've got a problem, and support them, and get them on the right
path.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a recent study casts doubts on the effectiveness of
curfew laws, despite their growing popularity around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at all of the data in a comprehensive fashion,
the evidence is that curfews do not have any effect on either
juvenile crime nor victimization,'' said Mike Males, co-author of
the study, which compared a broad array of crime statistics in the
12 most populous counties of California, where curfews have been in
widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the study found that in some cities with tough curfews,
the crime problem actually grew worse. The study, released last
month by the Justice Policy Institute, a private California
research group, found that juvenile crime dropped in San Francisco,
although that city had stopped enforcing its curfew law. In nearby
San Jose, a city of about the same size, the curfew was vigorously
enforced, and yet crime problems increased during 1980-1996.
</P>
<P>
   After his study, considered by some to be the most thorough
examination on the subject, Males said he concluded that it would
be easy to make a case on either side of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``a lot of assertions,'' he said. ``Anyone can pick
any particular crime or city to show that curfews work, or don't
work for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Clinton did by raising the issue in New Orleans,
Males said. ``He's saying they instituted a curfew, and crime went
down. He could just as easily go to New York. ... New York has had
one of the biggest crime decreases in the country, and they don't
have a curfew.''
</P>
<P>
   Males, who conducted the study as his doctoral dissertation at
the University of California at Irvine, said he did the research
after discovering that no government agency had attempted such a
broad examination, despite a push that has imposed nighttime
curfews in hundreds of cities, about 70 of which also have
ordinances forbidding children under age 16 from being on the
streets during school hours.
</P>
<P>
   Many police and other urban officials have disputed the findings
in the study and countered that it has been a useful tool in
reducing crime.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey taken by the U.S. Conference of Mayors late last
year, 267 cities answering a survey said that they banned
teen-agers from their streets, typically after 10 p.m. or 11 p.m.
on week nights and after midnight on weekends. Many in the survey
praised the idea of curfews.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, Texas, for example, called it a ``good use of police
officers' time'' that created ``more emphasis on parental
responsibility'' and said that ``teenagers are staying at home and
not wandering the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the survey also reported that curfews cost more money
for overtime, paperwork, and facilities for violators.
</P>
<P>
   Curfews are coming under constitutional challenge, as well, with
mixed responses in the nation's courts. Dallas passed an ordinance
nearly a decade ago that has survived scrutiny by the Fifth Circuit
of the federal court system, and many cities have modeled their
curfews after the Dallas example. But Washington, D.C., passed a
similar curfew, and the federal appeals court here struck it down
earlier this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Different courts have reached different conclusions,'' said
Jason Huber, a lawyer who has represented the American Civil
Liberties Union in an attempt to throw out a curfew in Charleston,
W.Va. The Supreme Court has yet to take a case to decide the issue,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, curfews allow police officers unfettered
discretion as to who they pull over and interrogate,'' he said.
``In a constitutional democracy, that's an offensive notion.''

`ROYAL SOUL EXPLOSION': PASSION AND PERSEVERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTBURY, N.Y. _ Voices were strong and hearts were wounded when
the Royal Soul Explosion appeared here at the Westbury Music Fair.
The all-star soul revue was a respectful showcase for seven singers
_ Jerry Butler, Gene Chandler, Chuck Jackson, Ben E. King, Lloyd
Price, Percy Sledge and Irma Thomas _ who made hits in the 1950s,
'60s and '70s. With the Uptown Horns band led by G.E. Smith on
guitar and Peter Wolf as a dancing M.C., the revue set out to be
something more than a typical oldies show.
</P>
<P>
   The format was intended to recall the package tours through
which most rhythm-and-blues stars paid their dues, and it brought
out the magnificent fusion of churchly fervor and show-business
shtick that they polished on the rhythm-and-blues circuit. The
songs, meanwhile, reaffirmed old-fashioned adult romance, realistic
but still heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the men sing, women ruled their world. Sledge and
Chandler reached the peaks of their sets on their knees, and the
other male singers sang about the loneliness and misery of
unrequited love. Ms. Thomas had some sass for lying men, with a
stretch of comedy in ``Wish Someone Would Care,'' and she deflated
male pride as she sang, ``You can have my husband but please don't
mess with my man.'' But in ``It's Raining,'' her coyly syncopated
phrasing and the shifting tone of her voice traced a precise arc
from affected nonchalance to desolation.
</P>
<P>
   The singers, all in their 50s and 60s, revealed voices that had
changed but not disappeared. Sledge sounded the gentlest, and the
most telling. As a songwriter, he specializes in utterly abject
love songs, testifying to men's helplessness in the face of desire.
His voice has hollowed out since the 1960s, leaving him with a high
tenor that is vivid and ardent but almost wraithlike in its pained
delicacy. For ``Let Me Wrap You in My Warm and Tender Love,'' he
brought his wife, Rosa, on stage for a duet that they sang in each
other's arms. And in ``When a Man Loves a Woman,'' which he sang
with a humility that was a polar opposite to Michael Bolton's
heavy-breathing bluster, Sledge knelt and crooned Rosa's name.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has unleashed his baritone since he made his big hits in
the early 1960s like ``Any Day Now''; he started phrases with a
gospel attack and worked his way up to big sustained notes with an
operatic vibrato that suggested Mario Lanza. Chandler, suffering
from laryngitis, made up for a temporarily iffy middle register
with syncopated timing, flamboyant gestures _ he wielded a top hat,
a cane and a cape for ``Duke of Earl'' _ and a pure, startling
falsetto that was miraculously untouched by his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Ben E. King chose to toy with songs like ``There Goes My Baby''
and ``Stand by Me,'' letting his phrasing glance off the beat with
a jazz singer's playfulness and barely dipping from his light tenor
register to the baritone he has in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, always a gruff singer, now had extra huskiness in ``Only
the Strong Survive'' and ``Your Precious Love,'' but he used it to
push phrases like a preacher. And Price sounded as jaunty as he did
nearly 40 years ago, praising a girl's ``Personality'' or detailing
the gunplay in ``Stagger Lee.'' The band, which was stiff and tinny
for much of the show, found some gusto for the New Orleans rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   As each singer commanded the stage, it was obvious where current
rhythm-and-blues singers learned how to woo audiences. And when the
soul veterans sang about decades-old romances with undimmed ardor
and indelible voices, it was easy to push aside grim thoughts about
the way the music business discards aging performers and to savor
not just the passion, but the perseverance.

PIANIST FROM NORWAY FINDS COMMON CHORDS WITH AMERICAN TINPAN MUSIC
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 EDWARD M. EVELD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nothing really explains it all that well, why a kid from Norway
got hooked on American ragtime music.
</P>
<P>
   Oslo's Morten Gunnar Larsen is now one of the top-regarded
ragtime pianists in the world, and he shrugs at the question, one
he's no doubt tired of trying to answer.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster he tuned in to ragtime whenever he could find it
on the radio, although he could more easily have focused on rock
music or contemporary jazz.
</P>
<P>
   As a young piano student, Larsen liked to rip through his
Beethoven at breakneck speed, just for fun. His ragtime diversion
certainly provided that zip, along with the complexity akin to the
European classics he was studying.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe ragtime felt like a discovery.
</P>
<P>
   At a concert in June, Larsen's first appearance in the Kansas
City area, the curious connection didn't seem so curious. Certainly
not important. Larsen flipped his tuxedo tails over the piano
bench, hunched his lanky frame over the keyboard and started in on
James Scott's ``Hilarity Rag.'' (``It's supposed to sound like a
burst of laughter,'' Larsen advised.)
</P>
<P>
   In the hands of too many performers, and many more living-room
pianists, ragtime-based music becomes mechanical, clunky really, in
part because of the technical demands. As few others can manage,
Larsen conquers the pieces with the grace and lyricism that's often
vital _ or with downright raucousness if that's what's needed.
</P>
<P>
   At Larsen's June performance, he introduced his pieces with
soft-spoken mannerliness, looking tall, thin and reserved in his
black tux. The experience felt much like a classical piano concert
at first, until you heard the crescendo of Larsen's left heel
pounding out the beat on the stage floor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Larsen's classical training at the Norwegian Academy of
Music serves him well, according to David Thomas Roberts, a top
composer of ragtime-based music from Moss Point, Miss. Ragtime's
reputation continues to improve but it still fights a
misrepresentation as ``light'' music, said Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a classical technical foundation and, just as
important, a musicality shaped by the European tradition,'' said
Roberts, whose own music infuses ragtime with everything from salon
piano music to bluegrass to French musettes to Latin American
elements. ``It's not just an asset; it's indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   In his early teen years Larsen was in constant search for
ragtime and early jazz sheet music to play on the side. When he
could find only the recordings of certain pieces, he would listen
to them oh-so-slowly and transcribe them himself. He loved the
seriousness of the piano but also the playfulness, the piano as
toy. What did his parents think?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not a wunderkind,'' said Larsen, who is 42. ``My parents
would say, `This is not good music. You have to play the classics.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Not a wunderkind, perhaps, but at 19 Larsen recorded his first
solo album, which received the Spellemannsprisen award, a Norwegian
Grammy. In 1977 he founded his 10-member Ophelia Ragtime Orchestra
and made his first trip to the United States, heading immediately
to New Orleans and its after-hours jam sessions.
</P>
<P>
   It was there he met actor and playwright Vernel Bagneris, with
whom he would later team up in the off-Broadway show, ``Jelly Roll!
The Music and the Man.'' And it's where he first met Eubie Blake, a
ragtime star whose music he had recorded from afar. They got
together again in Norway when Blake was on tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched him play, his emphasis on parts of the music,'' said
Larsen. And Blake watched Larsen play. ``It was very inspiring. He
told me to watch my tempo. He told me about the accents in ragtime,
about the way to accent the syncopated phrases.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1980s Larsen toured internationally in solo
performances and with jazz bands and ragtime orchestras, and he
created and arranged musical programs spotlighting Blake, Scott
Joplin and Thomas ``Fats'' Waller.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen and Bagneris took an early version of ``Jelly Roll!'' to
Oslo in 1990 and later to Michael's Pub, the jazz club in New York.
The show had its off-Broadway run in 1994-95, and Larsen won an
Obie as piano soloist and musical arranger//director.
</P>
<P>
   Critics couldn't stop gushing about Larsen's rendition of
``Fingerbreaker,'' the Jelly Roll Morton piece so aptly titled. The
composition was practically a dare from Morton, who claimed to have
invented jazz, to those who might try to master it.
</P>
<P>
   At his local appearance in June, Larsen introduced
``Fingerbreaker'' and, with a wry smile, took a deep breath and
ceremoniously straightened his arms, then clasped his fingers and
pulled them way back.
</P>
<P>
   He was joking, but tackling this piece must make even him
nervous. One music writer called it the piano equivalent of a
five-alarm fire. Of course, it's not enough to be a contortionist,
although that's impressive; the music has to sound great, too, and
Larsen comes through. ``Fingerbreaker'' is the title of Larsen's
new CD, due out this fall from Decca.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen enjoys coming to this part of the country, with its solid
base of ragtime fans. James Scott, one of the biggies in
traditional ragtime, was from the area, and Sedalia, of course,
celebrates its Scott Joplin connection with an annual festival.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen is constantly on the road and generally travels by rail,
even in the United States. He considers it the perfect time to
restfully think about music. Larsen recently took the California
Zephyr over the Rockies and Sierra Nevadas, an astounding trip
visually, he said, adding kindly that ``the train in the U.S. could
be more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Larsen keeps his headquarters in Oslo because it feels
like home, a place he feels comfortable, where he can bicycle to
the clubs, even late at night. He does need to be careful with
those hands, though: On a recent rainy day, his bike slipped on the
streetcar tracks, sending him to the pavement. Somehow he protected
his hands; his face, luckily in a sense, took the brunt of it.
</P>
<P>
   The kid from Norway is now the international recording artist
from Norway, with early jazz and ragtime-based music his successful
niche. So, you ask once more, how he got so hooked?
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the sentiment, the naivete, the emotional intensity,''
said Larsen, who believes people need only listen to the music to
understand. ``You can have the same sort of fascination for it that
you can have for Mozart.''

THERAPEUTIC TOUCH GIVES A HEALING FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 KATHERINE L. DYKSTRA  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soothing music floated through the air, and sunlight poured
through the skylight into Barbara Lentz's Prairie Village, Kan.,
living room. Lentz sat, eyes closed, in the center of the room
while Barbara Joiner slowly ran her hands over the field of energy
surrounding Lentz's body.
</P>
<P>
   This is therapeutic touch, a healing technique that has gained
followers _ as well as critics _ since the practice began in the
mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Therapeutic touch is really a misnomer: The practitioner never
actually lays her hands on the patient's body; the hands remain one
to six inches above. Practitioners attempt to balance the patient's
``energy field'' by moving their hands over the body.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has drawn fire from some medical professionals. The
Journal of the American Medical Association printed an article
earlier this year debunking it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our knowledge ... no well-designed study demonstrates any
health benefit from therapeutic touch,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless many patients say therapeutic touch brings relief
for everything from headaches to cancer pain. Lentz, who was
diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in 1981, has been poked and
prodded, medicated and anesthetized for 18 years. She discovered
therapeutic touch two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very open to all medical directions introduced to
me,'' Lentz said. ``I figured, what have I got to lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Path of least resistance
</P>
<P>
   ``Therapeutic touch has a profound relaxation response that
assists people with physiological relaxation,'' said Joiner, of
Overland Park, Kan., who has been practicing 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Therapeutic touch is based on the premise that all matter is
composed of energy, including human thought, said Julia Hagemaster
of Shawnee, Kan., who also has practiced for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the practitioner uses herself as a conduit, allowing
energy to flow through her and into her patient. Practitioners
believe this balances the patient's energy field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like when the battery of a your car is low, you charge it with
a battery of a higher power,'' Joiner said. ``I just use that
universal energy that surrounds all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique was popularized 25 years ago by Dolores Krieger
and Dora Kunz. Krieger, then a professor in the School of Nursing
at New York University, and Kunz, a natural healer, worked to
refine and structure the method, and it gained a following
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 60 local therapeutic-touch practitioners,
Joiner said. Although they are not licensed, classes are offered at
a few area clinics and hospitals, including University of Kansas
Medical Center. Hagemaster is on the faculty at KU Med Center's
School of Nursing, and Joiner teaches workshops at Johnson County
Community College in Kansas and at the Massage Institute of Kansas
City, which offers different types of complementary therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Hagemaster and Joiner are members of Nurse Healers _
Professional Associates, a national organization for
therapeutic-touch practitioners, as well as the Therapeutic Touch
Network of Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Energy feel
</P>
<P>
   In a recent session Joiner placed Lentz in a chair in the middle
of the room. Lentz closed her eyes, bowed her head and rested her
weak legs on a small pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Joiner also closed her eyes, rested her hands on Lentz's
shoulders and cleared her mind of all distractions. Centering is of
the utmost importance, she said, as it keeps the patient from
draining the practitioner's energy. While she was centering
herself, Joiner rubbed Lentz's shoulder, relaxing her muscles and
mind.
</P>
<P>
   Next Joiner slowly moved her hands over Lentz's body, assessing
her energy field. Her hands remained from one to six inches above
Lentz's body.
</P>
<P>
   Hagemaster said the energy of a healthy person would feel strong
and complete; someone who is stressed might emit a field that feels
something like a blanket in disarray, knotted and twisted. Someone
who is sick and weak feels something like stretched-out cotton,
full of holes, delicate and extremely fragile, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joiner then proceeded to smooth out Lentz's energy field, called
unruffling. It is only after this that Joiner can issue the
transfer of energy, the rebalancing.
</P>
<P>
   Hagemaster likened the patient to a sponge, soaking up the
energy until she is full. She says she can feel the energy leaving
her fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Joiner then reassessed the energy field and grounded the energy,
pulling it through the body, by placing her hand on the arches of
Lentz's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Lentz described the sensation as one of heat flowing over her
body.
</P>
<P>
   The process was repeated until Joiner felt that she had balanced
the field. Sessions can take five to 25 minutes, depending on the
patient's physical condition and age. People who are very weak and
small children take only short sessions.
</P>
<P>
   According to Hagemaster, anyone can learn to practice
therapeutic touch. ``It's human nature (that) some people are just
better than others,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the steps are simple, success depends on the patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can set the stage for healing, but the patient must be
willing to help,'' Hagemaster said.
</P>
<P>
   Therapeutic touch is practiced on everyone from AIDS patients to
drug addicts or those suffering simple aches and pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to remember that therapeutic touch complements
whatever traditional modality you are using,'' Joiner said. ``It is
not an alternative to traditional medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not uncommon for practitioners to charge for
their services, neither Hagemaster nor Joiner do.
</P>
<P>
   Grounded
</P>
<P>
   In April therapeutic touch made headlines when results from a
schoolchild's science project discrediting the technique were
published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The test, conducted by 9-year-old Emily Rosa of Loveland, Colo.,
saidthat more than 50 percent of the time, 21 therapists used in
her study failed to detect the energy field around Emily's arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The article itself is significant because it shows in a very
simple test that the people who say they are `rearranging energy'
can't really detect that energy,'' said John Renner, an
Independence family physician and head of the national Consumer
Health Information Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates contend that the project was flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The science project did not meet any of the basic criteria for
research,'' Hagemaster said. ``But if there is something positive
to be drawn from it, it is that it did get people talking and
asking questions about what therapeutic touch is.''
</P>
<P>
   Renner theorized that just being visited may help a patient
heal. He warned people to be cautious and apply common sense about
claims made by therapeutic-touch practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to ask where the evidence is, and that is the bottom
line,'' Renner said.
</P>
<P>
   But such skepticism doesn't bother Lentz. Whether there is an
energy exchange between the practitioner and the patient, it seems
to work for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She puts me in a state of euphoria,'' Lentz said of Joiner.
``I'm not sure that it's not just hocus-pocus, but when she leaves
I feel better.''
</P>

   Youthful eating habits
</P>
<P>
   If you watch Saturday morning cartoons, you know pre-sweetened
cereals, a rainbow of sweet and salty snack foods and splashy soda
pop commercials are aimed at the grade-school set.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent survey by the New York research firm David
Michaelson &AMP; Associates for Channel One Network, a news and
information station for young people that airs in 12,000 schools
nationwide, found teen-agers wield considerable buying power at the
supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Teens influence _ either directly or indirectly _ more than
$51.6 billion in annual grocery purchases, according to the
recently released study. The breakdown: $58 per teen household per
week were influenced by teens. (And that's in addition to the
billions spent on food purchases made outside the home!)
</P>
<P>
   Snacks, desserts and beverages are the items teens have the most
say over. For example, 87 percent of all sports drink purchases in
teen households are influenced by the teen.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast bars and salty snacks are other items heavily
influenced by teen tastes. Over half of nacho//tortilla chip
purchases are made at the teen's special request or are a
``standing order'' with the household's principal shopper.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of teens also extends to products not usually
associated as ``teen'' products, such as frozen foods, produce and
prepared meats. One-third of all health and beauty aid purchases
are made by or for teens.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also reflects the eating habits of 23 million teens
ages 12 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   - Teens eat an average of 4.33 times a day. Close to half of the
survey respondents (42 percent) eat five or more times a day.
</P>
<P>
   - Perhaps not surprisingly, a third of those meals are eaten
away from home _ to the tune of $12.7 billion a year spent at
fast-food restaurants. Teens typically visit a fast-food restaurant
more than twice a week and spend $5.72 on each visit. Favorite fast
foods include hamburgers (46 percent), pizza (13 percent) and
Tex-Mex (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Teens are just as likely to eat breakfast as lunch and dinner.
But lunch is the meal most likely to be eaten away from home. 58
percent buy something at school, while 28 percent bring lunch from
home.
</P>
<P>
   - After-school snacking is the ``fourth meal'' for most teens.
They spend $1.25 a day on these snacks, for a total of $5.2 billion
a year.
</P>
<P>
   University snacks
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Institute of Food Technologists' 1998 Food Expo in
Atlanta, university students competed to develop the best new food
products.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State University took third place for its entry, dubbed
``Chicotillas.'' A crunchy, bite-sized spiced tortilla snack,
Chicotillas are filled with a low-fat, hot, spicy raisin filling.
The sweet-and-sour breakfast//snack item plays on America's growing
taste for tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included ``Wrapidos,'' a tortilla with a moisture
barrier to keep hot and cold fillings from leaking through the
bottom, and ``S'morsels,'' a bite-size version of the campfire
favorite.

`STEPHEN SONDHEIM': PEEKS AT THE COMPLEXITIES OF A VERY PRIVATE
GENIUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the heyday of the American musical theater, which began
with Irving Berlin, the Gershwins and Cole Porter and lasted for
half a century, Stephen Sondheim is the only composer and lyricist
with an original vision and a flourishing body of work. With
``Company,'' ``A Little Night Music,'' ``Sweeney Todd'' and other
shows, he has set the standard for all who have followed him. The
sound of Sondheim is pervasive _ from him and from those he has
influenced.
</P>
<P>
   In the company of other innovative artists, he is often
misunderstood. His brilliance can be mistaken for mere cleverness;
his musicality can be obscured by the unusual context of the
material: the soaring melody of ``Johanna'' intentionally
juxtaposed with barbaric events. He has said that ambivalence is
his favorite subject and that it ``allows for dramatic contrast,''
as in the motif of the song ``Sorry-Grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   With his innate wit and musical acumen, Sondheim writes songs
that are self-sustaining as well as dramatically meaningful within
a show. His scores, in common with the man himself, are exceedingly
complex.
</P>
<P>
   In her intriguing biography ``Stephen Sondheim: A Life,'' Meryle
Secrest _ with the help of Sondheim _ tries to pierce the enigmatic
exterior of this very private person. Perhaps, considering the
nature of the subject, this is all we will be privileged to see.
</P>
<P>
   The author provides new information about Sondheim's fragmented
childhood. We learn about his father, a businessman who loved to
play the piano and was known with his partner as ``the Rodgers and
Hart of Seventh Avenue,'' and, especially, about his domineering,
unstable mother, Janet Fox ``Foxy'' Sondheim, with whom he lived
after his father left her for another woman. He says that his
mother treated him ``like dirt'' at the same time that she
expressed incestuous inclinations toward him.
</P>
<P>
   As has been previously reported, she once wrote to him that
``the only regret I have in life is giving you birth.'' Here we
have his response, an agreement to continue supporting her coupled
with the statement ``I don't want to see you anymore.'' When she
died, at 95, he was in London and did not return for the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The reader also finds out that Sondheim ``was never easy with
being a homosexual'' and had close relationships with Lee Remick
and Mary Rodgers, both of whom apparently wanted to marry him. When
he speaks about his life, he is revealing, for example, in
comparing himself to ``the boy in the bubble,'' protected and
isolated by his background and his success. Still, when he says
that he has a great capacity for liquor and that it (and also
marijuana) stimulates his mental processes, one wants a more
thoughtful consideration of the reasons for and the effects of his
apparent dependency.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Sondheim, as a teen-ager he came under the
tutelage of Oscar Hammerstein II, who was both mentor and surrogate
father. It was Hammerstein who said about Sondheim's otherwise
well-received schoolboy musical, ``By George,'' ``It's the worst
thing I've ever read,'' adding, ``I didn't say it was untalented.''
Hammerstein's frank criticism was a turning point for the hopeful
young composer, as was his suggestion that for an apprenticeship
his pupil should write four very different musicals, adaptations as
well as an original.
</P>
<P>
   From people with whom he has worked (Harold Prince, James
Lapine, Mandy Patinkin) there are interesting observations about
his professional life. In that regard the book acknowledges a debt
to Craig Zadan's ``Sondheim &AMP; Co.,'' which focuses on the
individual musicals. But there are also missed opportunities in
discussing his various creative relationships. For example, the
section on ``West Side Story'' insufficiently explores the
eclecticism with which Leonard Bernstein and Sondheim wrote their
score (borrowing from ``Candide,'' as well as other Bernstein
sources).
</P>
<P>
   The book is also marked by a kind of passive acceptance of what
individual people say, like the author's casual crediting of the
screenplay of ``The Snake Pit'' to Arthur Laurents. Laurents worked
on the screenplay but not enough to have a share of the credit,
which went to Frank Partos and Millen Brand.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the comment is extraneous and distracting, as are
the frequent quotations from unrelated sources ranging from Kenneth
Clark (a subject of a previous Secrest biography) to Edgar Allan
Poe. We also want to know less about peripheral matters like the
culinary prowess of the composer's resident cook, who suddenly,
late in the book, is identified by Sondheim as ``the equivalent of
a wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this is weighed an evenhanded portrait of a sensitive
but essentially solitary man compulsively immersing himself in a
very collaborative art form in which the initial ideas for shows
generally come from other people.
</P>
<P>
   Often, as in his collaborations with Lapine, this works out to
Sondheim's advantage. But when he worked with Hammerstein's
partner, Richard Rodgers, on ``Do I Hear a Waltz?,'' it was a
disastrous collision of egos and temperaments, provoking Sondheim's
memorable comment that Hammerstein was a man of limited talent but
infinite soul and Rodgers was a man of infinite talent but limited
soul.
</P>
<P>
   Though few would question Sondheim's talent, there are those who
might question the depth of his emotions. This heart-mind issue is
persuasively answered by his lyrics, many of which are reprinted in
the book. They are as poetic as they are personalized.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally when he writes closest to his feelings he is at his
most moving: in ``Company,'' about a man of charm who holds himself
at a remove from commitment; in ``Sunday in the Park With George,''
in which an artist struggles to find an image with which to express
his art. ``Opening Doors,'' in ``Merrily We Roll Along,'' is, he
says, the only ``consciously autobiographical'' song he has
written. In her book, Ms. Secrest stresses the passion that
Sondheim brings to his highly disciplined profession, and when it
is pertinent she relates the life to the work.

<P>
   It makes perfect sense. In other words (pun intended), it
tracks: If real trains run outside, why shouldn't model trains?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, you're thinking, what about twigs, leaves, rain and
snow? What about bunnies and birds and squirrels wreaking havoc
like Godzilla over Lilliputian locomotives? Well, think of it this
way. Real railroaders overcame some teeny obstacles, too _ such as
the Rocky Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   For model railroaders, surmounting nature's hazards (``Danger:
Falling Walnut Zone'') is half the fun and part of what's now
making garden railroading one of the most creative and
fastest-growing segments of the model train world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of one woman in Cincinnati who paints all her engines
pink,'' said master model railroader Bob Miller, 62, of Kansas
City, Kan. ``Her trains wind around pink flamingos in her yard.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Miller and his wife, Joyce, began creating an outdoor
railway that now covers nearly 300 square feet of their back yard.
The Corona Western _ an antique steam engine line named for their
street in Western Wyandotte County _ rolls around old oaks and
dwarf Alberta spruce, past a water garden, over handmade trestles,
through creeping phlox, periwinkle and past teensy buildings
populated by puny people. There are ladies in bustles, a man with
six-guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people do it as a way of self-expression,'' Miller
said. ``For me, it combines two of my major interests: the garden
and trains.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for Miller, a retired computer programmer with the
Federal Reserve Bank, toy trains usually aren't something to toy
with. This week he and 2,500 other ardent model railroaders from
around the country are meeting at Bartle Hall for the national
convention of the National Model Railway Association. It's the
first time in a decade that the group's national convention has
been in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Northeast Kansas Garden Railway Society,
Miller is scheduled to present a clinic on garden railway design.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the convention, the association also is sponsoring the
National Train Show, an exposition of model railroading that runs
from Friday evening through Sunday and is open to the public (see
accompanying box).
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, association members (there are 21,000 nationwide)
can be a serious group, a mostly male congregation of Choo-Choo
Charlies whose zeal, they admit, can sometimes border on
fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the wives call it a blood illness,'' Joyce Miller
said. ``It becomes a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains why garden railroading is so popular, why
subscriptions to the 15-year-old Garden Railways magazine have more
than doubled to 35,000 in just two years.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas indoor railroading generally belongs to a bastion of
males, outdoor railroading _ with its emphasis on flowers as well
as freights _ appeals to both men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more social,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live out here,'' said his wife.
</P>
<P>
   And whereas indoor scale-model railroading is often the stuff of
exacting scholarship aimed at midget verisimilitude _ an attempt to
replicate a line's exact cars, engines, freight, stops, switches
and times of departures _ garden railroading is anything but. It is
a venture in whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in his basement Miller has put together an HO
scale model of the Santa Fe Railroad. It's his pride and joy, his
serious project. His father was an engineer on the line for 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the model is not just any segment of the Santa Fe. No, no,
no. That would hardly be specific enough.
</P>
<P>
   His model is of the segment of the Santa Fe main line that runs
from Guthrie, Okla., through Oklahoma City with a branch line for
heavy grain hauling from Guthrie through Enid to Kiowa, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Sound specific enough?
</P>
<P>
   Ha!
</P>
<P>
   In scale-model railroading that's just the beginning. Miller's
Santa Fe line not only attempts to replicate the line in 1989, but
in June of 1989, during the ``wheat rush.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how exact it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, outside, on the garden railway, the mythical Corona
Western _ which goes nowhere except from the elm tree to the oak
and back _ has a sign that would never be seen on a serious scale
model: ``Bunny Crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing of garden railroading is that it's a totally
different atmosphere,'' said Robert Snare, assistant manager of the
Great Train Store on the Country Club Plaza. ``It's more of a fun
project.''
</P>
<P>
   With advances in technology, and a little patience, making and
maintaining a garden railroad may not be exactly easy, but it
doesn't have to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any more challenging to put a model
railroad in the garden then to do the garden itself,'' Snare said.
``You have to do a little bit of yard work to get it in, put gravel
to hold it in place, do a little leveling to get the grades even,
but once you do that, it's pretty much in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, garden choo-choos have never come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   When garden railroading first began in England in the late 19th
century, it was strictly a leisure-class hobby. Ever-changing
weather meant the cars and engines needed ever constant and
expensive care. Because of that, the hobby languished for decades
until it was revived in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   That's when a German manufacturer, known as LGB _ still the
leader in the field _ began making large and robust engines, cars,
track and electrical components that could withstand extremes in
heat and cold. Today, about 100 companies make an array of
completely weatherproof products from water towers to whistle
stops.
</P>
<P>
   While some trains are powered by underground heavy gauge wire,
others, like Miller's, eliminate wires by operating on battery
remote control. The batteries are in the cars and engines.
</P>
<P>
   And each of those cars and engines are big, an appealing feature
for people who'd rather not toy around with teeny trains.
Typically, each car measures about a foot long and six inches high,
more than twice the size of indoor scale models.
</P>
<P>
   Today an LGB starter garden railway kit _ a locomotive, two
cars, power supply and about a 10-foot circle track, enough to loop
around an old tree _ costs about $250 to $350.
</P>
<P>
   After that, money and imagination are the only limits on design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets to be like any hobby,'' said Garden Railways associate
editor Terry Thompson. ``You can spend as much or as little as you
would like.'' Some garden railways, he said, are worth tens of
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And as for pitfalls?
</P>
<P>
   Well, indeed, clearing twigs and leaves and rocks from the
tracks is a daily chore. Sometimes, after a heavy rain, wiped out
segments of track need to be realigned and cleared of mud. The
Millers also recall the time a bunny ran across their trestles and
a locomotive chased a baby squirrel around the entire track.
</P>
<P>
   But wait ... that was part of the fun.

CLINTON SETS WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SCHOOL SAFETY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ President Clinton pushed his education agenda
before a friendly audience Monday at the American Federation of
Teachers national convention, and announced plans to hold a White
House conference on school safety this fall.
</P>
<P>
   After a school year stained nationwide by an outbreak of fatal
shootings by students, Clinton said he intends to ``bring together
educators and law enforcement officers and families whose lives
have been touched by these terrible tragedies to find new solutions
to this profound challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The president suggested that communities across the country, to
restore discipline, should crack down on truancy and impose nightly
curfews for youngsters. He also renewed his call, first made in a
State of the Union message two years ago, for student uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one student is no longer obsessed by another students's
sneakers or designer jackets, and where students are focused not on
appearances but on learning, crime and violence go down and
attendance and learning go up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance before 3,000 AFT delegates meeting here
offered him a refuge from events in Washington, where independent
counsel Kenneth W. Starr and Republican leaders are pressing the
president in the Monica S. Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   The predominantly Democratic teachers union has been allied with
Clinton since his first presidential campaign in 1992. When AFT
president Sandra Feldman introduced the president Monday, she said
the ``vicious and ugly and personal'' attacks on Clinton had been
orchestrated by opponents who are ``after the destruction of public
institutions in general and public education in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech was interrupted repeatedly by applause and
several standing ovations as he outlined details of an education
program that dovetails with many AFT positions.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the convention, Feldman acknowledged that there
are unqualified teachers in the ranks of the American educational
system and said the AFT should take the lead to strengthen
standards by discouraging the use of ``emergency'' credentials and
ending the practice of hiring untrained teachers.
</P>
<P>
   While he was governor of Arkansas, Clinton advocated testing for
teachers, provoking a bitter clash with the Arkansas affiliate of
the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton saluted Feldman's initiative and said ``the AFT was
never afraid to say that before a teacher is certified, it is
reasonable to have demonstrated a competence of the teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   While endorsing tougher tests for teachers, Clinton also called
for higher salaries for educators and appealed for bipartisan
support in Congress for his proposals to finance the renovation of
school buildings, to reduce the size of classes, and to turn
schools into ``community learning centers'' in the evenings and
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time,'' Clinton said, ``for Congress to turn away
from some of these recent committee votes where they say no to
smaller classes, no to modernized schools, no to Americorps,'' a
volunteer program begun by his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton earlier vetoed a bill to create school vouchers
in the District of Columbia, he has not ruled out the concept. That
amounts to a slight difference between the President and the AFT,
which adamantly opposes vouchers. ``If you want to fight about
whether you believe in vouchers or not, fine, let's have an
argument about it. I don't mind that,'' Clinton said. But he said a
dispute over vouchers should not override their joint educational
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wanted to put 100,000 new teachers in the
nation's schools, just as he has sought to put 100,000 additional
policemen on the nation's streets.
</P>
<P>
   A coordinated program between education and law enforcement
officials would reduce violence in the schools, Clinton said, and
he singled out Boston for its toughened stance toward truancy.
After determining the scope of its absentee problem, Clinton said,
Boston instituted ``a strict new promotion policy: If you don't
attend, you don't advance.''

NBC LOOKS FOR `CREATIVE CHALLENGES' TO CABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 AARON BARNHART  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It was appropriate that NBC Entertainment
chief Warren Littlefield should meet the press on a Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking here to TV critics as part of NBC's fall season
preview, Littlefield was at his executive best, rifling through a
series of charts and graphs that would make even Ross Perot's head
spin.
</P>
<P>
   But while Littlefield typically uses this annual occasion to
document his network's domination of the other broadcast networks,
this time much of his remarks were devoted to what has been until
recently the great silent killer of broadcast TV: cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to counter some of the positive press cable's been
getting of late, the NBC research staff produced charts and graphs
showing, for example, that many top cable channels are down or flat
in viewership, including TNT, HBO, ESPN and A&AMP;E. Another chart
showed NBC's top programs gaining in young adult viewers, and the
size of the gain exceeding the entire audience of 30 leading cable
networks.
</P>
<P>
   As Littlefield put it, ``Size does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to NBC's bottom line it still does. But as even
Littlefield would admit later, cable still enjoys one powerful
intangible over broadcasters: a creative edge.
</P>
<P>
   While broadcasters are adept at recycling hit concepts, cable is
still the place for fresh, bold and sometimes bizarre concepts that
siphon precious viewers away from the networks. ``South Park,''
``Pop-Up Video'' and ``Celebrity Deathmatch'' are recent examples.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the heart of NBC's comedy development remains a type
of urban sitcom that has become nearly synonymous with the network.
The new show ``Jesse'' stars Christina Applegate, who comes from a
proven TV property (``Married ... With Children''), as did Tony
Danza and Fred Savage, who headed new NBC sitcoms last season.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, ``Encore! Encore!'' with Nathan Lane is a classic NBC
star vehicle, although in this case the wheels already appear to be
coming off. Designed to showcase the talents of the Broadway and
film star, the show was so derisively received by advertisers in
May that NBC had to revamp the entire concept and did not offer
even short clips of the show to critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' a show about a gay man and his best friend _ a
straight female _ attempts to merge the sensibilities of ``Ellen''
with the usual sex-and-the-single-woman premise found in other NBC
comedies (``Caroline in the City,'' ``Suddenly Susan''). ``Conrad
Bloom,'' the hero of yet another office sitcom, is (surprise!) a
single guy.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, NBC is not the only network that finds itself in a
creative cul-de-sac. Aside from the quirky office ``dramedy'' of
``Ally McBeal'' and ABC's romantic hippie-meets-yuppie combo on
``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' broadcast comedy development last season was
generally formulaic.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of life in this fall's slate of new shows. But
only one ``unusual'' program idea is a comedy. ``That '70s Show''
uses a ``Happy Days'' premise _ teen-agers in Wisconsin 20 years
ago _ but makes the adults a whole lot weirder and the kids
considerably smarter and plays fast and loose with conventional
broadcast mores.
</P>
<P>
   One scene in the pilot episode will be quite possibly the
funniest marijuana sequence ever shown in prime time. That is,
provided it ever makes air; anti-drug activists are sure to make
noises about the scene before the show debuts in September.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the networks are mostly flexing their creative
muscles on the drama side:
</P>
<P>
   - ``Trinity'' (NBC), about the lives of five adults who are
siblings in an Irish-American family. The show, developed by John
Wells of ``ER'' fame (he also worked on critics' favorite ``China
Beach''), is noteworthy for creating characters with genuine dark
sides to them: One is a self-destructive alcoholic, another appears
to have mob ties.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Brimstone'' (Fox) and ``Cupid'' (ABC), very different shows
that share a similar premise: An ordinary-looking human is actually
a supernatural being sent down to Earth to do penance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brimstone'' is about a former New York cop who can work his
way from Hell to Heaven if he apprehends 113 escaped demons.
``Cupid'' is about a man claiming to be the god of love, but who is
on probation and must put 100 couples together without his bow and
arrow.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Martial Law'' (CBS) is, like the show that will follow it on
Saturday nights, ``Walker: Texas Ranger,'' an action hour. But
unlike the tight-lipped stylings of Chuck Norris, the burly Sammo
Hung, a Hong Kong martial arts superstar making his American TV
debut, fights for laughs. The action sequences in ``Martial Law''
are hysterical, and Hung's deadpan response to everything supplies
the punchline to the punches.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Littlefield, of course, is very high on each of his new
shows, not just ``Trinity.'' It's his job to be. But in the next
breath he will allude to the lack of alternatives on broadcast TV.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed Sunday that NBC will soon be changing ``Later,''
the 12:35 a.m. talk show that currently relies on guest hosts, into
a vehicle for experimenting with new comedy forms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more lab space,'' Littlefield said. ``I think we can
play with alternate forms in that time period. It can be our
Off-Broadway theater, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Another NBC executive later noted the similarities between the
12:35 a.m. time slot and cable: Shows can be given time to find
their creative groove without constant ratings pressure; the
network doesn't have to fund an expensive, pilot-plus-13-episode
order; and with ``Later'' available on most NBC affiliates, viewers
will be able to discover the show.
</P>
<P>
   If the approach works for NBC _ the only network to make a
profit last season _ the other broadcast networks will undoubtedly
try something similar in late night, when young viewership is high.

RARITY CAPS A CALLAS SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has always been a reliable market for Maria Callas
recordings. EMI Classics (formerly Angel Records), the company with
which she was most closely associated, has done well with its
extensive Callas discography.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the new Maria Callas Edition, which includes every
recording she made with EMI (and some live performance recordings
it acquired the rights to), has been completed and made available,
it's clear that the company has also done well by Callas.
</P>
<P>
   This special, remastered, insightfully annotated series of more
than 70 discs represents a significant financial commitment for
EMI. It also contributes invaluably to something that major record
companies typically think little about these days: musical
posterity.
</P>
<P>
   The first installment in the Callas Edition, 20 complete opera
recordings, was released last August in conjunction with the 20th
anniversary of the soprano's death in Paris at 53.
</P>
<P>
   In January the next installment came: 11 recital discs,
including a collection of rarities, plus the first in the edition's
midprice series of complete opera recordings, Donizetti's
``Poliuto,'' an important live performance from 1960 that
represented the prima donna's La Scala comeback and was the last
role she added to her repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Then, this spring, another nine midprice opera recordings were
issued in navy blue box sets (to distinguish them from the
full-price sets in black boxes).
</P>
<P>
   And now, just out, to complete the series, is one final release:
a live performance from June 1957 at La Scala with Callas in the
title role of Gluck's ``Ifigenia in Tauride'' (5 65451 2). Ending
the Callas Edition with this recording (previously available only
intermittently on pirated long-playing records) is a statement of
principle from EMI, for surely this ``Ifigenia'' will be of more
archival than commercial value.
</P>
<P>
   This was Callas' second Gluck role, the previous one being
Alceste. As was the custom in Italy, she sang the role in Italian
instead of its original French. Gluck's operatic retelling of this
Greek tragedy, presented in Paris in 1779, may be his most sublime
and dramatically intricate work, though even in Paris during
Callas' day the opera's excellence was not widely appreciated. That
La Scala was presenting it in 1957 seems in retrospect a
preliminary step in what would become the early-music revival.
</P>
<P>
   But the conductor, Nino Sanzogno, misses the subtleties of the
work, which is treated as something grandly tragic and generically
elegant. The jeweled finery that was Callas' costume (from a
picture on the cover) suggests how little the work was understood.
Ifigenia, the daughter of King Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, is
living in captivity in Scythia. She is allowed to serve as a
priestess in a temple to Diana. But the temple is in effect a
prison and her life is bleak and deadening.
</P>
<P>
   Callas brings vocal richness and mellow sound to her singing,
though the tone colors are a little unvaried. But surprisingly, her
interpretation somewhat lacks the nuance, flashes of insight and
slight touch of the neurotic that made many of her portrayals so
human.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a nobility of expression, continuity of line and
seriousness of intent in her work that is hard to resist. That she
would challenge herself with this unusual role when the world was
clamoring for her Lucia, Norma, Violetta and Tosca is indicative of
her artistic integrity. Callas would sing it only four times,
during this 1957 production at La Scala.
</P>
<P>
   Although EMI has tried to clear it up, the recorded sound is
poor, rather woofy and indistinct. Her colleagues in the cast,
including Dino Dondi as Oreste and Francesco Albanese as Pilade,
are subpar. The orchestra is often sloppy. This is probably a
recording primarily for the serious Callas collector. Yet EMI has
given it the same careful presentation as the classic Callas
recordings in the series.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The midprice spring releases of complete operas included some
major Callas performances, like the historic live performance
recording from La Scala in 1952 of Verdi's ``Macbeth'' (5 66447 2).
The sound here is almost as problematic as that of the
``Ifigenia.'' But this release is important not just to the Callas
legacy, but to that of Victor de Sabata, one of the most brilliant
midcentury Italian conductors, who is woefully underrepresented in
recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The role of Lady Macbeth begins with spoken dialogue, when she
reads the letter her husband has sent telling of the strange
prophecies of the witches. Callas' reading is curiously prosaic.
But once she starts to sing, her performance is electrifying: bold
yet finely detailed, intuitive yet carefully considered, vocally
impassioned yet technically superb.
</P>
<P>
   Her articulation of the fast coloratura runs and turns, her
flexibility, and her range (with thrilling top notes and, even more
impressive, a hauntingly soft high D flat at the end of a
mesmerizing Sleepwalking Scene) belie the idea that Callas' vocal
technique was flawed from the start.
</P>
<P>
   As Macbeth, the baritone Enzo Mascherini has a robust, warm
sound, though he occasionally sings with inexplicable carelessness.
Italo Tajo as Banquo is excellent. And de Sabata conducts a
vibrant, stylistically elegant performance. You will have to make
do with the sound quality, but the performance captures Callas and
La Scala in their prime.
</P>
<P>
   Though Callas had recorded the title roles in ``Tosca'' and
``Norma'' incomparably for Angel (in 1953 and 1954) she was
persuaded to rerecord the roles in stereo. She returned to the
studio in 1960 for ``Norma'' (5 66428 2) and her voice is rougher
than it had been. But there may be more subtlety, less strident
defiance in this later reading. And it boasts Christa Ludwig's
poignant Adalgisa, Franco Corelli's virile Pollione and the great
Tulio Serafin on the podium.
</P>
<P>
   The second ``Tosca'' recording (5 66444 2) dates from 1964,
when, after a dismaying two-year period of vocal troubles, Callas
was attempting a comeback. Again, her voice shows signs of wear.
But this is an involving and distinguished performance, graced by
Carlo Bergonzi's first-rate Cavaradossi and Tito Gobbi's complex
Scarpia, repeated from the 1953 recording.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that original ``Tosca,'' with de Sabata on the
podium, is one of the greatest opera recordings ever made. And the
conducting of Georges Pretre in the later version is laconic in
comparison. Still, it is gratifying to have both available in these
new editions.
</P>
<P>
   The first installment of the series includes the 1959 stereo
version of Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor.'' But this spring's
midprice releases offer Callas' two earlier recordings of the role,
both superior. The 1953 studio recording (5 66438 2) is one of her
great achievements, with Giuseppe di Stefano, in excellent voice,
as Edgardo, Tito Gobbi as Enrico, and Serafin conducting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even more exciting, and moving, is a live 1955 performance
at the Berlin State Opera conducted by Herbert Von Karajan, with di
Stefano and, this time, Rolando Panerai as Enrico (5 66441 2). The
tempestuous Callas and the magisterial Von Karajan might seem an
odd couple, but there was alchemy when they worked together, never
more so than here.
</P>
<P>
   Von Karajan's tempos are often quite spacious. But Callas
responds to his conception with some of her most arching, ineffably
beautiful phrasing. The coloratura roulades are incisively
dispatched and radiantly sung. Yet every note counts: Lines are
never mere passage work, but thematic and directed. The live sound
is imperfect, but adequately clear and true. Even among the wealth
of Callas' recordings, this Berlin ``Lucia'' stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to EMI Classics, that wealth is more accessible than
ever. It will be interesting to see if the company maintains its
support of the Callas Edition by keeping all the component
releases, even those of less commercial viability, in the catalog.
The effort, knowledge and care put into the project to date is a
promising sign.

 &HT;    Ondeck: Chicago Cubs at Atlanta Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (13-3, 1.57; 7-0,
1.51 vs. Cubs) vs. RHP Kerry Wood (8-5, 3.46; 0-0, 3.46 lifetime
vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Maddux cannot explain his continued dominance over his
old club, but it has to be more than luck. In 77 1/3 innings over
10 career starts against the Cubs, Maddux has allowed just 11
earned runs, yielded 54 hits and struck out 59. Every other
National League club has beaten him at least once, and the Florida
Marlins have beaten him twice. The Marlins ended his 10-game win
streak on July 11, but Maddux is coming off a 4-3 victory over
Milwaukee last Thursday. In his only other start against the Cubs
this year, he won 8-2 on May 22 at Turner Field, allowing five hits
and two runs over eight innings. Wood, 21, is second in the NL with
156 strikeouts that were accumulated in 17 starts. His .190
opponents' batting average is the lowest in either league. He is
0-2 since the All-Star break, however, with losses at Milwaukee and
Pittsburgh. One problem has been walks. During his last 27 1/3
innings, Wood has walked 17 while yielding 16 hits. He faced
Atlanta is consecutive starts on May 23 and May 29 and did not
figure in either decision after giving up just five runs on 11 hits
in 13 innings while striking out 19. Chipper Jones and Andres
Galarraga have homered off him.

 &HT;    O'Meara unruffled in rough setting
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ There must be something about seaside golf
in cool, windy weather that pushes Mark O'Meara to his optimum
performance. A five-time Pebble Beach champion, O'Meara was as
solid as the rocks off Carmel Bay all week at Royal Birkdale, even
when the world's other great players were being blown off their
games.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's calmer, milder conditions notwithstanding, O'Meara had
placed a down payment on the Claret Jug the day before, when 40 mph
gusts were oscillating balls on the greens and knocking swings out
of plane. Despite such distractions, the steady O'Meara recorded a
2-over-par 72 that weighed just as heavily as his Sunday 68.
</P>
<P>
   Of the players finishing in the top 10 Sunday, only Italy's
Costantino Rocca (70) bettered the Saturday score, and just two
players, America's Jim Furyk and Jesper Parnevik of Sweden, matched
it. Many, as you may recall, could only fantasize about a 72.
Defending champion Justin Leonard, at 82, and Phil Mickelson, an 85
shooter, were among them.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who looked at O'Meara's record should not have been
surprised that he mastered Royal Birkdale. In 1987, he won the
Lawrence Batley International tournament here. In 1991 he played in
the final group with winner Ian Baker-Finch, finishing three shots
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me about Pebble Beach,'' O'Meara said. ``I've been
fortunate to win there five times, but any time you go to a golf
course where you've had past success, fond memories, which I've had
here at Royal Birkdale, you don't forget those things.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 O'Meara holed out two 7-irons on the back nine on the
way to his Batley win. He was tied for the lead after 54 holes in
the 1991 Open. Poised by such positive recollections, O'Meara made
his key swing of the tournament on the par-3 14th Sunday, nailing a
3-iron to four feet to erase the memory of a bogey at the 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up, 201 yards, into the wind, left to right,'' O'Meara
said. ``That was a great shot for me in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Two strokes behind Brian Watts through 54 holes, O'Meara used
the experience he gathered three months before at Augusta, when
breaking from the pack at the finish for his first professional
major. He hits fairways and greens. He hangs in. He waits for his
usually great putting to separate him from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the win at the Masters was a tremendous victory,
especially the way I held up coming down the stretch, making the
putt on the 72nd hole,'' O'Meara said. ``That, in itself, was a big
hurdle, knowing I had crossed that hurdle. Sure, I would say I used
that to my advantage out here today.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the puzzle baffles all who haven't been there.
Parnevik, now with three British Open chances that got away, found
O'Meara on the putting green Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it get any easier now?'' he asked the American. ``Do you
feel different today than you did when you teed off at Augusta on
Sunday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' O'Meara said. ``I'm probably just as nervous now as when
I was on the putting green before my final round at Augusta.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as nervous, yes, but not very nervous. On the 18th tee of
of the four-hole playoff Sunday, O'Meara was the picture of
tranquility. Carmel Bay? Irish Sea? Outside of frequent flier
miles, what's the difference?

 &HT;    'Man-woman element' comes to a pool near you
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ I have seen the future of synchronized
swimming and it's name is Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Too long the private domain of nose-plugged, varnish-haired,
sequin-splattered good ol' girls, the sport is being dragged _
smiling, always smiling _ into a new millenium of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Bill May _ pioneer, visonary, breath-holder _ is beating down
the walls that for so long have kept men from artistically treading
water. His personal Bill of Rights was issued Monday in the
Goodwill Games in the form of a silver-medal performance in the
duet competition. He and partner Kristina Lum took the sport to
places it has never been, and introduced possibilities seldom
dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   One small splash for man, one giant belly flop for mankind. Yes,
we can do almost anything a woman can, as long as it doesn't
involve the small detail of child-bearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that a man and a woman can compete in a major
international competition. Maybe this competition will open more
doors,'' said May, a 19-year-old upstate New York native who is now
the pride of the Santa Clara (Calif.) Aquamaids. Yes, he's an
Aquamaid. Before that, he was an Oswego Lakette. It's a hard life
Bill May has chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, a little boy may now picture himself upside down in
the pool, toes curled, legs striking the water like the hammers of
a Steinway. Or even here, in fact. ``There was a little boy, nine,
also named Bill, down here (on the pool deck) who told me he wanted
to do it,'' said Chris Carver, coach of the May-Lum team. What is
that we feel, the first breeze of a movement?
</P>
<P>
   No one was entirely sure how these judges would react to a
mixed-gender duet, performing to the romantic strains of Ravel's
``Bolero.'' Banned from the Olympics, petitioning to be included in
the next Pan Am Games, May had never taken his act to court as high
as this. These officials hadn't had to deal with a routine in which
the two swimmers ended by being entertwined like kudzu vines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they used the man-woman element extremely well,''
said Barbara McNamee, the U.S. judge who awarded the two a perfect
10 for artistry in Monday's duet free program. ``It was exciting
for me and for everyone else. I'd like to see more mixed events.''
</P>
<P>
   Lum has cast her lot with May all the way, sacrificing her
chance to join the Olympic man-haters. ``I had no hesitation about
swimming with Bill. We were committed to trying something
different,'' she said. She foresees the day when mixed pairs become
as accepted in synchronized swimming as in ice skating. That has
been their model all along, down to studying the moves and music of
Olympic ice dancing champions Torvill and Dean.
</P>
<P>
   As for synchro boy himself, Monday was a complete triumph,
considering that no one was going to catch the Russians for the
gold. He had found acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't have been a smooth road, enduring the taunts and
jibes with a pioneer's resolve. ``Behind that smile, he's tough,''
said May's father, Bob.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, I just thought it was something to do
that would be fun. I never really imagined myself standing up at
the Goodwill Games with a medal nine years later,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good day to be a man.

US PROGRAM WOULD BOOST MEXICAN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU AND RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The United States is quietly preparing to launch a
five-year, $3 million program aimed at strengthening the Mexican
Congress, one of the boldest efforts yet to assist Mexico's
development as a multiparty democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the project that will begin this year, US advisers will
help develop a congressional budget office and help train a staff
to handle responsibilities such as drafting bills and researching
legislation, according to US officials familiar with the project.
</P>
<P>
   The US Agency for International Development, or USAID, sponsors
dozens of similar democracy projects throughout the world. But this
first attempt here is notable because of the bone-deep animosity
many Mexicans feel about what they see as a long history of US
meddling in their country's political affairs.
</P>
<P>
   US officials and analysts said the project shows how much fierce
nationalism has eased here in recent years, softened by closer
trade ties with the United States and the slow death of a one-party
state that once used Mexican sovereignty as a tool to maintain
power.
</P>
<P>
   The project also underscores the progress of multiparty rule in
Mexico, particularly in Congress, where last year opposition
parties ended the majority that the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, had sustained for seven decades in the lower house.
The Senate is still dominated by the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the United States is increasingly aware that there's
an alternative political system taking shape in Mexico,'' said
Michael Shifter, a senior fellow with the Inter-American Dialogue
in Washington. ``It's an uncertain political situation that's in
flux, and the US is trying to be supportive of forces and groups
that are trying to advance the democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet tensions in the US-Mexico relationship are never far below
the surface. A recent example is a bitter dispute over the failure
of US law-enforcement authorities to notify their Mexican
counterparts about a sprawling cross-border investigation. The
probe, known as Operation Casablanca, uncovered alleged money
laundering at several Mexican banks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of tensions such as these, US officials appear to be
downplaying the government's role in the Congress project, some
development specialists suggested. US officials have emphasized
that the project grew out of Mexican requests for assistance and
will be less aggressive than in other countries, where American
advisers have helped draft legislation and, in some cases, aided in
writing a new constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be administered not by the US government,
officials emphasized, but by a contractor, the State University of
New York, or SUNY, which will receive a grant to perform the work.
``This is not a contract directed by the US government,'' said an
official familiar with the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very Mexican-led, -directed and -designed'' and USAID
``is simply providing a vehicle,'' the official said. ``This is
more of a responsive project in that it just works to facilitate
the needed expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexican congressional representatives said they knew little
about the project. Those more familiar with it offered varying
descriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an academic project to reform the legislative
process,'' said Gilberto Rincon Gallardo, executive director of the
Center for the Study of State Reform, a nongovernmental
organization in Mexico. ``This is still in the very early stages,
but there is no direct (US) political involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Porfirio Munoz Ledo, the president of Mexico's Chamber of
Deputies and a member of the center-left Party of the Democratic
Revolution, said in an interview that the project would foster an
exchange of ideas and insisted it would not amount to US meddling
in Mexican affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any legislative training program, but we often
have exchanges of ideas with other countries,'' Munoz said. He
added that in the context of this summer's tensions, ``we've had
our differences with the United States, but we're not fighting.
We're discussing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Another high-ranking lawmaker, Ernesto Alfonso Millan Escalante,
of the PRI, said SUNY officials briefed him and several other
deputies on the proposal about three months but nothing concrete
has been developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any other intention apart from cooperation,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Development workers familiar with the project described it as
ambitious, particularly for a country long resistant to foreign
aid. While entertaining bids for the project, USAID posted a
program statement on its Internet sitethat described the Mexican
Congress as a previously ineffectual institution that ``has the
potential to become the major institution at the national level in
which the issues of the state reform will be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   The Congress is particularly weak at participating in the budget
process, the USAID program statement noted, and any project would
work to strengthen that area. ``Members realize that the Congress
is not sufficiently equipped to play its constitutionally assigned
role and seek to develop the capacity to participate in the budget
process in a manner which is independent, responsible and
informed,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The project also will work to develop ``a permanent,
professional, nonpartisan staff trained in such areas as budget
analysis, legislative research, and bill drafting,'' according to
the program statement. A civil service staff is especially
critical, the statement said, because of term limits that cause a
turnover of legislators and staff members every three years.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting democracy has been a cornerstone of American foreign
policy since the end of the Cold War. The Clinton administration
early on defined its primary strategy as one of ``enlargement of
the world's free community of market democracies.''
</P>
<P>
   The US government currently spends a total of nearly a
half-billion dollars in more than 50 countries, including China, on
programs similar to the democracy project. Thomas Carothers, a
former US AID lawyer who has written extensively about democracy
promotion for the Carnegie Endowment in Washington, said the
programs vary in effectiveness and ``require a lot of
sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we heard the Japanese were setting up a project like this,
we'd figure they must want to keep an eye on trade legislation,''
said Carothers. ``I think Americans sometimes underestimate how
hard it is for other countries to see a large foreign power working
in their political system. But the people who are going into Mexico
are well aware of it.''

DR. GARETH M. GREEN, LED STUDY ON GULF WAR SYNDROME; AT 67 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Gareth M. Green, a Harvard professor who headed a 1994
National Institutes of Health study of Gulf War syndrome, died of a
brain tumor Saturday in Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. The
Brookline, Mass. resident was 67.
</P>
<P>
   An environmental health specialist, Dr. Green joined the faculty
at the Harvard School of Public Health in 1990. He previously was
associated with the Channing Laboratory at Boston City Hospital,
where his investigation of World War II veterans who were dying of
relatively mild cases of bronchitis and pneumonia led him to
identify a key player in the lung's defense against disease, a
large cell called the alveolar macrophage. The cell has since been
the subject of hundreds of studies.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Green then joined the faculty at the University of Vermont,
where he established a statewide network of pulmonary clinics
before joining the faculty at Johns Hopkins University, where he
was a professor from 1976 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he was named chairman of the panel to research Gulf War
syndrome, a mysterious mix of maladies with symptoms ranging from
headaches and memory loss to joint pain and rashes that afflicts
tens of thousands of veterans of the war in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in the Globe on Feb. 16, 1997, Dr.
Green said, ``Evidence that's developing supports the idea that
there's a biological illness, one that may have been aggravated by
psychological conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Brookline, he graduated from Harvard College and Harvard
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife, Joanna (Erskine); a daughter, Jennifer Joy
Green Wesley of Rhode Island; two sons, Geoffrey of Vermont and
Alan of Pennsylvania; his mother, Dorothy Bradford Summers Green of
Lexington, Mass.; three brothers and five sisters; and six
grandchildren.

SOTHEBY'S PLANS AN ARTS SHOWPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J.)  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An ambitious plan to expand Sotheby's headquarters on
York Avenue and 72nd Street into a department store for art with a
sleek glass and granite facade and a sculpture garden on its roof
has reached a critical stage in the city's approval process.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which is expected to cost more than $100 million, will
be reviewed and given a public hearing Wednesday by the New York
City Planning Commission, which is expected to give it the final
green light.
</P>
<P>
   The four-story former Kodak warehouse that has been Sotheby's
New York home for 18 years is intended to become an elegant
400,000-square-foot, 10-story building. It is scheduled for
completion in September 2000 and has been designed to address the
needs of an auction house poised for business in the 21st century.
The building's interior will have a 10-story atrium with
escalators, providing views of seven floors of exhibition space.
Each department will have its own space to show objects year round,
not just during the sale season.
</P>
<P>
   For years, both Sotheby's and its archrival, Christie's, have
been starved for space. Christie's finally decided to leave its
Park Avenue and 59th Street site for 300,000 square feet in
Rockefeller Center. The move is expected next year. For both
Sotheby's and Christie's, finding enough space in a location
convenient to art and antiques buyers, in a neighborhood where
precious paintings, furniture and objects can be moved in and out
safely and efficiently, was close to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   For these companies, whose total business has more than doubled
over the last 10 years, physical expansion has become critical as
each continues to grow from being merely auctioneers to also
running ancillary businesses like real estate, insurance and
storage.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, who made his reputation
and his fortune designing and building upscale shopping centers in
affluent communities like Short Hills, N.J., and Stamford, Conn.,
has taken an active role in the plans for the building expansion.
Ever since he and a group of investors bought the company in 1983,
he has made it a priority to oversee the renovations of Sotheby's
offices all over the world.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Taubman hired three Manhattan architectural firms to work on the
New York headquarters. Kohn Pederson Fox has designed the exterior,
Swanke Hayden &AMP; Connell has created the interior plans, and Richard
Gluckman, who has just completed the Whitney Museum of American
Art's new permanent galleries, has designed the building's top
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sotheby's and Christie's explored many of the same sites,
among them the former Alexander's department store at Lexington
Avenue and 59th Street, the site where the B. Altman department
store stood at Fifth Avenue and 34th Street and an old storage
company on the Upper East Side. Sotheby's also contemplated joining
a team of architects and developers applying to build on the New
York Coliseum site in midtown, but abandoned the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of research,'' said Diana Brooks, Sotheby's chief
executive. ``We met with about 150 clients and sent letters to over
250. In the end we came to the conclusion that people like where we
are. It's easy to get a cab, and for those coming to the city from
Connecticut or Westchester there's not much traffic and parking
isn't a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The location seems to make sense now, but when Sotheby's gave up
prime space at 980 Madison Avenue, near 76th Street, everyone
thought the move to faraway York Avenue was crazy. The business was
far smaller then, and York Avenue was less of a residential
neighborhood than it is today.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents are poised for a fight, although the community
board has approved the project. ``It will be as busy with the
trucks and twice the number of loading bays as Bloomingdale's,''
said Paul Higgins, president of the 72nd Street Association. ``I
surmise that every resident will take a 10 percent discount in the
value of their apartments because it clearly sends a signal that
this is a commercial district, not a residential one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's plans call for six floors to be built on top of the
four-story building, tripling its exhibition space. At the Planning
Commission's public hearing, it will ask for a zoning change to
allow commercial rather than residential space to be built on the
site. It will also seek a special permit to build what is
essentially a 150-foot-tall building with setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to rumor, the plans include neither art galleries nor
antiques shops as tenants. None of the art galleries Sotheby's has
bought over the years, like the Andre Emmerich Gallery or Deitch
Projects, will move to 72nd Street either.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Sotheby's has thought of developing
its York Avenue site. In 1985, Sotheby's signed a deal with Taubman
under which his real estate company would develop a residential
tower on top of the building. A zoning change in 1990 gave
Sotheby's approval to build one floor of space for itself and 27
stories of apartments. But the plan was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business has changed so much,'' Mrs. Brooks said. ``Back
then, we only had a $250 million auction business in New York;
today it's $900 million. The economics are so different today that
building a high-rise no longer looks financially appealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has been renting the York Avenue space but has an
option to buy the building from Benenson Capital, a New York-based
real estate developer, which it plans to exercise soon. The price
is about 10 times its annual rent, or about $11.5 million. Mrs.
Brooks estimates that the entire project will cost between $100
million and $115 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's will stay open during the construction. While many
offices will relocate nearby, Mrs. Brooks said, the core of the
auction business will continue at York Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Sotheby's spends about $5.5 million a year on rent.
Besides the York Avenue site, it is leasing space in five other
locations for storage as well as office and exhibition space: a
nine-floor warehouse at First Avenue and 111th Street; 411 East
76th St.; 750 Lexington Ave., at 59th Street; and 425 East 61st St.
and 980 Madison Ave. After the expansion, four of those leased
spaces will no longer be needed, but brokers at Sotheby's
International Realty will stay in the Madison Avenue offices. And
Sotheby's will no longer have the expense of having a fleet of
trucks transport furniture, art and objects between warehouses and
auction rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The design for the York Avenue expansion ``is going to be very
pure and understated,'' Taubman said. ``Nothing is going to shout
at you here except the objects.''
</P>
<P>
   Taubman designed his shopping centers so that visitors going to
one store would find themselves spending money in another, and he
has made sure that the new Sotheby's will work the same way. By
putting the main salesroom on the seventh floor and most of the
popular departments on the upper floors, the design takes visitors
into the heart of the building, so that they see a lot more than
they bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   Each department will also have its own storage space adjacent to
its offices and nearby exhibition space. ``We felt it was crucial
for everyone that experts live with their objects,'' Taubman said.
</P>
<P>
   The first floor will house a restaurant and a bookstore. The
10,000-square-foot top floor will be devoted to contemporary art
and will have ceilings 22 feet high, to allow extremely large works
to be shown. (The average ceiling heights throughout the building
will also be high, about 18 feet.)
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its current space, which has only one salesroom, the
expanded Sotheby's will have five, some of which can be transformed
into galleries when extra exhibition space is needed. ``The concept
here is that we wanted everything to be flexible,'' Mrs. Brooks
said. ``We've tried to build in what might happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the future of the business was crucial, she said.
Since private sales are a growing part of the business, the plan
includes galleries and offices for them. The company also plans to
provide warehouse space, so that if a client is going away for a
few months and wants a place to store a prized Matisse or Picasso,
it can be sent to Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   The plans call for devoting the entire third floor to Sotheby's
Arcade, where it sells its less expensive merchandise. ``We want to
increase volume significantly,'' Mrs. Brooks said. ``Right now, we
turn away between $5-million- and $10-million-worth of estate
business because we simply can't handle either the space needed to
show and store the objects or the sales schedule. People,
understandably, don't want to wait months to sell these kinds of
thing.'' She is considering ``quick sale areas,'' similar to
country tag sales, and even a retail jewelry department.
</P>
<P>
   During the height of the construction, Mrs. Brooks said, she
hopes to wrap the building in some kind of interesting contemporary
artwork, and various artists are being considered. ``While we're
undergoing the worst of the construction,'' she said, ``we still
want this project to be fun.''

   Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, a history professor with a wry sense
of humor and the former president of Smith College whose efforts
led to the Five College consortium, died Saturday on Martha's
Vineyard, where he had lived since retiring in 1975. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mendenhall became president of Smith College in 1959 and
steered the school with dignity and fairness through some of the
most turbulent times in American education. A champion of diversity
and free speech, he would go to antiwar demonstrations to make sure
the demonstrators were heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was truly an engaged intellectual; his feet were planted in
his historical discipline, but his heart was planted in the right
values,'' said Richard Unsworth, the former chaplain at Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the social upheaval prevalent on university
campuses, Mr. Mendenhall had to confront the challenges peculiar to
a women's college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom resisted efforts for Smith to go co-educational,'' said
his wife, Cornelia Baker Mendenhall. ``He thought there should be
choice and that single-sex education was important to some women.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing cooperation among Smith's four neighboring
institutions, Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Hampshire colleges and
the University of Massachusetts, ensured Smith would remain a
women's college. But beyond that, it augmented the potential of
each institution.
</P>
<P>
   While at Smith, Mr. Mendenhall oversaw the creation of the Ada
Comstock Scholars program, in which older women start or return to
college study in a flexible program that accommodates work or
family schedules. The program was one of the first of its kind in
the nation and was small when he left. It now has 250 students.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, he helped found and later chaired the board of
Catalyst, a national organization that seeks to advance women in
business.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mendenhall was born in Madison, Wis., the son of a
University of Wisconsin physicist, Charles Mendenhall, and a
pediatrician, Dr. Dorothy Mendenhall. His mother was an alumna of
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, three years after his retirement, Mr. Mendenhall was
awarded an honorary degree from Smith. The crowd of several
thousand roared with laughter when he said the honor ``redressed a
genetic error that always distressed me.'' He explained that his
mother, upon learning she was pregnant, enrolled a spot for her
expected child in the class of 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mendenhall attended Andover and graduated from Yale in 1932.
He went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar and was captain of the
Balliol College crew.
</P>
<P>
   Crew and boating were two of his passions. He served as an
informal coach of Smith rowers. And among the 10 books he authored
were ``A Short History of American Rowing,'' ``The Harvard-Yale
Boat Race 1852-1924'' and ``Have Oar, Will Travel,'' a history of
Yale's 1956 crew team, which won an Olympic gold medal in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a devoted Red Sox fan, and during the 1967 pennant
race, he brought a transistor radio to church for the baptism of a
family friend so he would not miss any of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mendenhall began teaching at Yale in 1937 and spent 22 years
there. He was master of Berkeley, an undergraduate resident college
at Yale from 1950 to 1959. While at Yale, he helped establish the
Directed Studies Program, a program of general education.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he became a college president, he chose not to leave
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching was his big thing and he taught straight through, no
matter what administrative matters he had to deal with,'' said his
wife. Not only did he love it, ``he thought it was important to be
on the same side of the trenches as the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   It would only take 10 minutes to walk from the president's house
to his office, but the trip often took Mr. Mendenhall 45 minutes or
an hour because he would stop and talk with people on campus, said
Walter Morris-Hale, a professor of government hired by Mr.
Mendenhall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in touch with the people who make Smith work, and I
mean the cooks, the plumbers, the people who cut the grass,'' said
Morris-Hale. Position and power did not matter to Mr. Mendenhall.
``He could approach anyone and anyone could approach him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mendenhall often asked people why college presidents are
like porcupines and then gave the answer: You have to be one to
love one.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the boards of several secondary schools including
the Kent School and Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, Mass. He was
a trustee of the Clarke School for the Deaf in Northampton, Mass.
and a director of the Council for Basic Education.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement at his home on Indian Hill, Mr. Mendenhall was
actively involved in life on Martha's Vineyard. He was on the board
of the Sheriff's Meadow Foundation, a conservation group, the
Martha's Vineyard Hospital; the West Tisbury Conservation
Commission and the Vineyard Open Land Foundation. He also loved to
sail his Menemsha 24 sloop, the Louisa K. Fast, on Vineyard Sound.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Cornelia, Mr. Mendenhall is survived by
two daughters: Bethany Mendenhall, of California, and Cornelia
Small, of New York; a brother, John, of Wisconsin; and two
grandchildren.

LIFE AS JUROR NO. 5 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For four days last week, I was juror No. 5, as
silent as a potted palm, sitting in a District of Columbia
courtroom in judgment of a defendant accused of assault with intent
to kill.
</P>
<P>
   This is the American way of justice, but a new experience
entirely for me. Unable to speak for days! Herded around like a
schoolchild! Identified by number rather than by my name!
</P>
<P>
   I was part of a petit jury presided over by Superior Court Judge
Robert Tignor, with responsibilities far less spectacular than
those of the federal grand jury in a nearby courthouse that has
been hearing allegations of wrongdoing against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But we took our duty seriously. Over the years, I have heard
stories about obstinate jurors, biased jurors, furious jurors. Fist
fights, practically. But that was not my experience.
</P>
<P>
   Our jury functioned reasonably well as a team. We went along to
get along. We followed the judge's instructions carefully, not
discussing the case with one another or anyone else until the trial
was over. Our deliberations were sometimes heated and maddening but
never so hostile that we stopped talking.
</P>
<P>
   The process was a tad messy. We often veered off on tangents
that were irrelevant to the question of guilt or innocence. But
someone would always apply the ultimate rational antidote: Do we
want to resolve this or sit here for several more days?
</P>
<P>
   After four and a half hours of deliberation and four secret
ballots, we finally agreed unanimously to convict the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   My jury experience did not begin auspiciously. None of us really
wanted to be there, interrupting our normal lives and workday
routines.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, a consultant, abandoned a business trip to Baton
Rouge, La. Another, a nurse, arranged for substitutes to take her
shift, which meant she would be obligated later to work extra hours
to compensate. A third was forced to hire a babysitter. Others
worried about work at jobs piling up.
</P>
<P>
   We 14 jurors (including two alternates) were a diverse lot, five
whites and nine blacks. Women dominated, 11 of us to only three
men.
</P>
<P>
   The crime occurred in 1993, seriously suggesting a less than
speedy D.C. criminal justice system. Nobody bothered to explain to
the jury about the delay.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved a now-74-year-old man who befriended the
daughter of his former mistress after the daughter became ill with
potential breast cancer. Suggesting that he might be her father, he
took out two insurance policies on her life under odd
circumstances, naming himself as beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that he met her at a remote, wooded location,
asked her to bend over to help him search for money he claimed to
have dropped, hit her across her back with his cane and knocked her
for a loop.
</P>
<P>
   Then she was hit again, causing a potentially fatal concussion
and breaking her jaw. She did not remember the blow but revived
hours later face down in a nearby drainage ditch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy'' claimed he was home the whole evening. His wife
corroborated that during the trial but mysteriously had previously
failed to mention this alibi to police or to the grand jury that
indicted him. She also contradicted him on relevant details about
the insurance policies.
</P>
<P>
   Whom to believe? Some jurors had emotional difficulty with the
concept of sending a man to jail without a neutral witness who
could confirm the actual attack. And there were gaps and
contradictions in the testimony, although strong circumstantial
evidence and the motive pointed to the man's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Our first secret poll showed that we were seriously divided,
with seven for conviction, four for acquittal and one undecided.
</P>
<P>
   To judge by the moans around the long table, we envisioned long
days until we could persuade the judge we were permanently hung.
</P>
<P>
   Those for conviction began talking first _ agitated babbling is
a good way to put it. Then we calmed down and started going bit by
bit through the testimony and documents. Everyone talked, although
a few forceful, rational voices tended to dominate the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Personal anecdotes that seemed applicable were told. Notes
enabling those for conviction to read back actual testimony quotes
successfully countered those with faulty memories who had not
written anything down. Over the four secret ballots, those for
acquittal were converted one by one.
</P>
<P>
   My jury seems to have been fairly typical in its unhappiness
with our thankless task but perhaps more diligent in our duties
than some. Distinguished jurists in several states are so alarmed
by problems in the jury system that they are pressing for reforms
to make it more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the National Center for State Courts presented its
annual award to Superior Court Judge Michael Dann of Maricopa
County, Ariz., for heading a groundbreaking committee that has made
recommendations already adopted by several states to make the jury
system more user-friendly. Primary among the suggestions is that
jurors should have the right to take notes during a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the jury is barred from writing down what
witnesses say, even though everyone else in the courtroom can do
so. Judge Tignor allowed us to make notes but demanded that they be
destroyed after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Another proposed change would allow jurors to discuss the case
among themselves as the trial unfolds. We were all frustrated by
not being able to discuss the testimony while the details were
still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   A third change would permit juries to ask questions of witnesses
and be given copies of witness statements. Brilliant! The more
information, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Based on my experience, the jury system functions. But it sure
could be improved. How about serving pizza and coffee in the jury
room, for instance?

<P>
   CHINANTLA, Mexico _ In the dark before dawn, when the priest
bumped his pickup truck through the samll town of Chinantla,
Mexico, to wake everyone up, Monica Cruz groaned and put her pillow
over her head. In New York City, as the assistant manager of a
store, she enjoys daylong access to cappuccino. Here in her dusty
little hometown, there is not a cup of coffee to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on that not quite morning, Monica, who is 30, gave in to
the priest's exhortation by loudspeaker, eased on her black sateen
jacket and headed toward the town cemetery with her oversized
candle. Other New Yorkers were slipping into the predawn stillness,
too _ a busboy from the Friars Club, a nurse from St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, a maid from the Warwick Hotel.
Under a crescent moon over adobe, they felt blissfully far from
their daily grind, their bilingual negotiations with the place
Chinantla calls simply ``over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifted outside themselves, they cleared their minds of
everything but their town's patron saint, Padre Jesus of Chinantla,
purveyor of miracles that transcend borders. This was his day; he
had brought them back from New York by the hundreds, as he does
every winter, for a week of fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   Up the steep hill to the blue church, they sang a birthday song:
``Padre Jesus of Chinantla, please send your blessings to the so
many of us in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think we all have too much love for this tiny
town,'' Monica, a native New Yorker, said later, as she lounged
with her three younger sisters _ Elizabeth, Melissa and Antonia _
at their parents' grand brick and marble house, paid for by tens of
thousands of floors mopped, orders cooked and garments sewn in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every migration story is the psychodrama of a family, its
aspirations and frustrations. For the Cruz family of Chinantla,
Mexico, it is also the story of a town, a global village in the
most literal sense.
</P>
<P>
   Like many modern immigrant families, those from Chinantla
straddle a border, abetted by newly inexpensive air fares,
international phone cards, and, now, by a new Mexican law that
allows them to retain their Mexican nationality as American
citizens and even confers it on their American-born children. They
live divided, 2,500 in Chinantla, 2,500 in New York, but consider
themselves one group.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the first-generation Chinantecan immigrants are
waiters and garment workers and bus mechanics. Back home, they are
big shots. They are the ones who, working out of a basement in
Brooklyn, collected the money that built the town's schools and
rebuilt its church, who financed and designed its potable water
system and illuminated its streets.
</P>
<P>
   The sons and daughters of peasants who sign their names with
inky thumbs, they are also the ones whose American children are
almost all headed to college, in college, or graduates. Every
January and every summer, their children and grandchildren fill the
town square with English, baggy shorts sweeping their knees. Cries
of ``Wassup?'' float through the hot, dry air.
</P>
<P>
   Many older Chinantecans keep their children's connections alive
by moving back permanently to the one place where they can be
somebody. After 30 years of dislocation, Ramon and Zoela Cruz,
Monica's parents, returned triumphant, to an eat-in kitchen, a
backyard henhouse and the sweet, bone-deep satisfaction of
familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   On their return, Mrs. Cruz, who spent decades folding fabric in
a Brooklyn sweatshop, hired a maid. She opened a small store, from
which she dispenses rice and advice.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who dropped out of eighth grade to work the fields, bought
his own land, on which he dabbles like a gentleman farmer. In crisp
tailored shirts and Bermuda shorts, he is Don Ramon to all, no
longer a cook but a candidate for mayor of Chinantla.
</P>
<P>
   When their granddaughter, Samantha Bizarro, a third-generation
Mexican-American, turned 3, she was sent ``home'' to Mexico.
Grandma was supposed to fatten her up with chicken mole and bean
dishes enriched with lard. But it didn't work. She returned as
skinny as ever, still devoted to rice cakes and Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she had had a taste of something far richer: Chinantla.
Another generation was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Working Hard, Saving for Chinantla
</P>
<P>
   Each time they return from Chinantla, the townsfolk scatter to
their homes in Brooklyn, the Bronx, Long Island and New Jersey,
where they complain about feeling ``locked in'' and grow wistful
about the town square, which sits in a bowl of hills dotted with
saguaro cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, though, they are gathering again in the alternative
town centers they have created in New York: their social club in
the back of the Garcia Superette on Church Avenue in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters live in yet another center, a little Chinantla
in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish community in Brooklyn. Almost all the
tenants in their graffiti-scarred building are Chinantecan; they
shop for tortillas around the corner at La Chinanteca, the only
store in the neighborhood that sells photographs of Padre Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In Chinantla, which the sisters visit at least once a year, they
have their own rooms, with queen-size beds and frilly comforters.
In Brooklyn, where their parents visit them every six months, three
of the four split a $700-a-month one-bedroom apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Melissa, grown women, share a flimsy mattress on a
metal frame in a makeshift room separated from the kitchen by a
curtain. Books and papers are piled high; both women are studying
for master's degrees, Monica in political science, Melissa in
advanced nursing.
</P>
<P>
   The real bedroom, where their parents used to sleep, now belongs
to Antonia, 24; her husband, Claudio Bizarro, a busboy; 6-month-old
Brandon, and Samantha, a kindergartner with pigtails.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen blocks away, the fourth sister, Elizabeth, 29, a
bilingual education teacher, her husband, Cuauhtemoc Tlatelpa, a
cook who aspires to be an architect, and their 2-year-old son live
in the renovated basement of an Orthodox family's house.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual and college-educated, the Cruz sisters have better
jobs than their parents ever did, with paid vacationd, sick leave
and health benefits. But, American citizens all, they still live
like new immigrants, crowded together, squirreling away money for
the future.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder they remain attached to Chinantla, a place of
winter fiestas and summer vacations, of comfort and pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, Daddy was a cook,'' Monica said. ``In Chinantla,
he's `the man.' And we're his daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   A Family Journey, Founded on tourist Visas
</P>
<P>
   Like most Chinantecans, the Cruzes did not cross the border like
so-called wetbacks, but flew in on tourist visas in the 1960s.
Still, their intention was to work, and they quickly found menial
jobs. Before long, they had two American-born daughters, Cecilia
and then Monica. Based on Cecilia's birth, they applied for legal
residency, which used to be granted routinely in similar
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   It was supremely important to the Cruzes that the girls be
baptized in Chinantla, so, while their residency application was
pending, they flew home. Then tragedy struck. While playing on the
cement floor of her grandparents' adobe house, Little Cecilia
ingested a poisonous fumigant and fell fatally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Her death was an unshakeable trauma, particularly for Mrs. Cruz.
Moreover, after Cecilia died, the American Embassy in Mexico City
denied the Cruzes' application for residency, suspecting fraud
because they could produce neither the child nor a death
certificate.
</P>
<P>
   This embittered Cruz, who felt he was being punished for the
death of his child. Three months later, he and his wife struck out
for the United States again, with forged documents. ``We defied
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of 15 years of back and forth. Three more
girls were born: Elizabeth in Chinantla, Melissa and Antonia in New
York. They were all brought home and left with their grandparents;
their parents worked round the clock in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters remember their childhood in Chinantla with
great affection. They played jacks with rocks, and sold lemonade in
the town square. They wore threadbare uniforms to the one-room
schoolhouse, and then threw themselves under the dining table to do
their homework.
</P>
<P>
   On one trip home, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz bought a small house of
their own. The next trip was involuntary. Cruz, to his everlasting
humiliation, was picked up by immigration agents, jailed for 15
days and deported. The Cruzes decided enough was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as fate would have it, they got the call that, after so
many years, they were to get their green cards. Mrs. Cruz did not
want to return. But Cruz felt they could not turn down the
opportunity ``to elevate our life style even further.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 1979, and Monica was 13. Her parents sat her down and
delivered earth-shattering news: she was American, born in New York
City. She refused to believe it. She ran away into the hills and
hid under an amate tree.
</P>
<P>
   Her youngest sister, Antonia, who was only 6, bubbled over with
excitement. She announced that the next time she returned to
Chinantla she would be blonde. (And indeed she was.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it was a green van that came to take us away,''
Melissa said. ``I remember driving off and a long line of dogs
following us, barking. We were all crying. My father said something
like, `Look forward, not back.' And then it was like fingers
snapped and we were landing at Kennedy. The chapter in Chinantla
was closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so they thought.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One Community, But Divisions, Too
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, it was clear that the only way for a Chinantecan
to survive financially was to leave Chinantla. This reality
produced a collective pang of conscience, and a kind of unspoken
social contract emerged. From the beginning, Chinantecans tithed a
portion of their earnings to their town. They formed a committee
and developed a census of Chinantecan immigrants. When they were
raising money for a specific project, they divided up addresses and
crisscrossed the metropolitan area on what they called ``la
colecta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority has been to give this little town its most basic
needs,'' said Abel Alonso, the committee's president. ``We have
changed the physiognomy of the town.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's motto is immortalized on an ink stamp: ``To
Chinantla and its future: The absent ones are always present.''
</P>
<P>
   To the official government of Chinantla, the motto has the faint
ring of a threat. But that has to be ignored, said Dr. Francisco
Calixto, the mayor, because, ``We have no other source of income
besides New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers send about $2 million a year home to Chinantla,
according to Smith. Scores of American pension checks and Social
Security checks also arrive every month to help support retirees.
</P>
<P>
   But there are tensions between the two communities about what
should be done in Chinantla. The New Yorkers want to preserve the
town's charm, and the locals want to modernize. And there are also
tensions about who should have power, who should get credit, and
who really needs help, the town or the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Small-Town Girls Trapped in the City
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters returned to New York for the second half of
their childhood in the late 1970s. At first they savored the
luxuries of the developed world. They reveled in indoor showers
after a lifetime of crouching beneath upturned pots of bracing well
water.
</P>
<P>
   But they also mourned the loss of their small-town freedom. They
bounced off the walls of their family's first residence, outdoorsy
girls trapped in an efficiency apartment.
</P>
<P>
   While their parents worked, the sisters competed to get 97s and
98s on tests. When home, their father hovered and lectured,
drilling them in geography and world politics. He did not tolerate
television watching. He did not let the girls date. They were very
good girls, and remain loyal to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents gave us everything, and they gave up everything
for us,'' Melissa said. ``All they wanted us to do was go to school
and make a better person of ourselves, and not end up doing the
jobs they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first eight years, they could not afford a single trip
to Mexico. Then, when their father landed the One Penn Plaza job,
which paid union wages, they began the custom of regular visits
home. On one of those trips, Elizabeth met her future husband,
Cuauhtemoc, a Chinantecan.
</P>
<P>
   But Antonia, the youngest, married first. She met her husband,
Claudio, then a new immigrant from the state of Morelos, at a
volleyball game organized by a Chinantecan youth group.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth, the most studious sister, waited until she completed
her master's degree in bilingual education to marry Cuauhtemoc.
After their wedding, Elizabeth, the only daughter born in Mexico,
forced herself to become a U.S. citizen. She mouthed the words
while thinking to herself, ``I'm doing this for my husband,'' who
obtained a green card through their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Melissa joke that all the Chinantecan boys are taken
and that they will have to range farther afield. But they are in no
hurry, for their ambitions, if at times scattered, are great.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat on a crate between bottles of hot sauce and bags of
rice in her store in Chinantla, Mrs. Cruz was asked if she was
proud of how far her family had come in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   She pursed her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two are still single, and they don't have all their diplomas
yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a demanding immigrant mother, the jury is still out.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Comfort In Padre Jesus
</P>
<P>
   Every Chinantecan home has a photograph of Padre Jesus, and some
have wooden replicas of the statue. When she was pregnant with her
first child, Elizabeth Cruz lowered herself to her knees in her
Brooklyn apartment and crossed herself before his photo. It had
been a difficult pregnancy and she was confined to bed. ``If we
survive,'' she promised, ``I will bring my baby to you in Chinantla
to be baptized.''
</P>
<P>
   By early this year _ ``miracle of miracles,'' she said _
Elizabeth was sending out engraved invitations, inviting all of
Chinantecan New York to the biggest baptism party of the season, on
her parents' terraced patio in Chinantla during the winter fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the party, skinned goats swung from the trees
in the backyard. The four Cruz sisters were stringing the patio
with baby blue streamers and setting out long banquet tables and
plastic chairs bearing the Corona beer logo.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen college-age women arrived to help with the
preparations. Leticia Lopez, a business major at Berkeley College
in Paramus, N.J., turned her face to the sun, and sighed, rubbing
her Fila sneaker in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the sky back there was like this, nice and blue,'' she
said. ``It's so nice and quiet here, too. Down here, life has time
to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, the boy of honor, 2-year-old Christian de
Jesus, was plunked into the official town barber's chair for a $1
baptism-special buzz cut.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., the town band showed up to parade Christian and his
parents through Chinantla. Christian was dressed in a white
captain's suit with gold braiding. A toy saber hung from his side.
Holding his parents' hands, he climbed the steep, rocky path to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted by the anticipation, Christian fell sound asleep just
as the ceremony began. As his godfather, his Uncle Claudio, held
him in his arms, the priest, in green robes, poured cups of water
over his closed eyes. His parents' faces crumpled; tears spilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my promise has been fulfilled,'' Elizabeth said.
</P>
<P>
   A Healthy Attachment, Despite Cultural Tensions
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Chinantecans are not conflicted about their
identities. They know instinctively that their attachment to
Chinantla is healthy, that it gives them a rich identity, and a
keen, even enviable sense of community in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But they do maintain a kind of jokey banter that reflects some
tension. When the sisters' uncle settled into an armchair with a
bottle of tequila to narrate the tale of their grandfather's role
as messenger for Zapata, Antonia rolled her eyes. ``I hate it when
he gets so Mexican,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Antonia's husband, at her request, wore the Baby Bjorn
to the cock fights, their uncle rolled his eyes. ``All this
kowtowing to the wives, it's so un-Mexican,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While they all idealize Chinantla, most of the young people know
in their guts that it would be difficult to live permanently in
such a small, conservative society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite spot in the world,'' Monica said. ``I
count the days until my next trip down here. But I'm afraid I've
outgrown it a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnestly, her sister Melissa says that if she had to make a
choice, she would rather live a tranquil life in Chinantla. In the
next breath, though, she acknowledges that her loyalty will never
have to be put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky,'' she said. ``We really don't have to choose
between here and there.''
</P>

OFFENSE RESTS WITH BLEDSOE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Drew Bledsoe stood alone at the podium Monday
answering the same old questions. How are you adjusting to the new
system? How does Robert Edwards look? Can this team win the Super
Bowl? Does this team have enough talent on offense?
</P>
<P>
   It was rather symbolic, because sometimes he must feel that he's
alone on the field, with everything evolving around him.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Bledsoe answer questions, in what is still an
uncomfortable setting for him, it was easy to see that he
understands the success of the Patriots' offense will be dependent
on him.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Curtis Martin in the backfield, the offense revolved
around Bledsoe's right arm. And with Edwards and Sedrick Shaw, that
will still be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Having a new offensive coordinator (Ernie Zampese) won't change
anything. Bledsoe has to lead the Patriots. Obviously he needs help
from his so-called weapons. If Terry Glenn takes his job seriously
and tries to make amends for last season, that's a plus. If the
coaching staff is serious about Vincent Brisby becoming a prominent
weapon again, maybe he and Bledsoe can regain the rhythm the two
had when Brisby was the quarterback's favorite target.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bledsoe threw often to Edwards out of the backfield in
both practice sessions and the rookie looked comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Zampese will introduce a subtle change in the way Bledsoe will
pass the ball. In reality, it's going back to Bledsoe's upbringing
as a football player. His father, Mac, was the high school coach at
Walla Walla High School. The offense of choice was the
quick-passing game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't our system per se,'' recalled Mac Bledsoe. ``We
borrowed it from Mike Price at Washington State. As it turned out,
Drew went to play for Mike and used the same system.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bledsoe believes his son will excel in Zampese's
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be second nature to him,'' said Mac Bledsoe. ``It's
very difficult for me to predict anything for Drew because I'm so
close to him, but it's a system that he did very well with in both
high school and college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's always been the temptation when you're
coaching Drew to have him drop back and throw long. We continually
had to remind ourselves of the basic principle of the offense, and
that is not to allow people to sit back in coverage. I think the
short passing game makes certain that doesn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For the younger Bledsoe, it's been an easy adjustment. ``It's
really all starting to come back to me, and it feels pretty
comfortable,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Why Parcells and his staff didn't use the same system Bledsoe
used at Washington State is unknown. When Bledose came into the
league, he was raw. Parcells tried to let him gain experience by
letting him throw the ball all over the field.
</P>
<P>
   The system basically worked as Bledsoe set passing records for
yardage and led the Patriots to the Super Bowl two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have a clue when I first got here,'' he said.
``It was like playground ball, just drop back and let it fly. Now
it seems I think I know what's going on most of the time. I'm much
more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   With Glenn out most of the year, last season was a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're healthy this football team is a better football
team than the one we left on the field in Pittsburgh,'' said
Bledsoe. ``This year the important thing is to stay healthy and
when we have an injury, to have the guys who step in keep up that
level of play. It's a battle everybody fights around the league.
With (strength and conditioning coach) Johnny's (Parker) offseason
program, hopefully we've eliminated those type of injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe feels the receivers have to adjust more than he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking them to be more precise in their routes,'' he
said. ``The important thing is for me to know where five or six
guys are going to be. We're still going to work the ball downfield
to take advantage of our speed outside.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, Bledsoe knows the areas in which he must improve. ``I
have to get better with my accuracy and be more precise when I'm
throwing the football, especially on shorter passes,'' said
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   With young backs who aren't real adept yet at picking up blitz
coverage, it would appear the Patriots need some veteran help. With
Dave Meggett and Sam Gash, it was like having extra coaches on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect all of our guys to step on the field and play the
game the way they're supposed to,'' Bledsoe said. ``We expect them
to be able to pick those things up when it happens. Whether you're
young or older, you have to do your job when you're called upon.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has benefitted Bledsoe over the years is that the
offensive line has protected him well. The running backs have
picked up blitzes. When that happens Bledsoe, can do the rest. This
year, he may have to do more than that.

 &HT;    Deal shuts Wachovia out of a potential expansion partner
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ SunTrust Banks is not through with mergers and
acquisitions, but investors apparently doubt Wachovia will be one
of the Atlanta bank's partners any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Winston-Salem-based Wachovia rose only 25 cents to
$86.75 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have long speculated a SunTrust Banks-Wachovia merger
is a logical outcome of the current wave of bank consolidations,
which number more than 200 in 1998 alone.
</P>
<P>
   L.M. Baker Jr., Wachovia chairman, president and chief executive
officer, declined to comment on the idea of a Wachovia-SunTrust
Banks combination. But he said the SunTrust Banks-Crestar Financial
deal does not change Wachovia's Southeast-focused growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most markets in the Southeast look good for the future, and we
favor the Southeast because we know something about it,'' said
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   As far as Raymond James &AMP; Associates analyst Richard X. Bove is
concerned, the only practical consequence of the Crestar Financial
deal is that Wachovia doesn't get a chance to a Richmond bank
holding company that operates in lucrative Virginia, District of
Columbia and Maryland markets.
</P>
<P>
   Baker told financial analysts in Atlanta earlier this year that
Virginia was one of several states that Wachovia viewed as an
expansion market. Florida and Alabama were others.
</P>
<P>
   Bove said Crestar Financial probably chose SunTrust Banks
because the latter's decentralized management style will save
Crestar Financial jobs, while Wachovia's centralized corporate
culture would have resulted in layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts still look for a SunTrust Banks-Wachovia merger
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Wachovia-SunTrust combination still makes a lot of sense
from an investment standpoint,'' said Michael Ancell, a bank
analyst for Edward Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Their protests about different corporate cultures to the
contrary, he said SunTrust Banks and Wachovia have ``a lot of
similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that both banks coveted the lucrative Virginia market
proves it, said Ancell.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wachovia's problem is that many choice merger
partners have been taken in the big market states of Florida and
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, they will have to review their
acquisition strategy,'' said Robinson-Humphrey analyst John W.
Coffey. ``Wachovia has said it wants to get larger in Virginia, and
now one of its targets is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Interstate/Johnson Lane analyst John B. Moore Jr. said Tennessee
and Alabama are likely states for future Wachovia acquisitions,
with the most choices being in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Birmingham-based) SouthTrust has excellent market penetration
in Georgia, Florida as well as Alabama,'' said Moore.

BO DEREK IS GRACIOUS ABOUT HER ROLE AS TEEN'S MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Brian Gross is older than Kelly Connolly, the
17-year-old surfer/snowboarder he plays in ``Wind on Water,'' one
of NBC's new fall series. But he's obviously not that old.
</P>
<P>
   Gross confessed to TV critics in Pasadena this week that he'd
never heard of Bo Derek, who plays his mom, Ciel Connolly, in the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know who she was,'' Gross said. ``I mean, my
dad and grandpa sure did.''
</P>
<P>
   As the critics roared, Derek, who fueled a fair number of male
fantasies after her appearance in the film ``10'' nearly 20 years
ago, blushed and said, ``Oh, God.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Charles Rosin warned Gross: ``There'll be no
supper for you tonight.'' But Derek graciously said, ``No reason he
should (know).''
</P>
<P>
   In the series, Gross and William Gregory Lee play two brothers
who seek prize money on the extreme-sports circuit to help their
mom save the family's Hawaiian ranch from a slimy entrepreneur
(played be Lee Horsley.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Former ``Saturday Night Live'' player Jon Lovitz will join
``NewsRadio'' in the second episode this fall, following a season
premiere in which the cast pays tribute to one of Lovitz's closest
friends, the late Phil Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   In the first episode, the crew of WNYX will learn that Hartman's
character, news anchor Bill McNeal, has died of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will attend a service,'' NBC Entertainment president
Warren Little-field said, ``and have a chance to celebrate and to
mourn the loss of Bill McNeal and, of course, Phil Hartman.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlefield said he hasn't seen a script for the season opener.
``But,'' he asserted, ``throughout the ages the comedies that deal
with milestones _ be it life, death, marriage _ are comedies that
audiences pay attention to. ... I think that, knowing this group,
it will be entertaining, but it will also be filled with a lot of
the emotions they have over the loss of Phil Hartman.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Angie Harmon, who got what she considers ``44 episodes of
acting lessons'' in two seasons of ``Baywatch Nights,'' will be the
new assistant district attorney on ``Law &AMP; Order.'' Harmon, who
starred last season as an FBI agent on ABC's canceled ``C16,'' is
replacing Carey Lowell, who left ``Law &AMP; Order'' voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Dick Wolf said Harmon will play Abby Carmichael, a
Texas-reared prosecutor with a hard-line attitude toward offenders.
Harmon herself is from Dallas and was a successful model before
venturing into television.
</P>
<P>
   Her addition to the ``Law &AMP; Order'' ensemble is the eighth cast
change in the long-running NBC series, which won an Emmy Award as
best drama last year. Wolf said he thinks fans of the show now look
forward to the occasional disruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look around your own newsrooms and think, `Who was
there five years ago?' there wouldn't be that many familiar
faces,'' Wolf said. ``We try to reflect accurately what happens in
real life. People move on. People get different jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ You might think John Wells, executive producer of ``ER,''
would be sticking pins into a George Clooney doll right about now.
Clooney, after all, will be leaving the nation's top-ranked drama
after its upcoming fifth season.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells sounds more like Clooney's personal publicist, mainly
because the actor has honored the terms of his five-year contract
with the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``George has done the thing that so few people do,'' Wells said
Monday, ``and I am very pleased to call him my friend and to have
been in business with him for the last five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said Clooney, who has managed to make films during
hiatuses from ``ER,'' still has forsaken untold millions more by
staying with the TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ethic is something that has been less and less present
over the last few years,'' Wells said. ``I have nothing but
admiration for the way in which he's handled himself through the
whole process.''

week's attempted car bombing on a crowded street was another
reminder of Middle East volatility. For Israeli grocery store
cashier Shoshana Katsav, it was an echo of her personal
``disaster.'' After a deadly bombing last year, she was in a coma
for three months and hospitalized more than five months. Her family
sat by her side aound the clock in shifts. On Wednesday, Katsav, a
mother of four and grandmother of two, finished her intensive

`SOUTH PARK'S' TREY PARKER AND MATT STONE: A WHOLE NEW BALLGAME

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Trey Parker and Matt Stone in a scene
from ``BASEketball.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    You can't please all the people all the time. But you can please
a lot of people most of the time, if you don't mind grossing out
some of the others nearly all the time.
 &HT;    Which is what ``South Park'' creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone
are doing.
 &HT;    Their methods are anything but sophisticated: Fart jokes. Alien
anal probes. Gleefully vicious attacks on celebrities such as
Kathie Lee Gifford, David Caruso and Sally Struthers. Talking poop.
And, of course, there's Kenny, the little boy who meets a violent
end in virtually every episode of the Comedy Central animated
series.
 &HT;    It may be lowbrow, but it's high-impact. The 2.2 million ``South
Park'' viewers include some of Hollywood's biggest movers and
shakers _ George Clooney is an aficionado _ and have earned the
28-year-old Parker and the 26-year-old Stone a growing reputation
in the business.
 &HT;    Just look at their ``To Do'' list: There's the ``South Park''
album, due this fall. And the feature film, which Paramount will
release next year. Oh, and they've been hired to write the prequel
to ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber'' (1994).
 &HT;    And, of course, ``BASEketball,'' the new David Zucker movie,
opening July 31, which offers the duo their first major acting
roles.
 &HT;    It's ``BASEketball'' that has brought the very busy pair to Los
Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel for an early breakfast. For the record,
Parker is the surfer-dude lookalike with bleached blonde hair,
white baggy pants and a washed-out T-shirt. Stone, in equally baggy
pants and just as washed-out a T-shirt, has a mass of curly brown
hair which he keeps fiddling with as he talks.
 &HT;    The lowbrow pair are cast as two losers who create a hybrid game
that mixes baseball and basketball, only to see it spiral out of
control into a national craze.
 &HT;    ``The actual game is too stupid to try to figure out,'' Stone
sums up, much to the dismay of a Universal Pictures publicist
standing by.
 &HT;    If anyone is afraid that the ``South Park'' pair will go
Hollywood, they needn't worry.
 &HT;    ``You know, that Casey Silver guy, who runs Universal, has
called us for lunch,'' Parker says.
 &HT;    ``We've bailed on him four times,'' Stone adds, laughing.
 &HT;    Their chief commitment is ``South Park,'' both say. The series
has been renewed through the year 2001.
 &HT;    ``The show is king to us,'' Parker says. ``We don't care that
much about having an acting career. We don't care at all about
being stars. We can't let the whole Hollywood trip get in the
way.''
 &HT;    ``The work is the only thing we have,'' Stone agrees. ``The
strange thing is that we got into the business to meet girls.''
 &HT;    And did it work? Parker winces.
 &HT;    ``What we got,'' he says, ``is a lot of pimple-faced boys going,
`We love you, man.'''
 &HT;    ``What a bummer,'' Stone says.
 &HT;    ``South Park'' has endured more than its share of attacks for
its foul language and nasty subject matter _ which, its creators
say, is merely because critics can't grasp the idea of a cartoon
about kids that is nevertheless for adults.
 &HT;    ``It's all ridiculous, because Comedy Central has been clear
about this show from the start,'' Parker says. ``The show is on at
a later hour. The show is for older people.''
 &HT;    ``If kids watch, it's not our problem and it's not our
responsibility,'' Stone adds. ``The airwaves are public. Your TV
set has an on-and-off button.''
 &HT;    The two note that they've walked away from millions of dollars
in product spin-offs. They've authorized only a line of T-shirts,
and even those are available only in adult sizes.
 &HT;    Controversy rocked the show earlier this summer, when a young
boy shot himself after writing a suicide note that mentioned
``South Park.''
 &HT;    Stone grimaces when the subject is raised.
 &HT;    ``What happened is that a young boy did kill himself,'' he says,
``and he wrote a suicide note that was four pages long. He listed
tons of things as influences. He listed `Beavis and Butt-Head.' He
listed Metallica. He listed everything he liked, and one of the
things stuck in the middle was Kenny from `South Park.'''
 &HT;    ``It sickens me to read that I basically shot a kid in the
head,'' Parker adds. ``I'm sorry, but it's ridiculous.
 &HT;    ``Hey, just think of all the millions of kids who watch the show
and haven't shot themselves in the head,'' he says with a smirk.
``This is one kid. I think we're doing OK.''
 &HT;    At the very least, they're in demand. The two had to squeeze
filming of their movie around the requirements of ``South Park.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is that we had to do reshoots a few months ago
for `BASEketball,''' Parker says. ``They had to put on makeup to
match how unhealthy we looked last fall, when we filmed the series
all day and the movie all night. They couldn't even match that
pasty look on our faces.''
 &HT;    It wasn't that long ago that things were even rockier for the
two, however. Both Denver natives, they first met at the University
of Colorado at Boulder, where they decided that they wanted to make
movies.
 &HT;    After graduation, the pair made their way to Los Angeles and
signed with the William Morris Agency, who liked their short film
called ``Cannibal! The Musical.''
 &HT;    Then they waited for the phone to ring. And waited. And waited.
 &HT;    ``It was just like in a movie,'' Stone recalls. ``We were two
guys who came to Hollywood and ended up sleeping in cars and on
people's floors for years. We had to figure stuff out like, `OK, we
have $5. How do we both eat lunch?'''
 &HT;    ``For the rest of the week,'' Parker chimes in.
 &HT;    In December of 1995, Brian Garden, then an executive at Fox
Television, hired them to make a Christmas cartoon he could give to
friends. For a then-princely $1,200, Parker and Stone created ``The
Spirit of Christmas,'' a five-minute short that revolved around
Jesus and Santa kung-fu fighting over the meaning of the holiday.
 &HT;    Garden's holiday greeting soon became one of the hottest items
in Hollywood, passed from hand to hand and quickly assuming
legendary status. Parker and Stone found themselves fielding a
variety of offers for animation work, and ultimately signed with
Comedy Central to do a project they'd tried in vain to sell earlier
_ ``South Park.''
 &HT;    ``We pitched `South Park' to Fox before the Christmas project,
and we were told it would never work,'' Parker says.
 &HT;    ``Famous last words,'' Stone adds, smirking.
 &HT;    As for the future, they recently turned in the script for ``The
South Park Movie'' _ which, Stone promises, ``will take it to the
next level. It's not just one long episode.''
 &HT;    As soon as their ``BASEketball'' promotional responsibilities
have been met, Parker and Stone will be back to work, thinking up
new ways for Kenny to die next season and pondering new celebrities
to harass.
 &HT;    ``We're feeling pretty hateful to Barbra Streisand, who frankly
ruined Aspen when she was dating Don Johnson,'' Parker says with
glee. ``She's ours!''

SAMUEL L. JACKSON: NEGOTIATIONS ARE HEATING UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or

 Includes a color slide of Samuel L. Jackson in a scene from ``The
Negotiator.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It's easy to miss Samuel L. Jackson.
 &HT;    Hidden behind dark sunglasses and a baseball cap, a
salt-and-pepper goatee partially obscuring his face, Jackson sits
unnoticed in the lobby of the Four Seasons hotel in Manhattan. He
just doesn't look like a movie star.
 &HT;    It's that same chameleon quality that serves the actor so well
in his performances, letting him assume a fresh look every time he
takes to the screen.
 &HT;    He went with an Afro for ``Pulp Fiction'' (1994), was unkempt
for ``Jungle Fever'' (1991), wore a Fu Manchu for ``Jackie Brown''
(1997), adopted Don King-esque hair-to-the-heavens for ``The Great
White Hype'' (1996) and was bald as a cue ball for ``Sphere''
(1998), a look he's still sporting.
 &HT;    ``When Laurence Olivier died they did a career retrospective,
and as the voice-over continued you saw Olivier's face morph into
the different characters he played, into all the looks he had,''
Jackson recalls. ``I hadn't been discovered yet, but I sat there
and watched that, and I said, `That's the way it should be.'
 &HT;    ``When I did theater I constantly wore different appliances,
wore sideburns, changed my hair, and it's great to do that on film,
too,'' he says. ``I'm thinking about changing my eyes with contact
lenses for something at some point.
 &HT;    ``Being chameleonlike, I think, is part and parcel of being an
actor,'' he adds. ``It's taking the play-acting we all did as kids
to the farthest level.''
 &HT;    Jackson prefers roles that he hasn't tried before, stories that
place characters in situations he never experienced, so that he can
expose new facets of himself while before the camera.
 &HT;    ``It's easier now because people are approaching me with roles,
with scripts,'' the 49-year-old, Atlanta-born actor says. ``When I
was younger, it was harder because I didn't have choices. I took
the jobs I got, and these jobs only came after auditions. I
couldn't be so picky, back when nobody knew who I was.''
 &HT;    The latest part to fascinate Jackson is Danny Roman, a newlywed
hostage negotiator who's the key figure in the July 31 release,
``The Negotiator.'' Framed for a murder he didn't commit, Roman
takes several hostages in police headquarters, then demands that an
outside negotiator (Kevin Spacey) be brought in.
 &HT;    ``Roman is an interesting guy with an interesting profession,''
Jackson says. ``He's a negotiator, which means he has to be a
talker. In the movie, he talks up to a point, then decides to go
inside, to put himself in jeopardy to resolve situations.
 &HT;    ``That's something I used to do, but don't anymore,'' Jackson
says. ``Back when I was young, I constantly put myself in
situations that were dangerous, and Roman does that as part of his
job.''
 &HT;    Another plus: The role wasn't specifically black _ it could just
as well have gone to a white actor, but it was offered to him.
 &HT;    ``I was thrilled,'' he says. ``It doesn't matter. `The
Negotiator' is about a guy in a situation. Black? White? Purple?
Who cares?
 &HT;    ``You want to know how little race mattered?'' he adds. ``This
film was originally supposed to be a Sylvester Stallone vehicle.
Stallone was attached to play the Roman role, and I was reading the
role Kevin does. And now look at the film.''
 &HT;    One other aspect of the role caught Jackson's eye: Roman's fear
of his entire life being taken from him. That sense of risk was
something the actor could identify with, because in the early 1980s
he nearly lost it all _ his wife LaTanya, their daughter Zoe and
his fledgling career _ to a swirl of drugs and booze.
 &HT;    ``I don't give my past too much thought,'' he says. ``I wake up
every day and say a little prayer that I won't use drugs, then I go
about my business and don't dwell on it. I've been clean for almost
10 years.
 &HT;    ``I can't go to a party and fall into the `Well Syndrome,''' he
adds, ``where I'd say, `Hey, I'm doing OK, I think I'll have a
drink.' I can't do that.
 &HT;    ``As long as I understand that, I'll be OK, and I think I'll
always understand that.''
 &HT;    Jackson glances at his glass of lemonade, then takes a sip.
 &HT;    ``I'm very superstitious,'' he says. ``As soon as I gave up the
drugs and booze, my career stared to happen for me. I figure that
the second I start doing anything stupid again, this will all go
away. I'd find a way to make it go away, because that's how
destructive my nature was.
 &HT;    ``I like this,'' he says, motioning to his opulent surroundings
in a gesture that seems to encompass his whole life at the moment,
``and I don't want to relive the past.''
 &HT;    Of course, fame requires some getting used to. Jackson recalls
heading into a donut shop with his daughter not long ago and having
to spend 10 minutes signing autographs before he could leave.
 &HT;    ``It's a pain, but it's OK,'' he says. ``I like people, but the
timing isn't always so great. Those were moments I wanted to spend
with Zoe.''
 &HT;    More typical, however, was his experience on a recent subway
ride in New York.
 &HT;    ``I was on a car and saw somebody I knew, so I chatted with this
friend until I got where I was headed,'' he says. ``People saw me,
and I could tell they were thinking, `That looks like Sam Jackson _
but he'd be in a limo, not a subway car.'
 &HT;    ``I walk the streets alone,'' he adds, ``I don't have
bodyguards. I have most of the same friends I had when I got
started.''
 &HT;    In fact, the actor says, in most respects he is the same as he
was before he hit it big.
 &HT;    ``I'm 90 percent the same guy,'' he says. ``There's 10 percent
that's changed a lot. I'm clean now. I do have a higher profile,
and there are advantages to being `famous.'
 &HT;    ``If I want to wear something nice for a talk show, I can make a
phone call and get nice designer clothes,'' he says with a laugh.
``I can afford to get great tickets for a Lakers game at the last
minute.
 &HT;    ``I try not to let it all get to my head, to let it throw me
off,'' he adds. ``I still make the bed, still take out the garbage,
and I drove carpool until my daughter got old enough to drive
herself.
 &HT;    ``I'm pretty normal.''
 &HT;    Jackson will next be seen in ``The Red Violin,'' a drama that
follows a violin as it passes from owner to owner over several
centuries. After that, he'll make a cameo appearance in the
top-secret ``Star Wars'' prequel, due in theaters in May 1999.
 &HT;    In August, Jackson will begin filming ``Deep Blue Sea,'' which
will reunite him with Renny Harlin, who directed him in ``The Long
Kiss Goodnight'' (1996). It's an action-packed drama that pits
scientists against genetically enhanced sharks _ Jackson jokingly
calls it ``Jurassic Shark.''
 &HT;    When not acting, Jackson relaxes at home with his family and
golfs at every opportunity. He also pores over scripts and novels
as he seeks projects to star in and/or produce, as he did with the
acclaimed drama, ``Eve's Bayou'' (1997).
 &HT;    Has he got anything special in mind?
 &HT;    ``I'd love to do a really good slasher movie,'' he says, smiling
broadly. ``I want to do one that's really about something, and it
just happens to have all this gore in it.''

NATASHA RICHARDSON: ESCAPING THE STARDOM TRAP

 Includes a color slide of Natasha Richardson with Dennis Quaid and
two versions of Lindsay Lohan in a scene from ``The Parent Trap.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    All things old are new again, or so it seems for Natasha
Richardson.
 &HT;    She scored a 1998 Tony as the sexy, self-destructive nightclub
chanteuse Sally Bowles in the raunchy Broadway revival of
``Cabaret,'' and on July 29 she'll be seen as a fashion-designer
mom in a family-friendly remake of the classic 1961 film, ``The
Parent Trap.''
 &HT;    If the two roles seem contradictory, that's intentional.
 &HT;    ``The great joy of acting is going into radically different
minds and hearts,'' she says. ``It was great to do `Parent Trap,'
which is pure fantasy where everything looks good and there's a
happy ending, and then to enter the world of Sally Bowles, which is
full of decadence and debauchery and, ultimately, leads her to an
end which is very sad.
 &HT;    ``Ironically,'' Richardson continues, ``I felt more of a
connection with Sally, even though we're worlds apart, than I did
with Elizabeth James, the mother I play in `Parent Trap.' But I
understood them both.''
 &HT;    In the updated ``Parent Trap,'' Richardson plays a single mom
who has kept one of her identical-twin daughters after divorcing
her husband (Dennis Quaid). Young actress Lindsay Lohan plays both
twins, with a little help from state-of-the-art special effects.
 &HT;    Richardson cheerfully confesses that she never saw the original
film, which starred Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara, with Hayley
Mills as the twins.
 &HT;    ``I grew up in England,'' she says, ``and `The Parent Trap'
wasn't popular with kids my age like `Mary Poppins' (1964) or `The
Sound of Music' (1965). I did watch it before we started filming,
and I thought it was quite delightful, although very different from
what we've done.''
 &HT;    The film's divorce theme was one she understood, however.
Richardson's parents _ legendary actress Vanessa Redgrave and the
late director Tony Richardson _ broke up when she was a child.
 &HT;    ``I was quite young,'' she recalls. ``Luckily, they always
remained great friends, so I didn't go though a lot of conflict
about it. But I used to fantasize about ways to get them back
together, just like Annie and Hallie do in `The Parent Trap.'''
 &HT;    As many children of divorced parents do, Richardson went on to a
divorce of her own, from London theatrical producer Robert Fox.
 &HT;    ``It felt terribly sad,'' she says, ``but it didn't feel like a
failure. We had such a good time all the years we were together.
But when you love someone and you know you can't be married to them
anymore, it's very sad.''
 &HT;    Richardson, who grew up on her parents' movie sets, took a
special interest in the young Lohan.
 &HT;    ``I worried about her, because I know how it can all go to your
head,'' she says. ``It's not easy for an adult to adapt to being
treated like the Queen of Sheba, with everyone catering to your
every need, much less a child.
 &HT;    ``I guess I sort of became Lindsay's surrogate mom,'' she
continues with a smile. ``I'd say to her, `What do you mean, you
went to a mall and saw a movie last night? You should have been in
bed by 10. You mustn't go out, darling.'
 &HT;    ``I think she thought I was sort of trying to rain on her
parade,'' Richardson adds, ``and I guess I was. But it was only out
of concern for her. Acting professionally is not something I would
allow my children to do, and my parents wouldn't allow me to do
when I was a kid.''
 &HT;    The controversial Redgrave wasn't a typical mother, Richardson
adds, but that isn't necessarily a drawback.
 &HT;    ``My mother raised me,'' she says, ``and there were some painful
and difficult times, because she was pursuing a career and also
very actively involved in expressing her political views.
 &HT;    ``But, looking back, I wouldn't switch her for a normal mom,''
the actress says, ``even though there were moments when I'd come
back from school and wish she'd just be there in a gingham dress
putting dinner on the table. I never had that. But now I'm really
glad I have her.''
 &HT;    Her father, whom she tearfully thanked in her Tony acceptance
speech, was also a considerable influence on her life and work.
 &HT;    ``He was a remarkable man, and also my harshest critic,'' she
recalls. ``He saw my first performance, in `A Midsummer Night's
Dream,' and he was incredibly tough on me. I was devastated. I kept
thinking, `Why would my father hurt me like this?' But then I
realized he was so right in everything he'd said.
 &HT;    ``Then he saw me in something else a year later,'' the actress
adds, ``and he was just over the moon. I thought, `God, I guess I'm
getting better after all.'''
 &HT;    Currently the most important man in Richardson's life is her
husband and the father of her two sons, Academy Award-winning actor
Liam Neeson.
 &HT;    ``I didn't imagine that Liam and I would ever be together
forever,'' she says, recalling their first meeting as co-stars in a
1992 Broadway production of Eugene O'Neill's ``Anna Christie.''
 &HT;    ``I had a huge crush on him, and I still do,'' she says, ``but I
never saw myself being with him, because we're such opposites.
 &HT;    ``Liam is kind of a loner and I'm more of a family-and-friends
kind of person,'' she explains. ``But what we have in common is
that we take our work very seriously, we take all the celebrity
business with a large grain of salt and we love each other.''
 &HT;    Asked if she feels a little jealous when watching her handsome
husband make love to another woman on the stage or screen,
Richardson giggles.
 &HT;    ``I think it bothers me more to see him with somebody than it
does Liam when I'm up there in a guy's arms,'' she says. ``I'm
like, `Mmmm, that kiss you had looked a bit good.' And, of course,
Liam has all these female fans. I know they have good taste,
because I have a crush on him and everybody else does too.
 &HT;    ``All of it is make-believe,'' she says more seriously, ``but it
takes some getting used to. My nanny took one of our boys to The
Disney Store the other day. The trailer for `The Parent Trap' was
on a video screen, and I was kissing Dennis Quaid. She said, `Oh
look, there's your mom.'
 &HT;    ``And my son said, `I don't want her to hold that other man.'
Now I've got to help him understand that it's just pretend.''
 &HT;    While Richardson can still get a little giddy about her Tony and
the adulation it has brought her, she's staying focused on what's
most important in her career.
 &HT;    ``It sounds boring, but what I really get a kick out of is the
work itself,'' she says. ``I think of the sports analogy: It's like
serving an ace or doing three triple lutzes in a row _ that's the
kind of rush you get when an audience responds to you.''
 &HT;    When in doubt, she says, she remembers some advice from her
mother.
 &HT;    ``She said you have to find something that's very particular to
you,'' Richardson says. ``Find what's special about you and not
anybody else.
 &HT;    ``After I had the children and I had sort of been just Liam's
wife for a while, I was scared of going back to work,'' the actress
recalls. ``I kept wondering, `Am I going to be able to be me again?
Is it too late? I'm not on the hot-young-thing list anymore.'
 &HT;    ``Then I thought, `No, if that's the dream you chase, you're
finished,''' Richardson says. ``I just want to do what I really
care about passionately and believe in. Then I'll be me.''

SEATTLE DOCTOR'S FILM ON DEALING WITH DEATH HAS REWARDING
`P.O.V.' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Maren Monsen had been working in the emergency room just a
few weeks when she first had to pronounce someone dead. The
training manual instructed her to check the patient's breathing and
pulse, but it was silent on matters of her own heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I had ever been alone in a room with
someone who was dead,'' she later reflected. ``In emergency
medicine we're taught to intervene and be in control. . . . For
doctors, death means failure.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, the young physician/filmmaker, who hails from Seattle,
came to question the assumption that life must be sustained at all
cost. After seeing patients linger in high-tech misery, she began
to wonder: At what point does life become a fate worse than death?
</P>
<P>
   Monsen takes viewers along on a personal odyssey in her film,
``The Vanishing Line,'' an hourlong film that is part of public
television's annual summer P.O.V. series, an award-winning showcase
for independent non-fiction films with a distinct point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Monsen isn't the first person to suggest that ``extraordinary
measures'' can lead to extraordinary misery, and her personal,
contemplative film won't settle the debate over when to pull the
plug. But it should inspire introspection and discussion among
viewers who someday will face these same choices.
</P>
<P>
   Monsen hopes it also inspires doctors to remain engaged with
dying patients, instead of fleeing with the helpless disclaimer,
``There's nothing more I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that this film can help people change the way they
think about death, because it certainly did for me,'' Monsen said
in a phone interview from Stanford University, where she is a
senior research fellow at the Center for Biomedical Ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Monsen, 35, grew up on Seattle's Capitol Hill and attended
Lakeside School before completing her undergraduate degree in art
history at Stanford University. She later graduated from the
University of Washington School of Medicine, taking time out to
study filmmaking in New York and at the London International Film
School.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Jeff Grainger, is chief patent attorney for a
company that has pioneered tools for minimally invasive heart
surgery. He also plays dobro on the film's soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents, Elaine and R. Joseph Monsen, are prominent in
academic and art circles in Seattle. Her mother, a UW nutritionist,
and her father, who is retired from the UW business school, are
eminent art collectors who (with financial help from Boeing)
donated the core of an internationally renowned photographic
collection to the Henry Art Gallery last year.
</P>
<P>
   Maren Monsen, long torn between her interests in science and in
art, was still a medical student when she made her first film,
``Where the Highway Ends: Rural Healthcare in Crisis,'' which won a
regional Emmy.
</P>
<P>
   Now doing hospice work at Palo Alto Veterans Hospital, Monsen is
making another film on end-of-life issues, focusing on faith,
culture and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Vanishing Line,'' it's aimed partly at medical
schools, which she believes should give doctors more guidance on
how to help dying patients.
</P>
<P>
   Monsen worked on ``The Vanishing Line'' for four years, putting
it aside periodically in hopes of delving deeper into
meaning-of-life issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to die,'' Monsen said. ``I would rather not
see it as an on-off switch.''
</P>
<P>
   In an extended visual metaphor, ``The Vanishing Line'' suggests
our lives are ruled not by high-tech equipment but by the three
Fates of Greek mythology. The first Fate spins the thread of life,
the second measures its length and the third Fate severs the
thread. The Fates reappear throughout the film, hovering in the
shadows as if to suggest that our sense of control is only an
illusion.
</P>
<P>
   The effect can be somewhat self-conscious, especially when the
Fates in their diaphanous gowns stride through a construction site
in slow motion, wearing hard hats. But they serve to remind us of
the limits of human intervention, and they lend the film a
dreamlike, philosphical quali-
</P>
<P>
   ty.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film revolves around a hospice social worker named
Jim Brigham, whose wife died from multiple sclerosis after a long
and disheartening encounter with the ``medical machine'' _ his term
for the impersonal protocols that consume the lives of seriously
ill patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Monsen accompanies him on his hospice rounds and watches as
Brigham _ kind but unflinching _ discusses legal and financial
issues with a young man dying of Lou Gehrig's disease and comforts
a frightened old man who knows the end is near.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who were in this film talked about how it was their
gift to the world,'' Monsen said later. ``They had a strong feeling
about providing a legacy of their life.''
</P>
<P>
   Monsen is clearly an outsider in these bedside scenes, ill at
ease with her sense of helplessness and too young and radiant with
health to instinctively sense what impending death feels like.
</P>
<P>
   She knows, however, that there are worse outcomes than death. In
a scene that is difficult to watch, we meet a little boy who
suffered severe brain damage when he nearly drowned in a swimming
pool five years ago. He was resuscitated 40 minutes after being
declared dead on arrival at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He now lies staring in bed, his face a hideous, open-mouthed
mask as his father, eerily reconciled to the situation, changes the
child's feeding tube. As the father comments that the boy is
``doing pretty good,'' our instinct is to recoil in horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had helped prolong this boy's life, indefinitely,'' Monsen
muses in a voiceover. ``If we hadn't, he might have been able to
slip away. Now his death would be hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Brigham, who has faced the agonizing choices that can shape
life's end, is an eloquent spokesman for the art of dying. Calm and
at peace, he describes his wife's death not only as a release but
as a profound spiritual experience. Monsen says his story showed
her that death can be ``a sacred and beautiful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearing his story and watching how he interacts with patients
had a big effect on me,'' Monsen said. ``I'd really like to have
medical students and residents taught that there's a tremendous
amount you can do for patients when they're dying, even if you
can't cure them.''
</P>
<P>
   For a broader perspective on the issues raised in the film,
viewers can participate in an electronic forum, along with
preselected medical professionals and ordinary people, starting at
noon Tuesday. The forum, which will continue through fall, is on
the Web at:

 Includes a color slide of Bob Newhart with Judd Hirsch in a scene
from ``George and Leo.'' 
 By CHRISTOPHER LOUDON  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He makes it look so easy, generating big laughs while deftly
avoiding the celebrity spotlight. Maybe that's why Bob Newhart
remains the unsung hero of American comedy.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he's somehow managed to star in five different
television series, including two of its most successful and
innovative sitcoms, while winning only a single Emmy Award _ and
that way back in 1961 for his critically acclaimed, but
short-lived, debut comedy/variety show.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, the 68-year-old comedian has finally been
getting his due. In June, it was announced that a Newhart star will
be added to Hollywood's Walk of Fame. That same week, Newhart was
honored with a lifetime-achievement award at the Banff Television
Festival, one of the world's foremost gatherings of industry movers
and shakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm highly honored by this,'' Newhart began his acceptance
speech, ``but I'm not sure you've got the right person.''
</P>
<P>
   It was vintage Newhart _ funny but also self-deprecating,
perfectly capturing the low-key ``just plain Bob'' spirit befitting
a comedian who actually began his career as an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite a degree in business management from Loyola
University in Chicago, Newhart confesses that he wasn't a
particularly good accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always figured that if you came within six or seven bucks of
it, you were going to be OK,'' he jokes.
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate the tedium of work, Newhart would telephone a
friend, copywriter Ed Gallagher, and improvise comic conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in my office would overhear me saying things to him
like, `So you say your office building is filling with soap bubbles
and they're up to the third floor?'' Newhart recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone bits evolved into a nightclub act, but Gallagher
soon tired of show business. Newhart persevered, reformatting their
telephone routines into one-sided conversations and repackaging
himself as a solo act.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, a Chicago disk jockey got hold of a
handful of Newhart's tapes. Impressed with such now-classic bits as
``The Submarine Commander'' and ``The Driving Instructor,'' he
arranged a meeting between Newhart and Warner Bros. Records talent
scout George Avakian.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a Warner contract and, in April 1960, the release of
a live album, the seminal ``The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart.''
It became the first comedy LP to reach No. 1 on the Billboard
charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think it was generational,'' Newhart says. ``I think
it was the college kids who made us. Nightclubs were expensive, and
a lot of the comedy was `Take my wife, please' and mother-in-law
jokes. College kids didn't have any money, and they didn't have
mothers-in-law. The material was irrelevant to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an obvious hole, and it was our turn to fill it,''
he adds. ``It was our natural way of finding the humor in
situations through vignettes rather than jokes. So college kids
would get pizza and beer and sit around in the frat house or
wherever and play comedy records. We were their nightclub.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1964, three more albums had gone gold, and Newhart ranked
among the most sought-after performers on the nightclub and
variety-show circuits. Yet, after his variety show had failed,
Newhart resisted lucrative offers to make a second stab at a
network series.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1972 that Newhart returned to series television,
but when he did he made a splash. As sane and sensible Chicago
psychologist Bob Hartley, the comedian sent ``The Bob Newhart
Show'' zooming into the top 20. It remained a ratings winner for
the next six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive was Newhart's return engagement on CBS. In
1989, after a four-year television hiatus, Newhart returned to the
CBS lineup and did the near impossible: He followed up an enormous
hit with an ever bigger one _ ``Newhart,'' in which he played
self-help-author-turned-Vermont-innkeeper Dick Loudon.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to wrap ``Newhart'' after eight successful
seasons, it was Newhart's wife, Ginny, who suggested the perfect
capper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember we were at a Christmas party,'' he recalls, ``and
she said to me, `If this is your last season, you really ought to
do a dream sequence. You ought to wake up in bed with Emily and
explain this dream you've had about running an inn in New England.'
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last day of shooting, we hid Suzie two sound stages
away,'' he recalls. ``And when the audience saw the set, they just
went crazy. They didn't even have to see Suzie, just the old `Bob
Newhart Show' bedroom set.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years after its original broadcast, Ginny Newhart's
inspired suggestion continues to rank as perhaps the most memorable
of all sitcom finales.
</P>
<P>
   Far less memorable was Newhart's subsequent return to CBS, in
1992, as acerbic cartoonist Bob McKay in the ratings-challenged
``Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to do a Bob Newhart that America had never seen
before,'' Newhart says, ``and America loudly responded, `We don't
want to see a Bob Newhart we've never seen before.'''
</P>
<P>
   This past season brought Newhart back in a more characteristic
role, as straight-arrow bookseller George Stoodie, trading quips
with fellow sitcom stalwart Judd Hirsch on ``George and Leo.'' The
show drew critical praise and respectable ratings, but nevertheless
CBS axed it in May.
</P>
<P>
   Though disappointed with what he says was a half-cancellation _
``I wouldn't go along with the conditions they wanted to impose on
the show for a second year'' _ Newhart remains philosophical about
it and supportive of the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the dollars are so big that the advertisers panic,''
he says. ``And then their panic is translated to the network brass
and they say `Find something else!' But I have no quarrel with
them. I can't fault CBS, because they did everything they said they
were going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he insists that he'll never again be lured back to a
weekly series. Instead, he intends to stay focused on his comedy
roots, performing 30 or 40 nights of solo stand-up per year,
blending new material with his classic telephone routines.
</P>
<P>
   And, no, don't look for updating in terms of his style. Expect
it to be quiet, polite and utterly free of blue language or
suggestive innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up Catholic has something to do with it,'' he says.
``I'd feel very uncomfortable if I did a show that resorted to what
I consider shock stuff. There's a certain feeling you get at the
end of the show when it's gone well and the audience has enjoyed it
and you did it clean. It's just a little bit harder to do.''
</P>
<P>
   An irony is that one of the comedians most credited with
popularizing profanity-laden comedy is himself a big Newhart fan.
</P>
<P>
   His most treasured moment of peer recognition came several years
ago, Newhart says. He was flipping through Variety and noticed that
his own favorite comedian, Richard Pryor, would shortly be inducted
into the Comedy Hall of Fame:
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the show's producer, George Schlatter, and said, `Can
I present the award? I'd like to do it, because I admire his talent
so much,''' Newhart recalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard was in the wheelchair at that time _ still is _ and so
I was on stage,'' the comedian continues. ``I did the salute to
Richard and then walked over to where he was and handed him the
award. He looked up at me and said, `I stole your album.'
</P>
<P>
   ```What?' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ```I stole your album. I was in a record store in Peoria, Ill.,
and I stole your album.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `Hey, Richard, I got a 25-cent commission on
that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And he turned to the people standing around him and asked,
`Anybody here got a quarter?'''

   NEW YORK _ The Vanguard Group moves markets.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at its recent introduction of two index funds that
specialize in small-cap stocks. On May 21, when Vanguard began
funneling $137 million into the stocks that make up the Standard &AMP;
Poor's Small Cap 600 index, the index surged higher, even as every
other major stock index declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we began investing that money, we were trading all day,''
said George Sauter, a Vanguard managing director who oversees the
company's $115 billion of stock index funds. ``I think we had a bit
of an impact on small-cap stocks that day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a startling admission from a company that has long denied
that its popular index funds affect the market benchmarks that they
track.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that Vanguard could push prices higher is that
small-cap stocks tend to be less liquid than larger stocks _ that
is, they have fewer owners and their shares trade less frequently,
making their prices more volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Vanguard moves big-stock indexes, like the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500, when it places big buy or sell orders, remains a
subject of debate.
</P>
<P>
   Sauter adheres to the longtime Vanguard stance and says no.
Among large-cap stocks, he said in a recent interview, ``our effect
on the market is more one of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   But other market analysts say Vanguard definitely pushes around
the S&AMP;P 500 and other large-cap indexes. ``You see it very often
near the end of the day when they come in and buy 400 to 500 stocks
in one fell swoop,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi
Associates, a Connecticut market analysis company.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is important because indexing has become the primary
growth vehicle of the mutual-fund industry, helping to fuel the
rise in big stocks. A reversal of that trend would presumably
contribute to the market's decline as well.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, barely one in 10 mutual funds that
invest in a broad array of U.S. stocks has been able to keep pace
with the S&AMP;P 500 index. Not surprisingly, ever greater numbers of
Americans are choosing to buy funds that mimic the index, rather
than try to beat it.
</P>
<P>
   In the first five months of this year, 18 percent of the $107
billion of net cash flows into equity mutual funds went to index
funds, according to Strategic Insight, a New York mutual-fund
research and consulting company. That is up from 14 percent early
last year and 11 percent in the comparable period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   No one is bigger in the index-fund business than Vanguard, whose
S&AMP;P 500 fund is nearly five times the size of its nearest
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds have become popular even in sectors in which smart
portfolio managers seem to have an advantage over the indexes. In
small-capitalization stocks, for example, information is not as
widely disseminated on strategies and progress, presumably making
it easier for a diligent money manager to stay ahead of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Sauter's admission that Vanguard affected small-cap stock prices
is borne out by the performance of the indexes in the days before
and after May 21.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, Vanguard began investing the money it had taken in
during a four-week subscription period for three new funds: the
Small Capitalization Value Stock Portfolio, which had collected $80
million in assets; the Small Capitalization Growth Stock Portfolio,
which had collected $57 million, and the Mid Capitalization Stock
Portfolio, which had gathered $94 million.
</P>
<P>
   The two small-cap funds were designed to track subsets of the
S&AMP;P Small Cap 600 index: the S&AMP;P Small-Cap 600/BARRA Value index,
composed of companies whose stock prices are low in relation to
their net worth, or book value, and the S&AMP;P Small-Cap 600/BARRA
Growth index, which contains small companies with high
price-to-book ratios.
</P>
<P>
   On 10 of the 13 days before May 21, and on each of the three
following days, the S&AMP;P Small Cap index moved in the same direction
as the other major small- and large-cap stock indexes _ the Russell
2000 index, the Nasdaq composite, the S&AMP;P 500 and the Dow Jones
industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   But only on Thursday, May 21, did the S&AMP;P Small Cap index zig
while the others zagged. That day, the small-cap average rose about
0.2 percent, while each of the other four indexes fell by
one-quarter to 0.6 percent. At the same time, the S&AMP;P Midcap 400
index, tracked by the other Vanguard index fund introduced that
day, fell just 0.1 percent, less than half the decline suffered by
the other indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Sauter drew a sharp distinction between
this activity and the company's purchase of large-cap stocks that
match the S&AMP;P 500, among other benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we might do is push all of the prices up to the `offer'
side of the market if we are buying a big basket of stocks, which
to me is not moving the market,'' Sauter said. The ``offer'' price,
also known as the ``ask'' price, is the higher of two prices at
which interested traders say they will buy or sell stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the cash flowing into Vanguard
often comes in waves, rather than even distributions from day to
day. ``Mondays are usually a heavy cash-flow day,'' he said. And
tax season, ``the first three and a half months of the year, no
question, is our biggest time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   When those big waves of cash flow in or out, Sauter says,
Vanguard spreads its buying or selling throughout the day, rather
than waiting until the end of a session.
</P>
<P>
   If the company did move markets drastically, ``it would be easy
for us to game that effect,'' he said. ``If we feel very strongly
that we were going to move the market at the end of the day, we
would want to buy before the end of the day, because we could buy
at the lower price.''
</P>
<P>
   Birinyi's data, however, show more than a dozen instances in the
first half of this year where late-day buying of the S&AMP;P 500 stocks
caused an upward acceleration or reversal of the day's trend. Many
of those instances point to Vanguard's presence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The buying of all or nearly all of the stocks in the index, in
relatively small orders of a few thousand shares each, indicates
the presence of an index fund rather than an institution trying to
arbitrage between the index and a futures contract, Birinyi said.
Other than an index-fund manager, he said, ``there are not a lot of
portfolio managers who would go out and buy 400 stocks at a time.''

   In a deal that expands New England's fourth-largest bank and
gives a Massachusetts player a larger presence, Peoples Heritage
Financial Group, Inc. of Portland, Maine, said Monday it had agreed
to acquire SIS Bancorp, Inc. of Springfield, Mass., for $428
million.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, which must be approved by regulators, would
create a super-community bank with $12 billion in assets and
branches in Maine, New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the second for Peoples Heritage, which has
successfully sought to blend community-style banking with the
sophisticated investment services and products offered by larger
banks. The company acquired CFX Corp. of Keene, N.H., for $627
million in April, six months after buying Morse, Payson &AMP; Noyes
Insurance, Maine's largest insurance broker.
</P>
<P>
   The deals reflect a consolidating financial services industry,
which is making some super-community banks strong competitors to
their bigger brethren as well as tomorrow's merger candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peoples Heritage will continue to expand, which will make them
a very interesting takeover target in the next five years,'' said
analyst Chad P. Yonker of Fox-Pitt, Kelton, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under Monday's agreement, Peoples Heritage will meld $9.8
billion in assets at three subsidiaries _ Peoples Heritage Bank in
Maine, Bank of New Hampshire and Family Bank in Massachusetts _
with SIS's $1.8 billion in assets, held in Springfield Institution
for Savings and in The Glastonbury Bank &AMP; Trust Co. People's
Heritage, with 194 branches, has the top market share in Maine and
New Hampshire. The acquisition of SIS, which dominates in western
Massachusetts, will give Peoples Heritage 56 branches in
Massachusetts, and eight offices in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, expected to be finalized later this year, gives
Peoples Heritage a bigger toehold in Massachusetts and its first
presence in Connecticut. Both SIS and Glastonbury will continue to
operate under their own names.
</P>
<P>
   The stock-and-cash deal represented a 27 percent premium to
SIS's closing stock price last Friday, the last day of trade before
the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to grow as planned, contiguous to our existing
franchise, through the acquisition of another strong community
bank,'' said William J. Ryan, president and chief executive officer
of People's Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Peoples Heritage, already the region's fourth-largest bank in
terms of assets before Monday's acquisition, still ranks behind
Fleet Financial Group, Inc., BankBoston Corp., and Citizens
Financial Group, Inc., after Monday's deal.
</P>
<P>
   SIS soared 7 5/8 to close at 52 5/8 in over-the-counter trading.
Peoples Heritage shed 1 1/8, also in Nasdaq trading, to end the day
at 24 5/16.

IMMIGRANTS RUSH TO BEAT FEE HIKE

   PHOENIX - They line up, scores of them, starting at the crack of
dawn. Immigrants braving the heat outside the Immigration and
Naturalization Service office in Phoenix, inching their way toward
U.S. citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the wait is lengthier, the lines snake longer _ a
mix of frustrated people checking on where they stand in the
naturalization process and eager folks turning in their
applications before an anticipated whopping fee increase takes
effect later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Folks such as Blanca Medrano, 32, who moved to the United States
from Mexico 11 years ago. Medrano stood in line one recent day
beginning at 5 a.m., anxious to get her application process
started.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of others join her in line, enduring triple-digit
temperatures at the INS main office, where misters provide the only
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Medrano and the others know that postponing the effort could be
costly. INS officials anticipate the application fee will more than
double, from $95 to $225, by December.
</P>
<P>
   ``This money,'' Medrano noted, ``is too much for an immigrant's
income.''
</P>
<P>
   The application fee is just a part of the overall cost of
citizenship. Candidates also have to pay about $30 for fingerprints
and photographs and another $30 for the citizenship test on
American history and government. In addition, many people pay to
learn English.
</P>
<P>
   Many immigrants spend much more on consulting attorneys or
having them fill out the application. The Immigration Outreach
Center offers a $385 package of services, including how to answer
INS questions at citizenship interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Even immigrants fluent in English often seek legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people prefer to consult an attorney when filling out a
form because the rules keep changing all the time, not
fundamentally but subtly,'' said Danny Siciliano, Immigration
Outreach Center's executive director. ``It's not necessarily logic
that dictates at the INS.''
</P>
<P>
   INS officials in Phoenix say that money raised from the higher
fee might allow the local office to hire more workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to bring on board retired INS officers for one-year
terms, but we don't know how many exactly and how soon,'' said
Russell Ahr, special assistant to the district director of the
Phoenix INS.
</P>
<P>
   It's no guarantee, however, that the process will speed up. For
one thing, some of the revenue goes toward political asylum and
refugee programs, said an INS spokesman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   INS offices across the country inarguably could use more
workers, and Phoenix even more so. The local office faces a backlog
of 26,000 citizenship applications and has only 12 full-time and
three part-time employees to process them _ as well as more than 20
other types of applications.
</P>
<P>
   To relieve the backlog, Phoenix INS officials send half their
files to a processing center in Laguna Niguel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   New York, by comparison, has about 300,000 cases to process but
boasts 237 workers, meaning each worker has a caseload of about
1,265. Each Phoenix worker has a caseload of about 1,733.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting logjam taxes INS workers and the people they
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Shashi Patel, who applied for citizenship two years ago, stood
in line from 5:30 a.m. on a recent morning to ask, for the second
time, about his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here six months ago to ask them what was happening with
my application. They told me it was being processed and promised to
call me the next day to tell me when to come for an interview. But
it never happened,'' Patel complained.
</P>
<P>
   Zdzislaw Kubica, an immigrant from Poland, has been waiting for
more than three years. He hasn't heard back from the INS either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm furious,'' he said. ``I'll wait another couple of months
and will write to our congressman.'' &QL;

JOHNSON STUCK TO THE PLAN AND EXCELLED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ To most, the enduring image of Michael
Johnson's career is and will forever be his look of pure
astonishment as he realized he had just covered 200 meters of
Centennial Olympic Stadium track in an impossible 19.32 seconds.
The moment in which a sprinter rejoices over obliterating a world
record _ even his own _ by more than three-tenths of a second is
inevitably the moment by which he will be remembered, and the fact
that it capped off his pursuit of double gold at 200 and 400 made
it all the more spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   But to Johnson himself, the key to that brilliant moment was
meticulous plotting and painstaking consistency. This is a man who
likes to, needs to, plan. The kind of man who lays his clothes out
not just the night before, but the night before that. For a man
like that, the drain of recurring injury the past two years has
been more than physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to deal with emotionally not knowing when
I'm going out there to train whether I'm going to get injured or
not,'' said Johnson, confident he's finally healthy again and here
to run the 400 Tuesday night at the Goodwill Games. ``I'm not a
day-to-day type guy. I know exactly what I'm going to be doing two
weeks, three weeks down the road as far as training. I think that's
a big part of why I've been consistent in my running.''
</P>
<P>
   To say the least. Johnson, who has been coached by Clyde Hart
since his collegiate career at Baylor, has been ranked No. 1 in the
world at 200 meters five times; at 400 meters, seven. Between
February of 1989 and June of 1997, he never lost at 400 meters, a
string of 58 consecutive wins.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the 30-year-old Johnson, the only thing that's
been consistent since he made history in Atlanta is setback.
Starting with the twinge he felt in the last few meters of the 200
that kept him off the 4x400 relay team and a chance at a third gold
medal, proceeding through the ballyhooed fastest-man match against
Donovan Bailey that ended with the thud of a torn quadricep,
carrying into this season of hamstring and Achilles problems,
Johnson has struggled against his body more often than he has
rejoiced in it.
</P>
<P>
   The betrayal may have stemmed from a hip misalignment that, in
hindsight, first surfaced after the semifinal of the 200 meters in
Atlanta. A resulting imbalance in his stride, said Hart, almost
certainly accounts for his other various injuries, and was finally
noticed last summer at the World Championships in Athens. Although
Johnson heroically won the final, he struggled through the heats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stood behind him, his left leg was just streaming out,''
said Hart. ``That one leg just had no control.'' When they got back
to the States, tests revealed the left leg had 1/3 less strength
and reaction time than the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like running on a flat tire,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson cherishes the memory of that World Championship victory
above most of his many others. ``That was one of the few races of a
championship caliber that I've gone into and had the feeling, `Hey,
I could do my best today and not win the race.' It took a lot of
desire, a lot of will. It wasn't strictly off talent and hard work
that day.''
</P>
<P>
   But soon after, the buzz began to take hold. Johnson is getting
old. The slide has begun. It's not so easy anymore, huh Michael?
</P>
<P>
   The sprinter says he understands that he'd stepped up to the
plate and hit a grand slam so often that everyone had come to
expect it; that, indeed, their standards were no higher than his
own. ``It's just difficult to deal with,'' he explained, ``when
people start thinking that it's easy, because it's not easy. It's
my objective to win, and sometimes it takes something spectacular
in order to just win.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning, he said, is his only objective here. After finishing
third in what could have been a dishearteningly slow 44:58 on July
9 in Oslo, Johnson traveled to Rome in a bid to turn around his
season and silence the skeptics. He believes he accomplished the
first task with a 44:40 win in the Eternal City.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to win after the loss in Oslo, but even the race in
Oslo told me that things were coming around, the injuries were
behind me,'' said Johnson. In Rome, said Hart, ``He controlled the
race. He looked vintage Michael for the first time since his
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   But the second task _ quieting the doomsayers, at least for
awhile _ may depend more on the outcome Tuesday. Eyebrows were
raised a few weeks ago when Johnson, citing lack of training,
trashed the chance for another double when he announced he was
pulling out of the 200 here. ``I'm still probably at least a
minimum of a month behind where I need to be in training,'' he
said. ``It takes awhile longer to get ready in the 200, to get
sharp. At this point I'm taking it one step at a time and not
trying to get too far ahead of myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Or let anyone else get there, either; at least not yet. Here
comes that word again. ``I've been one of the most consistent
athletes in this sport, so everyone feels like it's probably time:
here's the time we've been waiting for. As soon as you start to
show a little vulnerability. ...'' he trailed off. ``Nobody takes
into account why it is. The day that I'm out there running and I'm
not running very fast and it's not because of injury, I'll be in
retirement.''

CLINTON TO VISIT NORTHERN IRELAND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ President Clinton, who reluctantly heeded advice
not to travel to Northern Ireland before the peace referendum this
spring, will visit the British province and Ireland in early
September, the White House announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will stop on both sides of the Irish border en route
back to Washington from meetings in Russia with President Boris
Yeltsin. It will be the president's second trip to the island of
Ireland. His first was in November-December 1995, when he visited
Belfast and Londonderry in Northern Ireland and Dublin in the
Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The president will use his visit to underscore the strong U.S.
support for the May referendum that gave Northern Ireland a larger
measure of self-governance, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
cautioned the president against visiting to campaign for the
accord, even though the U.S. leader was in Britain for an
international economic summit less than two weeks before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were worried that a visit by Clinton, even though
he is of Irish Protestant stock, would play into the hands of
pro-British unionists who argued that part of the reason to oppose
the referendum was that it was being forced on them by outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was approved by large majorities on both sides of the
Irish border, winning 71 percent in Northern Ireland, where it was
backed by an estimated 55 percent of the majority Protestant
population.
</P>
<P>
   The White House noted that Clinton worked closely with the heads
of both (British and Irish) governments and the leaders of the
parties to make this historic accord a reality.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides of the Atlantic are determined not to
let sporadic outbreaks of violence, echoes of the decades of
intense sectarian and political rivalry in Northern Ireland, throw
the peace process off track.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the referendum, Clinton hailed the leaders who
stood for hope against fear, the future against the past, unity
against division. On his upcoming trip, he is almost certain to
meet with some of those leaders, including Blair and Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahern as well as Northern Ireland party leaders
David Trimble of the Ulster Unionists and Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein,
the political wing of the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may also try to work in a long-delayed golf game with
Dick Spring, the former Irish foreign minister, at the famous
Ballybunion course in Springs North Kerry parliamentary
constituency. But that outing may again be on hold as Spring has
left the government and joined a Boston-based firm of international
lawyers.

</P>
<P>
   IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE (Chinantla, Mexico) _ Almost every migration
story is the psychodrama of a family. For the Cruz family of
Chinantla, Mexico, it is also the story of a town, a global village
in the most literal sense. Like many modern immigrant families,
those from Chinantla straddle a border, abetted by newly
inexpensive air fares, international phone cards, and, now, by a
new Mexican law that allows them to retain their Mexican
nationality as American citizens and even confers it on their
American-born children. The story of Chinantla is a
multigenerational saga of a pueblito that has been bled of its
working-age population through a half-century of emigration. Yet it
has not faded but flourished, a would-be ghost town kept alive by
emigrants who consider the place a state of mind, an affair of the
heart and their spiritual anchor. By Deborah Sontag.

PATRIOTS TEAM TO BEAT IN AFC EAST, HEAD COACHES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Carroll wanted to know if he was doing any better with his
peers in the AFC East than he has been doing with the national
media in preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys didn't pick us last, did they?'' asked Carroll with
a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   No, Pete, they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the four head coaches who compete against you in
division all think you have the team to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Says Jim Mora, Indianapolis Colts: ``The Patriots have the most
talented team in the division. A lot of weapons, and they should be
a strong playoff team.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Jimmy Johnson, Miami Dolphins: ``No question they have the
best talent in the division. But if somthing happens to (Drew)
Bledsoe, that will change in a hurry. Then I think we could
leapfrog 'em. With Curtis Martin also out of there, they wouldn't
have anything to hang their hat on.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Wade Phillips, Buffalo Bills: ``The Patriots are the team
to beat. They are very strong defensively. I think their
quarterback might be looking at a breakthrough year where he takes
it to the next level. It will be interesting to see how they run
the ball without Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Bill Parcells, New York Jets: ``New England has the best
overall talent. A good blend of veterans and younger players. They
are more battle hardened than the other teams in the division.
They've played in bigger games.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, on the Dolphins: ``This will be the best team I've had
since I started coaching here. The talent is better. The overall
speed is better. I feel good about every position. That's not to
say we have a bunch of superstars, but we can put a solid player at
every spot. We are going to run the ball better. We've changed our
running game. We had to. We stopped scoring points in the middle of
last season, because we couldn't run the ball. Then teams started
to blitz us and then by the end of the season they were blitzing us
on every down. If we run the ball with success Dan (Marino) is
going to be fine. Defensively, we'll be pretty good. We drafted
some young players I like that will help us. We had another good
draft. What worries me most is injury. I never talked about
injuries in my entire coaching career until last year, and then we

sentence with, `if we can stay healthy.' But if we stay healthy ...

   Phillips, on the Bills: ``We've got a young team, with a lot of
new players, and they will have to come through for us if we want
to get better. We have to get better. Last year we led in fumbles,
interceptions, and had the worst passing stats in the league,
including last on third-down conversions. Our main concern will be
scoring points. Our quarterback situation will be better with Rob
Johnson (from Jacksonville). We're committed to him (as the
starter). We like what we have seen so far. Doug Flutie is the kind
of guy that can give you a spark. We think Todd Collins can play
better. Our running game will be key. Our offensive line has to
play better than it has. Sam Gash will be our fullback. We need
(wide receiver) Eric Moulds to come through for us. He's lost some
weight (12 pounds) and looks great. Our defense will be good. We
are going to switch to a 4-3 for the first time since I've been
here because we have a bunch of good defensive linemen, and we've
lost some linebackers. The most important thing for us will be to
run the ball. When you can't run, teams just kill you with those
zone-dogs. If you can run, then you can hurt them with the running
game.''

   Carroll, on the Patriots: ``We've got some strong things going
for us. Our defense is young and spunky. We've got a question at
cornerback, and if we get that fixed we should be very good. Our
defense should be better just on the strength of having played
together for another system, and knowing the system better.
Offensively, we know we can throw the ball. We have to find out if
we can run the ball, and who the guy carrying it is going to be.
That's what we will find out in training camp.''

   Mora, in his first season with the Colts: ``The whole key is
Peyton (Manning). We think he is going to be a special player. Now
we have to put the people around him who can help him perform. I
think we have some weapons on offense. We've got the runner
(Marshall) Faulk. We've got the wide receiver (Marvin) Harrison.
We've got two fine tight ends, (Ken) Dilger and (Marcus) Pollard.
And our offensive line is better than some critics think. We will
play a lot of two back, and some double tight end. We have to do
the best job of protecting Peyton that we can. We can't let the
other teams just tee off on him. We have to get him in situations
(third and short) where he has a chance to be successful. Our
defense wasn't very good last year. It's going to take us time to
get that reversed. We gave up too many big plays, and too many easy
touchdowns. We're going to play better team defense. We have to
make the other team work to score. ''

   Parcells, on the Jets: ``We should be a better team than we were
a year ago. I think we've improved our offensive line, and by doing
that our running game. We should have more firepower on offense.
Quarterback will be the question. We have to see what happens
there. Curtis (Martin) should give us a better running game, and I
feel my backs will catch the ball better than our backs did last
season. Defensively, we did not give up a lot of points last year,
but we are not overpowering, either. We'll have good special teams.
I think that will be our strength.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Division outlook:
</P>
<P>
   Johnson: ``New England is the team to beat. They have the most
talent. Their defense is very good. They are going to be tough to
beat, not question. Buffalo will try to run the ball on offense.
Their defense is a little older, and hopefully not as dominant as
in the past. Everyone says Johnson is the answer at quarterback.
We'll see. I rate the Jets behind New England. They'll have a
better running game with Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips: ``We've got three teams in the division in the same
situation, all with new quarterbacks. Johnson here. (Glenn) Foley
in New York. Peyton with the Colts. All three teams want to build a
better running game to help those young quarterbacks out. All three
will need some time for the quarterbacks to fit. New England is
solid. I like them a lot on defense. Marino is still the big factor
in Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Mora: ``The Patriots have the best overall talent. I think they
really helped themselves in the draft with all of those picks. I've
got a great deal of respect for Jimmy (Johnson) and the job his
staff does. That team doesn't seem to have a great deal of talent,
but he got them to the playoffs. The Jets are hard to evaluate
because of their quarterback situation. Foley is the key. Same in
Buffalo with Johnson. How well those guys plays will determine how
well their teams do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll: ``I count on the Jets being stronger. They made great
strides last year, and should get better just from the continuity
of the system. They've got a heck of a running back and the
acquistions of Vinny (Testaverde) should really help them. When he
gets to know the system they'll have a good 1-2 punch with him and
Foley. Miami, Buffalo, and Indianapolis will all emphasize the run.
They've got new coaching staffs and the coaches calling the shots
believe in the running game.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells: ``New England has the best situation at quarterback.
The rest of us are unsettled at that position, including Miami.
They don't know for sure how Marino is going to hold up. And the
rest of us will be playing with new starting quarterbacks. The
Colts will be better than people think. They weren't that bad at
the end of last season when they beat us pretty good. Buffalo is
high on Johnson. I've heard some good things about that kid. So he
could make them tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overview from Phillips: ``This is a tough division because every
team in it is committed to winning. When the Jets go get Parcells,
and Miami gets Johnson, you know they are going all out. Indy
brings in Bill Polian and Jim Mora, two guys who have had great
success in winning. We're trying to change things here. It's going
to be very competitive.''

ARIZONA COUNTY TO FINE PIGEON FEEDERS 
</HEADLINE>

   LAKD HAVASU CITY, Ariz. - Until the Lake Havasu City library got
a new roof, librarian Jenny Baltes always prayed for no rain.
</P>
<P>
   It had nothing to do with drippy ceilings. Baltes said the
moisture would activate the pigeon feces piled on the roof and in
the air-conditioning ducts.
</P>
<P>
   The result was not pleasurable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole building had a smell of old diapers,'' Baltes said
Thursday. ``People would literally be running in and out of here to
check out books.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the festivities surrounding London Bridge. Blame it
on an excess of human kindness. In any case, the huge growth in the
Mohave County pigeon population in places such as Lake Havasu City
and Bullhead City has spurred the Board of Supervisors to get
tough.
</P>
<P>
   The panel unanimously approved a measure last week that will
fine people $100 for feeding pigeons, effective in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Mohave County officials said it is the nation's first countywide
ordinance targeting the feeding of pigeons, although about 15
municipalities have passed such laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken White, executive director of the Arizona Humane Society,
said the new law won't address the problem of pigeon
overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in places in California that did this kind of thing
and all it did was tie up the courts and solved no problems,''
White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pigeons will do is go to the garbage dumpsters more.
Six well-placed dumpsters will take the place of all the people
feeding them.''
</P>
<P>
   Anti-pigeon activists, however, feel differently. Earl Siler,
president of the Lake Havasu City Pigeon Abatement Committee, said
he will take his chances with the new ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the London Bridge was dedicated here years ago, they
released about 300 pigeons into the air as part of the
festivities,'' Siler said. ``That number has grown to about 15,000
now and their feces, which causes 27 communicable diseases, is all
over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltes said the pigeon problem has gotten so bad in the city
that many people have placed fake owls and noisemakers on their
roofs to try to scare the birds away.
</P>
<P>
   Siler said the drive to get a countywide ordinance was spurred
by an incident in Lake Havasu City in which an elderly couple fed
about 400 pigeons a day at their home, then ``opened the garage
door at night so they (the pigeons) would have somewhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple was cited for violating a local nuisance ordinance,
he said, but the incident illustrated the need for a wider measure
targeting the feeding of pigeons.
</P>
<P>
   Mohave County Board Chairman Jim Zaborsky said he can empathize.
He said that pigeons infested two of his commercial properties in
Bullhead City, making some employees sick.
</P>
<P>
   Zaborsky said he spent $5,000 erecting barriers to try to keep
the birds from roosting on one of the buildings. Then, he said, the
birds followed him to his nearby home.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Street, Mohave County's health and social service
director, said the long-term anti-pigeon prognosis is grim. &QL;

IN PARIS COUTURE, THE SPECTACLE'S THE THING

<P>
   PARIS _ Lady Godiva's entrance on the back of a haltingly
high-stepping horse, amid an Amazonian rain forest opened the haute
couture fall and winter 1998-99 season for Givenchy by Alexander
McQueen. The poor, overtrained beast with a model on its back
didn't bring to mind fairy tales; it recalled instead Bianca Jagger
barebacking it through Studio 54, a defining moment of tortured
excess. And everyone knows how Studio 54 got its comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   In the same way that movies are being judged by the size of
their grosses, couture shows are now judged by the size of the
spectacle. And it's a good thing, since without all the noise and
excesses, someone might notice how little progress is being made in
the name of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But don't think about that. Keep your eye on the three-story
waterfall at Givenchy, and wait for the train at Christian Dior,
the Diorient Express. It steamed into a station full of cranky
clients. It wasn't run by Il Duce but by a fashion designer, so it
was an hour and a half late. But it looked great when it got there.
</P>
<P>
   Paris is a strangely friendly place following France's World Cup
victory. Even the usually grouchy waiters at traditional, chic
bistros like Benoit are singing on the way to the tables. Isn't
that just the sort of joy, the sort of happiness to be French, that
has been missing from the couture culture for so long? Especially
as Frenchmen stood helplessly by while American and British
designers brought the cultures that invented hamburgers and
hooligans, respectively, into the Frenchest of French houses.
</P>
<P>
   The first place the joy was evident was at the house that has
become the new French standard, Jean Paul Gaultier. Gaultier made a
clear case that he, not the recently hired ready-to-wear designer
for Saint Laurent, Alber Elbaz, is the inheritor of the mantle of
Saint Laurent, the pride of the French.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Gaultier's show, he told Pierre Berge, Saint
Laurent's president, who was in the front row, that he had created
a homage to Saint Laurent. Gaultier's mastery of couture has come
in four seasons after he decided to finance his own shows at age
38.
</P>
<P>
   Couture wasn't forced on Gaultier, and he isn't a hired hand at
someone's house: That accounts for the purity of his work. It was
dignified, the only luxury couture isn't often accorded these days.
</P>
<P>
   As French as it all was, full of Saint Laurent references, it
was Gaultier's signature borrowing from other cultures that made
the most magnificent pieces: the beaded kilt, the Peruvian sweater
made entirely of feathers, the cable-knit Irish fisherman's sweater
created with 1,000 hours of embroidery.
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier's trick is to honor the humble, making a trench coat
into a ball gown, or reinventing Granny's favorite crocheted
sweater, with insets of beaded-flower panels. But what singled out
Gaultier's show was its vision of French joy, two words that hadn't
been joined very often before the soccer match that rocked the
country, just in time for Bastille Day.
</P>
<P>
   To all appearances, Christian Dior, under John Galliano, is a
happy house, too. Hysterical, even. Galliano's locomotive should
have been dubbed Disorient Express, with Pocahontas, clad in a
chiffon dress with inset Navajo patterns, leading a band of
musketeer models, Renaissance princesses, 17th-century prigs and
Henry VIII cross-dressers. Don't even ask.
</P>
<P>
   At huge expense, a spice-filled souk was recreated, and the
lost-luggage room had trunks tagged with names like Bing Crosby,
Cleopatra and Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   Pimms was served as the couture clients clamored for water. And
costumes were shown as the couture clients clamored for clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Like McQueen, Galliano has themes he returns to, but each season
the fever dream seems a bit more complex, captivating and
exquisitely rendered, to the point where you can almost hear the
guillotine being sharpened.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the inspiration of the American Indian, this time
with Navajo blanket wraps, Indian symbols painted on leather,
elaborate cut fringes forming skirts and Indian beads draping down
rib cages. There were also mutton sleeves and doublets and ornate
Renaissance-style dresses.
</P>
<P>
   The show was costumey, crazy, way over the top, but it was fun.
Galliano makes extravagance look easy (it is someone else's money,
after all), and it's a quality the Dauphin of Dior can't afford to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult not to think of McQueen as the horse performing
its dressage gait at Givenchy. He knows so much, he's so talented,
and he can put on a show, but nothing about it looks easy or
natural for him. He went through his paces dutifully, but it didn't
look as if he was having very much fun.
</P>
<P>
   McQueen is entirely too young to be so dependent on a vocabulary
of his past successes, the only thread that tied the show together:
the jump suit with jacket lapels, the pieced brightly hued leather
suits, the John Galliano-inspired inset floral dress, the looping
lavender lapel jacket, the armorlike corsetry, the cut-out lacy
leather.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, his vision of Anastasia lost in the Amazon had a heady
``Lord of the Flies'' scent to it all, not treacly, from a belt
swagged with dead parrots, to paint-slashed eyes, to Gibson-girl
haircuts, which would need to be shrunken by a headhunter to fit.
</P>
<P>
   The Givenchy atelier clearly loves its designer; the quality is
impeccable. As was the white-suited McQueen, once a sort of savage
in the couture jungle, seemingly tamed and toeing the line for the
first time. (It is someone else's money, after all.) And missing
something because of it.

<P>
   Designers' runways never lie. So the French ones can look
joyous, but it may be years before Donatella Versace's can. Her
first couture collection, staged in the same room where her brother
held his last one a year ago, was as explicit in its homage to him
as it was in exposing the gulf that lay between Ms. Versace's
esthetic and her brother's.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace has become fashion's Medea, since her suffering is
of the enormous sort that only operas and tabloids can ever make
sense of. So, it's no wonder she doesn't mimic the tone of
Versace's shows, a pitch so high, so bright and no static at all.
</P>
<P>
   What has replaced joy at Versace is a rawness _ frayed edges to
fabrics like exposed nerves, lopped-off hemlines with a hint of
madness, feathers quivering across suits like a trembling hand.
</P>
<P>
   As was clear from the earliest days that they worked together,
Ms. Versace's esthetic is violently different from her brother's.
Her aggressiveness is familiar to us through media like punk music
and graffiti art; in other words, it is the opposite of the
refinement of couture.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gianni Versace's aggression was always sexual, Donnatella
Versace's isn't sexual at all. It is literally metallic: tulle
mixed with copper fibers, aluminum and lace, cashmere and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   But the clothes poignantly display little gestures of hope.
Wisps of feathers flutter, bringing life to the surfaces of tightly
fitted suits; rips in clothes are violent, but feathers jut out, as
if the model isn't losing her clothes, she's gaining wings.
</P>
<P>
   Skirt and trousers cut to be short in the back, long in the
front, seem less about indecision than a designer acting out the
compromises she made with Versace all the time. And there were
sweet memories of Versace's finer moments, like zipped-up suits
with Medusa medallion zippers, or slinky rhinestone dresses.
</P>
<P>
   It could never be said that this collection is without passion;
it has all the passion of the fighter slugging it out in the ring.
One can only hope that soon Ms. Versace can find solace and peace
in the work, too.
</P>
<P>
   Even courting the celebrities looked like harder work these
days; Melanie Griffith, Diane Lane and Jennifer Lopez were so done
up in their Versace best that they might as well have been wearing
banners across their chests and tiaras. And Puff Daddy sent a
backstage-style list of demands to Ms. Versace, asking for Cap'n
Crunch and Miracle Whip. Not exactly the shopping list for any
other house's couture clients.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what may help inspire Ms. Versace to lift her spirits is
just that: Versace has always been the house where such a request
is met with complicit laughter, not snooty derision.

CANADA LIFTS BAN ON SUSPECT GASOLINE ADDITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ To the outrage of environmentalists and Canadian
nationalist groups, Ottawa rescinded a year-old ban Monday on the
use of a controversial gasoline additive suspected by some
reseachers of causing nerve damage and agreed to pay the American
manufacturer, Ethyl Corp., $10 million compensation for legal costs
and lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ethyl Corp. had accused Canada of violating the North American
Free Trade Agreement with the ban.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of the ban represents an embarrassing flipflop for
the government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, which last year
pushed a bill through the national Parliament decreeing MMT a
pollutant and health hazard, and prohibiting the importation and
sale of the octane-boosting substance.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, several of Chretien's cabinet ministers hailed the
ban as proof that Canada could set its own environmental and health
policies in the face of opposition from powerful American corporate
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian nationalists, who claim the free trade pact threatens
this country's cultural and economic sovereignty, decried the
reversal as proof that Canada can no longer set its own health or
environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under NAFTA, we can expect more of the same,'' said Jo Dufay,
a spokeswoman for the Council of Canadians, an organization that
opposes NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as an ``octane enhancer'' that increases the power of
fuel, MMT has been added to automobile fuel sold in the United
States and Canada since the mid-1970s, when use of lead additives
was restricted in both countries. MMT is the trade name for the
chemical methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl.
</P>
<P>
   The key ingredient in MMT is manganese, and recent studies by
environmental and health groups has indicated that the chemical
might cause memory impairment, tremors and other damage to the
central nervous system when inhaled in sufficient quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the product, ranging from the American
Psychological Association to the Sierra Club, say that breathing
the fumes of MMT-laced fuels even at the levels found at the gas
pumps may be dangerous. They also claim it is an air pollutant.
</P>
<P>
   One Canadian study, funded in part by the US Environmental
Protection Agency, found evidence that even low levels of exposure
to manganese caused some impairment of the human nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a court case brought by the manufacturer
resulted in a ruling that the additive could be sold, because it
was considered to be ``grandfathered in'' as an existing additive
that did not require testing before introduction to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Greenbaum, head of the Health Effects Institute in
Cambridge, Mass., said most major fuel manufacturers have said they
would not use it, but some smaller companies may currently be using
it. Testing of the additive is ongoing, he said, but at present
``there's a lot of debate about the science; there isn't a lot
known.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadian officials denied that they were knuckling under to
high-power pressure from the United States, saying that Ottawa had
simply decided that there was no compelling scientific evidence to
support the legal ban on the additive.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's backdown came after Ethyl Corp. mounted a massive legal
and lobbying challenge, seeking $250 million in damages. The
company argued that the ban violated provisions of NAFTA
guaranteeing free trade between Canada, Mexico and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian news reports, government lawyers had
advised Ottawa that the ban could cost taxpayers millions of
dollars in legal costs in the event of a sustained challenge by the
manufacturer and gasoline refiners.
</P>
<P>
   Groups favoring a continued ban said that the about-face by
Ottawa represented a humiliating defeat for Canadian health
standards and national sovereignty. ``It is outrageous that a
US-based multinational has more weight with the Chretien government
than our Parliament, public health and our own environment,'' said
Elizabeth May, director of the Sierra Club-Canada.

 McCAFFREY CONTINUES CRITICISM OF DUTCH DRUG POLICY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration's drug policy director
on Monday criticized a heroin distribution program in the
Netherlands, even after his disapproving statements over that
nation's drug policy angered the Dutch government last week.
</P>
<P>
   The recent uproar over retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey's
attacks on liberal Dutch drug policy as an ``unmitigated disaster''
put him on the defensive during his recent eight-day European tour,
which included visits to prevention centers in the Netherlands. But
in a news conference Monday, McCaffrey criticized the Dutch
government for providing heroin to hardened addicts.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said the program would commit ``part of the population
to suffering endlessly from heroin,'' he said. ``We don't agree
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands, which allows the sale of limited amounts of
marijuana, started the program for heroin addicts on July 1. The
program provides a heroin injection or an inhalable tablet for
addicts, plus money for housing or other services.
</P>
<P>
   The heroin program, similar to one used in Switzerland, is
intended to keep crime down and addicts off the street, according
to Robert Housman of the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
which McCaffrey directs.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the heroin program dovetails McCaffrey's criticism
of Dutch coffeehouses, which sell marijuana and hashish to anyone
over the age of 18. McCaffrey said, however, that the coffeehouses
technically can't sell the so-called soft drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a legal hypocrisy that bothers many,'' he told the news
conference Monday. ``We don't agree about `soft' drugs.''

<P>
   In response to McCaffrey's criticism of the marijuana sales
during a visit Thursday, government officials publicly expressed
anger at the American official, and the Foreign Ministry called in
the U.S. ambassador in protest. The Dutch Ministry of Health also
questioned why McCaffrey was even visiting the country.
</P>
<P>
   While attacking the heroin program and the marijuana sales,
McCaffrey praised the Netherlands' extensive treatment and outreach
programs, which reach an estimated 70 percent of heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number I'm most envious of is the percentage of addicts
Dutch officials have contact with,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Netherlands has been effective in using counseling and drug
treatments, such as methadone, to combat heroin addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment with methadone, an opiate that blocks the negative
effects of heroin withdrawal without providing the high, is in
effect in the United States as well, but McCaffrey said the program
lacks flexibility because it is too centralized and users must go
every day for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said methadone should be one of the principal methods
for reducing heroin addiction in this country. He added that it was
one of the ways ``to get people to go back to work, back into their
families and reduce the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. drug control strategy aims to reduce illegal drug use
and availability 50 percent by the year 2007 through prevention,
treatment, law enforcement, research, protection of borders and
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to examining drug polices in six European nations,
McCaffrey worked on international cooperation on drug control.
McCaffrey said he hoped to have an annual convention between the
United States and European countries.

WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION WILL RECEIVE $2.5-MILLION ROCKEFELLER
GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive)

 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ To mark a long-awaited change in leadership at
the World Health Organization on Tuesday, the Rockefeller
Foundation will provide a $2.5-million fund to the new
director-general, Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, to aid her in
recruiting top-level experts over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister and a
physician who studied public health at Harvard, plans to revamp the
upper-level management of the organization, its spokesman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller grant was designed to give Dr. Brundtland the
financial freedom to bring outsiders into the U.N. agency
temporarily as expert advisers during a transition period of 12 to
24 months. U.N. officials are often hampered by bureaucratic or
political restraints when taking over agencies if they have to work
through the organization's slow-moving, politically sensitive
personnel system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fund is a way of helping her get going, to bring fresh
people and fresh ideas into the institution,'' said Lincoln Chen,
vice president of the Rockefeller Foundation. ``Essentially, she
would have the freedom to draw the best talent in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's president, Gordon Conway, is to announce the
award in Geneva later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller Foundation, one of a number of private
foundations that give grants to United Nations programs and
agencies, has been supporting health projects for 85 years, said
Chen, who is on leave from the Harvard School of Public Heath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very much were involved in trying to strengthen the WHO
because of its key role in world health,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller grant is a non-renewable gift, significantly
larger than many grants U.N. programs receive but considerably
smaller than the $1 billion gift from Ted Turner's United Nations
Foundation, which is now beginning to disburse money at the rate of
about $100 million a year for 10 years to a variety of projects.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Dr. Brundtland is expected to announce the creation
of a Cabinet system for the organization, with nine officials
assigned to major contemporary health issues, including
environmental problems, family health issues, health technology and
drug policies, the effects of social change in mental health,
communicable diseases and noncommunicable diseases. Cabinet-level
officials will also deal with management problems, said Richard
Leclair, organization spokesman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the World Health Organization, Dr. Brundtland succeeds
Hiroshi Nakajima of Japan, whose two five-year terms as director
general were marked by repeated reports of mismanagement,
corruption and political favoritism as nations jockeyed for good
positions in the organization. Health experts from a number of
nations who have worked with the organization say that political
considerations often got in the way of medical priorities or
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller grant is likely to provoke a share of criticism
from those member nations that do not approve of U.N. agencies
having the power to reach outside the system for high-level advice.
This is exactly what the Rockefeller Foundation aims to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``In talking to Mrs. Brundtland,'' Chen said, ``it arose that
probably what we could do that would be most helpful is to provide
this flexible fund that would enable her to overcome the biggest
constraint in the performance of these organizations, which is
people.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was elected to the position of director general early
this year, Dr. Brundtland said she was not afraid of mixing her
political skills with health concerns. She said that using her
political experience will make her a better advocate for health
projects. Health concerns have their political dimensions, she
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ill health leads to poverty in individuals, populations and
nations,'' she said. Medical problems no longer know borders, she
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brundtland, 58, was elected to the leadership of the World
Health Organization, based in Geneva, by barely half the votes of
the 32-member international board. After the vote she was asked at
a news conference in Geneva what it would be like to be the first
woman to be director general of WHO. She said that when she became
prime minister of Norway she was the first woman to hold that job
in 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are evolving gradually,'' she said.

TREASURIES MIXED BEFORE GREENSPAN TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury securities were mixed in light trading
Monday, with gains limited to the longer maturities as investors
wait for a report to Congress on the state of the economy by the
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond rose 16/32, to a price of 105 28/32. Its yield,
which moves in the opposite direction, dropped to 5.71 percent,
from 5.74 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in the bond market Monday was lighter than usual, with
about $34.6 billion in securities traded through the major bond
brokers by about 3 p.m., according to Govpx, a bond pricing
service. Volume was down about 30 percent compared with an average
Monday in the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is scheduled to appear before the Senate Banking
Committee Tuesday morning to deliver the first part of his
semiannual testimony. He will conclude the testimony Wednesday
before the House Banking Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the market expect him to suggest there is some slowdown
in the economy, making a rate increase by the central bank
unlikely. The Fed has not adjusted short-term rates since March
1997, when it raised the federal funds rate, or target rate for
overnight loans between banks, by 25 basis points, to 5.50 percent.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   While the testimony from Greenspan is expected to be followed
closely by investors, they will also be following the selection of
a new prime minister in Japan this week to replace Ryutaro
Hashimoto.

CLINTON ANNOUNCES CONFERENCE ON CLASSROOM SAFETY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ President Clinton, calling for a broad attack on
school violence and unruly pupils, on Monday announced a White
House conference on classroom safety in October.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to an American Federation of Teachers convention,
Clinton touted uniforms, a crackdown on truancy, curfews and ``zero
tolerance'' of guns as means to safer schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever there is chaos where there should be calm, wherever
there is disorder where there should be discipline, make no mistake
about it, it's not just a threat to our classrooms and to your
mission, it is a threat to the strength and vitality of America,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision to host a White House conference on
school safety was prompted by repeated instances during the last
year of deadly gunplay in schools, including the tragic incident at
Jonesboro, Ark., in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the White House conference would ``bring together
educators and law enforcement officers and families whose lives
have been touched by these terrible tragedies to find new solutions
to this profound challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He also renewed his call for Congress to enact a measure to ban
violent juveniles from buying guns ever in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that although he wanted to stiffen punishment
for some school-related offenses, ``you know and I know that we
cannot jail our way out of this problem. We've got to prevent more
of these kids from getting in trouble in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that police and social workers alike agree that
prevention works.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that although the series of gun-related
deaths at schools was appalling, he argued that less dramatic
behavior can be as disruptive to education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The small stuff matters. The basics matter,'' he said. ``In
most schools it's not the sensational acts of violence but much
smaller acts of aggression, threats, scuffles, constant back talk
that take a terrible toll on the atmosphere of learning, on the
morale of teachers, on the attitudes of other students,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was ``heartened by the flood of interest'' from
school districts about adopting requirements that students wear
uniforms. He said that what originally had seemed an out-of-date
concept _ and made ``half the kids in America mad at me _ had
become widely accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one student is no longer obsessed by another student's
sneakers or designer jackets, and where students are focused not on
appearances but on learning, crime and violence go down, attendance
and learning go up,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to the AFT, Clinton was addressing long-time
political allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We supported Bill Clinton early and we supported him twice,''
AFT President Sandra Feldman noted in introducing him. She
described Clinton as ``the most knowledgeable president in history
when it comes to education.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman castigated Republican attempts to offer vouchers, that
would allow parents to send children to private schools using
taxpayer funds as more than just an assault on public education
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that what President Clinton's detractors are after is
the destruction of public institutions in general and the
destruction of public education in particular,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides conceded that Clinton expected to be
addressing an AFT headed for merger with the National Education
Association into a mammoth teachers' union. But delegates to the
NEA convention last month rejected the proposal and sent
negotiators of their independent union back to the drawing board
with representatives of the AFT, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading back to Washington on Monday night, Clinton
attended two Democratic fund-raising events. First was a lunch for
Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., who is virtually unopposed for
re-election but whom the president owed for his support on ``fast
track'' trade authority. The gathering was expected to bring
$250,000 to the House member from New Orleans. Next was a
Democratic National Committee dinner expected to clear $200,000 for
the party.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a fan of the Crescent City's fabled cuisine, worked in
a red fish and seafood feast Sunday night at the Bon Ton Cafe,
which was opened specially for him. Aaron Neville, who has been to
the White House several times during Clinton's presidency, sang
before and after the meal.
</P>
<P>
   En route to the teachers' union speech, Clinton dropped by Cafe
du Monde, beside the Mississippi River levee in the French Quarter,
for beignets, the fried rectangular doughnuts smothered in powdered
sugar.

POSSIBILITY OF SLASH IN BEER TAX BRINGS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Richard Neal seems an unlikely
choice to be the chief Democratic sponsor of legislation that would
halve the federal tax on beer. No breweries are in his district,
and Neal says the issue ``really hasn't come up much'' back home in
Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Neal does have two close friends who view him as the perfect
politician to be out front on this issue: House minority leader
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, whose district includes the world's
largest brewer, and Beer Institute lobbyist Raymond McGrath, a
former New York congressman.
</P>
<P>
   The growing prospect that the beer tax paid by brewers will be
halved has alarmed groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
With more than 60 percent of alcohol-related car crashes involving
beer, and with the industry fighting efforts to tighten
drunken-driving laws, MADD president Karolyn Nunnallee predicts a
tax cut would increase underage beer purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This price reduction will go into the profits of the
companies,'' Nunnallee said, noting the tax is paid by brewers, not
directly by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The beer industry, however, casts the tax as a consumer issue.
Anheuser-Busch, for example, is running an advertising campaign
calling for ``instant tax relief for 80 million Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   While the beer makers calculate the tax amounts to 33 cents per
six-pack, industry officials acknowledge that part of the tax cut
might be kept by the companies and shareholders. ``It's our
expection that consumers will indeed see a reduction in the price
of beer,'' Anheuser-Busch said in a statement, but the company
didn't specify the amount.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to cut the beer tax has gained ground in recent weeks
since tobacco legislation was killed in the Senate. Philip Morris
Co., which successfully fought the tobacco bill by focusing on the
cigarette tax hike, also owns the Miller Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying includes a considerable amount of campaign cash, a
careful blending of class warfare, and the deployment of one of
President Clinton's Arkansas friends to try to win over the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The beer tax increase _ which now brings the Treasury $1.7
billion annually _ has been fought almost from the day it was
approved eight years ago, when former President Bush in 1990 broke
his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that doubled the beer levy also raised federal taxes
on luxury items such as yachts, furs and high-priced cars and jets.
Those taxes have since been repealed, leaving only the beer tax
hike, prompting the brewers to complain that beer drinkers have
been left with a tax hike, while the richest Americans no longer
pay higher levies for their luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   Beer industry backers believe this makes a powerful argument for
repealing the tax hike. ``The beer-drinking tax fell among
working-class Americans,'' Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the alcohol industry note that the companies
have been fighting tougher drunk-driving and advertising laws at
the same time they seek a tax cut. ``If you thought tobacco was
tough, this is one of the most powerful lobbies in the country,''
said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, the Massachusetts
Democrat who has battled the industry for years.
</P>
<P>
   In May, beer and liquor lobbyists successfully killed
legislation that would have tightened drunk-driving laws by
lowering the blood-alcohol content limit to .08 percent from .10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Sarasin, a former Connecticut Republican congressman who
heads the National Beer Wholesalers Association, said the tax and
drunk-driving limit are separate issues. He said the industry would
not agree to a compromise that would repeal the beer tax in
exchange for supporting a tougher drunk-driving limit. Lowering the
blood-alcohol limit would mean ``little old ladies at bridge
games'' who consume two glasses of wine would be considered drunk
while driving home, Sarasin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no statistics in the country that show .08 has had a
positive effect,'' Sarasin said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Boston University professor Ralph Hingson has authored
studies that show drunk-driving deaths dropped 16 percent in states
that have adopted the .08 percent limit. Sarasin said he was not
familiar with those statistics.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the beer industry has contributed $1.2 million for the
1998 election cycle, 68 percent to Republicans and 32 percent to
Democrats, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   While Sarasin lobbies for the beer wholesalers, McGrath, the
former Republican congressman, represents the brewers through their
organization, the Beer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said that since he left the House in 1992, ``I have made
it my business in the last three Congresses to visit with every
member of Congress personally.'' It doesn't hurt that McGrath also
is president of the Capitol Hill Club, where many Republicans hold
their fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The logical Democratic co-sponsor of the bill to lower the beer
tax would be Gephardt, since Anheuser-Busch is based in St. Louis.
But Gephardt declined, even though he supports cutting the tax.
</P>
<P>
   MADD's Nunnallee said Gephardt is closely aligned with the
industry as he considers running for the presidency in 2000. ``We
wish he would take a stand and fight with us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who in 1996 received $6,000 from the beer industry,
declined requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gephardt privately asked Neal to become the chief
Democratic sponsor of the tax cut, according to an individual
familiar with the conversation. Neal declined to comment about his
conversation with Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath of the Beer Institute said he approached Neal. The two
men served together on the House Ways and Means Committee, shared a
locker at the House gym, and remain close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richie Neal is the big co-sponsor,'' McGrath said. ``I asked
him and he said yes. I'm not kidding, he is a very good friend of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal said, ``I am an old friend of Ray McGrath, no question
about that.'' But he added: ``I don't recall a specific
conversation about this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While the legislation has 93 sponsors, Neal is the only one from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The beer industry has contributed $1,500 to Neal this campaign
cycle and $3,500 for the 1996 election. Neal noted that he has
backed separate legislation to toughen drunk-driving laws.
</P>
<P>
   While McGrath works on assembling House supporters, he is
counting on an Arkansan, Mac Carder, to woo Clinton. Carder was
director of Arkansas' Alcohol Beverage Control agency during three
years of Clinton's governorship and is now director of the Beer
Wholesalers Association of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are have been working on a friend of his, Mac Carder,''
McGrath said. ``We are trying to get him to work on Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Carder said he hoped to talk to Clinton about the issue. ``I
don't go around boasting having influence over the president,'' he
said. ``I play it low-key.''

CLINTON AND GOP BRACE FOR BUDGET BATTLE  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, R.I., N.M., S.D.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just a year after President Clinton and the
Republican leadership completed a bipartisan balanced-budget
agreement, the two sides are again headed toward a showdown over
taxes and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have eviscerated Clinton's proposals for education,
the environment, job training and child care, among other programs,
continuing their assault on what they consider excessive government
spending. Already, the administration has issued seven veto threats
against spending bills working their way through the House and
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bucked up by projections showing that the federal budget
surpluses will be even bigger than Congress had expected,
Republicans have stepped up their calls in recent days for a big
tax cut. In doing so, they are defying Clinton's demand that any
surpluses be placed off limits until the two parties settle on a
plan to shore up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   With both parties eager to emphasize their differences heading
into this fall's congressional elections, White House officials and
Republican leaders are bracing for a confrontation in late
September and early October, when Congress will be trying to wrap
up its work for this year and allow members to head home to
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly hope we can avoid the kind of crisis we've had in
the past,'' a senior administration official said. ``But I must
say, looking at where we're going, at the moment it appears that
whether we want a conflict or not, we're headed toward some degree
of conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the battle is ritualistic, with the White House
and Republicans, especially those in the House, playing out roles
that have become familiar over the past few years. Hard-line
rhetoric is likely to give way to a degree of pragmatism when it
comes time to negotiate in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans remain divided among themselves about how hard to
push for deep tax and spending cuts, with moderates in the Senate
balking at the plans being pushed by economic and social
conservatives in the House. And having been blamed for shutting
down the government after their standoff with the White House in
1995, Republicans have proven willing since then to grant the
president some of what he wants to avoid gridlock and Democratic
charges of extremism.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton has proved adept at casting compromise as
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither party is shying away from a fight. Republicans
are seeking to energize conservative voters _ those most likely to
turn out on their behalf in November. Democrats believe that they
have positioned themselves well on critical issues, including
improving education and child care and defending the environment
and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The squabbles over tax and spending priorities come against a
backdrop of broader partisan struggles over social and economic
issues like assuring quality health care, curbing smoking and
limiting abortion. And with tension also running high because of
the independent counsel's investigation of Clinton, the bipartisan
spirit that was briefly evident at the time of last year's budget
deal is nowhere in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's veto threats on the spending bills
encompass a wide range of issues. The White House wants more money
than the Senate is providing for the Interior Department's
environmental and Indian programs and for the Energy Department's
energy-conservation efforts. It objects to the House's termination
of one of Clinton's pet projects, the Americorps national service
program.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton lashed out at the House version of the bill
financing education, job training and child care, saying
Republicans were ``turning their backs on America's young.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority leader, said
Clinton was again showing ``a high predilection for discretionary
social-spending programs'' and that the Congress would head off the
White House's creeping attempts to expand government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would characterize it as the same old debate in a new
context,'' Armey said, referring to the turnabout from huge budget
deficits to the prospect of equally big surpluses in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The context is in our favor,'' Armey said. ``I believe we can
accomplish a great number of things for the American people,
including a tax cut, and it will be very nearly impossible for the
Democrats to vote against it and the president to veto it in that
context.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing estimates of the size of the federal budget surplus
are reshaping political calculations. Even if the two sides can
compromise on the spending bills, conservative Republicans,
particularly in the House, seem intent on forcing a confrontation
over taxes this year.
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate catalyst was the Congressional Budget
Office's report last week concluding that the surplus over the next
decade would be about $1.6 trillion, more than double its estimate
of just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   So emboldened are Republican tax-cutters by the surplus
projections that they are convinced they can defy Clinton's demand
that the surplus be off-limits until Congress and the White House
settle on a plan to deal with the Social Security system's looming
problems. Fear of being portrayed as putting tax cuts ahead of
saving Social Security has left many Republicans wary until now of
pushing for a big tax reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Friday that the budget office's
surplus estimate over the next decade is about $1 trillion higher
than it was when Clinton made his ``Social Security first'' pledge
early this year.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gingrich said, Congress can set aside more than
$600 billion for Social Security and still afford a $1 trillion tax
cut over the next 10 years. That would be far bigger than the $100
billion, five-year package that until now had been the goal of the
party's conservative wing or the $30 billion, five-year reduction
sought by Republican moderates in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is floating the idea of a package that would include
tax cuts for many two-income couples, reductions in the capital
gains and estate taxes and tax cuts intended specifically to help
the elderly _ a component designed to neutralize any Democratic
attacks over Social Security.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can seriously defend a $1.65 trillion surplus and
keeping the money in Washington, D.C., when it belongs to the
American people,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   But while a big tax-cutting plan has the enthusiastic support of
most House Republicans, it would face a difficult time in the
Senate. Moderates like Sen. John Chafee, D-R.I., have warned that
they could not support the spending cuts necessary under current
rules to pay for a $100 billion tax cut, and are urging Congress
not to go higher than $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., chairman of the Budget Committee,
said the new surplus projections make him sympathetic to calls for
bigger tax cuts in the long run. But for now, Domenici is
confronting not only the objections of his own party's moderates
but congressional budget rules that bar using the surplus for tax
cuts. To change the rules would require 60 votes in the Senate, a
hurdle that would be all but impossible for Republicans, who have
55 Senate seats, to overcome this year.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are taking pains to point out that Clinton
is not against substantial tax cuts, but that he does not want to
consider them until the country has dealt with Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in remarks to reporters on Friday, said it would be a
mistake ``to be talking of spending hundreds of billions of dollars
on a tax cut based on projected surpluses that may or may not
materialize, before we have spent the first dollar to save Social
Security so that you aren't going to have to support your parents
in a way that diminishes your standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   In a preview of the strategy Democrats are likely to use if
Republicans press ahead with a big tax cut, Sen. Tom Daschle of
South Dakota, the Democratic leader in the Senate, said he was
eager for a debate about ``our Social Security protection versus
their recklessness with regard to fiscal responsibility in using
Social Security trust funds for tax cuts.''

CLOSE TIES BETWEEN THE POLICE, CONFESSED KILLER QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE HUREWITZ  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gary Evans is the confessed killer of five men.
Jim Horton is a senior state police investigator with a illustrious
string of arrests in major cases.
</P>
<P>
   The two have had a professional relationship that stretches more
than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The quest by cops to obtain confessions and cultivate informants
from robbers routinely throws together odd couples in a tangled
dance with the devil. The Evans case has raised questions about
whether the suspect was coddled over the years, but many law
enforcement officials say such relationships are the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, 43, led a loose group of burglars who specialized in
antique thefts, recruiting them from the neighborhood in Troy,
N.Y., where he grew up. He has admitted to killing three former
associates and two jewelry store owners.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest in May has shed light on the relationship between
Horton and Evans, where the two used each other _ to mutual
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Evans was captured and had admitted to the killings,
their maneuvering continued. Horton suggested Evans might like to
see his former girlfriend, Michelle LeBrecht, who was in another
jail, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   LeBrecht, 27, and Evans met at the Albany County Jail, both
handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Her presence had a ``soothing'' influence on Evans according to
an observer. In return, LeBrecht filled in some blanks for police
on times and dates related to Evans' activities. She had no
knowledge of the slayings, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   LeBrecht pleaded guilty to charges of DWI and other vehicular
charges and was sentenced on Feb. 25, 1998, to serve at least six
months of a nine month sentence in jail. Instead she was released
June 26 after only four months incarceration, according to
Rensselaer County records.
</P>
<P>
   Horton was crucial to her early release, informing the
Rensselaer County Sheriff's office and the judge that she had been
``very cooperative.'' It's not the first time Evans or a friend has
received benefits from police cooperation. Evans was once paid
$2,000 for helping in a drug sting operation, receiving a portion
of the proceeds as set forth under federal guidelines for
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Evans always looked to curry favor with Horton in the hope that
it would someday prove helpful. Law enforcement officials say such
relationships are common for criminals who hope someday to cash in
on the favors or who might want to snitch on a competitor to get
them out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Horton arrested Evans, in 1985, Evans gave him
the name of his partner in crime, Michael Falco, whom Evans later
admitted to killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had been a source of intelligence. He would tell us
stuff,'' Horton said recently.
</P>
<P>
   The big payoff for Horton came when Evans agreed to enter a jail
to gather information that ultimately helped lead to the conviction
of Jeffrey Williams for murdering a woman. Evans testified against
Williams in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Evans was also cooperative in other cases, providing information
that helped lead to arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evans was playing us, playing me,'' Horton said recently. ``I
don't know if it would be to get rid of his competition _ he is
vengeful and he had ongoing disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Such maneuvering is typical of the wheeling and dealing that
characterizes much of the criminal justice system. Its lynchpin is
plea-bargaining, which prosecutors have called indispensable to the
smooth-functioning of the overloaded system, and which has recently
come under legal attack by the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Terry Kindlon, who represented Williams, is
sharply critical of police actions in the Evans case, arguing they
coddled him and _ unwittingly or not _ left him free to continue
his murderous spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gary Evans testified against Jeffrey Williams, Gary Evans
had at that point bodies buried all over the place and more bodies
to come,'' Kindlon said. ``And the reason he was out of jail when
he testified against Jeffrey Williams was because Jim Horton and
those guys got him out of jail, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton has said Evans did the crime and paid in time. He was
arrested when there was evidence against him, and served
substantial prison sentences.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A relative of one of Evans' victims is critical of police
handling of Evans, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not right, this man was arrested 22 times,'' said Dana
Rysedorph, the widow of Evans' last victim has said. ``Red flags
should have gone up ... Gary Evans was used as an informant. That's
why kept getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton said he did not believe Evans was a murderer until last
October when Evans' fifth victim disappeared and Evans fled the
area. At that point, Horton said recently, he went ``full bore''
after his fleeing quarry, leading to Evans' capture in St.
Johnsbury, Vt., on May 27.
</P>
<P>
   Albany County District Attorney Sol Greenberg said that law
enforcement experts recognize they are always taking a chance by
dealing with ``unsavory'' people like Evans, but it's a
``time-honored'' technique and Evans' testimony against Williams
was ``very important.''

BAY STATE LAWMAKERS OK RECORD $19.5 BILLION BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Awash in revenue, lawmakers passed the largest budget
in Massachusetts history Monday, a measure containing a historic
tax cut _ now recalculated at $770 million _ already awaiting the
signature of Acting Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The $19.5 billion budget, with a theme of investing for the
future, substantially increases funding for education, child care
and worker training. The 523-page budget also cuts unemployment
insurance rates and pays for capital projects out-of-pocket instead
of borrowing money to fix such things as roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But the staggering size of the budget -- more than $1 billion
larger than last year's spending plan -- set fiscal watchdogs
worrying about raising expectations that cannot be met in an
economic downturn or in the face of rising expenditures for the
MBTA, the Big Dig and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most expansionary budget of the '90s,'' said Michael
Widmer, of the non-partisan Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Joseph D. Malone, whose gubernatorial campaign
centers on fiscal conservatism, railed against the 7 percent growth
of the budget, compared to the 2.3 percent inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This idea of ratcheting up the size of government at three
times the rate of inflation is nothing short of dangerous and for
Paul Cellucci to be leading the band is an indication that his
inclination is for more and more government the old liberal way,''
Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hastily called budget announcement was nearly one month
past the deadline for completing a compromise spending plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was too much money around and everyone had three ways to
spend it,'' Stanley Rosenberg, chairman of the Senate Ways and
Means Committee, said in explaining the delay. The final version of
the budget was filed before midnight Sunday, passed both the House
and Senate Monday. Cellucci, who was not available for comment
Monday, is expected to sign the measure into law.
</P>
<P>
   Separately Monday, the administration recalculated the cost of
the tax cut and said the original $700 million cut, which was
broken out of the budget and already before Cellucci to sign, was
actually closer to $770 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, education received much attention and resources in the
Fiscal 1999 budget, with a $42 million jump in spending for the
public colleges and universities, representing a 5.7 percent
increase across the system _ the third substantial hike in as many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Local school aid swelled by $253 million to $1.4 billion. A new
account will be established to protect cities and towns that stood
to lose assistance under a change in the education reform formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very, very significant increase,'' said House Ways
and Means Chairman Paul Haley, a Weymouth Democrat and key
negotiator. ``There's no community out there that won't see a
significant increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Another $20 million was also appropriated for local schools that
score poorly on the annual Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment
System, given to fourth, eighth and tenth graders, who will have to
pass the test in order to graduate high school. Those districts
will be allowed to extend the school day or year; provide tutoring
or mentoring; create programs for weekends, vacations and
summertime; offer work experience; and provide for teacher
development.
</P>
<P>
   The budget also provides $22 million for adult education, such
as high school equivalency programs. And part of that funding will
cap community college tuition at $500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Human service agencies also struck gold.
</P>
<P>
   The number of daycare slots for the working poor will be
expanded with $16 million in extra funding and Community
Partnerships, an early childhood education program, will get a $20
million boost, enough to serve another 3,600 youngsters. Summer
meals and school breakfast programs were also expanded.
</P>
<P>
   The budget addresses the transition from welfare to work,
creating a $15 million reserve to help for such things as
transportation to jobs, case management and child care. In
addition, the spending plan increases by 10 percent funding for
homeless shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Social Services was given money to hire
another 50 social workers, along with domestic violence
specialists. And those providing residential support for the ill
and substance abuse services who earn less than $30,000 a year will
get double the raises approved last year.
</P>
<P>
   Funding increases were also put through for the blind, deaf and
hard of hearing and the Department of Mental Retardation, which is
expanding services to those turning 22 this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, which has arguably received a
disproportionate amount of tax cuts compared to the general public
over the last decade, fared well.
</P>
<P>
   A proposal to increase the minimum wage in three steps, which
the Senate attached to its budget, did not survive negotiations
with the House. However, there is still a movement in the House to
vote on the idea, despite Speaker Thomas M. Finneran's opposition
to raise the base wage. And employers will get an $18 million
overall reduction in jobless insurance rates and more than $30
million was set aside for worker training and development to help
ease the employment crunch in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Cities and towns also came out ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to having school aide fully funded at $1.4 billion,
municipalities will benefit from a lift in the Lottery cap. Nearly
$600 million will be returned to local government -- a $58 million
jump over last year -- due to growing revenues from scratch tickets
and numbers games. Regional school transportation costs are being
picked up by the state and cities and towns are getting a 20
percent increase in payments in lieu of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The three main provisions of the House -- longterm initiatives
that could save the state millions of dollars in interest --
survived negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: To fund $16 million in advance to the MBTA so that
the agency does not have to continually borrow money to operate; to
spend $18 million repairing and maintaining state buildings before
having to replace them; and by paying for roads and bridges with
cash on hand, instead of bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also attached non-budget related items to the
document, such as imposing the death penalty and establishing an
abortion clinic buffer zone that would keep demonstrators at least
25 feet from the entrance. Both proposals were deleted.

COMMENTARY: THE BIG-SHIP ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a funny political cartoon recently, spoofing the fact
that nothing President Clinton does seems to affect his poll
ratings _ as long as the stock market keeps rising. The cartoon
showed a newscaster announcing that a severed head had been found
in Clinton's sleeping quarters in the White House, but with the Dow
having reached a new record high the U.S. public was indifferent.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the whole world has started to remind me of that cartoon.
I half expect Dan Rather to begin the evening news one day like
this: ``And here are tonight's headlines: India and Pakistan
leveled each other's capitals today with nuclear bombs. The Taj
Mahal went up in a mushroom cloud. In Moscow today, Russia declared
bankruptcy and closed for business. In Asia, the Thai, Korean and
Indonesian economies sank into depression, while in Japan, the
country's political leadership was in such a state of confusion the
main headline in one Japanese newspaper screamed: `The People of
Japan Are Home Alone.' Meanwhile, OPEC was in disarray today as the
price of crude oil fell again, making gasoline much cheaper than
Diet Coke. But on Wall Street, the Dow hit a new record high on
expectations of higher corporate earnings ... .''
</P>
<P>
   How long, oh Lord, how long can the U.S. keep thriving while
everyone else is in turmoil? Is America now on another planet or
what? I posed that question to Goldman, Sachs' renowned market
analyst Abby Joseph Cohen. Her answer: It can last longer than you
might think.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen argues that the U.S. economy is a lot like a
supertanker _ not the prettiest of ships, not the fastest, but once
it got on the right course, once the U.S. government and leading
corporations went through the necessary deregulation and
streamlining to get ready for this era of rapid technological
change and global markets, ``this U.S. supertanker is not easily
set off course, and it's the sort of ship you want to be on when
the seas get rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the U.S. must care about what happens abroad, says Ms.
Cohen. After all, America is the world's largest importer and
exporter. But the U.S. economy is so big that foreign trade is
still only 13 percent of overall U.S. economic activity, which
remains ``quite robust,'' notes Ms. Cohen. Moreover, U.S. foreign
trade is divided pretty evenly among Western Europe, Asia and North
and South America. So while Asia's on its back, Canada, Latin
America and many Western European countries are getting stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Also, notes Ms. Cohen, when you look into the U.S. economy you
see that America, for the most part, is not competing with China to
sell stuffed toys or VCRs, which have become commodities. We aren't
even competing with Malaysia to sell basic computer chips. An
increasing portion of U.S. exports are advanced technology items or
high-level services _ all of which have a high value-added
component and are not easily substituted by some lower-cost
producer. There is no Korean alternative for Microsoft Windows 98.
There is no Thai version of Andersen Consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, what is hurting so many other countries _ the fall in
the price of oil and other commodities and the slowdown in Asia _
helps keep inflation and interest rates low in America. This
combination of falling gas prices and interest rates has amounted
to a huge tax cut for Americans, and with the U.S. economy now
restructured it can take full advantage of these lower input costs.
Japan, Germany and France, by contrast, are still hybrid economies.
They have some truly world-class, restructured, globalized
companies _ like Toyota and Sony _ but also a lot of laggards.
That's why America's markets today have replaced gold as the place
many people want to put their money in times of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   So what could wipe the smile off America's face? Everyone is
waiting for some ``event.'' But there really was no event that
triggered 1929 or October 1987. What America is most vulnerable to
is actually a subtle, collective change in mood _ so the next time
the market dives, instead of lots of people buying on the dip, and
therefore putting a bottom under any market fall, they sell on the
dip. Yes, there are some solid fundamentals underlying America's
strength today, and those competitors and investors who
underestimated them have lost a lot of money. But overestimating
can be just as dangerous. ``Strong'' and ``invulnerable'' are two
different things. That's why the only thing we have to fear is the
lack of fear itself.

POSSIBILITY OF SLASH IN BEER TAX BRINGS DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Richard Neal seems an unlikely
choice to be the chief Democratic sponsor of legislation that would
halve the federal tax on beer. No breweries are in his district,
and Neal says the issue ``really hasn't come up much'' back home in
Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Neal does have two close friends who view him as the perfect
politician to be out front on this issue: House minority leader
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, whose district includes the world's
largest brewer, and Beer Institute lobbyist Raymond McGrath, a
former New York congressman.
</P>
<P>
   The growing prospect that the beer tax paid by brewers will be
halved has alarmed groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
With more than 60 percent of alcohol-related car crashes involving
beer, and with the industry fighting efforts to tighten
drunken-driving laws, MADD president Karolyn Nunnallee predicts a
tax cut would increase underage beer purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This price reduction will go into the profits of the
companies,'' Nunnallee said, noting the tax is paid by brewers, not
directly by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The beer industry, however, casts the tax as a consumer issue.
Anheuser-Busch, for example, is running an advertising campaign
calling for ``instant tax relief for 80 million Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   While the beer makers calculate the tax amounts to 33 cents per
six-pack, industry officials acknowledge that part of the tax cut
might be kept by the companies and shareholders. ``It's our
expection that consumers will indeed see a reduction in the price
of beer,'' Anheuser-Busch said in a statement, but the company
didn't specify the amount.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to cut the beer tax has gained ground in recent weeks
since tobacco legislation was killed in the Senate. Philip Morris
Co., which successfully fought the tobacco bill by focusing on the
cigarette tax hike, also owns the Miller Brewing Co.
</P>
<P>
   The lobbying includes a considerable amount of campaign cash, a
careful blending of class warfare, and the deployment of one of
President Clinton's Arkansas friends to try to win over the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The beer tax increase _ which now brings the Treasury $1.7
billion annually _ has been fought almost from the day it was
approved eight years ago, when former President Bush in 1990 broke
his ``no new taxes'' pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation that doubled the beer levy also raised federal taxes
on luxury items such as yachts, furs and high-priced cars and jets.
Those taxes have since been repealed, leaving only the beer tax
hike, prompting the brewers to complain that beer drinkers have
been left with a tax hike, while the richest Americans no longer
pay higher levies for their luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   Beer industry backers believe this makes a powerful argument for
repealing the tax hike. ``The beer-drinking tax fell among
working-class Americans,'' Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the alcohol industry note that the companies
have been fighting tougher drunk-driving and advertising laws at
the same time they seek a tax cut. ``If you thought tobacco was
tough, this is one of the most powerful lobbies in the country,''
said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, the Massachusetts
Democrat who has battled the industry for years.
</P>
<P>
   In May, beer and liquor lobbyists successfully killed
legislation that would have tightened drunk-driving laws by
lowering the blood-alcohol content limit to .08 percent from .10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Sarasin, a former Connecticut Republican congressman who
heads the National Beer Wholesalers Association, said the tax and
drunk-driving limit are separate issues. He said the industry would
not agree to a compromise that would repeal the beer tax in
exchange for supporting a tougher drunk-driving limit. Lowering the
blood-alcohol limit would mean ``little old ladies at bridge
games'' who consume two glasses of wine would be considered drunk
while driving home, Sarasin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no statistics in the country that show .08 has had a
positive effect,'' Sarasin said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Boston University professor Ralph Hingson has authored
studies that show drunk-driving deaths dropped 16 percent in states
that have adopted the .08 percent limit. Sarasin said he was not
familiar with those statistics.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the beer industry has contributed $1.2 million for the
1998 election cycle, 68 percent to Republicans and 32 percent to
Democrats, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive
Politics.
</P>
<P>
   While Sarasin lobbies for the beer wholesalers, McGrath, the
former Republican congressman, represents the brewers through their
organization, the Beer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said that since he left the House in 1992, ``I have made
it my business in the last three Congresses to visit with every
member of Congress personally.'' It doesn't hurt that McGrath also
is president of the Capitol Hill Club, where many Republicans hold
their fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   The logical Democratic co-sponsor of the bill to lower the beer
tax would be Gephardt, since Anheuser-Busch is based in St. Louis.
But Gephardt declined, even though he supports cutting the tax.
</P>
<P>
   MADD's Nunnallee said Gephardt is closely aligned with the
industry as he considers running for the presidency in 2000. ``We
wish he would take a stand and fight with us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who in 1996 received $6,000 from the beer industry,
declined requests for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Gephardt privately asked Neal to become the chief
Democratic sponsor of the tax cut, according to an individual
familiar with the conversation. Neal declined to comment about his
conversation with Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath of the Beer Institute said he approached Neal. The two
men served together on the House Ways and Means Committee, shared a
locker at the House gym, and remain close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richie Neal is the big co-sponsor,'' McGrath said. ``I asked
him and he said yes. I'm not kidding, he is a very good friend of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal said, ``I am an old friend of Ray McGrath, no question
about that.'' But he added: ``I don't recall a specific
conversation about this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While the legislation has 93 sponsors, Neal is the only one from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The beer industry has contributed $1,500 to Neal this campaign
cycle and $3,500 for the 1996 election. Neal noted that he has
backed separate legislation to toughen drunk-driving laws.
</P>
<P>
   While McGrath works on assembling House supporters, he is
counting on an Arkansan, Mac Carder, to woo Clinton. Carder was
director of Arkansas' Alcohol Beverage Control agency during three
years of Clinton's governorship and is now director of the Beer
Wholesalers Association of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are have been working on a friend of his, Mac Carder,''
McGrath said. ``We are trying to get him to work on Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Carder said he hoped to talk to Clinton about the issue. ``I
don't go around boasting having influence over the president,'' he
said. ``I play it low-key.''

RIVERBOAT GAMBLING HAS GIVEN ONE DYING CITY A SECOND CHANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. _ The Casino Queen riverboat arrived here
five years ago, docking along the grimy river front of what was
then the epitome of a dying American city.
</P>
<P>
   Raw sewage backed up into the streets. Piles of trash shared the
landscape with vacant and burned-out buildings. Murders were
rampant, yet there was not enough money to buy gas for police cars.
The city's debt was so high that when a man who was physically
abused while in jail sued the city in 1990 and won, he was awarded
the deed to the defendant's only asset of value: the building that
housed City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove into town at night and missed the exit off the highway
because there were no lights on downtown,'' recalled Cheryl
Childress, who after leaving East St. Louis 30 years earlier
returned to her hometown in 1993 to become the casino's human
resources director.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the casino changed much of that. While many
regions have turned to casinos to invigorate languid economies,
perhaps no other city in the nation has become so quickly reliant
on casino revenue _ and avoided imminent extinction _ simply by
opening a place where people could gamble legally.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, the Casino Queen, now second only to
the local hospital as the largest employer in East St. Louis, has
brought 1,200 new jobs to this predominately black city of 42,000
people just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. Today,
nearly 50 percent of the city's operating budget comes from tax
revenue generated by the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my city, it's the lifeblood,'' Mayor Gordon W. Bush said
of the four-story, side-wheeler gambling boat that cruises in the
shadow of the famed Gateway Arch in St. Louis. ``If I take away a
month of revenue from the casino, I start missing paydays for city
workers. We fall on our backs without that money.''
</P>
<P>
   As casino gambling has spread across the country, the verdict on
whether it ultimately hurts or helps communities is still out. A
presidential commission is expected to report next June on the
effect that the proliferation of casinos and other forms of
gambling have had on the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The economic advantages of casino gambling are profoundly
evident in places like the Gulfport region of Mississippi, where 62
percent of the 18,000 new jobs created since 1990 were at casinos,
as well as in Joliet, Ill., where two riverboat casinos pay the
third and fourth largest amount of property tax in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But in East St. Louis, the impact of casino gambling has been
dramatic. Once a strutting blue-collar town of stockyards,
meat-packing plants, railroads and after-hour nightclubs, the city
began to decline when its industries stumbled in the 1960s. Its
population _ 82,000 in 1960 _ dwindled as many white residents
moved out. So precipitous was the decline that by the time the
state approved a license for the Casino Queen to open in 1993, few
residents opposed bringing legalized gambling to their community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the ministers who don't like gambling have not been
openly negative about it,'' said Bush, a burly, 55-year-old retired
Army lieutenant colonel who has already announced plans to seek a
third term next year.
</P>
<P>
   East St. Louis is still one of the poorest cities in the United
States, however, and not everyone here is so sanguine about the
gambling boat. Boarded-up buildings still line many streets. And
although half of the casino's jobs have been filled with city
residents, the unemployment rate here remains above 10 percent, and
could be much higher because many of the chronically unemployed are
no longer included in the count.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly heard grievance is that the casino has not
hired enough local people or used enough local vendors. But few
people, even the leaders of the city's more than 100 churches, have
been ardently opposed to the casino itself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rev. Walter Shackelford Jr., pastor of the Rush
Memorial Church of the Nazarene, a small church just east of the
downtown area, said his congregation still sees few benefits from
the casino. ``Since the casino opened, they have put a police
substation in our area,'' Shackelford said. ``But none of my
members or anybody I know of is employed by the casino. We are
still poverty stricken.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The direct impact of the casino, as well as its ripple effect,
is significant, however. The city has used the approximately $9
million it receives in casino tax revenue annually to begin to
reverse its long decline. Broken sewers have been repaired, streets
have been paved and more than 1,200 derelict buildings have been
demolished.
</P>
<P>
   The city's police force has nearly doubled, and now has 98
officers. The number of patrol cars has also doubled, to 73.
Officers now have full medical coverage; several years ago, police
officers had to pay their own medical bills when they were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Crime has decreased in most of the nation's cities, but the 100
percent increase in police protection here has led to an especially
large drop. The number of murders, for example, peaked in 1991 at
68, but so far this year there have been only 14. Firefighters now
have more than $1 million in new equipment, while their ranks have
increased by 35 percent, to 60 firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   More important to the city's sustained survival is that the
estimated 3 million people who visit the casino each year actually
venture into East St. Louis, where people once feared that they
were gambling with their lives if they visited. Casino and police
officials note that no serious crimes have occurred in or near the
casino despite the influx of visitors. This, many people here said,
is changing the city's reputation and causing other businesses to
consider developments in East St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get 3 million people to go somewhere that no one
thought anyone would go to, then obviously there's some opportunity
in that place,'' said Craig Travers, the casino's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who visit the casino come across the river
from Missouri, Travers said. Since it opened in 1993, the Casino
Queen has led the region, which includes six casinos in Illinois
and Missouri, in total gambling revenue. The Casino Queen Inc.,
which last year posted a total revenue of $131.8 million, is
privately owned by five different groups.
</P>
<P>
   And the casino's economic impact continues to grow. One private
developer, Koman Properties, expects to begin construction later
this year on a new supermarket, drugstore and video store. The
company's president is James G. Koman, whose family holds 20
percent of the equity in the Casino Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Another developer is planning a 72-room, $3 million hotel
adjacent to City Hall, and the Union Bank of Illinois is planning
to open a branch across the street. Along the riverfront, the
Casino Queen is breaking ground this year on a 150-room, $15
million hotel and a $5 million entertainment center. And Koman has
been buying land to develop a $22 million golf course on a 200-acre
site next to the casino complex.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 600 city residents who were hired when the Casino Queen
opened, about 35 percent came off the welfare rolls, casino
officials said. Before she started working at the casino five years
ago, Katrina Williams was raising her young daughter alone, earning
$4.10 an hour working part-time at a doctor's office, living in
public housing and receiving welfare checks. Now 32, she has been
promoted several times at the casino and is earning $28,000 as an
employment specialist, screening job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams' life has evolved in a way that casino officials
said has become common among employees. Over the last few years she
has bought a new car, gotten married and bought a house in the
suburbs ``with an in-ground swimming pool and a basketball court,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the mortgage applications that they complete for
employees, casino officials estimated that the casino jobs have
created more than 200 homeowners. But, because of the poor housing
stock and poor schools in East St. Louis, many casino employees
have moved to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and local developers hope that the exodus can be stopped.
Besides the casino tax revenue, another $7 million that the casino
paid to purchase some of its 95-acre riverfront property is also
being used to finance something this city has not seen in years:
the construction of new houses. Sixty new homes have already been
built, and 200 more mixed-income houses are planned.
</P>
<P>
   By renegotiating with its creditors and issuing bonds backed by
the state of Illinois, the city has been able to lower its
outstanding debt from $80 million to about $13 million, Bush said.
In all, the city's operating budget has gone from about $8 million
a year before the casino arrived to $20 million today.
</P>
<P>
   East St. Louis has also regained ownership of City Hall after
appealing the court decision and renegotiating a settlement with
the man who won the lawsuit. On the lampposts lining the street in
front of City Hall, large banners serve as not-too-subtle
remainders of what has made this fiscal rebirth possible.
``Chi-ching,'' one banner reads. ``Jackpot,'' says another.

MINISTER ACCUSED IN BELT-THRASHING OF SON GOES TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT AND DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lisa Cobble believes something is wrong, but it is not
that her ex-husband disciplines their son by using a belt. To
Cobble, the Massachusetts Department of Social Services was wrong
when it concluded last year that Pastor Donald R. Cobble had abused
his son by using corporal punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Cobble, an assistant minister at the non-denominational
Christian Teaching and Worship Center in Woburn, wants a Suffolk
Superior Court judge to overturn the DSS finding that spanking his
physically handicapped son, Judah, was child abuse. The DSS also
found Lisa Cobble neglected their 11-year-old son because she did
not stop the corporal punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Cobble, through his attorney, Robert Sherman, argues DSS
is violating his right to practice his religious and parental
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's my God-given responsibility, as well as my
God-given right, that if I love my son to train him up and teach
him what's right,'' said Donald Cobble, citing the Book of
Proverbs. ``And part of that is corporal punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobble said Monday he has gone to court to clear his name.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobbles said in separate interviews that Donald Cobble uses
a belt to punish Judah only rarely and slaps his clothed buttocks
once or twice, depending on his actions. Judah Cobble, who is now
11, has a muscular birth defect that requires he wear braces on
both legs and a back brace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donny loves Judah more than anyone on the face of this
earth,'' Lisa Cobble said in a telephone interview. ``I don't see
anything wrong because I know what Donny has done. It's not abuse.
Abuse is so much different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cobbles became enmeshed with DSS in March 1997 when Judah
Cobble was attending a Peabody elementary school. Judah, who has
Attention Deficit Disorder and other educational challenges,
reported being fearful of going home because his father would
``beat'' him for poor behavior in school.
</P>
<P>
   That triggered a DSS investigation, which substantiated the
finding of abuse and led to the recommendation that Donald Cobble
not be alone with his son until Judah Cobble turns 18 years old.
But no action was ever taken against the Cobbles by the DSS, which
closed the case in June 1997 when the Cobbles balked at following
the DSS recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The parents said each of them continues to take part in Judah's
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Unlike a few other states, Massachusetts does not provide an
exemption for corporal punishment under its child abuse law. But
exactly where the line falls between acceptable physical punishment
and child abuse is unclear, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Social Services spokeswoman Lorraine Carli said
state regulations require abuse reports to be substantiated if a
social worker believes a caretaker's action has hurt a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using a belt repeatedly on a child, you are causing a
substantial risk of injury, which can include swelling and
bruising,'' said Carli. She added, however, despite Cobble's public
pronouncements that he would strike his son again if the need
arose, the agency would not reopen the case unless it had evidence
he hit the boy again.
</P>
<P>
   Specialists in family violence and child protection said there
is growing research showing that corporal punishment, especially
severe forms, can damage children. Children who are punished
physically tend to be more violent, have lower IQs, do poorly in
school, be more anxious and fearful, and have lower self-esteem,
the specialists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think parents should be striking children for any
reason,'' said David Finkelhor, director of the University of New
Hampshire's Center for Research on Crimes against Children. ``The
research is becoming increasingly clear that physical abuse has
longterm negative consequences.''

72-YEAR-OLD YOUNG TURK IN JAPAN'S RACE FOR PREMIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Courting world opinion is not something most Japanese
politicians are good at or consider important to their success, but
Seiroku Kajiyama, one of three candidates to become the next prime
minister, took a stab at it on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama held a news conference for foreign reporters at the
governing party's headquarters, an event about as common in
Japanese politics as the passing of Haley's comet. He fielded
questions about his policy proposals, addressed the issue of his
age _ he is 72 _ and otherwise explained himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a chance to burnish his image in the West as a forceful
leader and in turn to influence the party leaders' choice. His
effort to get his message heard beyond Japan is yet another measure
of how bizarre, by traditional standards, the current political
race has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a genius to figure out that international
markets are having an influence on who will be picked as the prime
minister here,'' said John Neuffer, a political analyst at the
Mitsui Marine Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that there is such public lobbying is extraordinary.
The choice of the governing Liberal Democratic Party has
traditionally emerged from smoke-filled rooms after long hours of
political wrangling among the powerful heads of the party factions.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, who was widely
regarded as a shoo-in to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto as prime
minister, found himself confronted with a competitor from his own
faction _ Kajiyama _ later joined by Junichiro Koizumi, a popular
upstart.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto's resignation on July 13 was itself a surprise, forced
by an angry electorate that reduced the size of the Liberal
Democrats' delegation in the upper house of Parliament and by
younger party members suddenly emboldened by the fear that they
would lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that two televised debates on Sunday and Kajiyama's press
conference Monday, and it appears that Japanese politics have
fallen through the looking glass.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama is keenly aware of Japan's global profile. He
repeatedly noted the importance of a Japanese economic recovery to
Asia and the rest of the world, including the United States and
Russia. ``Japan has to take responsibility for the position it has
in the global economy,'' he said, a statement that echoed comments
by U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing his age, he said that if Japan could not turn
itself around during his lifetime, it would be in ``grave
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He sought to soften his image as a loose cannon. In 1990, when
Kajiyama was justice minister, he ordered a roundup of foreign
prostitutes in the Shinjuku area of downtown Tokyo, saying they
``ruin the atmosphere'' and comparing them to blacks moving into
white neighborhoods in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The comment, he said Monday, ``reflected my ignorance at that
time, because I grew up in a village where we did not have
different ethnic groups.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Japan, we have an adage, `A pheasant would not be shot if
it had not crowed,''' he said. ``If I hadn't become a candidate, no
one would have said anything about this, and I knew that but
decided to run anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is precisely Kajiyama's willingness to open his mouth
that has landed him in the unlikely position as a contender for
party president, who automatically becomes prime minister because
of the Liberal Democratic majority in Parliament's lower house.
</P>
<P>
   He has vigorously criticized Japan's shaky banking system and
the government's efforts to repair it, reversed his commitment to
fiscal austerity and accused the powerful finance ministry of
obfuscation and violation of trust.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kajiyama clearly sees shoring up the country's faltering
financial system as his primary goal. For that, he is the darling
of world financial markets, which seem to regard Obuchi, the
leading contender, as a sign of more of the same dithering that was
seen during Hashimoto's reign.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama says the government's recently announced ``total plan''
for fixing the nation's financial system would serve as a basis for
resuscitating Japan's debt-laden banks, although he suggests that
the plan does not go far enough because it lacks two critical
elements: forced disclosure of the extent of the banks' problem
loans and a plan for final disposition of the bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Similar criticism has been leveled by foreign analysts, several
of whom Kajiyama consults regularly.
</P>
<P>
   But Kajiyama faces an uphill battle by most calculations.
Koizumi threatens to lure away younger party members who would
otherwise throw their support to him. But party rules require a
runoff election should any candidate fail to win a majority, so a
pure Obuchi-Kajiyama face-off is still a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama tried to enhance his image as a reformer Monday when
asked to handicap his chances. ``I cannot destroy the unity of the
LDP factions by myself,'' Kajiyama said of the party that has run
Japan for most of the last 40 years. ``With Koizumi, who is very
strong, running, we can destroy that.''

   IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE (Chinantla, Mexico) _ Almost every migration
story is the psychodrama of a family. For the Cruz family of
Chinantla, Mexico, it is also the story of a town. Like many modern
immigrant families, those from Chinantla straddle a border, abetted
by newly inexpensive air fares and now, by a new Mexican law that
allows them to retain their Mexican nationality as U.S. citizens
and even confers it on their American-born children. The story of
Chinantla is a multigenerational saga of a pueblito that has been
bled of its working-age population through a half-century of
emigration. Yet it has not faded but flourished, a would-be ghost
town kept alive by emigrants who consider the place a state of
mind, an affair of the heart and their spiritual anchor. By Deborah
Sontag.

NO LONGER SERVING OTHERS, JULICH HAS SIGHTS ON VICTORY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAU, France _ When a handful of low-ranked riders went on a long
breakaway on Monday in the Tour de France, Bobby Julich stayed
behind. Joining breakaways to protect your team's interests is the
work of a domestique, a servant, and this year Julich is anything
but.
</P>
<P>
   After his 17th-place finish in the last Tour, his fourth-place
finish in the prologue in Dublin this year and his third-place
finish in the long individual time trial on Saturday, this is the
new, improved Bobby Julich, now a co-leader of Cofidis, a team
based in France. His domestique days are over.
</P>
<P>
   He is careful to be politic in defining his role: ``I expect to
be strong enough to support Francesco Casagrande,'' the nominal
team leader, ``in the mountains and to finish better than I did
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that Julich is in seventh place over all just before the
mountains, where he is expected to shine, his goals are bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is only my second Tour and I'm still learning,'' he said
on Monday morning before the ninth of the 21 daily stages, 130
steamy miles from Montauban to Pau, the doorstep to the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning is all that matters,'' the 26-year-old native of
Glenwood Springs, Colo., said. ``I may not win the Tour de France
this year, but I hope to win it in the future. You put these
experiences in the bank and learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Julich protected his standing by crossing the line 31st on
Monday in the same time as all the other major contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Less fortunate was another American rider who had been in the
top 10. Tyler Hamilton of Brookline, Mass., and the U.S. Postal
Service team suffered heatstroke as the temperature reached 104
degrees, and he lost 18 minutes 18 seconds. He fell to 160th among
the 168 riders left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he was gone, would have to drop out,'' said a
teammate, Marty Jemison of Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini did drop out on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The winner after a 106-mile breakaway was Leon van Bon, a
Dutchman with Rabobank, who beat Jens Voigt, a German with Gan, by
half a wheel in the time of 5 hours 21 minutes 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Third was Massimiliano Lelli, an Italian with Cofidis, who
stayed with the breakaway in case it gained so much time that it
took the yellow jersey away from his teammate Laurent Desbiens of
France. In that case, the team would have another rider at or near
the top.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the heroic efforts of Voigt, however, the main pack
finished just 12 seconds behind. The breakaway's lead topped out at
just over four minutes, which was no threat to Desbiens.
</P>
<P>
   Voigt did most of the work over the rolling course, frequently
dousing his head with water from bottles passed to him by fans. He
started the final sprint about 200 meters from the finish and could
not quite hold off van Bon.
</P>
<P>
   Desbiens retained the overall lead by 14 seconds over Andrea
Tafi, an Italian with Mapei, who twice tried to speed away but
failed. Third was Jacky Durand, a Frenchman with Casino, 43 seconds
behind. They all should fade early in the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   Julich knew on Monday morning that if a breakaway occurred, he
was not expected to chase it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not my job today,'' he said. ``My job is tomorrow.''
The riders who dropped out on Monday face four big climbs on
Tuesday and four more on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the mountains,'' Julich said, noting
that he lost 22 minutes last year in the first day of climbing in
the Pyrenees. ``Last year, I was scared of them.'' He came back
strong after the first stage, especially in the Alps and the last
long time trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was a question of morale,'' he said. ``I was
very nervous last year in the first two weeks, but this year from
the start I've felt very relaxed and very motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Many riders are jolted when the race ends its traditional first
week on the flat and starts uphill. Jan Ullrich, the defending
champion, is expected to have trouble on Tuesday because weight
problems limited his training and racing during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object was to get ready for the mountains,'' Julich said.
``This year, I'm ready for them, I think. I hope.''

   NEW YORK _ Put some of the world's smartest math scholars
together with the fastest computers. Give them a wealth of
historical data and a few billion dollars. Do they have a chance of
predicting swings in the stock market?
</P>
<P>
   David Shaw, a computer-science professor turned Wall Street
trader, believes that his chances are not much better than the odds
of picking red or black correctly in roulette. Shaw has all the
tools at his disposal _ the brains, the computers, the data and the
money. But each time his secret algorithms spot a buy or sell
opportunity in stocks or bonds, he figures his chances of making
money are only marginally better than if he flips a coin.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw is a quant, or a quantitative trader, who uses algorithmic
and statistical analysis of market data the way other investors use
research on individual companies and instinct.
</P>
<P>
   He is among the most successful of a generation of scholars who
have left their ivory towers in the last 20 years to try their
skills at hedge funds and big investment banks. A great deal of
fanfare greeted their arrival on Wall Street, with some analysts
predicting that mathematical models would revolutionize the way
money is made or lost in the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   It has not. Math has made a few multimillionaires, including
Shaw. But the quant business has become a highly specialized and
professional one _ small, competitive and, only sometimes, a
lucrative way to manage money.
</P>
<P>
   Quant funds now control perhaps 5 percent of all the money
invested in stocks, and a greater part of the speculative capital
invested in futures and options.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few people make a good living playing the
stock-market numbers game. Fads that once gripped the imaginations
of quant traders, like chaos theory and its hoped-for applicability
to modeling the market, have faded. And some of the most prominent
names in quantitative-oriented proprietary trading, like Salomon
Smith Barney, are getting out of the business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few people have done well but the majority of people have
not and many have been forced out,'' Shaw said. ``If we had not
gotten in early, it probably would not be possible to break in at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   That sober analysis does not match the popular image, most
recently embodied in the brilliant but disturbed hero of the movie
``Pi.'' Convinced that numbers lie at the heart of everything in
the universe and aided by an advanced silicon chip, Max Cohen, the
lead character in the independently produced film that won a top
prize at the Sundance Film Festival, discovers a number that
unlocks the secrets of the Torah, the infinitely variable game of
Go and stock-price movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are patterns everywhere in nature: the cycle of disease
epidemics, caribou populations in the Arctic, sunspot cycles, the
rise and fall of the Nile,'' the obsessive Max says in one of the
movie's philosophical monologues. ``Within the stock market, there
are patterns as well, right in front of me. Always have been.''
</P>
<P>
   That's fiction, of course, but not fantasy. A British
hydrologist, pondering the mysterious repetition of droughts and
floods on the Nile at the turn of the century produced the theory
that seemingly random events, like the roll of the dice and the
flip of a coin, are not necessarily perfectly random.
</P>
<P>
   He was H.E. Hurst, and his contribution to statistics is the
Hurst exponent, which measures the probability that one event _
like a flood or a surge in the Standard &AMP; Poors 500 stock index _
is likely to closely follow a similar event.
</P>
<P>
   This theory, with many mutations, lies at the heart of
quantitative active trading strategies today. No serious quant
trader aspires to predict tomorrow's price of, say, Ford Motor
shares. But most rely on computers that take into account many
variables, like economic conditions, analysts' recommendations,
sales and profit growth, interest rates and the money supply, to
help identify anomalies in market prices that might provide
opportunities for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Take a hypothetical example. By analyzing stock-market history,
a quant trader might conclude that Ford shares tend to move in
tandem with those of General Motors. That is not a big surprise,
given that both companies make mass-market cars and trucks, selling
a lot of them in the United States. But for any number of reasons,
the shares may not always move together, with one company's shares
rising or falling faster than the other's.
</P>
<P>
   Computers can spot when such anomalies occur and recommend ways
_ known as arbitrage _ to exploit that inefficiency. A trader might
buy shares in the laggard or sell short the forerunner, or try the
reverse in a falling market.
</P>
<P>
   The universe of quantitative traders seeking to exploit such
loopholes is diverse. Barclays Global Investors, based in San
Francisco, has some $95 billion in actively managed quantitative
funds. Fidelity and PanAgora Asset Management, both located in
Boston, run some mutual funds that use quantitative techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Big investment banks, including Morgan Stanley Dean Witter,
Swiss Bank Corp., and Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, at least
dabble in quant trading, as do at least a dozen big private hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The field has attracted some of the most formidable minds in
math and economics. Robert Merton and Myron Scholes, who won the
Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1997 for their work on
options pricing, are partners in a hedge fund based in Greenwich,
Conn.: Long Term Capital Management, which is run by John
Meriwether. Doyne Farmer, a physics scholar, runs the hopefully
named Prediction Co. in Santa Fe, N.M., backed by Swiss Bank.

</P>
<P>
   Among them is Shaw, who left Columbia University to set up his
own company. He works from a self-consciously un-buttoned-down
office in midtown New York, where young traders dress in beach
clothes and sandals and the walls are back-lighted in green neon.
</P>
<P>
   Though Shaw employs some 1,050 people, none visits companies or
reads stock reports. Instead, Shaw deploys some $1.7 billion to
exploit inefficiencies identified by the company's computer
calculations, trading shares in volumes that can account for more
than 5 percent of the daily turnover of the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Some people familiar with Shaw's operations said he had
consistently made solid returns in both up markets and down markets
_ approaching 25 percent annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But even Shaw sees the limits of quantitative trading.
Predictably, he does not want to call attention to his track
record, lest he attract more imitators. But that fear illustrates
the point that his trading formulas, however secret, are usually
absorbed by the market over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inefficiencies we identify are very small, and we have a
small edge that gives us a small amount of predictive value some of
the time,'' he says. Moreover, he says that his company does not
need more money, because if it throws its financial weight around
too much in pursuit of its small-margin arbitrage opportunities,
they tend to disappear even more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the fastest-growing part of D.E. Shaw is not
proprietary trading _ buying and selling for its own account _ but
arranging trades for big institutional clients.
</P>
<P>
   The market inconsistencies the company seeks to capitalize on
are so small that trading costs often make the difference between
profits and losses. So it has become skilled at buying and selling
large blocks of securities at low prices and without disrupting the
market, a skill it now offers to many nonquant clients.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's experience is not unique. Secret quantitative-trading
strategies, when they work at all, do not usually work for long.
One limiting factor is competition. If one trader seems to be
making a great deal of money buying Ford shares and shorting
General Motors, others will sooner or later figure out why, and end
the arbitrage opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that historical trends are not reliable
predictors of future events, though they might hold true for a
while. Under the hypothetical Ford-GM scenario, Ford might hire an
innovative chief executive who overhauls production methods and
catapults the company well beyond GM, earning the Ford shares a
market premium and justifying a disparity that history dictated
should not exist. Computers running algorithms fail to anticipate
such fundamental shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Sorensen, head of quantitative research for Salomon Smith
Barney, says that some kinds of such statistical arbitrage work
well in stable markets but fall apart when the market changes
course abruptly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like flying _ boring for nine or 10 hours _ then you
suddenly hit a storm,'' Sorensen said. ``In good times you can work
out a routine, make a little bit of money reliably. But you lose
lots of money when a big event changes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Salomon itself worries about such sudden shifts. Once known as
one of Wall Street's largest proprietary traders of debt
instruments, it has de-emphasized its ``black box'' secretive
computer-trading strategies. Salomon earlier this month closed its
high-flying bond-arbitrage operation, citing losses. But it and
many other big investment banks still try to keep current on
quantitative-trading theories.
</P>
<P>
   People who follow hedge-fund investments say many quants that
play in the mortgage-backed securities market _ including Long Term
Capital, which is reportedly down about 15 percent this year after
four years of strong gains, have recently suffered sharp losses.
These people attributed the losses to unexpected swings in the rate
at which homeowners repay their mortgages. Long Term Capital
officials declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such setbacks, some experts in the field still contend
that it is only a matter of time before computers running
mathematical models replace human judgment as the dominant force in
stock picking.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the unexpectedly slow development of quantitative
trading supports a long-held but hard-to-prove belief about stock
markets, especially the United States' extraordinarily deep ones:
They are formidably efficient, meaning that stock prices are fair
reflections of what the investing public will pay for shares at any
given moment.
</P>
<P>
   Any opportunities to profit from a difference between a share
price and what the market will really pay are so limited, and
shrinking, that the quest is ultimately doomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of some Holy Grail strategy that works a majority of
the time is nice, but it is just a dream,'' says Edgar Peters, a
quantitative strategist with Panagora. Good thing, too. Because if
Peters has it right, any market that allows a small number of smart
people to make a disproportionate share of the profits cannot last
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone could really predict with any degree of
reliability,'' he added, ``the market would die.''

DOCTOR'S TESTIMONY BOLSTERS PROSECUTION'S CASE AGAINST FORMER
CADET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ A doctor who examined Diane Zamora two
days after the murder of Adrianne Jones testified Monday that the
ex-midshipman's left hand was too weak to produce the squeeze marks
that were found on the victim's neck.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's hand had been severely injured in a wreck three months
before the murder, plastic surgeon Scott Kasden explained. His
testimony bolstered prosecutors' contentions that the bruises were
caused by another person: Zamora's co-defendant, former Air Force
Academy cadet David Graham of Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth day of Graham's capital murder trial here.
Zamora was convicted of the same charge in Fort Worth in February
and is serving a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Although he and Zamora both initially confessed to killing
Jones, Graham now claims he was not present and that his
then-fiancee singlehandedly killed the 16-year-old Mansfield girl
Dec. 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim Graham grabbed Jones' throat before fatally
shooting her at the jealous Zamora's insistence _ a slaying that
was supposed to make Jones pay for a sexual encounter with Graham.
According to a medical examiner's testimony last week, the marks on
Jones' neck most likely were produced by a strong man's left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to show Zamora could have committed the crime entirely by
herself, even without using her left hand, defense attorney Dan
Cogdell attempted a courtroom demonstration that seemed to backfire
because of the awkward contortions it required.
</P>
<P>
   Kasden, a Fort Worth surgeon who was attending Zamora after the
fall 1995 accident, focused on his treatment of the injured hand.
He said that on the day of the murder, Zamora had ``only one good
hand,'' her right.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for an opinion, he said Cogdell and co-counsel
Catherine Baen did not create a plausible scenario for Jones' neck
injuries when Baen tried to throttle Cogdell with her right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at her (Baen), the way she has to contort herself,
it's very unfavorable mechanically,'' Kasden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my opinion that (Zamora) could not have generated enough
force in her (right) hand.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, prosecutors have produced only circumstantial evidence
that Graham, 20, was at the murder scene in rural Tarrant County.
Graham's handgun, found in his attic, has been verified as the
murder weapon and bloodstains from Zamora's car, which Graham
frequently drove, were verified as coming from Jones through DNA
tests that also were entered into evidence Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Also backing the prosecution theory was crime-scene consultant
Max Courtney, who collected evidence for the Grand Prairie police.
Over several visits, he gathered bloodstains at the crime scene and
inside Zamora's car. Based on his analysis, Courtney concluded that
there were two assailants and that Jones bled inside the car, then
got out and made her own way to a barbed-wire fence, where she was
cut while crossing it.
</P>
<P>
   Jones collapsed a few feet away in a grassy area, bleeding on
the ground, Courtney said. She got up and fell flat on her back,
where she was then shot twice in the face. A gun expert earlier
testified the two blasts came from distances of 18 inches and 3
inches.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Jones was slain after she was driven to the
secluded spot by Zamora and Graham, who at the time were seniors in
Crowley and Mansfield high schools, respectively, and were engaged
to be married. They were arrested nine months later, based on
Zamora's confessions to schoolmates at the U.S. Naval Academy in
Annapolis, Md. Graham now claims his own confession was bogus, an
attempt to cover up Zamora's crime.
</P>
<P>
   In Zamora's trial earlier this year, prosecutors alleged that
she urged Graham to kill Jones to atone for having had a one-time
sexual encounter with Jones. But in this trial, prosecutors and
Cogdell both have stated that there never was an intimate
relationship between Jones and Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Because prosecutors are not seeking the death penalty, Graham
faces life imprisonment if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not yet shown jurors the confessions made by
Zamora and Graham. They expect to complete their presentation this
week.

ABC WOOS THE FASHION SET  
 A STYLE DIRECTOR RESIGNS  
 MANUFACTURING IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the Oscar ceremony in March, the No. 1 question
on the fingertips of browsers on ABC television's Web site was:
Where did the stars get their clothes?
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ABC plans to begin its coverage next year a
half-hour earlier to focus on things like what the stars are
wearing. And on Thursday, the network plans three hours of fashion
programming, starting at 8 p.m. with a special repackaging of four
previously run pieces and continuing at 9 with ``The World Fashion
Premiere From Paris,'' focusing on this week's haute couture shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible that there's no fashion on broadcast TV,''
Michael P. Davies, the executive vice president for alternative
series and specials for ABC Entertainment, said Monday. ``We don't
expect this to be incredible ratings, but we do believe that the
upscale women 18-49 will tune in to this.''
</P>
<P>
   A native Briton, Davies is warm to the notion of capturing a
fashion audience for ABC and plans to develop more shows. England
has had several successful series on the subject, like ``The
Clothes Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC will present the haute couture as an event, not a wardrobe
how-to. If it can show the connection between couture and what's in
the stores, there will be an audience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion shows fill the need for inexpensive programming, he
said, and that is one reason that cable networks like E! got there
first. ``They can deal with getting by on a very small audience,''
he said. ``There's a lot of available footage of runways shows, the
television station never has to stage an event, and fashion is very
visual.''
</P>
<P>
   A STYLE DIRECTOR RESIGNS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long Nguyen, who helped make Detour magazine one of
fashion's most stylish publications, has resigned as its style
director. A successor has not been named.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen said he left because the magazine had asked him to tone
down some aspects of its photo shoots, like nudity, and to include
more advertisers. ``The problem became that management at
supermarkets couldn't understand what the magazine is for,'' he
said. ``They said it was irrelevant to them. It has to be
irrelevant to them to be relevant to our reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Turner, the editor in chief, who is also leaving Detour, did
not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Detour has lured celebrities for its covers and top
photographers like David LaChapelle, Jean-Baptiste Mondino and
Paolo Reversi.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is looking for investors to begin a new magazine, Flaunt.
</P>
<P>
   MANUFACTURING IN NEW YORK
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With most of the country's apparel made overseas, it
is rare to find a manufacturer that thrives in New York City. One
company that does, 148 Lafayette _ at 148 Lafayette St., in
Chinatown _ has hired Edward Wilkerson, formerly of Donna Karan, as
its head designer.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing in the United States has given advantages to the
company, owned by Deirdre Quinn and Shun and Ida Siu, a couple who
also own Tech Sew and Uniart. Together, they are one of the largest
apparel makers in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The label, in stores like Bloomingdale's and Saks Fifth Avenue,
has grown from $6 million in sales in 1997 to a projected $15
million this year, Ms. Quinn said. Its biggest benefit is that it
is able to wait for orders before going into production.
</P>
<P>
   The company sees more potential in wholesale than retail. It
closed a shop last winter in Paramus, N.J., and plans to shut one
in White Plains soon. Its third store, in the World Financial
Center, will stay open as a litmus test for fashion concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson, whose first line will be for spring 1999, is expected
to bring a designer gloss to the line. He said that the bridge
customer, primarily a professional, wants more than the wide
armholes, too much fabric on the side, big buttons and wide collars
that characterize the bridge jacket. ``Even the career woman wants
some edge,'' he said.

 &HT;    New TV miniseries taking a literary bent
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Television is getting downright highbrow.
Next thing you know, David Letterman's gonna come out one night
wearing the flowing black robes of an Oxford don.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the miniseries ``Gulliver's Travels,'' ``The
Odyssey,'' ``Moby Dick'' and ``Merlin'' over the past two seasons
has led to a new flowering of literary classics on TV and not just
on their familiar home, PBS. NBC will air an adaptation of
Dostoevsky's ``Crime and Punishment'' this fall, as well as a
stylized version of Shakespeare's ``The Tempest'' set in the Civil
War South. Also in the works: a 12-hour adaptation of the Bible,
Lewis Carroll's ``Alice in Wonderland'' and the story of Noah's
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the way back to the classics is Robert Halmi Sr., the
producer who made ``Scarlett,'' the ``Gone With the Wind'' sequel,
an engaging combination of Barnumesque promoter and visionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Television took the books out of children's hands, so we owe
it to them to give them back,'' Halmi says.
</P>
<P>
   Only about two seasons ago, TV was cluttered with cheap, junky
movies, frequently about teenage girls facing sexual assault, with
actual titles like ``Coed Call Girl'' and ``Mother, May I Sleep
With Danger?'' While those movies haven't vanished completely, the
networks have cut down on the number of made-for-TV movies they air
each week and have definitely seen that a little class can find an
audience, particularly when spiced with special effects as ''The
Tempest'' will be.
</P>
<P>
   Or as NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield exults,
slightly tongue-in-cheek, ``Shakespeare, baby! We're talkin' about
Shakespeare!''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the TV version of ``The Tempest'' will use mainly the
plot and little of its Elizabethan language, says Peter Fonda, who
stars as Gideon Prosper, the Prospero role.
</P>
<P>
   Still, don't get too stuck on yourself as a higbrow viewer just
yet. Halmi says his version of ``Crime and Punishment'' has to run
two hours since it's on NBC, and that if he were doing it for the
BBC, it would probably run four to six.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attention span (of a U.S. viewer) is probably a tenth of
any European's,'' Halmi says.

 &HT;    Coke's U.S. bottlers go into meeting on positive note
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a combination celebration, pep rally, business
review and planning meeting. And Jack Stahl, president of Coca-Cola
U.S.A., will be leading the cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're coming into this meeting when our bottling system and
our business system is as strong as it's ever been,'' said Stahl,
who will preside over the company's annual meeting with its U.S.
bottlers today at Atlanta's Cobb Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is to empower the troops to help hit the company's
goal of selling the average U.S. consumer more than 400, 8 ounce
Coca-Cola beverages a year by the turn of the century _ up from 376
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl thinks the company will reach that target ``in this year
or the next,'' and crank up U.S. per-capita consumption to 500, 8
ounce drinks by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's network of bottlers will play a vital role in
reaching that goal, through infrastructure and marketing
investments designed to create what Stahl calls ``a 360-degree
Coca-Cola landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to create a win-win strategy, where bottlers and the
parent company both benefit in the form of increased sales and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bottlers control their destiny. They own the business,'' Stahl
said. ``They can choose to invest aggressively, and that is the
desired objective. That's what we're trying to do _ to get
aggressive investment in the business.''
</P>
<P>
   That investment, however, is becoming more difficult for some of
Coca-Cola's U.S. bottlers to shoulder, contributing to a growing
consolidation in the bottling industry.
</P>
<P>
   Though Stahl says consolidation won't be addressed in a
significant way at today's meeting, it's a hot topic among
bottlers. Representatives from about a third of the 105 U.S.
Coca-Cola bottlers on Sunday gathered to hear Marion B. Glover, an
Atlanta-based investment banker who specializes in the soft-drink
industry, talk about the economics of remaining in the Coca-Cola
system.
</P>
<P>
   The hard facts, Glover said, are that the top 10 U.S. bottlers
account for 91.4 percent of domestic volume. Many of the remaining
U.S. bottlers are handling such comparatively small volumes that
their profit margins have been squeezed _ an average decrease of 32
percent between 1993 and 1997, Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profits per case are really only significant for the over
20 million-cases-a-year bottler,'' he said. ``There's about a 50
cent-a-case profit difference between the large bottler and the
small bottler.''
</P>
<P>
   Glover's prediction: ``There will be fewer outstanding
small-to-medium bottler performers. Most marginal performers will
make more by selling than staying.''
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of hungry buyers. One is Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola Enterprises, which Coca-Cola spun off in 1986. CCE, the
largest of Coca-Cola's 10 ``anchor bottlers,'' handles about 70
percent of Coca-Cola's U.S. volume, up from 38 percent in its first
year of operation.
</P>
<P>
   CCE has spent $12 billion in bottler acquisitions since 1986,
including its recent $1.1 billion purchase of Coke Southwest, the
country's fifth-largest bottler.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte-based Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, which is
publicly traded, also is among those eyeing acquisitions, said
Robert D. Pettus Jr., executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do as many as we can profitably. That might be one or
two, or that might be 10,'' Pettus said. ``We want to continue to
grow both externally and internally.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his company might be considered bait to bigger fishes
like Coke Consolidated or CCE, M. Trevor Messinger said Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. of the Black Hills, in Rapid City, S.D., isn't ready
to cash in. In fact, it's trying to improve its economies of scale
by buying other small bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Messinger, a 27-year-old third-generation bottler who is vice
president and chief operating officer for the company, said he
never really thought seriously about doing anything other than
joining the family business. ``I don't know any other business that
gives such good returns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl acknowledges that consolidation will continue to be an
issue for the company's bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will choose to reap the value by selling their
businesses,'' he said. ``Historically, bottlers who have chosen to
work most closely with the Coca-Cola Co. and to align themselves
with the system have done extremely well. Bottlers themselves make
these choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, they'll learn about promotions for the next 18 months and
brand strategies for capturing growth _ even in markets like
Lexington, Tenn., with the nation's highest annual per-capita
consumption rate, at 732.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity is pretty infinite,'' said Andrew P. Angle,
general manager of Coca-Cola USA Operations.
</P>
<P>
   Market-by-market meetings will follow, with goals and strategies
set to maximize sales in each market.

 &HT;    Net.B(at)nk posts first profitable quarter
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Net.B(at)nk, the holding company for Atlanta Internet
bank, announced its second-quarter earnings Monday and reported the
company had its first profitable quarter since going public in
July, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ending June 30, the company reported pretax
profits of $240,000 or 4 cents per share, compared with a $1.4
million pretax loss or 11 cents per share during the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Interest income for the second quarter was $4.2 million compared
with none for the same period last year. Non-interest income for
the period was $104,000, up from a loss of $37 in the same quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Total assets were $246.7 million, compared with $965,000 during
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Non-interest expenses remained relatively stable with a loss of
$1.4 million in the second quarter, compared with a loss of
$1,383,000 one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Net.B(at)nk announced it had 12,000 customers. In the
second quarter, the bank reported a 45 percent increase in the
number of deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Because it does business exclusively over the Web with no
branches or tellers, Net.B(at)nk and other ``branchless banks'' can
offer better interest rates than many conventional banks.
</P>
<P>
   Net.B(at)nk President and Chief Executive Officer D.R. Grimes
said in a statement, ``Net.B(at)nk is the only Internet bank to
achieve profitability. This financial milestone is significant not
only for banking but also for electronic commerce in general.''
</P>
<P>
   John B. Moore, analyst with Interstate/Johnson Lane in
Charlotte, said the 4 cents per share profit the bank made from
operations was significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a young bank that's a year old that's profitable, and
that's significant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It usually takes a bank two years to become profitable. I
think in this quarter they passed a significant milestone by
achieving profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Net.B(at)nk stock closed at $2987 1/2 Monday, up $2.62 1/2.

GOVERNMENT TROOPS RETAKE KOSOVO TOWN FROM REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MIKE O'CONNOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Heavily armed ethnic Albanian rebels
looked down from the hills on the north side of this city on Sunday
and proclaimed the ferocious fighting below to be the death rattle
of Serbian control and the beginning of their new strategy of
taking and holding large towns.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Serbian officers on the hills to the south said they
had retaken this city of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of gunfire and the casual attitude of most of the
Serbian troops now in trenches that a day earlier had protected
guerrillas gave reason to suspect that for the moment the rebel
strategy had been blunted.
</P>
<P>
   But one Serbian commander's description of conditions in the
city may apply to much of the province of Kosovo, where 90 percent
of the people are Albanian and most of them seem to want
independence: ``I can assure you that the government is in 100
percent control of the whole city, everywhere,'' said the officer,
Capt. Milan Sipka. ``But it would not be safe to go in there unless
you have an armored personnel carrier.''
</P>
<P>
   Commanders of the ethnic Albanian fighters say they have
artillery and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles that could give
them far greater ability to attack government forces or to defend
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian officers say they think the rebels, who have formed the
Kosovo Liberation Army, probably have at least some artillery
pieces. ``I can't confirm that absolutely,'' Sipka said, ``but from
the sounds of the weapons used against us and the type of
explosions, we think it was artillery.''
</P>
<P>
   Troops from the Serbian interior ministry who counterattacked
the ethnic Albanian forces here displayed shoulder-fired rocket
launchers, heavy machine guns and an anti-aircraft gun they said
they had found in the captured rebel positions. Officers said some
of the weapons and ammunition were from China, and the weapons did
bear markings that appeared to be Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Orahovac was attacked by the Kosovo Liberation Army over the
weekend. Its population is almost entirely Albanian, with Serbian
policemen and officials in the government offices and the hospital,
which were the rebel targets. Late Monday night, after the
government troops' counterattack, Albanian journalists in the area
reported a large flow of refugees toward the north. Those reports
could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   There are perhaps 2,000 ethnic Serbian residents of Orahovac. On
Monday police officials said about 35 Serbian civilians had not
been accounted for. Officials said they suspected that at least
some had been taken by the rebels as prisoners, though they said
they had no concrete evidence. Serbian officers said one police
officer had been killed in the counterattack but that they knew of
no deaths among Serbian civilians.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, 70 ethnic Albanian women and children huddled
in one corner of a gas station in a single quivering mass.
Government troops who had detained them during the counterattack
stood nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're housewives with children,'' said Sevdia Hoxa, a white
scarf over her grey hair. ``We don't know what is happening. We
spent the last three days in the basements of our homes with our
children and grandchildren and nothing to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words came slowly, her knowledge of Serbian limited; many
ethnic Albanians cannot speak Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting stopped just about an hour ago, and the soldiers
brought us here,'' said a woman who would not give her name as two
of her small children held her. ``What will they do to us now?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their fears, the women said they had been given fruit
juice and milk for their children. And an hour later the
authorities began to release some of the women and children.
</P>
<P>
   In a small room of the gas station, some 40 ethnic Albanian men
sat on the floor, their knees to their chests, their heads down in
despair. They said they were civilians, but most seemed
able-bodied. None had been mistreated, but an intense terror
radiated from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As Serbian forces inched in to retake Orahovac, they also moved
toward an area north of the town that is a stronghold of the Kosovo
Liberation Army. But in the ethnic Albanian villages through which
they advanced, they were confronted by a network of new trenches
and bunkers, and houses where snipers lay waiting, according to
Serbian officers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a problem the Serbs will face in other places, because
though the government may control the main buildings in the cities
and towns, including the police headquarters and city hall, the
great majority of the people in the villages sympathize with the
rebels. In the villages, the insurgents can prepare their attacks
more easily and also withdraw from Serbian attack.
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, standing in Bela Crkva, a village just south
of Orahovac, Sipka pointed to a score or more of the roofless or
burned-out buildings that his men had fired on to rout the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were teams of snipers,'' he said. ``There were
barricades across the road and machine-gun positions in many
places.''
</P>
<P>
   But of the 800 rebels Sipka estimated had been waiting for his
forces before they got to Orahovac, not one prisoner was taken and
no dead were found.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just seemed to get away,'' the captain said.

FOREIGN PLAYERS SEEK RICHES ON SENIOR PGA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They constitute 8 percent of the fully exempt
players on this year's Senior PGA Tour and nearly 16 percent of the
tour's winners during the past season and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the elite of the foreign contingent, the most consistent
senior element this side of Hale Irwin and Gil Morgan. Australia's
Graham Marsh is its poster boy of the moment, given his status as
defending champion in the U.S. Senior Open.
</P>
<P>
   But Marsh routinely yields the spotlight to fellow Aussies Bruce
Crampton and David Graham, South Africans John Bland and Hugh
Baiocchi, Argentina's Vincente Fernandez, Japan's Isao Aoki or
England's Brian Barnes _ winners all since the start of the 1997
senior-tour season.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, the barrel-chested former Ryder Cup member and most
recent foreign winner, thinks foreign success on the American
senior tour stems from opportunity and relativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place to make your nest egg,'' said Barnes,
``because unfortunately the European tour, going back to the 1960s
and '70s, was small peanuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, while players on the European tour were laboring
for smaller wages, they also were honing their games in adverse
conditions and on courses far less manicured than what they see
weekly on the Senior PGA Tour. The contrast, Barnes said, can work
wonders for the confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two great things about American golf is every single week
you know the course is going to be in the best condition possible,
and 99.9 percent of the time you're going to get around in
short-sleeved shirts,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   For the towering Barnes, strolling the U.S. fairways with
rolled-up sleeves displaying his lumberjack-sized biceps, it seems
at times he has arrived in golf heaven.
</P>
<P>
   ``From one week to the next in Europe, even in the the bloody
height of summer, there's no guarantee you're not going to have to
wear two sweaters,'' he said. ``And then all of a sudden a wind of
40 miles an hour comes up and you've got to struggle around with
those conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond better-groomed courses, calmer conditions and a bigger
payday in what Barnes calls ``the second bud of the cherry,''
foreign players often bring considerable if unheralded skill to the
senior tour. Barnes achieved more fame than most by defeating Jack
Nicklaus twice in one day during the 1975 Ryder Cup when Nicklaus
was at the height of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Others arrived with less celebrity but plenty of game. John
Bland won the late-season 1995 Ralphs Senior Open at Wilshire
Country Club in his second senior start _ after winning a Monday
qualifier to get into the tournament. The next year he won $1.3
million and was named senior rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caliber of play is pretty good, but they're just not that
well known out of America,'' said Baiocchi, Bland's South African
countrymate who was a candidate for 1997 senior tour rookie of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these guys are the same,'' Baiocchi said. ``They've won
tournaments in Europe, and while the European tour is not as
competitive as the U.S. tour, it's still a pretty decent tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you play somewhere, it doesn't matter where you're
playing. They came over with good games and strong, competitive
minds. That's why they're doing so well.''
</P>
<P>
   PGA Tour commissioner Tim Fincham said the impact of foreign
players could grow just because of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the unique things about the senior tour is that it
really doesn't share many of the top players in the world over 50
anymore,'' he said. ``They are all here.''

NIGERIAN LEADER ANNOUNCES PLANS TO HOLD ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Pledging democracy but also playing for time,
Nigeria's military government said on Monday that it would hold
elections in the first three months of next year and hand over
power to a civilian president on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who took over as president last month,
announced his plans for the creation of what he called ``an
unfettered democracy'' in a speech to the nation that amounted to a
clear rebuke of his predecessor's staggeringly corrupt
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The president, dressed in full military uniform, said he would
release all political prisoners jailed by the former president,
Gen. Sani Abacha, allow the free formation of political parties,
reinforce the judiciary, permit international monitoring of
elections, reform the prison system and put an end to what he
called ``lapses'' in the management of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   In a thinly-veiled denouncement of Abacha, who died on June 8
with his country in a state of economic collapse and international
isolation, Abubakar said: ``We must admit that mistakes have been
made. In particularly, our most recent attempt at democratization
was marred by maneuvering and manipulation of political
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Abacha, whose appetite for personal enrichment was matched only
by his ruthlessness in imprisoning his opponents, had made himself
the only candidate for presidential ``elections'' that were to have
been held on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The speech on Monday was clearly designed to convince the United
States and other western governments that a page has been turned in
Africa's most populous nation, and to allay seething anger here at
the death in detention this month of the leading opposition figure,
Moshood Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   But while vowing to eradicate the legacy of Abacha, the new
president opted for caution. Apparently bowing to military hawks
who argue that Nigeria is vulnerable to fragmentation among its
more than 200 ethnic groups, he rebuffed opposition calls for a
handover of power by Oct. 1 to a civilian government of national
unity that would organize elections.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the formation of such a government would be ``full
of pitfalls and dangers,'' and potentially unrepresentative because
it would not be elected, Abubakar said, ``We will not substitute
one undemocratic system for another''. He added that his
administration ``has no desire whatsoever to succeed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That commitment may not convince many Nigerians. Democracy has
repeatedly been dangled before the 105 million citizens of this
country, a seemingly eternal mirage in sight but out of reach. It
is inevitable that the general's pledge to leave office in 10
months will be doubted until it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some opposition figures were inclined to hold fire. ``The
date of May 29 is by no means as short a time as some of us have
asked,'' said Clement Nwankwo, an opposition lawyer. ``But if the
date if really respected, then it may be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The program outlined by Abubakar appeared broadly in line with
suggestions made by the Clinton administration, which was skeptical
of the idea of a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 10-month extension of military rule is perhaps
longer than American officials here had expected or favored, the
administration has been inclined toward caution in a country with
muti-billion-dollar American investments in the oil industry.
Nigeria is the fifth largest provider of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Abiola, the opposition leader whose apparent
victory in the last presidential election in 1993 was annulled by
the armed forces, has sharpened Nigeria's pent-up demand for an end
to military rule and accentuated ethnic tensions in the country.
Abiola was from the southern Yoruba tribe, and the general who
canceled the elections was from the North.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar spoke respectfully of Abiola, but said calls for a
return to the past were ``unhelpful and impractical.'' He urged
Nigerians to move forward ``with confidence in the present and hope
in the future''.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who attended several military training programs
in the United States, said he would scrap the electoral commission
set up by his predecessor and create a new and independent one that
would be empowered to organize ``free and fair elections'' fought
by new political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the existing five political parties are hereby
dissolved,'' Abubakar said, referring to the groups created by
Abacha to back his plan to succeed himself, ``and their assets will
be taken over by administrators.'' The new parties, he added, would
be free to form and organize themselves without any military
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for regional governments held under Abacha were also
scrapped because of ``their widespread lack of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at a time when ethnic suspicions are intense in
Nigeria, Abubakar warned against the formation of parties along
ethnic lines. He urged all politicians to narrow their differences
and work for ``the formation of parties with a national
following.''
</P>
<P>
   It was far from clear that this call would be heeded at a time
when the Yorubas feel cheated by Abiola's death and convinced that
the next leader should come from their tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Many Yorubas say that the eventual election of somebody from the
northern Hausa or Falani tribes, which have tended to dominate
military governments, would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces have long argued that their continued
occupation of power was necessary to hold the country together. But
the debacle of Abacha's rule, the ruin of a potentially prosperous
economy and the move to democratic governments across Africa
appears to have reluctantly convinced many Nigerian officers that
power must now be ceded to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In one his most potentially significant promises, Abubakar said
his administration would ``breathe into the conduct of government a
fresh air of accountability.'' He demanded that ``all public
officers demonstrate transparency and uprightness in the conduct of
government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before his speech, Abubakar announced that he had pardoned and
would release 10 prisoners sentenced in what Abacha had called a
1995 coup plot. Those to be freed included three prominent
journalists _ Ben Charles Obi of the now defunct magazine Weekend
Classique, George Mba of Tell Magazine and Kule Ajibade, the editor
of The New Tempo.
</P>
<P>
   However no mention was made of two other journalists, Niran
Malaolu and Bagauda Kalto, who are still in prison. Widespread
rumors suggest that Kalto may have been killed by the Abacha
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar did not name a new cabinet to replace the one dismissed
earlier this month, but indicated he would try to bring a wide
spectrum of Nigerian politicians into the government.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many critical questions hanging over the transition
plan announced on Monday is what constitution will govern it.
Abubakar suggested that a constitution formulated under Abacha but
never promulgated may be approved by his military government after
being presented to Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
   This constitution is said by officials who have seen it to call
for a system whereby the presidency would rotate between different
regions of the country, and so between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But how such a system would work in practice remains as unclear
as the ultimate ambitions of a Nigerian army that has never stopped
promising democracy but has ruled for all but 10 years since the
country achieved independence from Britain in 1960.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Receiving a lifetime-achievement award at the
Jerusalem Film Festival this spring, the Israeli filmmaker Assi
Dayan congratulated organizers for putting on so fine a festival
``in this damned city.'' Then, turning to Mayor Ehud Olmert, he
loosed another curse: Please tell your friend, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, ``that he should go to hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was not big news. Dayan, son of the late Israeli
military hero Moshe Dayan, is known for his sharp tongue and his
harsh views about religious Jews and the right-wing government.
</P>
<P>
   But even more than that, such language has ceased to shock as
the dispute between religious and secular Jews has steadily
intensified in fury and emotion. It is common now to hear
references to Kulturkampf, a culture war in which the secular ``Tel
Aviv'' and the religious ``Jerusalem'' are battling for the very
soul of Israel. Hence Dayan's curse.
</P>
<P>
   The passions seem hardly proportionate to the realities. The
sides are vaguely defined _ religious Jews in Israel range from the
fundamentalist ``haredim'' to thoroughly liberal Orthodox, while
``secular'' Israelis run the political gamut from far-right to
far-left.
</P>
<P>
   Yet every skirmish rapidly turns into angry confrontation. The
most celebrated in recent months was the decision of the renowned
Batsheva Dance Company to withdraw from a gala in Jerusalem in
April celebrating Israel's 50th anniversary after ultra-Orthodox
politicians objected to a number in which scantily dressed dancers
danced to a Hebrew prayer.
</P>
<P>
   That incident unleashed a torrent of fury among secular
Israelis. Several days later, at a packed outdoor arena in Tel
Aviv, the company staged a retaliatory performance in which a
dancer dressed as an ultra-Orthodox Jew stripped to her underwear.
The Tel Aviv audience cheered as if their team had scored a
touchdown and had retaken the lead.
</P>
<P>
   At a tempestuous parliamentary hearing that followed, the
chairman of the Israeli Artists Union, Shaikeh Levy, declared:
``There will be creative freedom. The more important question is
whether there will be a country.''
</P>
<P>
   An enraged legislator, David Azulai, from the religious Shas
party, retorted: ``The country will continue to exist, with you or
without you.''
</P>
<P>
   Other clashes have occurred on streets the haredim want closed
on the Sabbath, or in towns where the religious have tried to
establish a presence. In Pardes Hanna, an old town in central
Israel, arsonists set fire to a haredi trailer, and hundreds of
secular Israelis have gathered for regular protests against what
they see as religious encroachment.
</P>
<P>
   A recent announcement that Jerusalem's boundaries would be
expanded drew violent protests from affluent suburbanites, many of
whom had fled before the swelling religious population of the city
and saw the expansion as an attempt to tap their taxes to
compensate for the large and poor haredi families.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have been quick to seize on the battle. Mayor Roni
Milo of Tel Aviv recently declared himself a candidate for prime
minister as champion of those opposed to ``religious coercion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is not over the Batsheva dancers' clothing,'' wrote
the columnist Nahum Barnea in Yediot Ahronot. ``The war is about
power, about territories of control. The haredim, a rising power in
Israeli politics, are testing the boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the chairman of the Labor Party, introduced a bill
to draft haredi youths, seeking to cash in on what is probably the
greatest source of resentment among secular Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Most ultra-Orthodox Jews are exempted from mandatory military
service on the premise that they study the Torah at their yeshivas.
What enrages other Israelis is not only that a rapidly swelling
portion of the population does not take part in the defense of the
Jewish state, but that this group receives state subsidies as well.
About 200,000 yeshiva students currently receive a total of about
$275 million _ and recently demanded a 33 percent raise.
</P>
<P>
   These resentments have been fanned by the fact that the haredim,
because of their huge families and relative poverty, pay few taxes.
And their unwillingness to take part in secular patriotic
ceremonies, like the annual minute of silence for those who fell in
wars, is seen as disrespectful to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   From the haredi side, two rabbis, Yosef Shalom Elyashiv and
Aharon Leib Shteinman, published a declaration that the proposal to
draft the ultra-Orthodox was a ``plot to uproot Torah from
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak's bill was defeated. But signs appeared on buses reading
``One Nation, One Draft,'' and ultra-Orthodox leaders promptly
threatened to boycott buses unless they were taken down.
</P>
<P>
   The haredim have their own sources of resentment. One is the
Israeli Supreme Court, which they see as a threat to religious law;
another is archeology, which they perceive as a threat to the
sanctity of the Jewish dead.

JURY DECISION IN PILGRIM CLEANERS CASE COULD AFFECT INDUSTRY'S
FUTURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ill.) 
 
By LISA M. CHMIOLA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A state district jury left Pilgrim Cleaners out to dry
Monday by finding a manufacturer of dry cleaning equipment is not
liable for the dry-cleaning operator's environmental cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-1 decision in the nine-week case was returned after only
a day and a half of deliberation, and could affect the future of
the dry-cleaning industry. Several similar lawsuits are pending in
the United States, but this case is the first of its kind to go to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case boiled down to whether R.R. Street &AMP; Co., a dry
cleaning equipment manufacturer based in the Chicago-area city of
Naperville, withheld information from Pilgrim on the dangers of
perchloroethylene.
</P>
<P>
   A dry cleaning solvent that came into wide use following World
War II, perc was labeled a hazardous chemical by the National
Institutes of Health in 1977, after it was found to cause cancer in
laboratory animals. It is unclear whether the chemical causes
cancer in humans.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, the Robertson family of Houston, former Pilgrim
Cleaners owners, claimed manufacturers knew the practice of
disposing water containing perc into sanitary sewers could lead to
pollution but did not warn dry cleaners of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrim owners sued several manufacturers in 1995 in an
attempt to recover $12 million in cleanup costs. Except for Street,
all manufacturers involved settled with the Robertsons, including
Dow Chemical Co., Hoyt Corp., Harkrider Distributing Co. and Vic
Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Street attorneys said the information Pilgrim claimed it did not
have has always been easily available and that Pilgrim, being one
of the largest dry cleaners in the country, certainly knew about
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The verdict says) someone who is going to get into this
business has the responsibility for using these chemicals
properly,'' said Street attorney John Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In closing Thursday, Street attorneys also said their company
was being made a scapegoat by a dry cleaner that did not handle
waste materials properly and that knew it was taking a risk by
pouring water with dissolved perc down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   They said the industry did not consider the disposal to be a
serious environmental issue until the early 1990s, when a
California study showed perc may escape through cracks in sewer
lines since it is heavier than water. They said dry cleaners were
immediately notified.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim attorney Mike Pohl said contamination at Pilgrim sites
has generally been along sewer lines, but Street attorney Clay
Lilienstern said contamination was mostly in areas where the
chemical was stored. Pilgrim attorneys said Lilienstern's
conclusions were based on faulty analysis of data.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim attorney Jean Frizzell said that even as recently as the
late 1980s and early 1990s, some top officials at Street did not
realize machines used to recycle perc released water contaminated
with small amounts of perc, because the company wanted to keep this
secret.
</P>
<P>
   Street attorney Taylor Hicks said it is ridiculous that the
company could have kept a secret ``a law of science'' that perc
dissolves in water.
</P>
<P>
   Some local governments outlaw the disposal of water with
dissolved perc down the drain. The practice is not outlawed in
Houston on the theory that treatment plants bring perc
concentration below five parts per billion, or the accepted level.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim attorneys said Monday they were considering their appeal
options.

JERUSALEM: Jewish dead. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The haredim have systematically tried to block archeological
digs where there is any chance of coming on Jewish tombs _ which is
most anywhere in Israel. In May, offices of the Antiquities
Authority in Hahalal were set on fire, with the loss of extensive
archeological documentation; the police said they were searching
for two haredi youths.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when all such passions are pushed aside, it is difficult to
see what the problem is. Although religious parties control the
Culture Ministry, state subsidies remain intact even for art the
religious would refuse to see. No program on television, stage or
radio has been banned or withdrawn because of religious pressure.
After months of fierce fighting along Bar-Ilan Street in Jerusalem,
a quiet compromise was reached to close the street during prayer
times on the Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   For all the demands to draft the haredim, Army leaders admit
this would create big problems because the ultra-Orthodox could not
serve with women and would demand far stricter dietary controls.
And the Supreme Court has usually managed to accommodate religious
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for all their threats, neither side has succeeded in
passing a law the other opposes. The attempt by the religious
parties to pass a bill institutionalizing their monopoly over
religious conversions was blocked, as was Barak's attempt to draft
haredim.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the sides are not as polarized as their language would
suggest. Studies have shown that only about 14 percent of Jews in
Israel define themselves as ``strictly observant'' and 20 percent
as nonobservant. All the rest are somewhere in between. But another
survey by Tel Aviv University also found that 80 percent of
Israelis expect an outbreak of violence between the religious and
the secular.
</P>
<P>
   The real reason behind the anxiety is a sense that Israeli
society in undergoing profound change in which every minor conflict
is a battle over the future.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist Yossi Klein Halevi wrote: ``What we're seeing is
really an apocalyptic debate, for the religious and secular are
both convinced that if the other side wins, the country will be
destroyed. The secular scenario is simple: If the country becomes a
theocracy, the secular middle class, which keeps Israel productive
and gives it an edge in the Middle East, will leave, and this
country will become a real ghetto, and Israel, as a theocracy, will
be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side, which is not well understood because the
religious don't make themselves understood in the media, there is
the idea that we were in this land twice before, and both times we
lost because we didn't follow God's law. When the religious looks
at Tel Aviv culture, at Batsheva, he sees the beginning of the end
of the Third Commonwealth. That's the tragedy here: the
protagonists aren't always aware why they feel so passionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Though such debates have always existed in a people defined both
by blood and religion, Israel was shaped and controlled in its
formative years by secular, liberal Zionists who perceived the
rigorously Orthodox as a vestige of Europe's ghettoes.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 by a
religious nationalist stunned the left by revealing the depth of
radicalization in the religious right. Then the election of
Netanyahu in 1996 revealed a convergence of interests among
traditional ultra-Orthodox, religious Jews from Arab countries and
religious nationalists, who together gained enough muscle to make
or break the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a debate, and suddenly the religious people brought
in a gun,'' said the writer David Grossman. ``They showed that even
though we had a state, they were more committed to God's laws.
We're fighting now for our future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why now? Because everything is sharper now, because we're
facing the crucial point of deciding how to live the next 50 years.
Will we have peace? Will we internalize the idea of concession to
neighbors? Will we create borders only or create a quality of life
in those borders? Are we going to survive only, or will we seek
something more than surviving from one catastrophe to another? All
the crucial questions of our identity rise again. They dictate our
political behavior, the way we treat each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious politicians dismiss such talk as hyperbole and
politics, arguing that the religious are not seeking or achieving
anything new.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you why I don't take this very seriously,'' said
Rabbi Avaham Ravitz, of the United Torah Judaism faction in the
Parliament. ``Nothing special happened in recent times in order
this should cause such a tension by secular against religious.
There were no religious laws passed. It was the other way around:
we're lately losing a few issues that we were sure would pass
through, like the Law of Conversion. So the religious parties are
not in a situation of threatening the secular, in a way that we're
forcing the secular to accept religious laws or religious behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very cynical way, this is being used for the political
interests of the lefties, the Labor Party, who are pushing Israeli
society and making this so-called culture war.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moshe Halbertal, an Orthodox rabbi who is professor of
Jewish thought at Hebrew University and of Talmud at the Hartman
Institute in Jerusalem, insists there is a struggle, one
symptomatic of deeper anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great sense of fear because society has been
transformed, and nobody knows where it's going to go,'' he said.
``What we're seeking basically is a new social contract here, a
social contract that we're taking the state out of this culture
war, that we're not willing to use the mechanisms of the state to
decide it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be an understanding that religious legislation
has caused tremendous alienation of a whole generation, besides
harming the whole fabric of society. On the other hand we must
respect the cultural autonomy of the hardim, in ways the state
didn't respect it in the past.''

DEREK BRAVES THE `WATER' AS A TV MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ At 42, Bo Derek is more of a resounding seven
than a perfect 10. But it's still tough to accept the fact that
she'll answer to ``mom'' on her first TV series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom!'' she exclaimed said in an interview, apparently
befuddled herself to be playing the mother of grown sons in ``Wind
on Water,'' a fall series on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Derek's own husband, John Derek, advised her to decline the role
before he died after emergency heart surgery two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not like the idea of me going off to do this,'' she
said. ``After being gone for 10 years and then to come back playing
the mother of two adults was not his idea of the woman he was in
love with. But it was my own decision. I felt it was right to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Set and filmed in Hawaii, the series is a soapy drama centered
on the two sons (William Gregory Lee and Brian Gross), whose skills
as surfers and skiers on the extreme sports circuit keep the family
cattle ranch in business.
</P>
<P>
   The show is executive produced by Zalman King (``9 1/2 Weeks,''
``Red Shoe Diaries''), who is better known for glossy, soft-core
porn than for family-hour shows on network television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of coming back to work,'' Derek said. ``It's
been about 10 years. And the idea of the television family hour
really appealed to me, since it's been so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zalman King, his style and eye, I think, were very appealing
to me. The character's very comfortable. The ranch backgrounds,
water sports, probably everything about it except being a mom was
something I felt really good about.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Derek has avoided attention, sticking close
to the 42-acre ranch she and John bought near Santa Barbara, Calif.
She raises Appaloosa horses there, indulging a passion she
developed making the film ``Bolero.''
</P>
<P>
   She seems untroubled by her long absence from the screen,
tacitly admitting that she made mistakes after the smash hit ``10''
in 1979, but also insisting that she never took movie stardom
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bolero'' was a major oops, at least if critical respect meant
anything. ``Tarzan, the Ape Man'' was another. Derek said she and
her husband were happy making their own little films together _
``fighting the system and doing strange things.'' Her feeling, she
said, was anything but pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   ``My image? I never took it seriously anyway,'' she said. ``I
wasn't out to prove anything. It was a blessing in my life, made my
life an absolute fairy tale. I pretty much could do anything I
wanted in the business, so it's my fault if I didn't go to another
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was responsible. I took control of my own career in the
business, and that makes it easier to live with now, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV series was to have been a low-key comeback in what is
essentially a supporting role. But the death of Derek's husband,
after 22 years of marriage and partnership, has given her return to
film work a new meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be therapeutic,'' she said. ``Maybe I'll be
better for it, because I'll be able to focus a lot more on it.

 &HT;    Georgia candidates spend day before election stumping
 &HT;    By Charles Walston and Kathey Pruitt

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Democrats waged a last-minute air campaign Monday,
while Republicans mounted a limited ground action as they attempted
to pump up voters for today's party primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roy Barnes (D-Mableton), Sen. Steve Langford (D-LaGrange)
and Secretary of State Lewis Massey spent the final day flying
around the state, speaking to supporters at airport terminals, and
hoping to attract local media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   They're hoping the 11th-hour appeals will energize an electorate
largely apathetic about today's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes put together the busiest itinerary _ seven cities in all
_ and drew the largest crowds as he canvassed the state with
baseball home run king Hank Aaron. Barnes supporters jammed
terminals from Albany to Augusta, accompanied by children who were
more interested in meeting Aaron than a man who could be Georgia's
next governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to see Hank Aaron more than Roy, which is perfectly
alright,'' Jim Patrick of Albany, who went to law school with
Barnes, said of his 11-year-old son Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans stayed close to metro Atlanta's Republican-rich
suburbs Monday after traveling the state last week.
</P>
<P>
   Former Attorney General Mike Bowers took his banner-draped RV to
McDonough, lunching with the mayor and police chief at a barbecue
joint, while cameras from Atlanta network affiliates and CNN
rolled.
</P>
<P>
   GOP front-runner Guy Millner, who completed a three-day state
fly around last week, also relied on retail campaigning Monday.
From table to table, behind the counter and in the kitchen of three
metro Atlanta restaurants, Millner shook hands and asked for votes.
Within minutes of each other, Millner, family activist Nancy
Schaefer, Kennesaw businessman Bruce Hatfield and Bowers all called
into an Atlanta radio talk show. Barnes and Massey almost crossed
paths in Albany, where Massey's plane landed as Barnes' was taxiing
toward takeoff. As soon as Barnes' airport news conference ended, a
Massey staffer began replacing Barnes campaign signs with Massey
signs.
</P>
<P>
   In Macon, Langford was scheduled to arrive about a half-hour
after Barnes departed. Only former Labor Commissioner David
Poythress took a different tact, shaking hands with the lunch crowd
at Colonnade restaurant in Atlanta, meeting with Snapper
manufacturing plant employees at shift change in McDonough and
greeting people at Atlanta's Five Points MARTA station at evening
rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes predicted the Democratic contest would wind up in a
runoff between himself and Massey, and told supporters in each city
that he would be back in three weeks. Massey, who turned 36 on
Monday, also forecast a runoff as he concluded his vote canvassing
in Atlanta Monday with a celebration at Manuel's Tavern with
campaign staff, supporters and a birthday cake. He spent part of
the evening talking to Manuel Maloof, who has been strategizing for
Democrats almost as long as Massey's been alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who come here and talk to Manuel the day before an
election end up being successful,'' Massey said.

 &HT;    Analysts caught offguard by SunTrust announcement
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For SunTrust Banks' customers, the Monday announcement
is mostly a nonevent.
</P>
<P>
   For Wall Street analysts, though, the planned acquisition of
Richmond's Crestar Financial transformed their perceptions about
the Atlanta firm.
</P>
<P>
   And for SunTrust Banks' shareholders, there are some short-term
negatives, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The new subsidiary will operate as a separate subsidiary of
SunTrust Bank, and SunTrust Bank customers in Atlanta, Nashville,
or Orlando won't notice much beyond whatever new products and
services the Virginia company adds to the overall mix.
</P>
<P>
   In the current climate, Wall Street frequently likes bank merger
announcements, but this time analysts seemed miffed at being caught
off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is out of character for SunTrust. They haven't done a
deal in 12 years,'' said Robinson-Humphrey analyst John W. Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``SunTrust has not done a significant merger since 1986. I don't
think (Wall) Street was expecting a major merger from SunTrust.
They've increased their market capitalization by 50 percent, paying
$9.5 billion (based on Friday's stock prices), which is a
significant merger for anyone. With that, it's more unlikely that
the company will sell out at some point,'' said John B. Moore of
Interstate/Johnson Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There've been a number of rumors going around for months, that
SunTrust was going to sell out to Wachovia or someone else, and
that rumor is going away. So the premium is coming out of the
stock,'' Moore added.
</P>
<P>
   And another negative, he said, is that ``this is an
out-of-market merger,'' which the Street generally dislikes.
``Typically, there's less opportunity for expense reduction and
expense savings'' when there's no overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased number of SunTrust Banks shares, profit
per share is projected to increase 3.6 percent in 1999 and 4.4
percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore said, owing to accounting rules, SunTrust Banks' share
buyback policy would end for at least two years. This program had
the effect of benefiting both earnings per share and shareholder
value because there have been more earnings and fewer shares to
divvy up.
</P>
<P>
   Of more importance, R. Harold Schroeder of Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods noted the owner of each SunTrust Bank share now owns $11.50
worth of Coca-Cola stock. That stake will be reduced by the
addition of 113.5 million new shares SunTrust Banks will issue to
finance the merger.
</P>
<P>
   That said, all three analysts like the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically it makes a lot of sense,'' Coffey said.
``Crestar is the gateway to the most wealthy population in the
nation, and SunTrust's products fit that market perfectly. There
are no negatives in the out-of-market economics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The SunTrust story has clearly changed somewhat,'' said
Schroeder, ``and the burden of proof is on this management team,
but we think they can execute it.'' Completing this merger
smoothly, he said, will clearly help it survive in the next round
of consolidations.

   SunTrust to acquire Crestar Financial
</P>
<P>
   By Rob Chambers
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ SunTrust Banks joined the merger melee, announcing
Monday it will acquire Richmond, Va.-based Crestar Financial for
stock originally valued at about $9.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta banking company has been on the sidelines while
competitors such as NationsBank and First Union multiplied their
size with acquisitions. SunTrust Banks has made about two dozen
small purchases over the last dozen years and had lost out to
NationsBank in bidding for Barnett Banks last year. But not since
its December 1986 purchase of Nashville-based Third National had
SunTrust Banks bought a large company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being asleep for 12 years is a pretty long time,'' joked
SunTrust Banks Chairman L. Phillip Humann, who noted that timing
and a bad Tennessee economy in the wake of the earlier merger had
made the Atlanta company leery of deals for a few years. But,
essentially, he said, the current deal simply made financial and
management sense.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Crestar Financial said it decided to partner with
SunTrust Banks because its own ability to grow through acquisitions
had become limited by its relatively small size. Talks began in
March, heated up two weeks ago, and the deal was ratified Friday.
</P>
<P>
   What SunTrust Banks gets is a rich new market. Crestar Financial
ranks second in market share, based on deposits, in Virginia, third
in Maryland, and first in the greater Washington, D.C. area, one of
the wealthiest spots in the nation. SunTrustBanks currently ranks
second in Georgia and third in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the price, at about 4.3-times book value as of
Friday, is not cheap. However, Crestar Financial is considered a
plum as well as the last remaining major prize in Virgina. Wachovia
and First Union bought three other major companies there last year.
First Virginia Banks of Falls Church, with $9.38 billion in assets,
is the lone sizeable survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Wall Street didn't like the news because the deal
seemed both rich and out of character for the Atlanta company.
SunTrust Banks stock fell $8.43 3/4 cents to $79, while Crestar
Financial jumped $9.31 1/4 to $73.31 1/4. But long term, analysts
say, the acquisition is a good move for the Atlanta banking company
because of the valuable new territory that's being added.
</P>
<P>
   Crestar Financial will keep its name and Chief Executive Officer
Richard G. Tilghman will become vice chairman of SunTrust Banks.
Humann will continue to head the company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger is expected to have little effect on SunTrust Banks'
customers. However, there will be cuts among back office staff, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies expect the deal, which requires approval by
shareholders and regulators, to close in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the requirements of merger accounting, SunTrust Banks
will cease its share buyback program.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta company expects to take a $200 million merger charge
in 1998 and another charge of $50 million to align accounting and
reserve policies
</P>
<P>
   The merger will create the 10th largest banking company in the
United States, with $88 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, the principals say, will be immediately profitable,
adding 3.6 percent to 1999 earnings and 4.4 percent to earnings in
the year 2000. Humann said that this would be achieved through $131
million in cost savings and $25 million in revenue increases over
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Normal attrition and back office layoffs, Humann said, will
create the savings. There is no overlap between the two companies,
so, ultimately, most of the marriage's benefits will come from
increasing revenues over time.
</P>
<P>
   Humann cautioned that this acquisition shouldn't be confused
with a SunTrust Banks trend or ``master plan.'' But, when asked
about the Carolina-sized gap in the map that separates most of the
company's territory from Virginia, he said, ``To the extent that a
gap state or another state represents a quality opportunity, we
would be interested.''

<P>
   Relief workers continued counting the dead in Papua New Guinea
Monday, as fears rose that the giant wave that obliterated several
fishing villages on Friday swept away far more children than
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most saddening thing is that 70 percent of the survivors
have been adults _ most of the children are dead,'' the Rev. Austen
Crapp, the administrator of the Catholic Diocese of Aitape, told
reporters Monday at a hospital where hundreds of survivors have
been treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``What chance would a 2-year-old or a 3-year-old child have?''
Crapp asked. ``It wipes out everything, destroys everything,
bounces people off trees, bowls them into the lagoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The children may be hiding somewhere,'' he added. ``We hope
so. But the current fear is that they have drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   As Australian aid workers opened a field hospital on high ground
and relief supplies began trickling in, Papua New Guinea's prime
minister, Bill Skate, toured the worst-hit villages and the Sissano
lagoon, choked with dead fish and hundreds of rotting human bodies.
Skate put the official death toll at 705, although he and other
officials said the final number might be closer to 2,000 or 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding more dead bodies now than Monday _ every minute
and every hour we find more dead bodies,'' Skate said. ``I will
always remember this as long as I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Emergency officials began to worry that the huge numbers of dead
might threaten the living through disease and contaminated water
supplies. The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald reported that
workers had dug a hurried mass grave in Aitape, about 20 miles to
the east of where the tsunami hit, and buried 90 people who died of
injuries after being taken to the hospital there.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven villages in the nation's remote and rugged
northwest were destroyed on Friday evening when a tsunami reported
up to 30 feet high pounded the coast. The tsunami was caused by an
earthquake that registered 7 on the Richter scale, followed 20
minutes later by a second quake that registered 5.7. Officials said
between 6,000 and 10,000 people lived in the area, mostly relying
on subsistence farming and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wave crashed into the house,'' a survivor, Raymond Nimis,
told The National newspaper of Papua New Guinea. ``People were
dying everywhere. Some died under the house. Others got rolled in
by the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Skate, who has declared a state of emergency, appealed to other
countries for help _ for doctors, food and building supplies. By
Monday, Australia had sent three C-130 transport planes full of
personnel and relief supplies, with a fourth expected on Tuesday.
New Zealand was also sending two planeloads of supplies.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred relief workers from Australia _ including 60 doctors
and nurses _set up a field hospital in Vanimo, about 50 miles away
from where the tsunami hit, in case of another earthquake. Several
helicopters, paid for by local mining companies, began ferrying
hundreds of wounded people there. Seventy gravediggers were also
airlifted to the Sissano lagoon, but found that many of the bodies
were too decomposed to be buried without machinery, The Morning
Herald reported.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some workers complained of a shortage of supplies, and in
Washington Monday, relief officials said it would be difficult to
get the needed supplies quickly to the area, which is mountainous
and covered with thick jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems in this area is how remote it is,'' said
Ann Stingle, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, which is
helping to coordinate relief aid. ``It is two days by boat for
mobilizing a lot of the relief goods. So this is going to be quite
a logistical challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the world, nations expressed their condolences and
offered help. A Vatican spokesman said Monday that Pope John Paul
II was ``profoundly saddened'' by the disaster and hoped that the
``international community will show its solidarity by providing
prompt and effective assistance.'' The secretary-general of the
United Nations, Kofi Annan, offered to help assess the damage and
coordinate relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said she
would visit the capital of Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby, on July
29. The spokesman, James Rubin, said Albright had announced plans
for a brief visit between meetings in the South Pacific before the
disaster. But now her visit may also include a pledge of aid, Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be sure on one hand we are not causing an
undue logistical burden,'' he said. ``On the other hand, she has
asked the administration and the department to look at ways to be
helpful to them as they face this catastrophe.''

BY KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been having lunch fairly regularly with one of my male
colleagues, and it is generally all business. We get along well,
and, about a week ago, he asked me out. I gave him some excuse so I
could think about what I want to do. I like him, but office
romances concern me. Are there any new thoughts in this area? A.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Much of the thinking about office dating can be rather dated,
however this is not automatically the case. The first place to look
is at the culture and policies of your company. Although some have
strict prohibitions in this area (which only drive relationships
underground), others accept the reality that some employees are to
become romantically involved with each other. Another reality is
that employees are now more likely to find romance at work because
so many are spending longer and longer hours at work.
</P>
<P>
   The larger concern for employers occurs when people in
supervisory positions date employees who report to them. In fact, a
small but growing number of employers are setting policies that
call for such employees to inform management in order to prevent
questionable work decisions and future legal problems in the event
the relationship goes south.
</P>
<P>
   Office romances can lead to serious problems and serious
solutions. If you do become involved, you need to keep your eyes
open.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I came up with a good idea and mentioned it to my manager.
She suggested I put it in writing. After a couple of weeks, she
wrote a letter back to me saying the idea was useless and left her
cold. I am annoyed and wonder if I should say something. C.L.
</P>
<P>
   A: It actually sounds like your manager's response was useless
and left you cold. Regardless of any action you take, it is
important to recognize at the outset that a person who writes this
type of letter is not typically inclined to listen to constructive
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your idea was ridiculous, there is no excuse for her
response. All that her behavior has done is generate anger and
squelch the likelihood of you ever presenting another creative idea
to her. As a result, she loses, the company loses, and,
unfortunately, you lose.
</P>
<P>
   Since you are so upset over her reaction, you should meet with
her. This should not be a meeting where you evaluate her or the
letter, but rather one in which you try to clarify the ground
rules. Tell her that you were confused by her response to your
idea, and you would like to know if there is anything you should be
doing in order to avoid this type of reaction in the future. Her
reply will tell you if it is a good idea to continue in her
department, or if it is a better idea to broaden your horizons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I worked for a company for eight years, and they blocked off
one month where no one could take any time off so that a new
computer system could be installed. My husband's birthday fell on
the first day of this period and I had requested it off but was
told no. My husband was furious, called the controller, and then
told me to quit. So, I did. Later the controller called me and said
I could have my job back and the birthday off, but I chose not to
return. Please let me know how I should have handled this. D.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: You cannot live your life trying to rehash ``should haves''
and ``shouldn't haves.'' All that happens is that you dwell on the
problem, and inevitably conclude that you made a mistake. That is
not fair for you.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that you made a decision. It may not be sitting well
with you, but that can happen in any decision. Maybe it was a good
thing to leave the company, and maybe it wasn't. Either way, you
left. If you truly feel that you made a tremendous mistake, call
the company and see if the offer still stands.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not inclined to seek your former position, or if it
is not offered, you need to stop torturing yourself over what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Use this time to review your skills and, if warranted, consider
getting some additional training. Make a listing of the factors
that are important to you at work, and then actively seek a
position that at least fulfills some of them.
</P>
<P>
   You have a career ahead of you. If you will not or cannot return

U.S. AND INDIA MEET ON STANDOFF OVER NUCLEAR TESTS AND SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ American and Indian officials held a round of
talks Monday to ease the standoff that developed after India
conducted underground nuclear tests in May. But officials on both
sides said there were no breakthroughs that could lead to an early
lifting of American economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   There was no tangible sign of compromise on what has been
Washington's central demand, that India and Pakistan, which
detonated its own underground nuclear blasts two weeks after India,
abandon plans to deploy nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said much of the discussion Monday had
centered on a goal that both sides have identified as potentially
achievable, an agreement by India to sign the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, which it shunned when the treaty was concluded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were the third in a series that began in Washington in
June, a month after the Indian tests, and that continued with a
meeting in Frankfurt this month. As on the previous occasions, the
American side was led by Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
and the Indian team by Jaswant Singh, an emissary of Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset both sides have agreed to say little publicly
about progress. Still, it was clear from general statements Monday
that both countries are keen to find ways around the impasse that
developed after the five tests on May 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
   The tests prompted President Clinton to impose wide-ranging
economic sanctions. A similar package of sanctions was imposed on
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week both houses of Congress voted to exempt agricultural
sales from the sanctions, a move made under pressure from Western
farmers. In a separate move the Senate approved a resolution
authorizing Clinton to ease other sanctions against the two
countries if they make progress toward meeting American demands.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Talbott is to fly to Islamabad, the Pakistani
capital, for talks that have been given added urgency by warnings
from Pakistan that unless Washington eases the sanctions Pakistan
may default on repayments due soon of its foreign debt of more than
$30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by the Indian Foreign Ministry said the talks with
the Americans Monday had ``a spirit of working together to find
common ground.'' But Indian officials told reporters that the
American delegation had been told that there was ``no prospect'' of
India's renouncing plans to deploy nuclear weapons, a goal that
Vajpayee announced just after the tests.
</P>
<P>
   American officials confirmed that Indian leaders had been
adamant about their intention to deploy at least a small nuclear
arsenal, what the New Delhi government is calling a ``minimum
deterrent'' force.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott described the talks as ``constructive and ongoing'' and
said a fourth round would be held next month in Washington. ``It is
very important,'' Talbott said, ``to restore relations between
India and the United States to a level, in spirit and substance,
that both countries want and both countries deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   He held talks later with Vajpayee and Home Minister L.K. Advani
and planned to meet on Tuesday with Sonia Gandhi, president of the
opposition Congress Party. Another member of the American
delegation, Gen. Joseph Ralston, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, met separately Monday with the Indian Defense Minister,
George Fernandes.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials said they hoped an agreement on the test ban
treaty might clear the way for a proposed visit by Clinton this
year.

TURBODYNE AFFIRMS DEAL WEIGHED; STOCK RISES 8%

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shares in Turbodyne Technologies Inc. rose more
than 8 percent Monday to reach a 52-week high on news the company
is in talks with several unnamed firms about one or more of them
acquiring a minority stake in the pollution-control specialist.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that the company said was prompted by inaccurate
speculation on the Internet and elsewhere over a possible deal,
Turbodyne said it is talking with ``several major industrial
concerns'' about a possible sale or other form of partnership. The
company added that ``the discussions are in the early stages, and
there is no assurance that any of the discussions will result in (a
deal).''
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne makes retrofit kits that cut exhaust emissions from
vehicles, construction equipment and other devices operating on
internal-combustion engines. The company also makes aluminum
castings for the automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne had 1997 sales of $39.2 million. In June, the company
reported a first-quarter loss of $4 million, or 13 cents a diluted
share, on $9.7 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has run rampant in recent weeks over a possible
partial sale of the company. Turbodyne spokeswoman Meredith
Lafforge said that in Internet chat rooms and elsewhere,
misinformed individuals have said the company is to be bought by
everyone from Microsoft to Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never should have had to put out this release,'' Lafforge
said, ``but people have been jumping the gun on different random
rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Lafforge said the company opted to release a statement ``rather
than have people wreak havoc with our trading'' based on false
data.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne shares rose $1.0625 to close at $13. &QL;

CLINTON URGES STRICTER RULES IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ President Clinton appeared before the annual
convention of the American Federation of Teachers on Monday to urge
his listeners to be stricter with their pupils, adding an appeal
for low-cost discipline to his more familiar call for new education
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy speech, Clinton urged more discipline in
classrooms, character education, school uniforms and enforcement of
truancy laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever there is chaos where there should be calm, wherever
there is disorder where there should be discipline,'' Clinton said,
``make no mistake about it, it's not just a threat to our
classrooms and to your mission, it is a threat to the strength and
vitality of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made at times a seemingly paradoxical argument for such
policies. At one point, he declared that mandatory uniforms would
help children ``feel free.'' Uniforms help reduce crime and
violence, he said, freeing children from danger.
</P>
<P>
   The president has long advocated such policies as school
uniforms. But his advisers are also encouraging him to emphasize
values in his speeches with an eye to winning moderate ``swing''
votes in the midterm elections, and he seemed to be trying at times
on Monday to box out the Republicans. Clinton even borrowed a
phrase, without attribution, from House Speaker Newt Gingrich. He
said that giving teachers the tools to have safe and orderly
classrooms ``is central to the mission of renewing America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced on Monday that he would hold a White House
conference this fall on school safety, saying that he hoped to seek
ways to prevent school shootings like the one in Springfield, Ore.,
in May.
</P>
<P>
   The president received an adoring reception from the 4,000
delegates in a cavernous convention hall here. In introducing him,
Sandra Feldman, the union's president, made reference to his
travails in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton is a president who has been under attack _
constant attack _ from those who are desperate to stop him from
pursuing his policies,'' she said. After a standing ovation died
down, Ms. Feldman added that the ``vicious and ugly and personal''
campaign against Clinton was aimed at ``the destruction of public
institutions in general, and the destruction of public education in
particular.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech to the teachers, Clinton turned his attention
to fund-raising and golf. He appeared at a fund-raising lunch for
Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., then went golfing in the smothering
humidity before helping raise $200,000 over dinner for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's 38-minute speech to the teachers was the latest in a
series of events in which Clinton has highlighted issues of drugs
and crime affecting children that the White House believes are of
particular concern to parents. He returned again on Monday to the
theme of children and guns, calling for passage of a juvenile crime
bill that would ban violent juveniles for life from buying guns.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said that gun violence was not the greatest threat
to most schools. ``In most schools it's not the sensational acts of
violence but smaller acts of aggression, threats, scuffles,
constant back talk that take a terrible toll on the atmosphere of
learning, on the morale of teachers, on the attitudes of other
students.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought the breakfast table had been left
unspattered by the cola wars, Pepsico announced Monday that it was
buying the Tropicana juice business from Seagram Co.
</P>
<P>
   The $3.3 billion cash purchase pits Pepsico against its
archrival, Coca-Cola Co., which owns Minute Maid, in the one part
of the day that is not traditionally given over to carbonated soft
drinks. The giants will now compete on the orange-juice front,
among others, and in a sign of things to come, both Coca-Cola and
Tropicana on Monday claimed to be the world's biggest branded juice
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brands compete head on head, and what this acquisition
does is ratchet up the orange-juice wars about three notches,''
said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, Pepsi's largest acquisition to date, also means the
end of a planned public offering of Tropicana stock, which had been
announced May 21 by Seagram's chief executive, Edgar Bronfman Jr.
The spinoff was intended to help pay for Seagram's $10 billion
acquisition of Polygram NV, the music company.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico approached Seagram about buying the company and the
price it paid is considered by some market analysts to be about the
same as had been anticipated through the public offering. Others
said Seagram could have made more through a public offering, and
certainly senior executives stood to gain more. Still, the sale
price is nearly triple the $1.2 billion Seagram paid Beatrice Co.
for Tropicana 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tropicana will continue to be based in Bradenton, Fla., and will
operate as a separate company, reporting directly to Roger Enrico,
chairman and chief executive of Pepsico. Tropicana, which had sales
last year of close to $2 billion, packages brands like Tropicana
Pure Premium, Season's Best and Dole worldwide. In the last several
years, it has made investments like buying orange groves in China
to improve its market position there.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday whether Tropicana's president and chief
executive, Ellen Marram, and the president of its North American
division, Gary Rodkin, would remain with the company. Enrico said
in an interview that he hoped they would. ``We haven't had a chance
to have all the discussions we need to have,'' he said. ``I've
expressed my hope to Ellen that she and the rest of the management
team will stay on.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Tropicana, Mark Gutsche, said Ms. Marram would
have no comment on her plans or on the deal. One analyst, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said, ``If she and Gary Rodkin walk, I
think Pepsi's got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The news had little effect in the stock market. Pepsi shares
rose 25 cents, to $39.75. Seagram shares rose 12.5 cents to
$39.9375.
</P>
<P>
   While the announcement on Monday took some analysts by surprise,
several said it was a good move for Pepsi, one that would increase
its overall performance and give it a presence in a fast-growing
category. ``Pepsi is getting very powerful brand equity in a
growing category,'' said Andrew Conway, an analyst for Morgan
Stanley, who had also been working on the stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico said: ``This fits in with what we want to be, a company
of big brands staying within the beverage and snack business. This
is a company that is in great shape. It's not broken. I think we
can add to it, and it will be additive as we go forward.''
</P>

<P>
   Tropicana has a strong lead in the part of the juice business
known as ``not from concentrate,'' meaning the company produces,
pasteurizes and packages the juice without turning it into
concentrate at any point. Tropicana's market share in that highly
profitable segment is 72 percent, and Minute Maid abandoned the
not-from-concentrate business last year in favor of frozen and
ready-to-serve, both from concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Minute Maid, through a spokeswoman, appeared unruffled by
Pepsi's entry into the juice business. ``The Minute Maid Company
has long-term strategies in place for its business and for its
brands,'' the spokeswoman, Chris Bozman, said. ``The company is
focused on executing those strategies to build value not only for
the Minute Maid business but also for the shareholders of the
Coca-Cola Company. As a result, it is irrelevant which company owns
which competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke has been putting considerable effort into Minute Maid of
late. At a company meeting for analysts and money managers in
Atlanta last month, Minute Maid was the focal point at a breakfast
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president, Ralph Cooper, pointing to changes in
the way the brand was manufactured and marketed, said, ``We have a
brand-new company here that we're creating.'' He added, ``We want
to own breakfast every day, own the lunch box every day, and own
the point of purchase every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Enrico said he telephoned Bronfman shortly after the May
announcement about Tropicana. But talks did not get serious until
about two weeks ago, he added. As recently as Saturday, bankers
working on the initial public offering did not know Pepsi had
become a suitor for Tropicana, though word began circulating late
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short run, they paid fair market value and they are
buying a business that has opportunity by itself,'' Bill
Pecoriello, an analyst for Sanford Bernstein, said.

   DALLAS _ Horacio Hernandez took a brief break from pouring and
troweling highway concrete while the temperature rose to 101 here
Monday afternoon, pulled away his tinted safety goggles and tried
to wipe them off with a T-shirt that was already soaked.
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of sweat could keep a project entirely on schedule
when crews have to quit painting when the temperature hits 100,
have given up altogether on roadside plantings, and have to mix
truckloads of ice cubes with the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   From Florida through Louisiana and Texas to Colorado, weeks of
incessant heat and drought have caused scores of deaths, burned-out
homes and withered crops.
</P>
<P>
   Although the numbers are preliminary and may prove overstated,
local and state authorities blamed the heat for 117 deaths,
including 81 in Texas, 22 in Louisiana and 11 in Oklahoma. Most of
the victims were elderly women and men who, determined to get by
without air-conditioning, mistakenly believed this summer was like
any other.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the heat claimed more lives, records show, was in
1995, when more than 300 deaths in the Chicago area were deemed
weather-related. Florida has had some recent rainfall and relief,
but the outlook for Texas is more, much more, of the same. On
Monday, the 15th straight 100-degree-plus reading in Dallas, has
already marked this summer as the worst since 1980, which was the
hottest ever.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas County health officials declared a state of emergency
more than a week ago. Other counties across the state are seeking
federal disaster assistance to compensate for more than $1.5
billion in farming and ranching losses.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Denver, usually a mile-high summer haven, temperatures
reaching 100 degrees have forced Public Service Company of Colorado
to threaten rolling, half-hour power shutdowns unless customers
keep their air conditioners off when they're not home.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, which had the second-hottest June on record and
a July barely any cooler, keeping the bobcats at the Audubon Zoo
healthy and cool has required dishes considered creative even by
demanding local standards. The animals' new diet features frozen
popsicles of chicken and beef.
</P>
<P>
   This heat wave, however, has chosen Dallas as its home base.
Compounding the heat has been the lack of any significant rainfall
here since early June, turning the earth into a vast radiator.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service predicted no let-up in Dallas or
the region through at least early next week. With a mass of heated,
high-pressure air refusing to budge, said Michael Mach, a weather
service meteorologist, the best hope is for a tropical storm from
the Gulf of Mexico to someday barrel through. But nothing of the
sort, he added, is in sight. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dallas County declared a state of emergency 10 days ago, and
counties around the state have sought federal disaster assistance.
As a matter of pride, however, many Texas want to prove how well
they can hold up.
</P>
<P>
   The salary of Dachel St. Mary, an office temporary, would only
stretch far enough for a single, $15.99 window fan to cool her and
her two children in their three-bedroom apartment. But even that
purchase was a concession. Before the air-conditioning era, she
said, ``People made it here for hundreds of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But then her four-year-old son, Andre, began waking up in the
middle of the night, sweating and throwing up. She saw on
television that the Salvation Army was among the agencies handing
out fans. So by Monday afternoon, she and Andre, who was sucking
from a plastic water bottle his mother had put in the freezer, were
waiting in a Salvation Army lobby for a friend to take them and two
new 20-inch box fans home.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the wrong side of the air-conditioning gap include
cowboys on the region's ranches. For Ben Morales and the other
cowboys he supervises at the Hester Brite Ranch in West Texas,
riding the range in air-conditioned pickup trucks rather than on
horseback hasn't gone far enough to soften ranching in temperatures
as high as 104. The drought has forced them to spend more hours and
days checking pumps, water lines and tanks, and feeding the cattle
protein pallets to make up for what they're missing from the
ground. In a year with only a third the normal rainfall, he said, a
half inch today, however welcome, will leave the earth dry by
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   At the Dallas Cowboys practice camp in Wichita Falls, Texas,
near the Oklahoma border, where the temperature reached 103 Sunday,
the players have been treated like imperiled cattle. Doctors and
coaches weigh them before and after practice to make sure they are
getting enough fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of practicing with full pads in the afternoon, they
practice in shorts, helmets and shoulder pads; they wear the
heavier gear only in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The construction workers rebuilding Dallas' North Central
Expressway have improvised their own gear. Some have ripped apart
sheets and T-shirts to fashion extra sun protection that hangs from
their hardhats down the backs of their necks. The new highway is
going in a deep, wide trench, blocking most breezes but reflecting
the sun's glare off the concrete
</P>
<P>
   Without ice in the concrete, it sets too fast to be shaped and
smoothed. Cooling down the workers is more of a challenge: the
nine-person crew that includes Hernandez usually goes through six
5-gallon insulated plastic jugs of water and gatorade each day.
Hernandez worked along the concrete retaining walls with Sunkist
and 7-Up cans each filled with water and within arm's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lawrence, working nearby, said the experience would improve
his motivation once he returns to Grambling University this fall.
``On days like this,'' he said, ``becoming a lawyer sounds
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   With few men willing to admit their limits, Arturo Gonzales, a
foreman, has to tactfully suggest to anyone looking faint that they
join him on some errands in his air-conditioned pickup truck. As he
drove up a ramp and away from the trench, he pointed to a newly
planted a bald cypress tree that, despite daily watering, had
already turned a lifeless brown.
</P>
<P>
   To this heat spell, Gonzales sees only one ultimate solution.
``I'm just waiting for October,'' he said.

EAST TIMOR HOPES, FEARFULLY, FOR PEACE

<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ There is an unsettling mix of terror and hope
in this threadbare capital of the disputed territory of East Timor,
where a solution to two decades of separatist warfare and military
brutality suddenly seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   The terror in this former Portuguese colony, born of decades of
mutual mistrust, comes from new threats of violence that in recent
days have caused thousands _ and perhaps tens of thousands _ of
people to flee the territory, which was seized by Indonesia in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am very frightened,'' said Benny Pinanoan, a lumber
trader who made Dili his home 14 years ago but evacuated his wife
and six children by ship on Friday. ``They came to me at night,
about 10 of them, and asked me if I was for integration or
autonomy. I tried to explain to them that I am just a businessman.
I don't care what flag they fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope comes from Indonesia's capital city, Jakarta, 1,400
miles to the west, where a bishop, a president, a United Nations
envoy and a jailed separatist leader have been discussing formulas
for peace. The four men, in round-robin meetings, seemed to be
moving quickly toward a framework that could include a period of
dialogue followed by some form of autonomy and a referendum that
could lead to independence. The talk was of gradual change that
could take years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations still recognizes Portugal's sovereignty over
the territory of 800,000 people, but until a month ago Indonesia,
under former President Suharto, insisted on its right to East
Timor. The shift came in June, when the man who succeeded Suharto,
B.J. Habibie, offered East Timor an ill-defined ``special status.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its annexation, East Timor has been Indonesia's greatest
international embarrassment, the source of most of the complaints
about its human rights record and, with its poverty and
instability, a drain on the resources and energy of the central
government.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether the territory's conciliatory forces or its
violent history will prevail.
</P>

   ``It's too early to tell what will happen,'' a Western diplomat
said. ``It could turn into a very messy situation. It depends on
whether the moderate elements there have enough influence. If the
hotheads win out, East Timor could be headed for serious
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend Dili was a near ghost town of shuttered shops
and silent streets as many remaining residents held a stay-at-home
protest to mark the 22nd anniversary of Indonesia's annexation of
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sea breezes of the early mornings, groups of students
gathered at the gates of their university _ closed for a month
because of separatist disputes _ to wait for the local newspaper to
arrive with daily reports of progress in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm greatly encouraged,'' the United Nations envoy, Jamsheed
Marker, said this weekend, after meeting with Habibie, the Roman
Catholic Bishop of East Timor, Carlos Ximenes Belo, and the
territory's imprisoned independence leader, Jose Xanana Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very optimistic that a solution can be found,'' Marker
said, in one of the most upbeat assessments heard from an official
since Indonesia invaded the eastern half of the island of Timor in
1975 and annexed it as a province the next year. He said the
foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal had agreed to meet in
New York in two weeks to try to move the talks forward.

FOUR TEXAS LAWMAKERS RANK IN TOP 10 IN PRIVATELY SPONSORED TRAVEL,
STUDY INDICATES 

</HEADLINE>

and GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jetting off to such destinations as Africa, France
and Turkey, lawmakers from Texas and their staffs are among the
most frequent travelers in Congress when others are footing the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that
four House members from Texas rank in the top 10 in privately
sponsored travel in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the travel is subsidized by industry groups or other
associations that have business before Congress, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the frequent fliers list is House Ways and Means
chairman Rep. Bill Archer, R-Houston. The study found that Archer
and his staff took 105 trips at a cost of $126,967.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, ranked third with
35 trips at a cost of $102,000. House Majority Whip Dick Armey,
R-Irving, was sixth with 58 trips at a cost of $80,041.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Green, D-Houston, rounded out the top 10 with 20 trips
at a cost of $42,271.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 the study found that organizations spent $6.4 million on
travel for all members of Congress and their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Although the members of Congress authorized all the trips, much
of the travel was delegated to their aides.
</P>
<P>
   Archer himself took only one trip, a 10-day visit in February
1997, to the Congo in Africa sponsored by the Corporate Council of
Africa, which paid $13,000 for the congressman's expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining trips were taken by his staff, which handles a
variety of issues, including tax policy and health care and
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the trips were one-day speaking engagements in
nearby locations, others were more exotic.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's former top tax staffer, Kenneth Kies, attended a forum
sponsored by the European-American Tax Institute in Cannes, France.
The Institute paid $3,850 for the seven-day trip to the French
Riviera last October.
</P>
<P>
   Kies also spent two days in the resort island of Nantucket in
June 1997, courtesy of the Tax Executives Institute, which picked
up the $800 tab.
</P>
<P>
   Kies left the Ways and Means staff in February for a job at
Price Waterhouse accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   While some travel may be necessary for staff and lawmakers,
critics say that often they are excuses to go to nice places.
</P>
<P>
   ``How necessary is it to discuss tax policy on the French
Riviera?'' asked Jennefer Shecter, a researcher with the Center for
Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Shecter said the trips raise the ``question of what kind of
access to lawmakers are these special interests getting that the
average citizen doesn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that lobbyist-subsidized travel is a way lawmakers and
their staffs can get around the gift ban enacted by Congress in
1996 that prohibits special interests from spending large amounts
of money wining and dining politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't give lawmakers gifts anymore but you can pay for
them to travel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the trips were sponsored by nonprofit or
educational groups that wanted speakers about policy, others were
spearheaded by groups that actively lobby Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Kahn, the former top health care staffer for the Ways
and Means Committee, took a two-day trip last November to Orlando,
Fla., courtesy of the Health Insurance Association of America, to
speak about the balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   The health insurance association worked to kill President
Clinton's first-term health care proposal and now opposes managed
care legislation before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn went to work for the health insurance association in
December and is now its president-designate.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means communications director Ari Fleischer last summer
took a two-day trip to Dallas to explore energy deregulation and
its tax implications. The $1,557 tab for the trip was picked up by
Texas Utilities, Co., which has a big stake in the outcome of any
utility deregulation legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said that travel was important for lawmakers and their
staffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This nation would not be well served if politicians spent all
of their time within the Beltway,'' he said, referring to the
highway around Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if staffers had to fly to Cannes, France, to gain insight
into issues, Fleischer responded, ``Is the only valid place to go
Minnesota?''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the study also unfairly inflates travel estimates
for Archer because it included the travel of a number of employees
who work for the Joint Tax Committee, which is overseen by the
House and Senate but chaired by Archer.
</P>
<P>
   Forty of the 105 trips listed by the Center under Archer's name
were taken by staff working for the Joint Tax Committee, said the
congressman's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of DeLay's trips were largely driven up by a dozen
trips abroad, including travel to Russia and the Czech Republic,
both paid for by the Ripon Educational Fund, a GOP organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Republican took along four of his aides on the
weeklong, $2,915 ``educational awareness '' trip to Turkey last
December. The Turkish-U.S. Business Council footed the bill for
that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, the Texas Christian Coalition paid for DeLay to
fly to Dallas to speak and the Tobacco Institute, an industry
funded organization, paid to fly DeLay aide John Feehry to Phoenix
for a briefing on tobacco issues.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Rudy, a DeLay aide, said that while privately sponsored
trips can sometimes raise ethical questions, ``it's certainly
better to do it this way than making the taxpayers pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans point out that they control committees and therefore
have bigger staffs doing more traveling than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The only Texas Democrat to make the top 10 travel list, Green
and his staff traveled to a number of countries, including Israel,
Mexico and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   A number of groups that do business before Congress also
sponsored his trips, including the Association of American
Railroads, which paid for a three-day, $3,307 trip to Palm Beach,
Fla., where the congressman examined transportation issues related
to railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Green said that his interest in railroads stems in part from the
fact that his district includes the Port of Houston, which relies
on rail to transport freight from the ships.
</P>
<P>
   Green said ``it makes me a better congressman to learn about''
issues such as rail transport.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Armey's privately sponsored travel was to U.S. cities to
discuss his flat tax proposals, although his aides went to China,
Turkey, Israel and Taiwan on fact-finding trips. An Armey aide,
David Hobbs, traveled to Palm Springs, Calif., on the tab of the
American Banker's Association, a group that has an interest in
major reform legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the seven trips Armey took were sponsored by Citizens
for a Sound Economy, a conservative group.

 DILI, Indonesia: talks forward.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Dili, habits of conflict remain strong and the prospect of
change seemed only to have heightened suspicions between the
separatists and the army, and between indigenous residents and the
Indonesian outsiders who have settled here over the past two
decades, taking over some 70 percent of the urban economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is not good,'' Belo said. ``It's tense. People
cannot sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past week as many as 20,000 non-Timorese residents have
fled East Timor, complaining of threats from mysterious black-clad
``ninjas'' and other thugs, though both the military and
separatists disavow any link to the threats.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks filled with armed soldiers and police officers patrolled
the streets this weekend, but people said the show of force was far
from reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last few days have been very tense, very tense,'' said
Olandina Alves, a restaurant owner who is also a member of the
provincial legislature. ``The troops are in every street, showing
their weapons. They say they are there to provide security, but it
is the troops who make people feel insecure.''
</P>
<P>
   This month three envoys from the European Union were forced to
cut short a visit here when huge crowds surrounded them and at
least two people were killed when soldiers began shooting.
</P>
<P>
   They were only the latest of tens of thousands of people who
have died in the territory's continuing turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of an estimated 50 to 200 demonstrators at a funeral
in November 1991 became known as the ``Dili massacre'' and has been
a major target of human rights groups opposed to Indonesia's
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Darwin, Australia _ just 400 miles to the east _ than
to Jakarta, this overwhelmingly Christian territory has little in
common with most of the rest of Indonesia, a nation that is 90
percent Muslim. While the rest of Indonesia was formerly under the
sway of Dutch colonialists, East Timor alone was a Portuguese
colony, for 400 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since Habibie's offer of a new status on June 11, East Timor has
been one of the most prominent examples of the wide-ranging reforms
that have swept the country since Suharto's resignation on May 21.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie also offered to withdraw some troops from the territory
and to release Gusmao, who was captured in 1992 and is serving a
20-year sentence for separatist activities, as part of a deal that
would include international recognition of East Timor as part of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Tono Suratman, the military commander here, said on
Friday that about 12,000 soldiers are stationed in East Timor. He
said the separatist guerrilla movement, known as Fretilin, had been
reduced to no more than 215 fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's offer was immediately rejected by East Timorese
separatist leaders like the self-exiled spokesman Jose Ramos-Horta,
who together with Belo won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996. But the
offer and the rejections were just the start of accelerating
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Marker arrived in Jakarta from talks in Portugal
about Habibie's offer, saying he had received positive signals and
that ``we have a chance, a good chance, at arriving at a
solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Gusmao, who received both Marker and Belo in his Jakarta prison,
gave the negotiations a lift, saying the issue of his release
should not slow down talks between Indonesia and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on the eve of Marker's arrival, Gusmao said, ``We
remain committed to dialogue as a means of finding a solution and
we are prepared to compromise to guarantee a fair solution while
respecting the interests of Indonesia.'' But he insisted, ``There
will be no solution if there is no referendum.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the bishop, who enjoys the respect of all sides
here, offered himself as a mediator in ``a transparent dialogue to
seek a way out of the conflict.'' He emerged smiling from a recent
meeting with Habibie, calling him ``a big politician and a big
president.''
</P>
<P>
   While separatists in East Timor are demanding an immediate
referendum on the territory's future, even Ramos-Horta recently
told the United Nations that tensions ran so high that it would be
unwise to hold a referendum in less than three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer recently described
the concern of many. ``If you have a referendum, the losers will
just take to the hills,'' he said. ``It wouldn't solve the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people interviewed here seemed to agree. The watchword was
``dialogue.'' Even among student activists, few people insisted on
independence in the short term. After years of fruitless struggle,
they said, everything was suddenly moving a little too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Independence is the final goal, but dialogue is important,''
said Antero Benedito da Silva, the leader of the student movement
here. ``Referendum is a process. So we start with free debate, a
dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of the debates and dialogues and compromises,
fundamental differences could keep the conflict alive. Sooner or
later, the East Timorese side insists, there must be a referendum,
which, at this stage, almost everyone agrees would result in a
demand for independence.
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, that appears to be the one demand the
Indonesian side is determined not to grant.

Granik says it's about the rich guys
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deputy commissioner disputes union claim that labor fight is to
protect NBA rank and file
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MONTE CARLO, Monaco _ Until NBA players become more realistic and
truthful about what's really important to them, it will be
impossible for their union leaders and the league to find much
common ground in labor negotiations, deputy NBA commissioner Russ
Granik says.
</P>
<P>
   Even as NBA commissioner David Stern and players union chief
Billy Hunter prepared to talk today _ their first face-to-face
meeting since before the June 24 draft _ Granik was painting a
bleak picture of the situation while on tour with the U.S. team
that will compete in the FIBA World Championship of Basketball next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they (the players) are totally disingenuous because
they keep saying this fight is about the guys at the low and middle
end (of the pay spectrum), but it's not,'' Granik said during a
candid, hourlong interview. ``What the union wants is for the guys
at the top to be able to make as much as they want. And then they
obviously would like more money for other guys, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are the second and third priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   This is directly opposite of the union's claim, which is that
this collective-bargaining struggle is for the rank and file rather
than the superstars.
</P>
<P>
   This basic difference of opinion is at the root of the NBA's
labor dispute. The players want to keep the so-called Larry Bird
exception, which has allowed stars and even lesser lights to sign
contracts worth as much as $18 million per year. And that number
seems certain to rise without changes to the way the NBA does
business with its players.
</P>
<P>
   The owners want to have the Larry Bird exception altered or
eliminated so that the top end of the pay scale is not limitless.
</P>
<P>
   Stern is scheduled to meet with Hunter this morning. It is
impossible to predict what, if anything, will be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   But most people believe that if today's meeting was a marker on
the road to completion in this labor dispute, it would be an inch
marker instead of a mile marker.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter spent the early part of July in Maui with player
representatives from each team, hashing out strategies and
outlining information about making sure players are secure
financially should the lockout last into next season.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a very real possibility, according to Granik, who
says owners don't want to make the same mistakes in this round of
labor talks that they made in 1995, when they gave up a luxury tax
and other salary restrictions to avoid missing part of training
camp and, perhaps, losing games for the first time in league
history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Granik believes there's an excellent chance that missing
games will become a reality in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a very good chance,'' he says. ``I hate to say
it, but I do. I don't want to predict that we will have one,
because I'm certainly hopeful that as we get closer, things will
get more serious and maybe we find a solution. That's what David
and I have done for the last 20-plus years _ we've tried to make
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really think the mood on the part of ownership is
different this time. I think there's a real possibility that this
time we're going to say we're not going to be able to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some sense that perhaps we tried too hard to make a
deal last time, that in our quest not to lose games last time
around, we gave up too much once we gave up the luxury tax that we
negotiated. That was all part of an effort to say, `We just don't
want a work stoppage, so we'll really accommodate what the players
want.' In return for which, we insisted on being able to reopen if
it didn't work. We just kind of knew that there was a good chance
that it wasn't going to work. And we did it anyway because we just
didn't want to have a work stoppage. I think some people feel that
we should have learned a lesson from that and that this time around
we can't just make a deal just so we have a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's time to play hardball. And the league is
making it clear what it wants after reopening the '95 agreement
after just three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we would like is to have something that is not
open-ended, that the guys at the top can't make quite as much as
they seem to be making,'' Granik says. ``And that will give more
money to the guys in the middle and the low end because we're ready
to spend the money. It's not about cutting back or even not
increasing (the total NBA payroll). It's just about how much it
increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem is that they want the guys at the top to be
able to get every last dollar that they can get. And then they'll
worry about the other guys. Not that it's our primary goal to take
care of the lower- and middle-level guys. We just think that's a
natural result of what we want because we want a system that has a
cap at the top end. When the top salary in other sports is maybe $8
million in hockey, a little more than that in football and maybe a
little more than that in baseball, we don't need a salary system in
the NBA where guys make $20 million to $25 million. There's
something in between there. And if the guys at the top didn't make
those levels, that would mean more money for everybody else. But as
long as they insist that it has to be totally open-ended and
there's nothing that could put a cap on the total salaries, then
we're not going to be able to make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players privately have said some sort of restricted free
agency might be the answer. They believe giving teams the right of
first refusal when their own free agents receive an offer from
another team could streamline the salary structure somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Owners counter that such a system still would not put a lid on
spending, that if somebody has enough value, a team will pay _ and
in some cases overpay.
</P>
<P>
   What the owners want is a system that designates a specified
amount of money _ it was nearly $1 billion last season _ that goes
to player salaries. Then there would be a cap of some sort to make
sure a handful of players don't eat up so much of that total that
owners have to dig further into the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``A billion dollars going in the pot for an average of 400
players is a lot of money, an average of $2.5 million that would go
up yearly,'' Granik says. ``But when some of the players start
making $20 million or more per year, all of the sudden it's not so
much money. That's a payroll of $30 million or so per team. But if
one player is taking $20 (million), it starts to seem like a lot
less than a billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the essence of our problem. And that's what they're
really in here fighting for is the ability of the guys at the top
to make as much as they can. And within some range, we can
understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if it's unlimited, then we don't have any system that we
can live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's meeting will be a start to finding a solution. But
probably not much more.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In virtually every way _ including the size of
their family _ John and Paula Lawrence are quintessentially middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   They live in a white brick colonial home in the verdant upper
Northwest section of Washington. He's a commercial real estate
lender; she's an audiologist. Their daughter, Candice, 12, attends
private school, plays violin in a citywide youth orchestra and
studies origami. Their son, John Paul, 6, has yet to develop the
patience needed for such pursuits, but his parents are confident
that, in time, he will.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrences, who devote a lot of time and energy and love to
their children, are adamant that they will have only two.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision to limit the size of their family, the
Lawrences are an example of a little-noticed, but striking trend in
the nation's black population: a steep decline in the birth rate
for married African-American couples. Married black women gave
birth to 357,262 babies in 1970. But, by 1996, the last year for
which complete figures were available, that figure had dropped to
179,568, a decline of nearly 50 percent, nearly twice the drop in
the birth rate among married white women.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reasons for the sharp drop in child bearing among
black women are universal _ higher family incomes, more education,
movement away from parents and relatives who can provide support
and child care. As more black families move up the economic ladder,
they are following the well-worn path of other ethnic groups and
reducing the size of their families.
</P>
<P>
   But some who have studied the phenomenon also say the slowdown
in the birth rate among two-parent black families is caused by some
forces not found in the larger white community. Black couples often
want to maximize the benefits they can give to their children so
that the offspring will have a better chance to compete in a
society the parents feel is racist, these expert say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to numerous African-American parents who really
are very serious about making sure their children are having rich,
rewarding experiences so that they start like with an advantage,
and not disadvantage,'' said Dr. William Turner, professor of
family studies at the University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   This sharp drop in the birth rate for black married couples has
had another equally significant, and surprising effect: It has
contributed to the appearance of what has been described as a
``crisis'' of illegitimacy within the black population, where the
percentage of births to mothers out of wedlock is approaching 70
percent. The number of single black women bearing children has
increased dramatically, rising to 415,213 in 1996 from 215,1000 in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Statisticians and demographers note that the startlingly high
percentage of black children born outside marriage is not the
result of more and more single black women giving birth. Indeed,
the percentage of single black women who have given birth has been
declining since 1989, and it reached a 40-year low in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the high proportion of black babies being born out of
wedlock is now mainly a function of its statistical comparison to
the steep drop in the number of children being born to married
black women.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the trend means that married black couples, whose
median household income is rapidly approaching parity with their
white counterparts, are able to give their children more of the
advantages of enhanced economic status: better housing, higher
quality schools, more material goods, more opportunities for travel
and cultural enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either one of us ever thought in terms of having
three or four kids,'' said Lawrence. ``I didn't have any fast or
hard ideas not to. I don't think Paula had any fast and hard ideas
not to. But I don't think we ever really contemplated more than
two.''

 WASHINGTON: than two.''

<P>
   But experts warn that since incomes for single black mothers
remain stagnant and their birth rates have not slowed as rapidly,
the sharp decline in the percentage of married black families
having children could widen the class divisions within the black
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that the potential for these rifts to be
exacerbated is terrific,'' said Turner. ``Unless there is some
constructive, meaningful dialogue and some organizations that are
strong in the black community get involved and deal with this in a
meaningful way, I think you will see those rifts grow even more and
more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity of birth rates between married and unmarried women
is a subject that causes discomfort among the several black
families interviewed. Some expressed concern that not enough
married African-American couples are having children, though that
criticism is directed toward those who are childless, rather than
those who have only one or two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that many times,'' said Paula Jackson McClain
manager of federal disability programs for the Washington public
schools. ``We have so many young black girls having babies who
really can't afford to have them. It's a shame that our black
families who have two-parent homes and the economic resources to
provide for their children aren't having any children. If you're
not having children, how can you say what our future will look
like? If the numbers are coming from parents who are too young, or
don't have the same educational drive and don't reinforce that in
their children, then we're kind of letting down our own race.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip and Brenda Woods Francis have two sons, ages 11 and 7. The
couple lived for a time in Zaire (now Congo), and Francis said that
the help provided by others there might have allowed them to have a
larger family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had not returned to the United States, we might have had
three, maybe, four children,'' said Francis, 46, who is director of
AIDS Research for the National Institute of Drug Abuse. ``Comparing
living there with living here, the biggest difference is
infrastructure and support system. When we lived in Zaire, we could
literally say we need to go away for two years, and the neighbors
would take the child or children and take care of them until you
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Newman, 44, a teacher in the Prince Georges County, Md.,
public schools, has only one sister. But her husband, Dominic, 45,
a ground maintenance foreman for the U.S. Parks Service, is one of
13 children. The couple have two sons, ages 19 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can produce two responsible adults, I'm happy,'' Ms.
Newman said. ``If they can go to college, get out and work, have a
solid religious background, I don't feel bad about not having any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Among several families interview, the women said that small
family sized has become such an accepted norm, that hardly anyone
even talks about it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one I've ever spoke with about it was a friend of
mine who has four kids,'' said Ms. McClain, 36, the mother a
9-year-old and a 1-year-old. ``When she was expecting her fourth
child, she said to me that only one person ever really
congratulated her. Usually people's response to the news was, Well,
I'm happy for you, if that's what you want.' It was as if she had
done something inappropriate and not something you should be
jubilant over.''

CAVER HELPS RESCUE HIMSELF FROM TIGHT SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Douglas is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALLUPVILLE, N.Y. _ Covered in mud, exhausted after two days
trapped in a dank crevice, Craig Douglas still managed a resilient
return to the Earth's surface Monday, smiling at jokes as he
emerged from one of the most intensive cave rescues ever in the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, 24, of Medford, Mass., suffered muscle injuries in the
accident, and underwent surgery Monday afternoon. It may take days
to determine whether permanent damage was done to his right leg _
which lay pinned under a rocky ledge for more than 30 hours _ and
it may be weeks before he can walk again, even with assistance.
</P>
<P>
   But it was quickly clear Monday that Douglas had lost none of
his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Wayne Douglas, who stood at the mouth of the nearly
invisible hole that leads to Keyhole Cave, began teasing his son as
soon as he resurfaced at 9:29 a.m. He called his son a
``spelunker'' _ which, among cavers, is short for a clumsy rookie _
and the younger Douglas, an expert caver, immediately grinned back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave him a good ribbing,'' his father said, smiling, later
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one example of Douglas's good spirits throughout the
ordeal, which lasted 39 hours and drew more than 200 rescue workers
from seven states to this tiny hole in the ground 45 miles west of
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 2:30 p.m. on Saturday, after descending Keyhole
Cave 3 1/2 hours earlier, Douglas accidentally slid down a narrow
slot as he was trying to inch through a 10-inch by 16-inch
passageway.
</P>
<P>
   His right leg lodged under a rock, Douglas called out to Buster
Miller, one of three companions with him on the trip. Miller, 24,
turned back to discover Douglas's leg up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he tried to help Douglas; but minutes later, when the
effort proved unsuccessful, Jennifer Russell, another friend,
climbed out of the cave and ran down the road to the house of site
manager Emily Davis Mobley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew exactly what to do,'' Mobley, 48, said.
</P>
<P>
   Small groups of expert cavers converged, then dozens. A
physician who specializes in cave rescues, Dr. Sam Chewning, flew
by private jet from North Carolina. Hundreds of rescue workers
brought electric generators and phone lines, food parcels and
hand-warmers.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, the sleepy country road became host to a convergence
of television crews and curious neighbors, as the first rescue
mission ever to take place in Keyhole Cave unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   By 7:16 p.m. on Sunday, rescuers _ with help from Douglas
himself _ had accomplished their first task: freeing his leg from
the ledge where it had gotten stuck, after chipping away at the
stone with a drill.
</P>
<P>
   But the second and arguably more dangerous phase _ ascending the
100-foot cave _ still remained.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a full suit of polypropelene underwear and a set of
one-piece overalls, his stomach filled with Power Bars sent from
above, Douglas rested for several hours in a nearby cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Then at 7:50 a.m. Monday, attached to a single rope, he
astonished rescuers by performing a ``self-assisted rescue'' _ in
which he essentially worked his way up along the narrow walls of
the cave while rescuers pulled on a supporting rope from above.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afterward, a whole bunch of the rescuers said, `I really want
to meet him,''' Mobley said. ``I have a real admiration for Craig.
We're all very impressed. Even we think this is pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, whose 19-year-old sister, Erica, was also in the trip,
recently graduated from the University of New Hampshire, where he
pursued a double major in chemical engineering and philosophy, his
father said. He now lives in Medford, where he shares an apartment
with Miller, a college friend, and is working for his father's
company, Langton &AMP; Douglas Construction.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mobley and his friends, Douglas is an expert,
athletic caver, who descended a nearby cave just weeks ago. And his
friends Miller and Russell also recently completed a cave rescue
weekend in Vermont, in which they spent two days learning exactly
the rescue procedures they used this weekend, Mobley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that may have been fresh in their minds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a press conference at the Albany Medical Center, where
Douglas was admitted Monday, Russell read a statement indicating
that both she and Miller were astounded by Douglas's
``extraordinary strength, both emotionally and physically.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked continuously with the team ... to free his knee, and
then managed to find some energy left to perform an assisted
self-rescue,'' said Russell, who lives in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas was recovering late Monday from an operation known as a
faschiotomy, a one-hour procedure designed to restore the flow of
blood to his leg, according to his surgeon, Dr. Paul Hospodar.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas's leg had suffered swelling for approximately six to 10
hours, Hospodar said. Although he could be on crutches within as
few as four days, Douglas may need physical therapy, and perhaps
further surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But the surgeon said Douglas was in ``great condition''
considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am truly amazed at the condition he is in now,'' Hospodar
said.
</P>
<P>
   And as to his future in underground explorations?
</P>
<P>
   Douglas's father _ who said emphatically that he is not a caver
himself _ said he did not doubt his son would return.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 24 and he loves it,'' he said. ``He'll keep caving, I'm
sure.''

 &HT;    ACC coaches come together for annual pre-season meeting
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE LANIER ISLANDS, Ga. _ Each year the nine head football
coaches of the ACC gather in a resort location to discuss the
coming season. And each year eight of these men must again address
the universal question that haunts this league: Will this be the
season that somebody _ ANYBODY _ mounts even a token challenge to
Florida State?
</P>
<P>
   Now these coaches, to their credit, say all the right things
about Florida State. They praise the school's talent, coaching, and
tradition and want to emulate it. They express the proper
appreciation for the television exposure (and the dollars) the
Seminoles have brought to the ACC. They insist that the rest of the
league is slowly, but surely, closing the gap on Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   FSU coach Bobby Bowden, for his part, just smiles and agrees
with his colleagues. He says something appropriately humble like:
''Shoot, men. I know they are gonna catch us sooner or later. Just
hope it ain't this year.'' And everybody laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Then the season starts and Bowden's boys blow the doors off of
the rest of the league. Here are the facts: The Seminoles are 47-1
in ACC games since becoming a member in 1992. It has won those
games by an average of 30.5 points. The lowest margin of victory
for Florida State over the ACC was 1992 (20.75 ppg), it's first
year in the league. Since then it's been 27 points or higher.
</P>
<P>
   The same song and dance took place again on Monday at Lake
Lanier where Florida State was picked to win the ACC for the
seventh straight year. The other coaches, of course, believed they
were getting closer to finally beating the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   But here is reality: The gap between Florida State and the rest
of the ACC will NOT shrink in 1998. If anything, it will grow even
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   If somebody was going to knock Florida State off the ACC throne,
it would have been last year. North Carolina had its best team
ever, finishing 11-1 with the nation's No. 2 defense. But when the
showdown came in Chapel Hill on Nov. 8, the Seminoles toyed with
the Tar Heels and won a 20-3 game that really wasn't that close.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson, which had its all-time leading rusher and passer in the
same backfield, put a huge scare into Florida State in Death Valley
but came up short, 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   Now both those teams are rebuilding while Florida State is
reloading to field perhaps its fastest team ever, according to
Bowden. Whereas a year ago the Seminoles played Clemson, North
Carolina, and Virginia on the road, all those games are now at
home. Accordingly, Florida State is in the top three of just about
everybody's preseason poll and the ACC championship, like it or
not, will again be but a mere formality.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: The rest of the ACC improved and in 1997 took its
best shot at Florida State. It missed. Now it appears the Seminoles
will be more dominant than ever in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''What everybody has to remember is that Florida State is not
standing still waiting for us to catch up with them,'' said North
Carolina coach Carl Torbush, whose team is picked to finish second
again. ''They are getting better too. They've set the standard.
We're getting better but we're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches feel Florida State's greatest advantage is the
depth the Seminoles have been able to develop through years of
recruiting at the very highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're talking about front-line players, the first 22 you
put on the field, they don't have much of an advantage,'' said
Clemson coach Tommy West. ''But when they put that second 22 and
even that third team out there, they have a big advantage. That's
where the rest of the teams in this league have to close the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches believe that while Florida State has gotten to the
top of the ACC with superior talent, it has used something more to
stay on top.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we've closed the gap but you've still got to show up
and play,'' said Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a talent standpoint, I don't the gap is as wide as it
once was. It's the mental part of the game where they still have a
big edge. Every time they play somebody, it's the other team's big
game. They are used to the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, of course, simply enjoys the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody has their run and now we're having ours,'' said
Bowden, whose team has finished in the final top four nationally
for 11 straight years. ''We're not dominating our league more than
Nebraska has dominated theirs. Are we?''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's some consolation.

 &HT;    ACC Notebook: Not even Bowdon gets audience with Pope
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE LANIER ISLANDS, Ga. _ As if Florida State didn't already
have a leg up on the rest of the league, head coach Bobby Bowden
almost put himself into another class earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, in town for the 1998 Atlantic Coast Conference Football
Kickoff, said he and wife Julia took a vaction to Italy this
summer. ''There is a priest over there who is a Florida State
graduate and he was going to arrange for us to meet the Pope,''
said Bowden. ''We were going to have our picture made together.''
</P>
<P>
   But alas, even the Dean of Southern College Football had to take
a backseat on this one. ''He (the Pope) decided to take a
vacation,'' said Bowden. ''I just wasn't big enough for the Pope.''
</P>
<P>
   How can you tell?
</P>
<P>
   Virginia offensive coordinator Sparky Woods was asked how
Cavalier head coach George Welsh was faring after underoing back
surgery for a herniated disc on June 22. ''I couldn't tell any
difference,'' said Woods. ''He always looks like he's in pain to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eating at him
</P>
<P>
   Woods and new North Carolina coach Carl Torbush attended
Carson-Newman College together as underclassmen in the early '70s.
Woods described Torbush as having a huge appetite. ''He was always
mooching food off of other people's plates,'' Woods said. ''That's
how he met his wife. She caught him mooching some food off her
plate in the cafeteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Still on top
</P>
<P>
   Florida State was once again voted No. 1 in the ACC by the
sixty-six sportswriters and sportscasters at the meetings. In fact,
the Seminoles received all 66 votes as the top team. North Carolina
edged Virginia for the No. 2 spot by three votes while Tech was
picked fourth and Clemson fifth. Wake Forest was a surprise No. 6
pick while N.C. State was seventh, Duke eighth and Maryland last.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball or football?
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina freshman Ronald Curry from Hampton, Va., is
considered by many as one of the top football and basketball
players in the country. Torbush says if Curry is red-shirted, he
will meet with the player and Carolina basketball coach Bill
Guthridge at the appropriate time to discuss whether Curry would be
allowed to practice basketball in the fall. ''We're not counting on
any freshmen playing,'' said Torbush, ''but if they do, that's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   No expansion
</P>
<P>
   With rumors of the ACC expanding, only Bowden and Tech's George
O'Leary voiced any support for the league to up its membership from
its present nine. O'Leary said he'd like to see twelve while Bowden
said he favored ten. ''I'd expand one team,'' said Bowden. ''Get
somebody from New York, like Syracuse.'' O'Leary says he feels
expansion is necessary. ''I think we ned to expand or we'll be
behind the eight-ball,'' he said. ''I think you have to expand to
control the (TV) markets.''

 &HT;    Cargill's lofty junior status brings conflicting demands
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It wasn't a typical week for Ansley Cargill, but
neither was it the first time she'd been pulled in different
directions since establishing herself as the best 16-and-under
girls tennis player in the United States last summer.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of deliberating, the Atlanta teenager accepted a
wild card into what would've been her first professional
tournament, this week's $25,000 USTA Women's Challenger of
Peachtree City, Ga. Taking the wild card meant bypassing one of the
four major junior national championships, the USTA Girls 18 Clay
Courts in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, four days later, that didn't seem like a good idea
anymore. So Cargill pulled out of Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd really rather be playing in the pro tournament, but that's
the dream and it's better for me to face reality,'' Cargill said
from Memphis, where she won her first-round match Monday. ``I
apologize for that. I didn't really mean to hurt anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurt? No. Anger? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lack of integrity here,'' said Peachtree
City tournament director Virgil Christian, who also was upset that
Cargill never withdrew from Memphis after accepting his wild card.
``You have to think through your decisions because you ruin a lot
of work for a lot of people. She gave us her word.''
</P>
<P>
   Also disappointed was Jenny Craig of Adidas, which helps sponsor
the Peachtree City tournament and outfits Cargill as a member of
the Adidas national junior team. Craig, who secured the wild card
for Cargill, flew in from Portland, Ore., on Saturday primarily to
see her play, then tried to persuade her to stick with Plan A.
</P>
<P>
   ``She called me in tears with her decision, completely stressed
out,'' said Craig, who sympathized with Cargill's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, who gave up a chance to face top-200 touring pros for
the first time, decided her first loyalty was to the U.S. Tennis
Association, which funded her trips the past year to Europe and
South America and to the junior majors, including the French Open
and Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   The USTA's view was that Cargill should further prove herself as
an 18-and-under amateur, if simply to justify future trips abroad.
Cargill consulted with the USTA coach for women's tennis, Lynne
Rolley, who left the decision to Cargill but offered the carrot of
future pro wild cards. The implication, Cargill understood, was
that those wild cards might depend on playing in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult because everything you do, you wonder
what's the USTA going to say about this or that,'' Cargill said.
``I have to stay on their good side because I have to have their
funding and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargill has been in the spotlight since she won the USTA Girls
16 National Championships last August in San Diego, but has been
troubled by competing loyalties ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Cargill went to live in Florida, hoping to train with
national coach Tracy Chappell. Upon arriving, Cargill found that
Chappell was estranged from the USTA and banned from the USTA's
National Training Center in Key Biscayne. Cargill worked with other
USTA coaches there for a while, then moved in with Chappell and
worked with her independently through the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is they weren't happy with me being with Tracy and
there was friction,'' said Cargill, who continues to work with
Chappell. ``It's hard to talk about it because I don't really know
what happened. I was caught in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Cargill returned to Atlanta this month. She plans to re-enroll
as a junior at Westminster in the fall and looks forward to life as
it used to be. And apologies, again, to Peachtree City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what they're talking about; you shouldn't go back
on your word,'' Cargill said. ``But I don't think they understand
the roller coaster I've been on this year.''

TINY PREEMIE GETS TO GO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She began life last October as a 14-ounce preemie, the
size of a Pepsi can, her mother recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Twice since then she came close to dying, but she didn't, and
now Shaniqua Leatherwood owns a distinction. She's tied with
another baby as the smallest ever born in Boston to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Shaniqua went home yesterday after spending the first nine
months of her life in sterile medical wards and growing to a
whopping 9 1/2 pounds _ the weight of a normal 6-week-old infant.
</P>
<P>
   Just before leaving Franciscan Children's Hospital and
Rehabilitation Center, Shaniqua lay in bed fussing like any baby:
turning her head, swinging her arms, rubbing her feet together,
slipping out of her white socks.
</P>
<P>
   But while she has put on some pounds, many of her organs are not
yet fully developed. So a plastic tube supplied her with oxygen
through her tracheostomy, an electrode taped to her big toe
monitored her oxygen, heart rate, and respiration, and her floral
pink dress hid the tube in her stomach that feeds her when formula
bags are attached.
</P>
<P>
   Similar life-preserving equipment has been installed in her
home, where she will receive nursing care 12 hours each day at
least until she can eat and breathe properly. According to a survey
of Boston hospitals and Globe records, no baby weighing less than
14 ounces has ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   That Shaniqua survived is a miracle, some say. When she was born
last Oct. 30 at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center after just 25
weeks in the womb, ``they told us she wouldn't live,'' said her
29-year-old mother, Gwendolyn Leatherwood. At two months, Shaniqua
stopped breathing due to narrow breathing passages, and at four
months, major heart problems developed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tracheostomy and God saved her,'' Leatherwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, credit near-miraculous technological advances.
While only a few babies need the extensive medical care Shaniqua
did, more premature babies _ increasingly smaller and sicker _ are
surviving than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, America hit an all-time high of 7.4 percent in the
proportion of infants born at weights low enough to put them at
risk _ 5.5 pounds or less. At the same time, the infant mortality
rate has continued a long-term decline: 7.2 per 1,000 in 1996, down
from 12.6 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the life support services Shaniqua has already
used, she will need care from several specialists: ear, nose and
throat, lung, and eye. Physical and occupational therapists must
teach her how to play and move, and a speech therapist must teach
her to swallow and chew. Not until she is 18 months or older will
specialists be able to see what, if any, nerve, mental or
developmental damage has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the cost of her medical care runs in the hundreds of
thousands of dollars, according to a Franciscan spokeswoman, and is
paid for by Medicaid. The largest hospital bill in Massachusetts
last year was almost $1.4 million over three months for a privately
insured newborn requiring complicated surgery, according to the
Massachusetts Health Data Consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Future advances will undoubtedly push even lower the birthweight
of babies who can be saved. Along the way, the ethical debate will
intensify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think everyone should be saved,'' said Dr. Milana
Stavitsky, Shaniqua's pediatrician. ``Others think that maybe
society spends a lot of money they could use another way because of
(babies') severe handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, you just cannot tell who to save or not. I had patients
who I thought would have terrible outcomes and they look great four
years out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stavitsky cautiously predicted Shaniqua's outcome:``I think she
has a pretty good potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Leatherwood said she had received prenatal care, but high blood
pressure and low levels of amniotic fluid sent her to the hospital
early. Before Shaniqua's birth, she worked out of her home cutting
and styling hair. Now taking care of Shaniqua will be a full-time
job, she said. Her other child, an outgoing boy now 6 years old,
was born at 32 weeks and weighed 2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Leatherwood, a single mother exhausted by her nine-month ordeal,
said, ``After everything she's suffered, she should be blessed from
now on.''

COHEN HOPES FOR STANDARD ADULTERY POLICY SOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday that
he hoped to create a standard, less onerous approach to prosecuting
adultery in the military, even though a draft proposal for him to
do so has met some resistance within the services.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he was not surprised at the resistance, which,
officials familiar with the deliberations said, has been most
vigorous in the Marine Corps. He said he expected to decide this
week or next on a single policy that would have the support of the
chiefs of the Army, the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to make it as fair as possible, but also to have
some standard approach, if it can be achieved, to set some rules to
clear up the ambiguities and inconsistencies,'' Cohen said,
speaking at a Pentagon news conference with the defense minister of
Kazakhstan, Col. Gen. Mukhtar Altynbayev.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines' opposition to any lessening of the severity with
which adultery is treated has set up a last showdown over adultery
and fraternization, both of which have been the subject of more
than a year of review. Cohen ordered the reviews last June to
address perceptions that the services pursued courts-martial for
sexual misconduct erratically, often holding enlisted personnel and
junior officers to a harsher standard than senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   A committee of review appointed by Cohen has drafted changes to
the Manual for Courts-Martial that would impose a less serious
discharge than at present for enlisted personnel convicted of
adultery. Among the committee's other recommendations are new
guidelines that would call for criminal cases only when the
adultery had disrupted the smooth functioning of a unit or
discredited the service.
</P>
<P>
   When the Pentagon's general counsel, Judith Miller, outlined the
proposed changes for the four armed services earlier this month,
the Marine Corps in particular objected, officials said. The corps
went public Monday when a spokesman, Col. Stuart Wagner, said the
marines' commitment to country extended to family as well.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Semper fidelis' is not just a slogan,'' Wagner said of the
Marine Corps motto, Latin for ``Always faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in favor of any action that would lower our
standards,'' he said, ``either actually or by perception.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday that the other services had not objected
so strenuously to the changes, but it was not clear whether Cohen
would force the Marines to accept the committee's recommendations
or would instead find a compromise. The secretary himself said, ``I
think any time that you are looking at existing policies and
procedures, and looking for ways in which you can correct any
deficiencies or what are seen as ambiguities, I suppose there's
bound to be some resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen did not discuss the proposed changes in detail Monday but
said he wanted commanders to resolve cases involving adulterous
affairs with ``a much more balanced approach to resolving them
rather than going just from the incident itself to perhaps a
court-martial in the first instance.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in Congress has been muted, with most lawmakers
waiting for an announcement of the secretary's final decision. But
conservative groups have already expressed outrage at the
proposals. Elaine Donnelly, president of one, the Center for
Military Readiness, said the changes would erode military
discipline. ``If you're going to break a commitment to your
spouse,'' she said, ``then you're going to break the commitment you
have to those who serve under your command.''

ADMINISTRATION STAYING OUT OF GM STRIKES, FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Mich.)  (See related story, GM-AD-COLUMN) 
(af) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Last year, the Clinton administration blocked a
strike against American Airlines and leaped in to resolve a walkout
against the United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   But 46 days into strikes at General Motors Corp. that have idled
26 factories and more than 186,000 workers, the administration has
made no such move. President Clinton has not even mentioned the
dispute publicly for more than a month, and he spoke about it then
only in answer to a question. ``I would like to encourage the
parties to work it out,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Clinton spoken directly with leaders of the United
Automobile Workers or GM, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the administration's action _ or inaction _ is consistent
with labor law, labor politics and labor history, particularly
within the intense and sophisticated tradition of auto bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the UAW nor GM has asked the government to step in _ as
the parties did during the UPS strike _ and they never have in the
past. With a 60-year history of bargaining between them, the union
and the company fiercely believe in their ability and their right
to handle their own disagreements without state or federal
interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mediator just gets in the way,'' said Douglas Fraser, who
was the president of the UAW from 1977 to 1983. ``He wouldn't add
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis M. Herman, the Labor secretary, has offered the parties
the use of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, but they
have not taken her up.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, she noted that collective bargaining in
principle was not supposed to involve the government. ``This really
is bargaining by the parties and not bargaining by the
government,'' she said. Ms. Herman was here for a convention of the
American Federation of Teachers, which Clinton addressed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman said that unlike the labor confrontations last year,
``these talks have not broken down, they continue to negotiate.''
She described her role as insuring ``that they are at the table and
that they are talking and working through these differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the important role for this administration, given that
they are still bargaining in good faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The president does not have the legal authority to step in, as
he did in the case of American Airlines, according to the
administration and outside labor experts. Under the Railway Labor
Act, which also governs labor relations in the airline industry,
the president has the power to impose a cooling-off period in the
event of a strike that threatens commerce or travel.
</P>
<P>
   But under the National Labor Relations Act, which governs auto
strikes, he may not step in unless the strike imperils ``the
national health and safety'' and affects an entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly don't believe this strike has reached that level
of impact,'' Ms. Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   John T. Dunlop, a Harvard professor who was secretary of Labor
under Gerald R. Ford, said that the company, the union and the
government were conducting themselves in this dispute much as they
have over six decades of labor turbulence in the auto industry.
``It is in keeping with past practices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his public silence, Clinton is said by aides to be
closely monitoring the dispute. Every day, he receives a stack of
clippings about it and a memorandum breaking down the number of
workers idled in each state.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herman said that she speaks to both sides frequently and is
tracking the economic impact of the strikes in the industry and
beyond. She said Monday that she was becoming concerned about
reports on the damage caused by the strikes at two parts factories
in Flint, Mich., to GM's vendors and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   GM is losing about $75 million a day. And that, from the union's
perspective, is one more reason for the administration not to
intervene. To the union, any federal interference would weaken its
most precious power, the financial damage caused by a strike.
(Monday, about 300 UAW leaders gathered at a hotel in Flint to map
out strategy.)
</P>
<P>
   Auto workers and unions generally remain an important, if
diminished, element in the base of the Democratic Party. And that
base of loyal voters will be particularly critical in the midterm
elections this year, as less politically active voters are likely
to stay home from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite misgivings about Clinton's centrist policies, union
members have proved stalwart supporters of the president, who has
presided over an economic boom that has meant high overtime pay for
most auto workers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials are now awaiting the outcome of
arbitration between the union and GM that is scheduled to begin on
Wednesday. The arbitrator will decide whether the strikes represent
an illegal walkout that violates the company's national agreement
with the union.
</P>
<P>
   If the arbitrator rules that the strikes are illegal, GM has
asked for a court order to end the strikes, as well as to grant
financial penalties against the union. That outcome, one official
said Monday, would make any question of government action moot. &QL;

 &HT;    From coast to coast, nation swelters
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gregg Olsen knows heat waves. Five years ago, it got so hot in
Seattle that some people were painting their lawns green.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawns aren't even brown yet,'' Olsen said Monday, ``so
it's not that bad yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet. But we're well on our way.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle was no different Monday than most of the rest of the
nation _ hot, sticky, muggy _ as the heat wave blamed for at least
117 deaths continued to roll over the country.
</P>
<P>
   In hard-hit Texas, where the heat has claimed 81 lives,
sheriff's deputies knocked on doors in remote Dallas County
neighborhoods to help anyone suffering from heat distress. The
temperature in Dallas reached 100 degrees Monday for the 15th day
in a row, and deputies distributed bottled water and electric fans
to the needy.
</P>
<P>
   The dead included 43 illegal immigrants who had crossed the
border from Mexico. The Mexican government issued a warning for
citizens planning any crossings to beware of the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas and Oklahoma also hit triple digits Monday as the
oppressive blanket of heat was blamed for at least 22 deaths in
Louisiana, 11 in Oklahoma and one each in Arizona, Missouri and
California.
</P>
<P>
   Even the hot spots were worse than usual. You go to Death Valley
in the summer, you expect it to be hot. But for the past six days,
it had been at least 120 degrees. The California desert even set a
record Friday for the second-highest temperature there: 129
degrees. How unseasonably hot is that? The all-time high of 134
degrees was set in 1913.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was relatively milder, with the mercury merely reaching
115 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the humidity was 27 percent,'' said Death Valley National
Park ranger Terry Baldino, ``so it felt more like 125 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   It felt that hot to John Cronin, too, though the temperature
only reached the mid-80s Monday in his Georgia, Vt., home, not even
60 miles from the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty sticky,'' he said Monday afternoon. ``Vermont is
usually a lot cooler than this.''
</P>
<P>
   How are he and his family coping?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pool, so it's not a big deal,'' Cronin said. ``But
the last week has been something of a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He has eight electric fans in his lakeside home and three
ceiling fans, plus a couple of wall air-conditioning units.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're better than nothing,'' he said, terse New England
stoicism in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning. Now there's something that Olsen wishes he had
bought for his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I didn't need it,'' the Seattle native said. ``Now
it's like driving in a hot little tin can. I'm going to get it for
those three days a year we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat is even hammering people in top physical condition.
Many athletes are having to adjust their training schedules.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do your workouts earlier, especially when it's hot
every day,'' said Rebecca Twigg, a former world champion cyclist
who lives in Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Twigg prefers not to drive her car, relying on her bicycle for
the daily 10-mile commute to work and school.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the winter,'' she said, ``I do my errands in the middle of
the day. Now I won't do anything in the middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat was not enough to keep tourists away from Death Valley.
Most of them this time of year are Europeans. Many of them stop at
the famous desert because it's between Las Vegas and San Francisco,
two popular destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see the extremes of our country and this it,''
ranger Baldino said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the tourists only spend a day in Death Valley,
and they rarely venture out of their air-conditioned rental cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get too many campers and they're usually not hiking
much,'' Baldino said. ``The heat is so intense at times that the
air temperature can be 120 but the ground temperature can be 200.
You don't want to grab door handles. You don't want to pick up
rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the nation, many people took solace from the hope
that the heat will relent. Soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray for these hot days,'' Olsen said in Seattle. ``We
whine from the beginning of April, 'We want our summer.' Then, when
it gets here, we want it to go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't last long, so you don't need a lot of coping
skills. You're probably just embarrassed that you're complaining
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Death Valley, the temperature reached triple digits for the
37th time this year on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really just a mindset,'' Baldino said.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, Cronin had a more practical solution that suits the
entire country: ``We're drinking a lot of water.''

   Boots, possible fingerprint may give Feds new lead in Rudolph
hunt
</P>
<P>
   By John Harmon
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ Battling heat and occasional rattlesnakes, an
army of law officers continued Monday to seek bombing suspect Eric
Robert Rudolph foot by foot in rugged mountainous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that agents may have found fresh footprints of the
Birmingham bombing suspect in the Nantahala National Forest,
federal agents Monday returned to the store where Rudolph bought a
pair of boots in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   They came and asked if they could see the boot that Eric
bought,'' said Kathy Jo Roper of Roper's Boot Store in the nearby
rural community of Topton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the boot outside and made impressions in the sand
and dirt outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents visited the store in February during the early days of
the now six-month-old manhunt for Rudolph. At the time they
purchased a pair of the same style and size of Danner insulated
hunting boots bought by Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear why agents returned for more boots, and U.S.
Justice Department spokesman Patrick Crosby declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's WBS-TV, citing sources, reported Monday that searchers
had found a fingerprint matching Rudolph's at an abandoned
campsite.
</P>
<P>
   At a press briefing Monday, the chief of the Southeast Bomb
Taskforce said teams skilled in tracking are combing the
surrounding mountains. The teams include tracking dogs and heavily
armed tactical units of the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms, said taskforce chief Woody Enderson.
</P>
<P>
   They are searching an area known as the Tusquitee range, which
has 5,000-foot-high peaks, dense hardwood forests and thickets of
rhododendron that are virtually impenetrable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not impossible for a team to to cover 10 to 15 miles in a
day,'' Enderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've covered 10 square miles since last week... It's progress
as well as we could hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 31, is charged with bombing a Birmingham abortion
clinic Jan. 29, killing an off-duty policeman who was moonlighting
as a security guard and severely wounded a nurse. He also is wanted
for questioning in three Atlanta bombings, including the 1996
Olympics blast that killed one and injured more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Until he emerged July 9 and obtained food, Rudolph had not been
seen early February, when his abandoned pickup truck was found
outside Murphy.

   LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co. is expected to report little
or no profit growth in its fiscal third quarter ended June 30 due
to soft home-video sales and lagging foreign performance for movies
and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment giant will probably issue today's report prior
to the market's opening, according to analyst Stewart Halpern of
Furman Selz. Wall Street's consensus estimate is for profits of
$0.21 a share, or about $437 million, similar to results in the
year-ago quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Operating profits will drop more than 12 percent to $948
million, Halpern said, due to a 42.8 percent decline to $180
million in the creative-content sector. Problems stem from poor
home-video performance from ``Flubber,'' soft foreign box office
due to a poor performance from ``Starship Troopers'' and the
distraction of soccer's World Cup and Asia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern forecasts broadcasting results should remain flat with
$340 million in operating profit while theme parks will rise 10
percent to $428 million due to strong results from the new Animal
Kingdom in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's stock price, adjusted for its recent three-for-one
split, hit a record $42.375 on May 4, fell to $35.0156 on June 30
on analysts' downgrades and cuts in earnings estimates, then
rebounded partly due to respectable performance by ``Mulan'' and
``Armageddon.'' It closed off $0.8125 at $38.5625 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern rates the stock a ``buy'' and expects it to finish 1999
in the $48 to $50 range.

 WASHINGTON: than two.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But experts warn that since incomes for single black mothers
remain stagnant and their birth rates have not slowed as rapidly,
the sharp decline in the percentage of married black families
having children could widen the class divisions within the black
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that the potential for these rifts to be
exacerbated is terrific,'' said Turner. ``Unless there is some
constructive, meaningful dialogue and some organizations that are
strong in the black community get involved and deal with this in a
meaningful way, I think you will see those rifts grow even more and
more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity of birth rates between married and unmarried women
is a subject that causes discomfort among the several black
families interviewed. Some expressed concern that not enough
married African-American couples are having children, though that
criticism is directed toward those who are childless, rather than
those who have only one or two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that many times,'' said Paula Jackson McClain
manager of federal disability programs for the Washington public
schools. ``We have so many young black girls having babies who
really can't afford to have them. It's a shame that our black
families who have two-parent homes and the economic resources to
provide for their children aren't having any children. If you're
not having children, how can you say what our future will look
like? If the numbers are coming from parents who are too young, or
don't have the same educational drive and don't reinforce that in
their children, then we're kind of letting down our own race.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip and Brenda Woods Francis have two sons, ages 11 and 7. The
couple lived for a time in Zaire (now Congo), and Francis said that
the help provided by others there might have allowed them to have a
larger family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had not returned to the United States, we might have had
three, maybe, four children,'' said Francis, 46, who is director of
AIDS Research for the National Institute of Drug Abuse. ``Comparing
living there with living here, the biggest difference is
infrastructure and support system. When we lived in Zaire, we could
literally say we need to go away for two years, and the neighbors
would take the child or children and take care of them until you
come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Newman, 44, a teacher in the Prince Georges County, Md.,
public schools, has only one sister. But her husband, Dominic, 45,
a ground maintenance foreman for the U.S. Parks Service, is one of
13 children. The couple have two sons, ages 19 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can produce two responsible adults, I'm happy,'' Ms.
Newman said. ``If they can go to college, get out and work, have a
solid religious background, I don't feel bad about not having any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Among several families interview, the women said that small
family sized has become such an accepted norm, that hardly anyone
even talks about it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one I've ever spoke with about it was a friend of
mine who has four kids,'' said Ms. McClain, 36, the mother a
9-year-old and a 1-year-old. ``When she was expecting her fourth
child, she said to me that only one person ever really
congratulated her. Usually people's response to the news was, Well,
I'm happy for you, if that's what you want.' It was as if she had
done something inappropriate and not something you should be
jubilant over.''

 &HT;    Weiss's name may be left off lineup more in coming weeks
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Without being specific, shortstop Walt Weiss concedes
his availability this month is going to be erratic. He sat out his
third game in four days Monday, against Chicago, and until his
right quadriceps markedly improves, the club should expect more of
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least a month ago, I accepted the fact my legs weren't
going to be 100 percent the rest of the year,'' he said. ``And now,
it's going to be up to me to make good decisions when I'm out on
the field. I haven't done a good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss was slowed last Tuesday after he scored from first on a
Chipper Jones double in New York. The quad then flared up again
Sunday, when he tripled and then attempted to score from third on a
grounder to shortstop. He plans on taking ``a few days off'' in the
short term and, with every stop of Atlanta's upcoming nine-game
road trip on artificial turf, his starts the rest of the month will
be scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when the quad might heal completely, Weiss said, ``That'll
probably be in January sometime. I just want to be able to get out
there and run well enough that I can compete. We're going to take a
few days here and go on. I think it's just going to take me being
smart, which I don't feel real good about. That doesn't come so
easy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss has started mixing in some plyometrics with his regular
training room treatments to help with flexibility. But Ozzie
Guillen's work load will increase certainly over the next two
weeks. Weiss is already talking about being ready for October.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could go out there and run at 80 percent, that'd be
fine,'' he said. ``It's just when you're trying to run at 60
percent, it's tough to get anything accomplished out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson
</P>
<P>
   Even watching the TV the past few seasons from his home in
Seneca, S.C., Doug Graffanino knew his son Tony needed to change
his stance. The Braves second baseman had simply become unable to
cover down-and-away corner of the strike zone. His average was down
to nearly .200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when I started having back problems, I opened up my
stance to take pressure off my back,'' Graffanino said. ``Then when
I got healthy, I never went back.''
</P>
<P>
   When the father finally came to visit the son to work on his
swing three weeks ago, he was pleased to find Tony had already
repositioned himself in the box, moving closer to the plate, closer
to the pitcher and starting his hands higher. He has since been
taking 200 swings a day with hitting coach Clarence Jones and
conditioning coach Frank Fultz and Graffanino would like to think
his 4-for-4 game on Sunday (with his third homer of the year) was
an indication his work has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders of the Caribbean
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have ventured into Caribbean islands again to sign
Robbie Albertus, a 16-year-old left-handed pitcher from Aruba,
their first prospect from the island nation. Albertus, whose
fastball has been clocked 84-86 mph, chose to sign with Atlanta
over Toronto and Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one that we've highlighted for the last two years
and we've sent seven different people to see him pitch,'' said Paul
Snyder, the Braves' director of scouting and player development.
</P>
<P>
   Condolences
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beauchamp will leave the team after tonight's game to return
to his native Oklahoma for the funeral of his brother, who died
Sunday night of cancer. Beauchamp will rejoin the club for its
weekend series in Pittsburgh.

BOWLER, 17, ALREADY WITH 3 PERFECT GAMES, ON LANE TO STARDOM
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention Arizona editors.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY ANGELA RANDAZZO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jackie Edwards was just 14 when she bowled her
first perfect 300 game _ not bad for someone who had taken up the
sport just two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Now 17, Edwards, a resident of Simi Valley, has added two more
perfect games to her impressive record, along with a first-place
finish at the Junior Olympic Gold Team USA competition held
recently in Reno, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I shot my first one, I never thought I would get it that
soon. I was pretty surprised,'' she recalled of the first 300 game.
``I knew, just getting better, I would do it again. It was just a
question of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The budding bowler is confident, but not cocky.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has earned a total of $12,000 in scholarship money from
tournaments, including a $5,000 scholarship for winning the Reno
tournament last month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Edwards said bowling still is a lot of fun and she has no
immediate desire to turn professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could probably compete with (professionals) now, but I'm not
ready. I'm just not old enough,'' Edwards said. ``Right now, it's
all fun and exciting because every tournament is new and different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a goal to strive for and I enjoy meeting competitors
from all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, along with the top five winners in Reno, will represent
the U.S. in national and international bowling competitions. In
January, she will travel to Colorado to the Team USA bowling
facility for training to improve her game for competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' talent has garnered her more than prestige. She has
accumulated scholarships and is being courted by several colleges
with bowling teams, including Arizona State University.
</P>
<P>
   However, the recent Royal High School graduate plans to attend
California State University, Northridge, in Los Angeles, at least
for her freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay close to home the first year.'' Edwards said.
``I'll consider transferring to join a collegiate team next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, also a member of the Greater L.A. Junior All Stars,
practices at Harley's Simi Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in two or three tournaments every month is just fine
for Edwards because she doesn't much enjoy practice sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I practice here at Harley's whenever I get the chance. I can
bowl five games in an hour, so that's my practice,'' she said. ``I
actually don't like practicing because it's boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Her house average is 218 and she averages 204 on the road. With
21 titles under her belt in the girls league, Edwards recently
joined the open league, which includes boys for stiffer
competition. ``The boys are normally better bowlers. They don't
like it when girls beat them.'' said Edwards, who has won two open
titles.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' parents, Kathy and Doug, are avid bowlers and
introduced their daughter to the sport five years ago. Father,
mother and daughter each have bowled a 300 game _ making them,
according to the Bowlers' Almanac, only the second family trio in
the country to accomplish this feat.
</P>
<P>
   Doug, an attorney with CBS television, acts as her coach. Kathy
helps run the junior league at Harley Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith, a Simi Valley resident who recently turned pro,
has also coached Edwards. Smith, who recently finished fourth in
the AC Delco Classic, is impressed with the young bowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's unbelievable.'' said Smith. ``She is the best girl
junior bowler in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever lofty highs she might reach, Edwards is a young woman
with her fee ton the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you learn the basics, the mental game takes over,'' said
Edwards. ``I'm determined to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Simi Valley is located 35 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles.

FIRM TO MARKET MORNING-AFTER PILLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A small New Jersey company expects to market morning-after pills
in about two months, its chairman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Roderick Mackenzie, chairman of the board of Gynetics Inc. of
Belle Meade, N.J., said in a telephone interview that he would be
the first to market the pills in the United States and that they
would cost about $20 a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The pills, which are ordinary birth control pills taken at a
high dose, can prevent pregnancy if a woman takes them within 72
hours of unprotected intercourse. They work, Mackenzie said, by
preventing ovulation and are about 98 percent effective in
preventing pregnancy. The most common side effects are nausea and
vomiting, which afflict 10 percent to 40 percent of those taking
the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Although medical experts have known for years that high doses of
birth control pills taken after sex can prevent pregnancy, many
doctors and women have been unaware of this method of emergency
contraception.
</P>
<P>
   Mackenzie said he decided to market the pills at the urging of
the Food and Drug Administration. Philip Corfman, who was a medical
officer at the drug agency until he left last December, said that
in keeping with the FDA's tradition of prompting the marketing of
drugs that are needed by Americans, he had taken steps while he was
at the agency to encourage the marketing of a morning-after pill.
</P>
<P>
   Corfman said the FDA had asked several large companies to market
the pills, but they refused. So he spoke to Mackenzie, whom he knew
because Mackenzie had formed a small company, GynoPharma, to bring
a copper intrauterine device to the American market.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie eventually sold GynoPharma to Johnson &AMP; Johnson. That
happened on the last Friday of July 1995, Mackenzie said. ``On
Monday, I started Gynetics,'' to market morning-after pills. He
expects to market a combination of two well-known birth control
pills, ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, both of which are off
patent.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since starting Gynetics, Mackenzie said he had
established a partnership with a manufacturer of the pills,
formulated the pills into tablets, and conducted clinical studies
with them.

GARCIAPARRA IN THE SWING AT NO. 3 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Garciaparra hitting stats text table.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ He has handled the switch so smoothly that there has
hardly been a ripple of controversy. As a rookie last year, Nomar
Garciaparra was simply sensational as the Red Sox' leadoff man. A
year later, he is performing even better in the No. 3 slot, where
he figures to remain for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his relative inexperience, Garciaparra continues to
shine in his new spot, which he inherited in late May. Garciaparra
led off in 32 of his 33 starts (.301, 43 for 143) to start the
season. Since the switch (helped by the emergence of Darren Lewis
at the top of the order), Garciaparra has batted .332 (64 for 193)
in 45 of the last 46 games. In the other two games, he batted
second and cleanup once, going 1 for 4 in each appearence.
Truthfully, it doesn't matter where he hits in the order.
</P>
<P>
   The early season shift from leadoff to third followed a 14-day
absence because of a strained right shoulder, which might have been
one of the contributing factors that caused him to be passed over
for the 1998 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   His production out of the third hole suggests he will hit there
in 1999 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never played major league baseball until last year,''
reminds hitting instructor Jim Rice. ``So when he arrived last
year, we didn't know what he could do. It just turned out the spot
in which he would be more valuable to us was leadoff. This year,
it's different. With his kind of power, you suddenly have a man who
comes up with somebody on base. Instead of one run on a home run,
you've got a chance to get at least two.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Garciaparra emerged as a terrific all-around hitter,
batting .306 with 30 home runs and 98 RBIs. With his arm and range,
Garciaparra was not your typical rookie shortstop. His
aggressiveness on offense and defense reminded people of players
from another era.
</P>
<P>
   Boston already had Mo Vaughn, Reggie Jefferson, Mike Stanley,
and Troy O'Leary to fill the middle power slots. Garciaparra led
off in 152 of 153 starts, and it proved to be a surprisingly good
fit.
</P>
<P>
   But as 1998 began, the Sox realized they needed to utilize
Garciaparra's power, as well as his ability to get on base. He had
44 doubles and a league-high 11 triples. He had 68 multiple-hit
games, only four fewer than Wade Boggs hit in 1985, when he had 653
at-bats in 161 games. (Boggs batted .368 that year with a
career-high 240 hits.) Garciaparra walked only 35 times in 1997, as
compared with Boggs, who in four seasons had more than 100 walks,
125 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   And Garciaparra showed he could hit to all fields. For a leadoff
man, that's a nice trait. As the No. 3 hitter with power, it's like
finding a pot of gold in the middle of a baseball diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a good hitter,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``He
makes some hard outs. But he keeps being aggressive up there. Like
I say all the time, I think he's been here before, but I don't know
when. He's a baseball player. He's shown that he can adapt to any
position in the lineup in which you choose to hit him. He's a
productive hitter, so we try and put him in a spot where he can
help the team drive in runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taking a few more walks this year (18). But when he goes
into that batter's box, he goes in there to hit. He knows where the
barrel of the bat is. I call him a viper. He's quick.''
</P>
<P>
   The fiddle and diddle he does between every pitch still drives
umpires crazy. Same for the media which has learned to put up with
his meticulous attention to pregame and postgame detail before an
interview. A rare day goes by without Garciaparra taking 100 ground
balls. His life is a 24-hour day of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't changed me,'' said Garciaparra of the switch. ``I
haven't changed my approach. I've got to go out there in any
situation that comes along and do what I got to do. Wherever the
manager puts me, I'm going to do my best to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always try to get better. There is a lot of listening and a
lot to learn in this game. I hope I'm improving every day. I'd like
to take away something from each game. As far as my place in
history, I don't think about who batted No. 3 before me. I just go
out and do the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra fully understands his role. He is hitting third,
partially because he provide protection for Mo Vaughn; partially
because the Red Sox envision a day when he will be the club's big
bopper. Ted Williams batted No. 3, as did Carl Yastrzemski, Rice,
and Vaughn ... even Boggs. It is a sign of ultimate respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a kid who can bat in spots 1 through 5, you
really have something,'' said Rice. ``I don't think you should put
him below 5. You want him to come up as much as possible. A lot of
people say that it really doesn't matter where you bat someone. But
over the course of a season, it does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been other guys who came in that way. Rickey
Henderson comes to mind. But if you have an organization that is
all set, as we did last year, and you have a guy coming in who has
speed, steals bases, and can hit a lot of doubles, you realize that
he can also be a leadoff man.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra and Rice talk every day. Sometimes after every
at-bat. There is a similarity in that Garciaparra is a line-drive
hitter, much like Rice, who hits for average and power. It is only
a matter of time before he proves himself one of the best Red Sox
hitters of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``His strength is that he knows himself,'' said Rice. ``A lot of
times he overswings. Other times he tries to do too much with a
certain pitch. But at the very next at-bat, he has the ability to
regroup. We talk, and he knows that he doesn't have to swing as
hard. He knows he has to be a little more patient. He knows he has
to make contract and swing through the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may remind people of the way I hit. But he's more
consistent in hitting the ball on the bat. He doesn't make any
cheap outs. This guy hits the ball hard all the time. And what
makes him unique is that he can hit the ball in any direction.
Teams can't pitch him a certain way.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra doesn't put any added emphasis on the home runs and
RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I always felt I had a lot of people on base,'' he
said. ``And I did set the record for RBI's as a leadoff hitter.
That just says there were a lot of people on base for me. Today, I
figure it's the same thing. There are men on base, and it's my job
to drive them in. If nobody is on, I have to try to get on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got to work and work hard to prepare myself for
each game. Again, wherever Jimy wants to put me, I'm going to go
out and do the best job that I can. I have just one goal ... win
the World Series.''

PATIENT RIGHTS DEBATE ENGENDERS UNLIKELIEST OF ALLIANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The struggle over patients' rights legislation has
scrambled old alliances and created some extraordinary new ones. It
is throwing together doctors, trial lawyers and consumers, and
pitting them against insurers and managed care companies, who in
many cases are fighting each other over how much regulation they
can take.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is business as usual. ``When the issues are big,
and big interests are involved, you tend to form coalitions and run
op-ed pieces,'' said Dr. J. Robert Graham, executive vice president
of the American Academy of Family Physicians, which is alone among
leading doctors' groups in remaining unattached.
</P>
<P>
   But in this debate, the union of natural adversaries is novel in
the extreme. ``The whole thing is a little bizarre,'' said Gail
Wilensky, a senior fellow at Project Hope's Center for Health
Affairs who was a senior official in the Department of Health and
Human Services in the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core fight is the managed care companies and insurance
companies on one hand and consumer activist and physician
organizations on the other,'' Ms. Wilensky said. ``Physicians are
ticked off at being pushed around,'' she explained, and consumers
are angry both at being pushed around and at having little recourse
when they are denied care.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very different arena from the one four years ago in
which the Republican Congress scuttled President Clinton's proposal
to provide health care for everyone. The divisions then were clear
and the positions predictable. Most businesses fought the plan,
most consumer groups supported it and the American Medical
Association, unsure of what it meant for its members' fees and
prerogatives, sat on the fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about dismantling the entire system and having
nationalized health care,'' said Dan Danner, head lobbyist for the
National Federation of Independent Business and chairman of the
Health Benefits Coalition. That put all businesses in the same
boat, he said. No one needed to build coalitions to battle an ogre
that business called ``socialized medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   But with no one even flirting with notions of universal care
anymore, the debate has shifted to one about consumer access to
doctors and reliable care. That issue more readily crosses lobbyist
and party lines, more so even than an old perennial like Social
Security. It is a hard one for businesses to gang up against.
</P>
<P>
   So every bill that Congress is considering, Democrat and
Republican, grants consumers at least some protection from HMO
practices that restrict care, like access to emergency rooms
without an HMO's approval and information about all forms of
treatment for an illness, including those an HMO deems too costly.
</P>
<P>
   The last time around, businesses found a message to rally voters
who might otherwise have gone along with universal care. The
message was choice, the patient's right to choose his own doctor.
``Choice,'' however, does not sell anymore. Among other things, it
has lost its punch to semantic devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Coalition for Patient Choice, for example, is
financed largely by the Golden Rule Insurance Co. of Indianapolis.
Golden Rule wants legislation to let more consumers choose its
medical savings accounts, which give them a tax break to buy health
insurance. More important, consumers and physicians complain that
four years' experience with unfettered HMOs has meant less choice
of care, not more.
</P>
<P>
   Thus without a credible battle cry, opponents of patient-care
legislation have left themselves open to consumer advocates'
classic strategy for beating back better-financed business lobbies.
``It's divide and conquer,'' said Drew Altman, president of the
Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care philanthropy. ``It's a
time-honored strategy, and that is what is happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more improbable alliances behind the debate, the
American Medical Association is joined with the American Trial
Lawyers Association, which dines on suing the shirts off doctors.
</P>
<P>
   It is just as improbable to see both the doctors and the trial
lawyers allied with chiropractors, midwives, the AFL-CIO and
liberal consumer groups like Families USA. Yet all are bound by the
National Partnership for Women and Families in an ad-hoc lobby that
claims 170 member organizations called, simply, ``the Coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   But coalitions also fragment and splinter as readily as they
form. In the Health Benefits Coalition, companies with 50,000 and
100,000 employees are allied with mom-and-pop shops with 5 or 10
workers, but on other provisions of health care bills in Congress,
they are sniping at each other under the letterheads of other
coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Some HMOs, mostly the nonprofit companies, are subtly distancing
themselves from their brethren that are mostly for-profit and
investor-owned. ``We have some philosophical differences about
whether government should enforce rules of behavior,'' said George
Halvorsen, president of Health Partners, a nonprofit health plan
based in Minneapolis, and chairman-elect of the American
Association of Health Plans.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the biggest health insurance companies and HMO operators,
Aetna and Cigna, have quit their industry's lobbies, the Health
Insurance Association of America and the American Association of
Health Plans. ``They're the non-taxpaying group,'' Mike Monroe, a
Cigna spokesman, said of companies like Health Partners.
</P>
<P>
   The scrambling among special interests illustrates differing
views of the appropriate balance of reliable care and reasonable
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups, doctors and everyone else in the business of
providing care support comprehensive and accessible care for
patients. Employers, insurers and HMOs want to hold the line lest
the cost imperil their profits. All agree that some restraint is
essential. They disagree over how much.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of this spectrum are some of the HMOs. ``We, as
managed care plans, are interested in maintaining care without
increasing costs substantially,'' said Phil Nudelman, chairman of
Kaiser/Group Health in Seattle and chairman of the American
Association of Health Plans. ``We're not saying, `let's not discuss
it.' Let's look at the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at the pro-consumer end of this spectrum is Ronald
Pollack, executive director of Families USA, who supports the
leading Democratic patient protection proposal of Sen. Edward
Kennedy of Massachusetts and Rep. John Dingell of Michigan but who
considers it little more than a fig leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've really got to underscore that the Patients Bill
of Rights is only a tiny element of any meaningful health reform
agenda,'' Pollack said. ``You've got to deal with all the people
who are uninsured, and this doesn't touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   And at the frugal, cost-wary end stands the Health Insurance
Association of America. ``We believe that consumers would be best
served if none of these proposals are signed into law, including
the proposal introduced today by Senate Republicans,'' Charles Kahn
III, the insurance group's chief operating officer, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The association's president, Bill Gradison, explains, ``We're a
middle man. We pass the costs along to our customers if we're going
to stay in business. Critics say, `you can just absorb them.' Well,
that's not how markets work.''
</P>
<P>
   So insurers and many HMOs, most of which have been losing money
in holding down premiums to win subscribers, want to show consumers
that the cost of care is an issue for them, too, and in that way
persuade them to resist the consumer lobbies' proposals.

ADVERTISING: MEDIA WAIT ANXIOUSLY AS GM CUTS SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mich.)   (See also GM-STRIKE)  
(lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The media are nervously assessing how much they may suffer as a
result of the labor problems now hampering operations at General
Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do except cry a little bit?'' Brian McMahon,
senior vice president and group publisher at Car and Driver and
Road &AMP; Track magazines in Los Angeles, asked rhetorically. ``We
just hope it ends quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``GM is our largest single corporate advertiser and has been for
a number of years,'' he added. ``You just hope you can make it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   General Motors is the United States' largest advertiser as well
as the largest automaker, having spent $2.2 billion last year on
sales pitches for cars, trucks and minivans, according to figures
compiled by the Competitive Media Reporting unit of VNU NV. That
represented a 30.1 percent increase from the $1.7 billion that GM
spent on advertising in 1996 and helped make 1997 a record year for
U.S. ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   But strikes at two parts plants by the United Auto Workers union
have forced GM to halt nearly all production in North America. The
losses GM is sustaining as a result _ more than $75 million a day _
led the company to significantly curtail ad spending across the
board during June and July to save money.
</P>
<P>
   Now those cuts have been extended through August, a top GM
executive said Monday, though they would be offset partly by a
television campaign that may start as soon as Thursday. The
commercials will remind consumers that despite the labor unrest,
many vehicles remain unsold on dealer lots.
</P>
<P>
   The substantial reduction in ad spending ``is unfortunate, but
it has become necessary because we are in a cash conservation
mode,'' said Philip Guarascio, vice president and general manager
for marketing and advertising at the North American operations of
General Motors in Warren, Mich. He confirmed a report about the
extension of the cutbacks that appeared in the trade publication
Advertising Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurts is that we had such terrific momentum going in the
spring, particularly in June,'' Guarascio said, referring to
vehicle sales that had been stimulated by incentives. ``The biggest
issue is that this has stalled us in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   GM is making ad-spending decisions ``on a month-by-month
basis,'' he added, ``to give the media as much lead time as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't gone dark,'' he added, because ``there is some
limited model advertising'' for vehicles like the Pontiac Grand Am
and Cadillac Catera, ``and we plan to support the launches of big
new vehicles like the Silverado and Alero.'' Still, the GM
budget-slashing has affected virtually all media, many of which
depend on the automaker for large portions of their total annual ad
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a very frustrating situation for everyone,'' said
David Long, president for media sales and marketing at the Time
Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as we head into the fall,'' when advertisers traditionally
spend the largest portions of their annual budgets, he added,
``it's whoo boy!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit by the phone every day and wait,'' Long said of his
largest advertiser. ``We're a big enough company that we can
weather this, but not happily.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has ranked first among all advertisers in magazines, network
television and the yellow pages, according to Competitive Media
Reporting, as well as first among national advertisers in
newspapers. The company ranks second in national spot radio, cable
television and spot television, again according to Competitive
Media Reporting data.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM has cut spot TV back considerably across the country, which
impacts the economy of the television business,'' said Ave
Butensky, president of the Television Bureau of Advertising in New
York, which represents close to 500 local stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, GM usually has a large inventory of unsold cars
at this time of the year,'' he added, ``so the company would
continue advertising'' even though the model year was winding down.
</P>
<P>
   Guarascio said the media ``have been super-cooperative'' as GM
turned back commercial time that had been bought on television,
moved out of space that had been ordered in monthly magazines and
deferred buying pages in weeklies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contracts ask them to provide their best efforts to help
when we need it,'' he added, referring to clauses related to
strikes and other business difficulties, ``and they have. We
understand the sacrifices being made and once this gets settled _
and it will _ we will take that into account as the money comes
back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, the media anxiously await
developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM is one very important client and obviously we're keeping an
eye on the situation,'' said Harold Shain, president of Newsweek
magazine in New York, a unit of Washington Post Co. ``We'll do what
we can to help them ride it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek carried almost 104 ad pages from GM in the first six
months of 1998 _ more than any other magazine, according to the
Publishers Information Bureau and Competitive Media Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other categories have been up significantly,'' Shain said,
``such as finance, technology and business, which have helped make
up somewhat for pages in the automotive category being down.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications,
which owns magazines like Details, GQ, Glamour, Mademoiselle,
Vanity Fair and Vogue, ``the fickle finger of fate has certainly
fallen on us,'' said Peggy Daitch, vice president for corporate
sales and marketing, Detroit, who is based in Troy, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM executed the strike clause, canceling business in September
and October issues,'' she added. ``A number of our September issues
were already on press or printed, but we canceled out whatever we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the divisions are talking about rescheduling ads for
later months, depending on the strike ending,'' Ms. Daitch said,
adding with a chuckle, ``But we may run out of months.'' Her
meaning: Those pages may arrive too late for 1998 and not be
tallied until 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At Hachette Filipacchi, the unit of Lagardere Group that owns
Car and Driver and Road &AMP; Track, ``there have been some
cancellations, beginning with October issues,'' McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not unexpected,'' he added. ``When you have no days'
supply of a vehicle, why advertise it?''
</P>
<P>
   But GM dealers have many days' supply of many vehicles _ more
than 600,000, according to The Detroit News, which reported Monday
that GM was developing a campaign to promote sales of already-built
cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Press reports have been somewhat misleading'' about supplies,
Guarascio said. ``We have a lot of inventory in a lot of places for
a lot of brands, especially on the East and West coasts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're going to launch television advertising, possibly on
the 23rd, to tell consumers we have plenty of cars and trucks,'' he
added. ``It won't look like a local retail ad for a furniture
store; the tonality will be upbeat and positive, not like a fire
sale.''
</P>
<P>
   Guarascio read from a proposed storyboard for a commercial,
footage for which was shot over the weekend on dealer lots from
coast to coast. The campaign will ``run a couple of weeks,'' he
said, ``primarily as a traffic-building effort''; the theme will
most likely be ``Lots of cars, lots of trucks, lots of deals.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will be created by McCann-Erickson Detroit in Troy,
Mich., Guarascio said, which is the agency for GM's Buick division.
McCann is a division of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, part
of the McCann-Erickson World Group of Interpublic Group of Cos.

FINANCIAL POST TO BECOME PART OF NEW CANADIAN DAILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Ill.)  (ART ADV: Graphic of Canadian newspaper circulation figures is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)

 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ After stirring up the Canadian newspaper market with
his plans for a new national daily, Conrad Black, the owner of
newspapers from Vancouver to Jerusalem, shook things up even more
on Monday with the announcement that he was buying The Financial
Post and would use the Toronto-based paper as the financial section
of his new project.
</P>
<P>
   The Post will give Black an immediate national distribution
network, an experienced business staff and a circulation base of
about 100,000 across Canada for his new newspaper, which is
scheduled to make its debut in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Just the announcement in April of Black's plan to start a new
newspaper has set off competitive preening among publishers in a
market often described as complacent. The Toronto Star, Canada's
largest daily, with a weekday circulation of 461,000, has recently
strengthened its editing and reporting staffs with new hires and
competitive raids. Earlier this month, The Globe and Mail, with
308,000 daily circulation, revamped its layout and type style and
used color for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Parkinson, publisher of The Globe and Mail, said the
revamping had been going on since 1995 and was in anticipation of
eventual competition. ``We've kept our eye on this for years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts had expected Black _ known for buying, not
starting, newspapers _ to use an existing publication to start his
new daily. The Financial Post seemed the most likely target because
analysts believed its owners were least able to compete with the
new newspaper and would rather sell if the price was right.
</P>
<P>
   Black already owned 19.9 percent of The Post when its owners,
Sun Media Corp., rejected his offer to buy a controlling interest
last year. He then sold his holdings in The Post, but obviously did
not lose interest in acquiring yet another newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Black's Hollinger International and its subsidiaries control 117
daily newspapers around the world including The Chicago Sun-Times,
The Daily Telegraph of London and more than half of Canada's 105
daily newspapers, according to company records.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Godfrey, president of Sun Media, said he changed his mind
about selling The Post when Black put four local newspapers on the
table as part of a deal. That made it ``sweet enough for us to
continue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the swap-purchase transaction announced Monday, Southam Inc.,
a Hollinger subsidiary, takes control of Sun Media's 80 percent
stake in The Post. The remaining 20 percent will continue to be
held by Pearson PLC of London, the publisher of The Financial
Times.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sun Media gets four Southam dailies in Southern Ontario for
about $100 million : The Hamilton Spectator, The Kitchener-Waterloo
Record, The Cambridge Reporter and The Guelph Mercury. They have a
combined daily circulation of approximately 200,000.
</P>
<P>
   There is some confusion, or disagreement, about The Post's
future. Bill Neill, it's publisher, told reporters that the
five-day-a-week financial tabloid newspaper would not necessarily
be melded into Black's new national daily but could continue to be
published in its present form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a colossal waste of money to buy The Financial
Post and not continue to publish it under the masthead of The
Financial Post,'' Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Whyte, editor of Black's new daily, said, ``We are
going to be publishing The Financial Post as our business
section.''
</P>
<P>
   The name The Financial Post will be retained, but the format
will be different. ``Our intention is to re-establish The Post as a
broadsheet'' that will be incorporated into the new paper, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still starting a national newspaper from scratch,''
Whyte added. ``But building a business section has suddenly become
quite a lot easier.'' &QL;

SUNTRUST BANKS TO ACQUIRE CRESTAR FINANCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 ATTN: Ga., Va.)  (mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its first significant transaction in a dozen years, Suntrust
Banks Inc. said Monday that it had agreed to acquire Crestar
Financial Corp. for $9.5 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is subject to the approval of Crestar
shareholders and federal regulators, will create the nation's
10th-largest bank holding company, with assets of $87.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   From its headquarters in Atlanta, Suntrust oversees operations
in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama. Over the last few
years, it has remained on the sidelines as large regional bank
competitors like First Union Corp. and Nationsbank have greatly
expanded their size and scope through highly publicized, highly
priced mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The institution created by the deal announced Monday will not
rival either of those banks, both based in North Carolina. Indeed,
for the time being Suntrust has chosen to leap-frog both North and
South Carolina, where banking is dominated by First Union,
Nationsbank and Wachovia Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Crestar, based in Richmond, Va., will provide Suntrust with a
solid presence in Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia,
fast-growing markets that Suntrust's competitors have been tilling
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, analysts said, is the clear message the
transaction sends to Suntrust competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This signals that, longer-term, Suntrust wants to be a buyer
and a player, to dictate its own destiny, as opposed to being
merged into someone else,'' said Keith Stock, a consultant who
specializes in financial services with A.T. Kearney, an
international management consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, disappointment on Wall Street that Suntrust is no longer
to be a takeover candidate may have played a role in the sharp drop
in its share price after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Suntrust stock closed at $79,
down $8.4375, or about 10 percent. Crestar's stock, meanwhile,
jumped $9.3125, or 15 percent, and closed at $73.3125.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the transaction, Crestar shareholders will
receive 0.96 of a Suntrust share for each of their shares.
</P>
<P>
   The terms are based on the closing price on Friday of Suntrust's
shares. But L. Phillip Humann, who became Suntrust's chairman,
president and chief executive earlier this year, said the sharp
drop in the stock price Monday would have no bearing on the
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Humann acknowledged that problems in the late 1980s with First
Tennessee Corp., a bank that Suntrust had bought in 1986, may have
made the bank wary of other deals for several years. He added that
over the last six months the bank's attitude has undergone a marked
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Tennessee deal was the right deal with the right
company in the right state at exactly the wrong time,'' he said.
``Tennessee went into a very deep recession, and the economics
became unattractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Suntrust has made a number of smaller acquisitions
and has kept investors happy through stock buybacks and with the
help of a sharp increase in the market value of its 48 million
shares of Coca-Cola Co., a stake that is now worth more than $4.2
billion.

<P>
   Still, the banking deals that have shaken the financial services
landscape over the last year did not go unnoticed in Atlanta,
Humann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As it became clearer that Suntrust would be competing against
not just $200 billion banks but against several banks with assets
of $600 billion, we did take another look at where we ought to
be,'' he said. ``That did not drive us toward this transaction, but
our thinking has changed over the last six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Crestar, which until 1987 was known as United Virginia Banks,
will continue to operate under its own name. Richard Tilghman,
chairman and chief executive of Crestar, will continue in those
roles and will become vice chairman of the Suntrust board.
</P>
<P>
   Although the deal is expected to produce reductions of more than
$130 million in annual expenses, both banks said they did not
expect it to lead to significant staff cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger is not being driven by cost-saving
considerations,'' Tilghman said, ``but rather by two well-run
organizations that exist in an attractive market from Maryland to
Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co. was Crestar's financial adviser, and Lehman
Brothers advised Suntrust.

STATES TO DISCUSS DIVISION OF ANY TOBACCO DOLLARS

<P>
   As state attorneys general prepare to resume settlement talks
next week with tobacco companies, they plan to meet on Tuesday in
Chicago to discuss how to divide tens of billions of dollars in
possible settlement money.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, negotiators for the tobacco industry and a small
group of states began talks intended to resolve the 37 remaining
lawsuits filed by states to recover Medicaid money spent on
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But despite a recent round of meetings intended to develop a
unified negotiating front, state officials remain divided over the
terms they will accept in renewed talks or whether they will even
participate in them, lawyers and regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest talks, the industry offered to pay about $196
billion to resolve the remaining state lawsuits, officials familiar
with the terms said. Companies also agreed to a public health
provisions like the removal of all outdoor tobacco advertising and
the funding of a national foundation that would work on stopping
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies are seeking to resolve the state cases because
they view them as the most potentially damaging lawsuits against
them both in regulatory and financial terms. Over the past year,
producers have paid $36 billion to settle lawsuits by Florida,
Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas.

LAWYERS SEEK MILLIONS IN ITALIAN SKI-LIFT DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (shorted) 
(js) 
 By MATT WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American lawyers representing seven of the 20
people killed when a Marine warplane severed a ski-lift cable near
Aviano, Italy, in February are seeking to collect millions of
dollars directly from the United States government.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1951 NATO treaty, relatives are supposed to sue for
compensation through the Italian court system, which will determine
culpability and damages. Once a verdict is reached, three-quarters
of the damages would be paid by the United States government and
one-quarter by Italy. But the lawyers are asking that the case be
heard in U.S. courts because they fear it could take up to 10 years
to be heard in Italy. They also said they believed the compensation
would be more generous in the United States. The lawyers are
seeking several million dollars for each of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were victimized by a U.S. airplane and we as a
country need to take responsibility,'' said John Eaves Jr.,
representing a mother and son from Katowice, Poland. Eaves
delivered a plea to the White House, Congress and the Departments
of State and Defense on Monday, to be allowed to sue in a U.S.
District Court. He pointed out that the House, at the request of
the White House, had approved $20 million to pay for damage to the
ski lift.

FPA MEDICAL FILES FOR CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., N.C., Texas, Ariz., Ga.)  (lb) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FPA Medical Management, a troubled company that bought the
businesses of thousands of doctors, filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws Sunday, eliminating the value of
stock it had used in paying physicians. FPA was the most disastrous
case of a big health-care company that grew so fast it lost track
of costs and could not pay doctors for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts said the filing signaled the end of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   FPA shares had already plummeted from $40 last fall to a low of
a few cents following earlier disclosures of losses that analysts
attributed to risky contracts with managed-care companies and heavy
debt assumed from FPA's two dozen acquisitions in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have reacted to the FPA troubles by dragging down
share prices of two other big physician-practice management
companies, Medpartners and Phycor Inc. Analysts said Phycor was the
strongest financially of the three.
</P>
<P>
   FPA closed Monday at 18.75 cents, down 53.125 cents in Nasdaq
trading. Medpartners was unchanged at $6.375 on the New York Stock
Exchange. Phycor declined 18.75 cents, to $15.75, in Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors expected companies like FPA to strengthen their hand in
negotiating payments with HMOs and to lighten their costs by taking
over dealings with the insurance companies and providing
centralized information systems.
</P>
<P>
   In four years as a publicly traded company, FPA reached a peak
of 7,900 doctors with 1.4 million patients, including groups in New
York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Dresnick, chairman and chief executive, said the New
York and New Jersey groups would continue with FPA and there would
be no disruption of patient care. Analysts said there had been 470
primary-care doctors in New York, including contracts that FPA
bought from Oxford Health Plans of New York and Wellpoint Health
Network of California, and 900 primary-care physicians in New
Jersey. They included 115,000 patients in New York and 55,800
patients in New Jersey
</P>
<P>
   Dresnick said that FPA was still analyzing the numbers but that
it appeared about half the 1.4 million patients would remain after
the previously announced closing of 50 operations and withdrawal
from Nevada and parts of five other states: North Carolina, Texas,
Arizona, Georgia and California.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one banks, headed by BankBoston Corp., one of FPA's
biggest creditors, agreed to inject up to $50 million to keep the
company afloat and make overdue payments to doctors, nurses and
hospital emergency rooms.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing, which had been expected, was reported
Monday in The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The company's biggest customer, Pacificare Health Systems,
withdrew contracts covering 200,000 patients this month and
arranged to pay those doctors directly or through other groups. FPA
had complained that the Pacificare contracts did not cover doctors'
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew FPA had problems,'' said Dr. Linda Lake, chief medical
officer of Pacificare, a California-based HMO with 4 million
members. She said Pacificare was ``looking at provider solvency in
all of our markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lake said it was uncertain whether physician-management
companies could satisfy the expectations of doctors while pushing
for 20 percent growth, or more, to keep Wall Street happy. Geoffrey
Harris, a health-care analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said, ``FPA
may be an extreme example, but its difficulties are representative
of problems that all the physician-practice management companies
are having.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is the physician reaction, can they keep
them,'' he added. ``Without physicians, there is no
physician-practice management company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Weakley, a health-care analyst at Merrill Lynch, said
the industry would survive because ``there is still a need for
professional management in the doctor industry _ hundreds of
thousands of doctors who for the most part practice alone.''
</P>
<P>
   FPA said in the Chapter 11 filing that it had total assets of
$46.3 million and liabilities of $345.5 million. Under the filing,
which requires approval by the Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,
Del., FPA would issue 40 million new shares of common stock.
Secured creditors would get 20 million shares. Unsecured creditors
would get warrants for 3 percent of the total and managers would
have options to acquire 8 percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Phycor and Medpartners, which had also been growing rapidly,
called off an announced merger last winter. Medpartners has since
gone from operating losses at the end of 1997 to a modest
first-quarter profit this year.

 &HT;    Age and aches are slowing Johnson
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Of course it's been hard. Comedowns are always
painful. This is a guy who floated out of Atlanta two summers ago
on his own magic carpet ride, a couple of gold medals and an
eye-popping world record to his name.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Michael Johnson is just another guy earning a buck on the
track.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter that Nike sweetened his contract after
Atlanta. Or that he's popping up these days on TV in Mountain Dew
commercials. Or that a handful of other endorsements push his
yearly take to about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   None of those benefits will help him to run fast anymore. And he
has been humanized by what eventually catches up to everyone,
athlete or not _ age. Staring down at his 31st birthday in
September, Johnson has spent much of the last two years in the
trainer's room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very difficult to deal with emotionally,'' Johnson
said. ``I'm not a day-to-day guy. I know three weeks down the road
what I'm going to do in training. That's why I'm successful,
because I plan it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Just back from the injury list, Johnson will be tickled to win
the 400 meters tonight. Forget any run at the world record. And he
scratched from the 200 meters, his signature event in which he ran
a record 19.32 seconds in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Words like has-been and slump are being tossed about with his
name.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes beyond Atlanta,'' Johnson said of the expectations.
''If you look at my record since '90, I've only lost two 400s. I
understand people expect a lot out of me. It's just difficult
because people think it's easy. You can't go into races expecting
to do something spectacular every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) we're only as good as our last race. So you've got to
keep winning.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, he has been a physical wreck since the
Olympics. He badly strained a quadricep muscle in the ugly match
race with Donovan Bailey in the spring of 1997. Rest was thought to
be the cure, but the injury bug struck early this season and
Johnson hasn't broken 20 seconds in the 200 since 1996 or 44
seconds in the 400 in 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, after his latest spell on the sidelines, he
labored to finish third in the 400 in 44.58 _ only his second
defeat this decade. He rebounded with a victory in 44.40 last week
and now finds himself a slight favorite here.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson can't point a finger on the cause of his injury woes,
only that he feels fine now. But his longtime coach, Clyde Hart,
suspects they're related to recurring problems with imbalance with
his hips _ which, he said, first needed ''an adjustment'' between
the Olympic 200 semifinal and final.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said it can be traced back to the years of wear and tear,
of the tremendous torque Johnson places on his body running
full-blast around the curves in the 200 and 400. When Johnson won
the 400 at the World Championships last summer, Hart said, a study
of videotapes showed his left leg was swinging out, he had no
control of that leg. He had about one-third less strength in the
left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like running with a flat tire,'' Hart said.

By BOB RAY SANDERS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you looked it up in your Funk &AMP; Wagnalls, as I did last week,
you would be told that gospel music emerged about 1870 and that it
first had a ``predominantly white style,'' whatever that means.
</P>
<P>
   You would also be informed that its roots were in ``Sunday
school hymns'' and ``camp meeting spirituals.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always risky trying to put a birth date on an art form. But
if you've ever heard a song sung by Mahalia Jackson, Roberta
Martin, ``Sister'' Rosetta Tharpe or Clara Ward _ four women whose
images now grace newly released 32-cent American stamps _ you would
know that gospel is a descendant of sounds that were born much
earlier than the 19th century, and that its roots not only go much
deeper than Sunday ``school,'' but perhaps deeper than Sunday
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most assuredly, gospel is music whose roots are anchored in the
heart of humanity's motherland _ Africa _ reaching past countless
generations and encompassing centuries long gone.
</P>
<P>
   It is music conceived in hope and jubilation, born into trial
and tribulation, reared among despair and discrimination and truly
blossoming in the days of struggle and determination.
</P>
<P>
   Gospel is not music that just aims for the heart; it heads
straight for the soul. When sung and played just right, the music
has a way of conjuring up memories and dreams that can bring
happiness and sadness at the same time _ both producing
uncontrollable tears.
</P>
<P>
   In its true American form, becoming popular in the 1930s, '40s
and '50s, it has been infused with spirituals, folk, blues,
hillbilly, country and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Funk &AMP; Wagnalls is right when it says, ``Although the black and
white varieties of gospel music have remained distinctive,
repertoire has been shared, and they have freely influenced each
other stylistically.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dorsey, often referred to as the father of modern-day
(black) gospel, wrote more than 400 inspirational songs, including
``Precious Lord, Take My Hand.''
</P>
<P>
   A standard in black churches, ``Precious Lord'' was one of
Martin Luther King Jr.'s favorites, and just moments before he was
assassinated in 1968 in Memphis, he had requested that the song be
played at a rally he was scheduled to attend that night. The great
Mahalia Jackson would sing it for him at the memorial service the
day King was buried.
</P>
<P>
   When Dorsey first started touring with his new style of church
music, many Baptist and Methodist churches around the country
wouldn't allow it to be played or sung in their sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   But the more it was heard, the more popular it became, producing
great talents who would be recognized around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was gospel's first superstar. The recording of her
rendition of ``How I Got Over'' (1947), which was written by Clara
Ward, sold more than a million copies.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Ward and Jackson were featured regularly on
popular television shows like ``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' and the
Ward Singers were a top act in Las Vegas. (Jackson, although
offered nightclub contracts in New York and Las Vegas, always
refused to sing where liquor was sold.)
</P>
<P>
   Just as it was influenced by other styles of music, gospel _
with its great rhythms, stirring lyrics and soul-wrenching melodies
_ has had a great effect on other popular music, producing some of
the greatest stars in rhythm 'n' blues, soul, pop and jazz.
</P>
<P>
   People like Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Whitney
Houston all had their start in gospel, owing part of their success
to pioneers like the four women who now have their faces on postage
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gospel,'' of course, means ``good news,'' and it was good news
indeed that the U.S. Postal Service, as part of its ``Legends of
American Music'' series, in New Orleans unveiled the stamps
featuring gospel greats Jackson, Ward, Martin and Tharpe.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service issued 45 million of the stamps.

<P>
   EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. _ The Casino Queen riverboat arrived here
five years ago, docking along the grimy river front of what was
then the epitome of a dying American city.
</P>
<P>
   Raw sewage backed up into the streets. Piles of trash shared the
landscape with vacant and burned-out buildings. Murders were
rampant, yet there was not enough money to buy gas for police cars.
The city's debt was so high that when a man who was physically
abused while in jail sued the city in 1990 and won, he was awarded
the deed to the defendant's only asset of value: the building that
housed City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove into town at night and missed the exit off the highway
because there were no lights on downtown,'' recalled Cheryl
Childress, who after leaving East St. Louis 30 years earlier
returned to her hometown in 1993 to become the casino's human
resources director.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the casino changed much of that. While many
regions have turned to casinos to invigorate languid economies,
perhaps no other city in the nation has become so quickly reliant
on casino revenue _ and avoided imminent extinction _ simply by
opening a place where people could gamble legally.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, the Casino Queen, now second only to
the local hospital as the largest employer in East St. Louis, has
brought 1,200 new jobs to this predominately black city of 42,000
people just across the Mississippi River from St. Louis. Today,
nearly 50 percent of the city's operating budget comes from tax
revenue generated by the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my city, it's the lifeblood,'' Mayor Gordon W. Bush said
of the four-story, side-wheeler gambling boat that cruises in the
shadow of the famed Gateway Arch in St. Louis. ``If I take away a
month of revenue from the casino, I start missing paydays for city
workers. We fall on our backs without that money.''
</P>
<P>
   As casino gambling has spread across the country, the verdict on
whether it ultimately hurts or helps communities is still out. A
presidential commission is expected to report next June on the
effect that the proliferation of casinos and other forms of
gambling have had on the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The economic advantages of casino gambling are profoundly
evident in places like the Gulfport region of Mississippi, where 62
percent of the 18,000 new jobs created since 1990 were at casinos,
as well as in Joliet, Ill., where two riverboat casinos pay the
third and fourth largest amount of property tax in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But in East St. Louis, the impact of casino gambling has been
dramatic. Once a strutting blue-collar town of stockyards,
meat-packing plants, railroads and after-hour nightclubs, the city
began to decline when its industries stumbled in the 1960s. Its
population _ 82,000 in 1960 _ dwindled as many white residents
moved out. So precipitous was the decline that by the time the
state approved a license for the Casino Queen to open in 1993, few
residents opposed bringing legalized gambling to their community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the ministers who don't like gambling have not been
openly negative about it,'' said Bush, a burly, 55-year-old retired
Army lieutenant colonel who has already announced plans to seek a
third term next year.
</P>
<P>
   East St. Louis is still one of the poorest cities in the United
States, however, and not everyone here is so sanguine about the
gambling boat. Boarded-up buildings still line many streets. And
although half of the casino's jobs have been filled with city
residents, the unemployment rate here remains above 10 percent, and
could be much higher because many of the chronically unemployed are
excluded from the count because they are no longer looking for
work.
</P>
<P>
   The most commonly heard grievance is that the casino has not
hired enough local people or used enough local vendors. But few
people, even the leaders of the city's more than 100 churches, have
been ardently opposed to the casino itself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Rev. Walter Shackelford Jr., pastor of the Rush
Memorial Church of the Nazarene, a small church just east of the
downtown area, said his congregation still sees few benefits from
the casino. ``Since the casino opened, they have put a police
substation in our area,'' Shackelford said. ``But none of my
members or anybody I know of is employed by the casino. We are
still poverty stricken.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The direct impact of the casino, as well as its ripple effect,
is significant, however. The city has used the approximately $9
million it receives in casino tax revenue annually to begin to
reverse its long decline. Broken sewers have been repaired, streets
have been paved and more than 1,200 derelict buildings have been
demolished.
</P>
<P>
   The city's police force has nearly doubled, and now has 98
officers. The number of patrol cars has also doubled, to 73.
Officers now have full medical coverage; several years ago, police
officers had to pay their own medical bills when they were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Crime has decreased in most of the nation's cities, but the 100
percent increase in police protection here has led to an especially
large drop. The number of murders, for example, peaked in 1991 at
68, but so far this year there have been only 14. Firefighters now
have more than $1 million in new equipment, while their ranks have
increased by 35 percent, to 60 firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   More important to the city's sustained survival is that the
estimated 3 million people who visit the casino each year actually
venture into East St. Louis, where people once feared that they
were gambling with their lives if they visited. Casino and police
officials note that no serious crimes have occurred in or near the
casino despite the influx of visitors. This, many people here said,
is changing the city's reputation and causing other businesses to
consider developments in East St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get 3 million people to go somewhere that no one
thought anyone would go to, then obviously there's some opportunity
in that place,'' said Craig Travers, the casino's general manager.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people who visit the casino come across the river
from Missouri, Travers said. Since it opened in 1993, the Casino
Queen has led the region, which includes six casinos in Illinois
and Missouri, in total gambling revenue. The Casino Queen Inc.,
which last year posted a total revenue of $131.8 million, is
privately owned by five different groups.
</P>
<P>
   And the casino's economic impact continues to grow. One private
developer, Koman Properties, expects to begin construction later
this year on a new supermarket, drugstore and video store. The
company's president is James G. Koman, whose family holds 20
percent of the equity in the Casino Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Another developer is planning a 72-room, $3 million hotel
adjacent to City Hall, and the Union Bank of Illinois is planning
to open a branch across the street. Along the riverfront, the
Casino Queen is breaking ground this year on a 150-room, $15
million hotel and a $5 million entertainment center. And Koman has
been buying land to develop a $22 million golf course on a 200-acre
site next to the casino complex.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 600 city residents who were hired when the Casino Queen
opened, about 35 percent came off the welfare rolls, casino
officials said. Before she started working at the casino five years
ago, Katrina Williams was raising her young daughter alone, earning
$4.10 an hour working part-time at a doctor's office, living in
public housing and receiving welfare checks. Now 32, she has been
promoted several times at the casino and is earning $28,000 as an
employment specialist, screening job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Williams' life has evolved in a way that casino officials
said has become common among employees. Over the last few years she
has bought a new car, gotten married and bought a house in the
suburbs ``with an in-ground swimming pool and a basketball court,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the mortgage applications that they complete for
employees, casino officials estimated that the casino jobs have
created more than 200 homeowners. But, because of the poor housing
stock and poor schools in East St. Louis, many casino employees
have moved to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and local developers hope that the exodus can be stopped.
Besides the casino tax revenue, another $7 million that the casino
paid to purchase some of its 95-acre riverfront property is also
being used to finance something this city has not seen in years:
the construction of new houses. Sixty new homes have already been
built, and 200 more mixed-income houses are planned.
</P>
<P>
   By renegotiating with its creditors and issuing bonds backed by
the state of Illinois, the city has been able to lower its
outstanding debt from $80 million to about $13 million, Bush said.
In all, the city's operating budget has gone from about $8 million
a year before the casino arrived to $20 million today.
</P>
<P>
   East St. Louis has also regained ownership of City Hall after
appealing the court decision and renegotiating a settlement with
the man who won the lawsuit. On the lampposts lining the street in
front of City Hall, large banners serve as not-too-subtle
remainders of what has made this fiscal rebirth possible.
``Chi-ching,'' one banner reads. ``Jackpot,'' says another.

IMF BACKS $17 BILLION FOR RUSSIA, BUT DELAYS FIRST PAYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, La.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The board of the International Monetary Fund Monday
night approved a $17 billion emergency rescue plan for Russia, but
trimmed back its first payment in an effort to force a reluctant
Russian Parliament to enact major austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was announced after a closed-door meeting that
lasted hours, seeming to reflect the enormous risk the fund was
taking. Russia has repeatedly failed to live up to commitments it
made in return for far smaller loans than the program approved
Monday. And on Friday the Duma, the Communist-dominated lower house
of Russia's Parliament, left Moscow for summer vacation without
passing some significant elements of Russia's commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The fund responded Monday night by reducing its first payment
from $5.6 billion to about $4.8 billion, officials said, a figure
they believed would not rattle the markets but would still send a
warning to the Duma. The $800 million that was withheld would be
released if Russia complied with fund conditions, chiefly new taxes
and more vigorous tax collection.
</P>
<P>
   The deal struck between the fund and Russia last week called for
more than $17 billion in new loans to be issued over the next 18
months, in addition to other aid from the World Bank and from
Japan. The next installment from the fund would come in September
if Russia demonstrated its compliance with the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the board began its meeting, President Boris Yeltsin's
staff was scrambling in Moscow to come up with new decrees that
would partly satisfy the IMF's conditions. Russia's chief
negotiator with the IMF, Anatoly Chubais, said Monday evening here
that he had worried over the last three days that the sizable deal
worked out last week was on the verge of collapse. ``Three times we
were able to find the solutions,'' Chubais said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he did not believe the $800 million reduction in
the IMF's first payment would harm Russia's economic recovery. ``If
it is less than $1 billion there will be no major impact,'' he said
Monday night at the Russian Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   Both American and IMF officials are acutely aware that if a
bailout of this size fails, it will only fuel the growing
criticisms of the fund's performance, which sparked to life again
Monday on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   As the fund's board met, one of its leading House critics, the
majority leader, Rep. Richard Armey, R-Texas, said he would lead a
``big fight on the floor'' to block an $18 billion increase in the
U.S.' IMF contribution. He appeared to be reversing course from a
speech he had given last week, in which he said he expected the
fund would get as much money as the administration sought, with few
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., Armey's likely rival to become
the next speaker should Newt Gingrich step aside to seek the
Republican nomination for president, said the troubles in Asia and
Russia had persuaded him to support the $18 billion contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the economic argument for the IMF is marginal at
best,'' Livingston said in an interview with Bloomberg News
Service, ``but I do think that there is a psychological and
political element that calls for us to support it now.'' He noted
that the Senate had already approved the $18 billion contribution,
and he said there were ``a majority in the House'' in favor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The divisions among the Republicans reflect a tension between
the party's growing suspicion of powerful international
organizations and its concern about appearing inattentive in the
face of a spreading economic crisis that is beginning to affect
American businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The agricultural lobby, for example, is strongly in favor of the
additional contributions because a drop in grain and other exports
to the afflicted countries is depressing commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   And no one on Capitol Hill has yet been heard directly
criticizing the bailout of Russia, perhaps for fear that if the
fund is prevented from acting, there may be a demand for direct
American support, the kind of bilateral loan that President Clinton
extended to Mexico three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So far the administration has declined to offer direct aid to
Russia, even the kind of ``backup financing'' it offered South
Korea and Indonesia to bolster confidence in those countries. So
far none of the direct aid to either country has been released.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy that emerged Monday was to hold back some of the
first installment of aid _ scheduled to be about $5.6 billion _ to
pressure the Russian parliament to pass the remainder of the
anti-crisis package when it comes back into session next month.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund concluded that it was too risky to cut off Russia
entirely in the midst of an economic crisis that has clearly
weakened Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a moment to kick Yeltsin because some of the
Communists in the Duma stood in the way,'' one American official
said. Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to leave for Russia this
week, and American officials clearly have an interest in not
plunging Russia back into a crisis during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have done a hell of a lot,'' one fund official said.
``This is a more serious effort than we have seen in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF money is intended to bolster Russia's depleting reserves
of foreign currency in an effort to avoid a forced devaluation of
the ruble. But a key requirement is that Russia enact changes that
would assure a steadier flow of tax revenues, no easy trick in a
country where most individuals file no tax returns and many
companies flout the tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes the Parliament has failed to make so far was a
requirement that local tax offices send tax revenues to Moscow. In
return, Russia's provinces would be permitted to impose sales
taxes. The Duma approved the sales taxes but not the measures to
assure that more payments are directed to Moscow rather than
sitting _ often unaccounted for _ in regional offices. One
negotiator with the Russians likened the problem to sending your
federal tax returns to a post office box in Pennsylvania, and then
discovering that Pennsylvania was funneling the money to its own
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement sent to the IMF Monday, Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko and the chairman of Russia's central bank, Sergei
Dubinin, said they had acted unilaterally to increase revenue to
the government and reduce the budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared buoyed even before the fund acted. They
exchanged nearly $6 billion in short-term Russian treasury bills
for longer-term bonds, a step the fund had urged to ease Russia's
debt burden. The attraction for investors is that the longer-term
bonds are denominated in dollars, not in rubles. That means the
Russian government, not the investors, would be caught short if
Russia devalued the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   The ruble is pegged to a fixed exchange rate with the dollar,
which has proved extraordinarily expensive for Russia to maintain.

 Consummate Hoax _ Virgin Cybercast Was Online Scam   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
It was all a hoax.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sensational planned ``cybercast'' of two 18-year-olds losing
their virginity live on the Internet _ which had generated
headlines nationwide _ actually was a money-making scheme designed
to reel in millions of unsuspecting people in an online version of
``War of the Worlds,'' according to one of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never was any intention of an online deflowering; the
whole thing was a scam,'' said Seth Warshavsky, president of
Internet Entertainment Group, an online adult entertainment company
which was to supply the computer equipment to broadcast the event.
</P>
<P>
   Warshavsky said he decided to go public after learning that the
site wouldn't live up to its advertising because he feared backlash
from angry customers.
</P>
<P>
   Warshavsky _ whose Seattle-based company is best known for
marketing the sex video of actress Pamela Anderson and rocker Tommy
Lee _ said yesterday that organizers of  &LR; www.ourfirsttime.com &LR;  told
him they planned to charge Internet users $5 each to view the
August 4 event and then announce at the last-minute that the
couple, ``Mike and Diane,'' had decided they were not ready for
sex.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warshavsky, organizers expected to make $5 million
from the event.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which carried photos of the couple and their ``diary
entries,'' now has a message that says Mike and Diane will not
consummate their relationship. ``Unfortunately, the cat is out of
the bag, so to speak,'' it read.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation underscores how the Internet has become a hotbed
for unfounded gossip, innuendo and _ in some cases _ fraud,
industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is like the real world: It is full of a lot of
good information and a lot of disinformation and B.S.,'' said
Stanton McCandlish, program director at the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, a civil libertarian organization in San Francisco.
``Consumers need to increase their critical thinking and not
believe everything they read _ both online and offline.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been several &UR;  &LR; notorious falsehoods online during the
past several years, including a fake document asserting that TWA
Flight 800 was shot down &UR;  &LR; by a missile and a purported commencement
speech by Kurt Vonnegut that turned out to be a column written by a
Chicago journalist.
</P>
<P>
   But none has generated as much media coverage or Web hits as the
Net virgins.
</P>
<P>
   Warshavsky said Ken Tipton, a former video-store owner and
operator of the site, wanted to produce an international sensation
on the scale of Orson Welles' ``War of the Worlds'' radio
broadcast, which some 60 years ago fooled millions of Americans
into thinking that Martians had invaded New Jersey. Tipton even
used the pseudonym ``Oscar Wells'' as part of the elaborate scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Tipton was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Mark Vega, a Los Angeles-based free-speech lawyer and
spokesman for the ``young'' couple, also could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a notice posted on IEG's Web site, he insisted that
the virgin video feed ``was not about making money'' and he called
Warshavsky's charges false and defamatory.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vega insisted the online site was legitimate and
estimated that in just a matter of days, it had attracted hundreds
of millions of ``visits.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptics said the couple _ whose faces were obscured by
black bars _ looked more like buffed, mature models than wide-eyed
18-year-olds about to share their most intimate moment on the World
Wide Web.

ZONING LAW THREATENS PORN BUSINESS IN NEW YORK CITY

 (af)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The voluptuous woman in the spiked heels flashed her
neon charms from the sign above grimy Eighth Avenue, just as she
has every day and night for years, to advertise the Playpen sex
club. But not even her perpetually saucy smile quite managed to
dispel the sense of doom at sidewalk level, where extinction
threatens the X-rated video stores, ``hug-and-squeeze rooms'' and
topless bars around Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   It may be premature to talk about the last days of porn as we
know it. The administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani did not get
the formal mandate it expected Monday from a federal appeals court
to begin enforcing a zoning law that could close down most of the
city's adult-oriented businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But in the dimly lighted world of sex shops and nude dancers,
where the future is at best uncertain, there was already a lot of
apocalyptic talk and misty remembrances of peep shows past.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the end of an era, no doubt about it,'' said a manager at
the Big Top Lounge at 675 Eighth Avenue, down the street from the
Playpen, who gave his name only as Bill. ``It's a fad that had to
play out, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The fad he had in mind is nudity, which he said first became the
rage in Times Square bars after World War II but got its biggest
boost from the ``flower children'' of the 1960s. It was a time Bill
recalled with fondness, which may explain why he offers slow
dancing to 60s classics upstairs in the ``hug and squeeze'' room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sex,'' he said emphatically. ``Nobody is getting
nothing upstairs _ just a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Bill, who was nattily dressed in flesh tones and white all
the way down to his shoes, most of the bouncers, doormen and clerks
at the sex shops had little information about what their future
might hold.
</P>
<P>
   Their bosses, the owners of most of the city's 164 adult
entertainment shops, have asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals to stay the city's enforcement of its zoning law on
sex-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As of the close of business Monday, the court had not issued a
response to the owners' request. Nor had the city received the
formal go-ahead to begin enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Times Square has been remade _ polished,
cleaned up, brightly lighted and made more family-friendly. The
sex-video stores and peep shows are starting to look like
anomalies, even though their daytime clients are virtually
indistinguishable from the typical lunchtime crowd of tourists in
shorts, office workers, tattooed bicycle messengers and
muscle-baring men with earrings in their eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, even Las Vegas is getting children-oriented,'' said
Garry Leonard, a professor of cultural studies at the University of
Toronto who studies the role of pornography. ``And I think the word
is getting out that Times Square has changed and Disney is coming
in.''
</P>
<P>
   He had just ambled out of Euroworld, an X-rated video store on
Eighth Avenue at 41st Street, in his sandals, blue jeans, flannel
plaid shirt and a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   What was he doing in there, he was asked. ``Research, believe it
or not,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The city zoning law, if it is eventually enforced, will not
spell the end of pornography. The law will move so-called adult
entertainment to what are now industrial zones, basically away from
where people live.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of one Eighth Avenue habitue, an elderly man on
crutches who calls himself Captain Jones, sex shops are part of the
American way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People came to this country and they had urges,'' he said, a
telltale whiff of a little morning nip on his breath as he idled in
front of the Big Top Lounge. ``They became adventurers, scientists,
businessmen. But they have to play too.''

 &HT;    Bengals president looks forward to challenge of tough season
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Bengals president Mike Brown and coach Bruce Coslet
may never be this loose and relaxed again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, it's all business.
</P>
<P>
   After recounting all the offseason moves during the annual
pretraining camp luncheon at the Queen City Club, both proclaimed
the Bengals are ready to face the challenges of the brutal schedule
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Brown pointed to Boomer Esiason's retirement to the broadcasting
booth, Dan ``Big Daddy'' Wilkinson's trade to the Washington
Redskins and John Copeland's torn left Achilles tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that wasn't the end of our difficulties,'' Brown said.
``The committee that does the (NFL) schedule has given us a doozy
(with nine games against 1997 playoff teams). It sort of looms in
front of us like an immovable object.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our work cut out for us and we know it. Yet, in spite
of all this, I feel good about where we are. While we have a real
challenge in front of us, I look forward to getting into the season
and showing we can do all right. I feel we will do all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the optimism is all the new players, especially
on defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals signed six free agents _ quarterback Neil O'Donnell,
defensive ends Michael Bankston and Clyde Simmons, linebacker Jerry
Olsavsky, cornerback Thomas Randolph and strong safety Myron Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The team also added a nine-man draft class featuring five
defenders, including first-round linebackers Takeo Spikes and Brian
Simmons. They are the only remaining holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   Add those defensive newcomers to an already-talented offense and
the Bengals hope it equals their first winning season since 1990.
``We have a lot of new players on defense _ old players, young
players, but new players,'' Brown said. ``It will take a while for
them to gell. That's one of the challenges Bruce and (defensive
coordinator) Dick LeBeau have in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``On offense, we come back with a more veteran team. Almost
everybody is established except at the quarterback position, where
we have a competition (between Jeff Blake and Neil O'Donnell for
the starting job).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen these quarterback controversies for many, many
years. They have one thing in common _ they resolve themselves on
the field. In this case, that will happen, too, and when it does,
we'll be a better team because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet is confident the Bengals can improve on their 7-9 record
from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think, overall, we've upgraded ourselves talent-wise,'' he
said. ``It'll be critical to see how fast they can get up to speed
in what we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year in the draft, we had two things in mind: Continue to
build our defense and increase our team speed. We think we
accomplished both. I'm not going to make any predictions. But I can
promise you this: We're going to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Coslet _ who owns a 14-11 record entering his second full
season as Bengals head coach _ feel any pressure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he said. ``It's a pressure-packed business. I felt the
pressure the first snap I took on a football field, the first day I
was an assistant (in 1980 with the 49ers). It's part of the job.''

 &HT;    No end of strike in sight for GM
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Striking United Auto Workers in Flint., Mich.,
told union leaders Monday that they hope to be off the picket line
in time to open Christmas presents in what was another gloomy sign
for the General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Entrenched in the auto industry's most costly labor battle in
decades, UAW leaders don't see a quick end to two strikes that have
strangled the world's largest automaker's North American production
and idled 185,000 workers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer this goes, Labor Day looks more and more like a
possibility,'' said UAW Vice President Richard Shoemaker before he
and other union leaders convened a summit of about 300 local union
officials from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the picket lines the other day, and the only thing
that our membership was impressing on us about the length of the
strike was that they hoped we had it done by the Christmas shutdown
because they'd like to receive their Christmas shutdown pay,''
Shoemaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid chants of ``no justice, no peace,'' the local presidents
and bargaining committee chairmen gathered for about two hours in a
suburban hotel ballroom not far from the Flint Metal Center
stamping plant, where the first strike began June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders for UAW Local 696, which represents 3,400 hourly workers
at two GM brake factories in Dayton, attended the union's strategy
session.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton union has also been at odds with GM over employment
and outsourcing issues for more than two years. GM has targeted two
local brake plants for sale or shutdown unless they can become
profitable. The two sides have made little progress in the local
talks during the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Local 696 President Gary Hill said the union is determined to
save jobs in GM plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``GM is going to have to live up to its local agreements or it
could be this way for the next five to 10 years,'' Hill said.
``There should have never been a strike like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flint strikes have idled nearly 8,000 workers or roughly 40
percent of GM's workforce in the Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW's closed-door meeting in Flint came one day after union
members in Spring Hill, Tenn., voted to authorize what would be the
first strike at GM's Saturn Corp. subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   GM and the UAW have a unique contract at the Saturn plant, the
only U.S. assembly plant that doesn't fall under GM's national
pact.
</P>
<P>
   If talks fail, the local may ask Saturn workers again if they
want to scrap the Saturn contract and put themselves under the
national contract. The national contract offers higher base pay but
lacks the goals-based bonuses that Saturn workers have enjoyed in
good sales years.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn workers and their union leaders allege that GM has
reduced the influence they have in product decisions, contrary to
the principles of the Saturn contract.
</P>
<P>
   GM is planning to produce Saturn's first midsize car at a plant
in Delaware rather than at the Saturn assembly plant in Tennessee.
There also has been talk of building a Saturn sport utility vehicle
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee small-car plant has about 7,200 union workers and
is the only GM assembly operation still running at normal
production in the United States, using stockpiled parts.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett planned to be back in Spring Hill Tuesday, when talks
were scheduled to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Shoemaker said he called the summit to brief union leaders on
the strikes. The walkouts by about 9,200 workers have shut 25 GM
assembly plants and more than 100 GM parts plants throughout North
America. GM has lost more than $1.2 billion so far.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations resumed at the Delphi Flint East parts plant
Monday, but were in recess until today at the Flint Metal Center
stamping plant.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, an arbitrator is scheduled to hear arguments from the
UAW and GM on the automaker's motion to have the strikes ruled
illegal. The closed hearing will be conducted in Detroit.

 &HT;    Huffy to shut down Ohio bike factory
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Huffy Corp. will make its last bicycle in
Celina, Ohio next week when the company lays off 650 workers and
stops production at what used to be the world's largest bike
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Miamisburg-based company announced May 28 that
the Celina plant would be closed, but the massive layoff of its
hourly workforce will come sooner than first expected.
</P>
<P>
   Only 200 parts makers and support personnel will remain employed
at the plant after the layoffs July 31. The plant officially will
close Oct. 2, according to Tom Frederick, Huffy's vice president of
finance and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy officials originally said it would take about a year to
phase out the plant, but Frederick said the company was able to
expedite added production to its bike factory in Farmington, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really has been no last-second outcry from our employees
and we are thankful for the orderly shutdown,'' Frederick said.
Huffy plans to increase bike production at the Farmington plant and
will import more bikes from Asia and Mexico to cover the lost
production in Celina.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy's workforce, represented by the United Steel Workers of
America Local 5369, have not disrupted production since the company
announced it would close the plant.
</P>
<P>
   But several workers are still angry and having difficulty
finding new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can say what they want, but they shoved us out on the
street and now we're faced with raising our families on jobs that
pay $5.50 an hour,'' said Dennis Gehle, an employee at Huffy for 26
years. ``My wife and I both work there and thought we could retire
at Huffy, but we'll be gone next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Huffy announced it would close the Celina plant, the
company had told workers they would have to work for as little as
$6.10 an hour with no health benefits and no pension plan or risk
losing the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble between Huffy and its workforce began in 1995, when
workers agreed to a 20 percent pay cut after the company's bike
division lost $10.5 million. About 2,000 hourly workers were
employed at the bike plant in 1994 before layoffs trimmed
employment to a low of 650.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Huffy officials said they needed workers to
accept more concessions so the company could trim about $15 million
from operating costs at the Celina plant.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick said the company plans to hire a national real estate
firm to handle the sale of its Celina facility. Frederick said the
company would be willing to sell the 40-year-old, block-long
building for about $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the potential buyers would be manufacturers and a
quick sale would benefit both Huffy and the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Huffy Corp. last reported break-even earnings for the second
quarter due to a $12.6 million charge related to the closing of the
Celina plant. The company also makes basketball backboards and lawn
and garden tools, and markets inventory and supplier services.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Anti-UFW Group Threatens to Spoil Strawberry Campaign  
   
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Watsonville, Santa Cruz County  
 
 
The United Farm Workers' high-profile campaign to organize
California's 20,000 strawberry workers is facing a potentially
lethal setback at the state's largest berry farm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of anti-UFW workers at Coastal Berry _ which has been at
the center of the UFW's campaign _ filed a petition last week
seeking representation by an independent, non-UFW union.
</P>
<P>
   State officials could schedule such an election for as early as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The election is only the latest in a series of unusual events at
Coastal.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, Coastal's owners signed a ``neutrality
agreement'' in which they promised not to oppose any attempts to
bring in a union.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, other strawberry growers have sued Coastal, claiming
its ``neutrality'' amounts to aiding and abetting the UFW.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-UFW workers have staged wildcat strikes to protest the
company's neutrality, which they also perceive as being pro-UFW.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the UFW has accused Coastal of letting its foremen
threaten and intimidate potential union supporters.
</P>
<P>
   UFW organizers say the Coastal foremen want to preserve their
own substantial power over hiring and firing by setting up a
docile, pro-management union.
</P>
<P>
   If the anti-UFW forces win, it could present the biggest and
most serious hurdle for the UFW's strawberry drive and for the
AFL-CIO, which counts the UFW among its members and has plowed
millions of dollars into the 3-year-old and so far unsuccessful
effort to organize California's berry workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (proposed non-UFW union) is a farce, an extension of the
foremen and supervisors,'' said Arturo Rodriguez, president of the
UFW and son-in-law of its late founder Cesar Chavez. ``It is a real
disservice to workers who have been fighting for two years to get
real (union) recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're genuinely trying to have an open forum,'' countered
Coastal Berry president David Smith. ``But each side would like us
to squoosh the other side. Coastal Berry is a pawn in a very big
game of organized labor versus organized agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   With 775 acres of bright red berries on green hillsides that
slope gently toward Monterey Bay, Coastal Berry's property looks
too bucolic to be at the center of one of the country's biggest
labor battles.
</P>
<P>
   But with a 10 percent share of the state's $608 million
strawberry market, Coastal is the largest single grower. Other
brand names like Driscoll sell far more berries, but they are
marketing-and-shipping cooperatives or companies serving dozens of
individual growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we win an election at Coastal and get a contract, we will
set a whole new standard for the industry,'' said the UFW's
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   So far the UFW has signed a contract with only one small organic
berry grower _ Swanton Berry Farms near Santa Cruz. It is No. 1
within the organic berry market but employs only 40 employees
during peak season.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the UFW say the dearth of contracts is a sign that
the union is out of touch with the strawberry workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry workers earned an average of $6.70 an hour in 1996,
the most recent year for which state data are available. But
workers at big farms often earn more than the average. Coastal says
its employees currently earn $7.50 to $11 an hour, depending in
part on how many berries they pick. They receive health benefits
but no pension.
</P>
<P>
   ``These workers are some of the highest paid field workers in
the country, so they don't perceive a benefit to becoming
unionized,'' said Doug Kerr, general counsel for the Western
Growers Association, a large trade association for California
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   UFW leaders respond that berry wages and working conditions have
improved dramatically in the past three years precisely in response
to their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW says its efforts have been slowed mainly by workers'
fears of retaliation by growers and foremen.
</P>
<P>
   Pickers haven't forgotten what happened at five berry farms that
voted to unionize several years ago: Shortly after the votes, the
owners shut down operations and left all the workers unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to create an atmosphere where workers don't have to
fear retaliation, violence or shutdown if they vote for the
union,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   At Coastal Berry, executives claim they've done everything
possible to eliminate any fears of retaliation among workers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, other strawberry growers charge the company has gone
too far the other way _ toward supporting the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coastal is so close to the union that, if it's not actually
owned by the AFL or UFW, it looks as if it's a union-owned
company,'' said Kerr of the Western Growers Association.
</P>
<P>
   There's an unusual history behind the company that has helped
fuel such charges.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, Coastal was owned by giant Monsanto Co. through its
Gargiulo tomato subsidiary. In mid-1997, Monsanto signed a
neutrality agreement saying it would not oppose UFW efforts to
organize its berry fields.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterwards, the company sold the berry operations to two
private Washington, D.C., investors, David Gladstone and Landon
Butler.
</P>
<P>
   The two buyers had no previous experience in farming. But both
had extensive track records working with unions, as financial
advisers to unions and investment bankers in employee stock
buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said that the new owners saw potential marketing
advantages in becoming the first and only union-label strawberry
grower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very long and successful history investing in
companies where workers are represented by labor unions,''
Gladstone wrote in an April letter to some Coastal employees. ``I
believe workers should be represented by their union, but of course
that is a choice for workers to make themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   UFW leaders initially credited top Coastal executives with
sincerely trying not to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   But over time, UFW members started complaining that the company
hadn't reined in some foremen who were strongly anti-union and who
tried to intimidate potential union supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The foremen ``tell us that the union is worthless and will steal
our money,'' said Efren Barajas, a picker who was initially
anti-union but changed his mind because of anger at the foremen's
pressure tactics. ``Sometimes they would tell me to go and provoke
fights with the pro-union people.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; UFW opponents, on the other hand, accused the company of
pressuring workers to support the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who don't want the union are treated bad, and the
ones who want it are treated good,'' said one worker wearing a ``No
UFW'' hat in the fields recently.
</P>
<P>
   In June, more than 100 anti-UFW workers held a one-day wildcat
strike to complain that the company was being pro-UFW.
</P>
<P>
   One of their gripes was that the company let UFW organizers come
into the fields for one hour to talk to workers. Those who did not
want to listen could go home with pay.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on July 1, anti-UFW workers held another one-day strike
that turned violent. When some crews of pro-UFW workers tried to
continue picking, the strikers attacked them with fists, clods of
dirt and berry boxes, according to local news reports.
</P>
<P>
   When the police showed up, the strikers attacked them, too. By
the end of the melee, two anti-UFW strikers were arrested. Three
UFW supporters including Efren Barajas had to seek hospital
treatment for injuries, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Since then, the UFW has held a series of vigils calling on
Coastal Berry to fire the workers and foremen who allegedly
instigated the violence. The company has refused to fire anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Western Growers Association continues to press a
lawsuit it filed in June, alleging that Coastal's neutrality
statement amounts to a deceptive business practice. ``Coastal Berry
is clearly biased in favor of the UFW,''said WGA president David
Moore. ``It has misled the public by promoting its neutrality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Last Thursday, anti-UFW workers _ including some who were
arrested for attacking the police during the recent violence _
petitioned to hold an election to form an independent union called
the Coastal Berry Farmworkers Committee.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If the anti-UFW workers win, it would be a major setback for
the UFW's berry drive. Under farm labor law, the UFW would be
banned from calling any more elections at Coastal Berry for a year.
And the union would lose credibility at other smaller berry farms
that have been watching the situation at Coastal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  At a press conference in Oakland yesterday, AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney joined UFW leaders in asking state labor officials to
dismiss the election petition because of the recent violence in the
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``People signed petitions out of sheer fear of being beat up
like their fellow workers were beat up,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they're looking into the UFW's charges and
preparing for the election at the same time. Farmworker union
elections must be held within seven days _ so the election is
scheduled for this Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investigating those allegations at the same time we are
in countdown mode for the election,'' said Paul Richardson, general
counsel of the Agricultural Labor Relations Board.  &LR;

 High Tech Trying Hard to Keep `Temporary' Workers Bill Alive   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Suddenly, the high-tech lobby is fighting to keep alive one of its
top legislative priorities: a congressional bill to increase the
number of ``temporary'' skilled workers from overseas who can fill
jobs in the United States.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May, when SB1723 sailed through the Senate on a 78-to-20
vote, it looked like high-tech was going to get the increase it
sought in the quota of workers who could be brought here under the
controversial H-1B visa program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the odd alliance of an anti-immigration Republican
leader in the House of Representative and the labor-friendly
Clinton administration has H-1B legislation listing badly _ if not
sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Two Silicon Valley lawmakers, Representatives Tom Campbell,
R-Campbell, and Zoe Lofgren, D-San Jose, are trying to broker a
compromise between the Senate bill, which the tech industry likes,
and the current House version, which it hates.
</P>
<P>
   But with only 24 days before Congress goes out of session, the
clock is ticking on an issue that has tempers running high.
</P>
<P>
   ``As divided as the two sides are, I'd be the most surprised
person in the world if they manage to pull off a compromise,'' said
Carl Shusterman, an immigration lawyer in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the debate began favorably for the tech lobby, which
created headlines earlier this year by warning of a dramatic
shortage of high-tech workers, especially programmers.
</P>
<P>
   With industry blessing, Senator Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.,
drafted a bill to increase the quota of foreign workers _ now
65,000 _ who can come here each year on six-year work permits.
Three-quarters of the Senate, including both California members,
voted to raise that quota to a high of 115,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then the bill landed in the House Judiciary Subcommittee on
Immigration, where Representative Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a bulwark
of anti-immigration sentiment, added two innocuous-sounding riders
that made the tech lobby draw a collective gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's HR3736 would require that companies seeking to import
H-1B workers make two ``attestations'' _ that they have tried and
failed to hire qualified Americans, and that no U.S. workers were
laid off to create vacancies for foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-industry lawyer Susanna Igleheart Bogue said those
provisions would enable disgruntled workers to get the Department
of Labor to investigate any firm that hired H-1B staff _ leading to
expensive administrative law proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech firms would rather leave the H-1B quotas alone than
accept attestation,'' Bogue said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Campbell is supporting Smith's attestations in
principle, while looking for language that doesn't make the
industry gag. He's asked lobbyists Mary DeBeal of Hewlett-Packard,
Tom Gann of Sun Microsystems and Mike Maibach of Intel to negotiate
with Smith directly.
</P>
<P>
   Lofgren, meanwhile, is reportedly trying to get the White House
to reverse or at least soften its threat to veto any H-1B bill that
lacks attestations. But a Senate source says Lofgren's out of luck,
because Clinton's mind is made up.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of industry's position is laid out in a July 7
e-mail _ which found its way to me _ in which Intel lobbyist
Jenifer Eisen lays out the facts: by industry's count, Smith then
had 240-to-270 votes for his bill, attestations and all. Passage
requires 218 yeas.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, will reportedly get Abraham and Smith together later this
week to bang out a compromise in which the attestations would not
apply to the first 65,000 workers admitted under H-1B visas, but
would be required for workers who come in under the new, higher
quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, William Archey, president of the American
Electronics Association, insisted yesterday that a bill palatable
to industry would emerge from the House and make it to the
president's desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the right side of the angels on this,'' Archey said
confidently.
</P>
<P>
   By which I think he meant he'll be spending a lot of time on his
knees in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by phone
(650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail (abate(at

 Surfing the Web for Wedding Gifts   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Considering the number of things you can do online these days _
everything from gambling to broadcasting a live birth _ it's
surprisingly difficult to shop for wedding presents in cyberspace.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's because most places with popular wedding registries _
such as Bloomingdale's, Crate &AMP; Barrel and Williams-Sonoma _ have
not put them online. The only major retailers that offer online
bridal registries are Macy's, JCPenney and discounter Service
Merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Most retailers run on very thin margins,'' said David
Alschuler, director of electronic commerce research at the Aberdeen
Group in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's a challenge for them to make big
investments in new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the companies that make popular bridal gifts are loathe to
sell online for fear of alienating the stores that carry their
wares.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Black &AMP; Decker's Web site has a bridal area that
suggests wedding presents, but doesn't let Web surfers purchase the
DustBusters and rice cookers.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Fear of undercutting Black &AMP; Decker sales to
department and specialty stores, according to Christina Blosser,
who oversees the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still more important to not jeopardize the already
established relationships (with retailers) than to move
aggressively in the online environment,'' said Blosser.
</P>
<P>
   However, a few Web entrepreneurs have stepped in to fill the
gap, offering consumers a one-stop shop for a diverse selection of
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, most sites have a limited selection of
traditional bridal items. Rather, cyber-registries are more likely
to carry nontraditional items such as soaps, candles, camping gear
and even tickets to events.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Palo Alto newlyweds Virginia Wei and Michael Han
registered last month on Ucopia ( &LR; www.ucopia.com &LR; ) for golf
lessons, symphony tickets, a video rental card and museum passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very busy; we spend very little time at home,'' said
Wei, who is an attorney at Wilson, Sonsini Goodrich &AMP; Rosati in
Palo Alto. ``Our family and friends were delighted that they could
purchase something for us that comported with our lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Ucopia, which is based in San Francisco, offers everything from
gift certificates for skydiving and cooking lessons to expensive
knickknacks from hip South of Market boutiques. It also
carries &UR;  &LR; some items from more traditional retailers such as Strouds
and Smith &AMP; Hawken.
</P>
<P>
   Ucopia charges retailers a commission, but also charges the
shopper from $1.50 to $5 per transaction. The 3-month-old site
eventually plans to charge couples $45 to register online.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most people, the fee is no big deal in exchange for the
convenience,'' said Dave Gulezian, the 30-year-old Stanford MBA who
co-founded the site with fellow alumnus Brian Anderluh.
</P>
<P>
   Ucopia's main competitor is the The Wedding Network ( &LR; www.wed &LR; 
 &LR; dingnetwork.com &LR; ), which also offers alternative gifts but doesn't
charge couples or buyers for the transaction, instead taking a
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Wedding Network offers wine clubs from Virtual Vineyards and
cigar shipments from Corona Cigar Co., as well as sporting gear
from GrandWest Outfitters and The Flyfisher.
</P>
<P>
   Wedding Network Executive Vice President Larry Smith said he's
hoping to add some more traditional goods to the slim lineup of
china and linens, but it's a slow process because many retailers
are worried about losing their customers to an online competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of wedding sites but there aren't a lot of
registries because it's not easy,'' Smith said. ``It's very
difficult to work with retailers to develop it.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, some Web sites such as TheGift.com have tried
to bypass retailers altogether by buying directly from
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the manufacturers are willing to participate. For
example, KitchenAid _ which makes the popular bridal gift item, a
stand mixer _ refuses to work with online registries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is that we're so powerful in the bridal
industry that we bring more to the table than they do,'' said
KitchenAid spokesman Brian Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   And other manufacturers refuse to let Jeff Swearingen, the
founder of TheGift.com, order small quantities of items.
</P>
<P>
   So he has actually purchased a warehouse-full of china, crystal,
silverware, blenders and grills _ in anticipation of future bridal
registry customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tells me I'm nuts,'' he said. ``But I'd rather sit
on some inventory for a few months than make a customer wait a few
months'' for an item they've purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Swearingen is also opening a store in nearby Dallas so that he
can lure Internet-leery manufacturers to sell to him.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that his business is a long shot, but he believes that
in a few years online bridal registries will become the standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say that we're building a luxury liner in ankle-deep
water,'' he said. ``Next year we'll be knee-deep.''

HANKS REVELS IN SPIELBERG'S `PRIVATE RYAN,' PERHAPS THE BEST WAR
MOVIE EVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Hanks enters the room like the meter is running. His hair is
still shorn close to his head, as if he had just stepped in from
the set of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' director Steven Spielberg's
remarkable new World War II movie.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanks is peppy and cool, though not as cool as the room in
the Mansion on Turtle Creek; the climate-control setting is causing
hypothermia. He moves straight to the windows and pushes open the
curtains, relieving the suite's Bat Cave-like gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Because every other remark is sprinkled with irony, it sometimes
takes a moment for Hanks' intelligence to shine through. It's as if
his cheekiness puts the conversation on a five-second delay.
</P>
<P>
   Hanks shakes off the refrigerator-car chill and pours the first
of what will no doubt be dozens of rounds of coffee for the day. He
has embarked on a multi-city tour to promote ``Ryan,'' which opens
Friday. It's the first serious film to get a summer release in
years.
</P>
<P>
   When it's remarked that the Mr. Freeze room temperature isn't as
difficult as the 10 arduous days' worth of Army physical
conditioning for ``Ryan'' _ which Hanks insisted on following
through to the end _ he shrugs: ``Oh, you mean the legendary basic
training story. Yeah. (the training) gets longer and more legendary
in every magazine story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan'' falls squarely into what could be called the second
half of Hanks' career, which began with ``Punchline,'' when he
yoked himself to more serious work. He evolved past the breezy
character comedy of ``Splash'' and ``Nothing in Common'' into
pictures with a heavier dramatic tone, like ``Philadephia'' and
``Apollo 13'' and ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't cruise through ``Ryan,'' and credits a lot of that to
Spielberg, who may have the most intuitive grasp of filmmaking of
any major director. It is Spielberg's reflexive talent that makes
``Ryan'' _ about a platoon sent behind enemy lines to bring home a
dogface whose brothers have died in the war _ the best WWII movie
ever made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the most instinctive director of all time,'' nods Hanks.
``That's the word. When we first talked about this movie, we had
read the script independently and found out the other guy had read
it. So we talked about it the next day. The things he said in our
very first conversation showed up on the set in moments of his
particular kind of clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a movie that was storyboarded to within an inch of
its life. There WERE no storyboards. Literally, at some point he
would say, `What would you (actors) do here?' And we'd show him
what we'd do. And he'd go, `Great. Then I can put the camera here,
here and here.' He was more improvisational and collaborative than
I ever would have thought Steven to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect this embodiment of the auteur theory, because,''
Hanks raises his arms to indicate imperiousness, ``Steven's a
genius, and he's directed all these amazing movies. But (Spielberg)
said his point was to put the audience on the beach at Omaha. He
didn't want this kind of crane-up-fast-kind-of-thing. He wanted the
camera to be moving around like one of the GIs _ he wanted (the
camera) to see what the GIs saw _ so that the audience will
actually be on Omaha Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``In doing that, we saw that he was uncompromising. My very
first shot in the movie on Omaha Beach is in the back of the
landing craft, and the ramp goes down. And I didn't even really
know about it beforehand, but the first four rows of guys got mowed
down. They were wired with squibs and explosives _ and I think a
couple of 'em were even mannequins.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the ramp goes down and,'' Hanks punches the air to
illustrate the shock of noise and motion, ``Blam, blam. Blam! BLAM!
There's pink mist in the air and there's bits and pieces of motion
picture movie flesh all over me. I had to pick up a guy and throw
him over the side (of the landing craft). We did that shot, and I
went up and found the other actors and I said, `You're not gonna
believe what's going on down there.' And that's the way it was
every step of the way. He just put the cameras in places that were
totally surprising. He follows this instinct and follows it
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Nick at Nite's TV Land cable outlet, Hanks' first
steady acting work, ``Bosom Buddies,'' repeats endlessly. ``But
after it was canceled _ and we thought we were lucky to get renewed
for a second year _ I thought I'd never work again. I didn't work
for a year. I got some little things, but nothing much. When I got
`Splash,' everybody else had turned it down. It was the first
Touchstone film. And Disney (Studios) then isn't what Disney is
now. I mean, it was like some run-down junior college campus in
Atlanta in 1962. The commissary had tuna sandwiches wrapped in
foil. It was like a Greyhound bus station, and I was happy to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks' standing as a consummate ensemble player exploded out of
``Splash.'' He has worked with a number of actors, and his
generosity brings the spark of team spirit to his work. But the
toughest co-star he ever had? ``When they ask me what was the
hardest movie _ before (`Ryan') _ I still say it was `Turner &AMP;
Hooch.' I was extremely opinionated because of what I didn't want
it to be ... some cheesy, goofy dog comedy,'' he says, exploding
into laughter. ``And I thought the dynamic of the man and the dog
was very interesting.

SPECIAL ASSEMBLY SESSION WILL PASS PROPOSAL TO LIMIT PAROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Responding to harsh election-year attacks on
Assembly Democrats, Speaker Sheldon Silver announced Monday that he
would bring the Assembly back for a special session next week to
pass Gov. George Pataki's proposal to limit parole for violent
felons.
</P>
<P>
   The move represents a significant shift for the Assembly
leadership, who have been blamed by Republicans for the failure of
the governor's proposal in the last legislative session. It is
intended to neutralize a contentious issue that Democratic
lawmakers from conservative and moderate districts had feared could
jeopardize their seats this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday afternoon, Silver, a Manhattan Democrat,
acknowledged that since the regular legislative session ended last
month he had been under pressure from rank-and file lawmakers in
his chamber to pass Pataki's proposal to restrict parole for
first-time violent felons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were members who looked at it as a political issue,''
Silver said, ``and they wanted the political issue removed. I think
it was important to take the politics out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only a few inmates convicted of violent crimes in New
York State serve more than two-thirds of their maximum sentences
before being released. But Pataki's proposal to restrict parole for
first-time violent offenders would require felons to serve at least
85 percent of their maximum sentences before being released.
</P>
<P>
   With 30,000 inmates in New York eligible for parole each year,
some experts believe that the governor's plan will increase the
prison population beyond its current level of 70,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, had made elimination of parole for
first-time violent felons a major legislative goal this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by his office late Monday afternoon,
Pataki said, ``I had no doubt that when the members of the Assembly
went back to the towns and villages they represent, they would
recognize that our policy of keeping violent felons behind bars
longer is working and making our streets safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the bill has already been passed by the Republican-led
Senate, it could be signed into law directly after approval by the
Assembly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Up to now, Silver had been willing to adopt Pataki's proposal to
toughen parole for violent felons only in exchange for a major
expansion of drug-treatment programs as an alternative to prison
for nonviolent criminals. He also wanted mandatory schooling for
inmates and increased supervision of former inmates after their
release.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his Republican allies in the Senate, however,
rejected the Silver plans as too expensive and soft on criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But Assembly members ultimately passed their own bill, believing
it would give them the political cover they needed on the parole
issue.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Pataki and his Republican allies have stepped
up their campaign against Assembly Democrats, attacking them for
failing to pass legislation dubbed ``Jenna's Law,'' named after a
22-year-old woman, Jenna Grieshaber, who was killed in Albany last
November. The man charged in her death was released early from
prison on a stabbing conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days ago, the State Republican Party started mailing
out more than 150,000 posters that featured a photograph of Silver
and nine of the state's most notorious convicted criminals. The
posters were accompanied by a letter that stated: ``Some of these
violent felons will be out of prison in as little as two and a half
years, free to rape and kill again, simply because of the
reprehensible actions of a single man, Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, several Democrats who had been under attack because
of the parole issue expressed relief over the speaker's decision.
Naomi Matusow, a Democratic Assemblywoman from Mount Kisco, said
the move takes a powerful issue away from her Republican
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an attempt to use this issue against me and to
distort my record in spite of the fact that I had supported Jenna's
Law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Under current laws governing the sentencing of criminals, a
judge will usually sentence a criminal to a range of time in
prison, like three to nine years, instead of a specific term. That
approach has been abandoned by most states and the federal
government in favor of formulas that make sentences more specific
from case to case, thereby giving judges less discretion.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the minimum sentence imposed by a judge is usually
one-third of the maximum, or if the defendant has a prior felony
conviction, one-half of the maximum. An inmate becomes eligible for
parole after reaching the minimum, and is automatically released
after serving two-thirds of the maximum, except in cases of
unusually bad behavior in prison.

UNDATED: very interesting. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I had this string of motivations to do it. And all of 'em, by
and large, were false, just the kind of things you tell yourself to
talk yourself into doing the movie. But the good thing that came
out of the movie was this thing between me and the dog. At the
time, our competition was gonna be Jimmy Belushi and `K-9,' which I
think was supposed to be some movie about an anthropomorphic dog.
What was it gonna do? Answer the phone? Drive a car? So we went the
other way, and made it about real behavior between a guy and this
uncontrollable dog.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Turner &AMP; Hooch' was one of the times when I was really
involved with the making of the film,'' Hanks continues. ``That was
actually the first time I could block out my own business, and it
was shot wonderfully. It was a huge experience to a guy learning
the craft of how you make movies. Because sometimes the actors come
in and say stuff like, `OK, how come I can't walk to the window
right now?' Or `Why can't I take a chair and smash it against the
wall?' Y'know, the kind of cool behavior where you try to be
flashy. Not taking into consideration the fact that, well, there's
only one of those chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his knee-deep immersion in that film, Hanks is asked
if ``Turner'' gave him his first ideas about directing. ``Well, I
guess in the back of my mind I'd always thought about directing.
And Ron (Howard) always said it was the greatest job in the world.
And it can be. But Penny (Marshall) says,'' and he drawls the words
out in her pained whine, `` `It's the s-------t job in the world.'
'' But he did eventually step behind the camera to write and direct
``That Thing You Do,'' a '60s-set film about a one-hit-wonder band
that's a buoyant, understanding take on popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Thing You Do'' has a heady, ecstatic glow that conveys
the saucer-eyed naivete of the time. And its courtliness,
sidestepping contemporary sexual attitudes, drew derision. ``In
'64, I was 7 years old,'' Hanks counters, ``and the concept of sex
was not even in my head. It's funny because when the movie came
out, and talk about doing press _ man, that was a celebrity mule
train that never ended _ they ragged on me for that. `How come
there's no sex in the movie?' Because it's 1964!''
</P>
<P>
   He sits back and rolls his eyes, still slightly exasperated
about the reception the picture got. ``And there was a very
discreet nod to affairs of the heart. It's not (sex) under the
grandstand. It's a pop (music) movie. And pop exists from here,''
he says, pointing to his head. ``Rock 'n' roll is from the neck
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then (people) would go `Why the Beatles and not the Rolling
Stones?' Because I never got the Rolling Stones. When I was a kid,
they scared me. They seemed too rough, angry about something, and I
wasn't sure what they were angry about. How about the fact that the
Rolling Stones never came out with a record head to head with the
Beatles? (Mick Jagger) just heard those Howlin' Wolf records when
he was 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanks sighs and raises a brow. ``It was all about joy, that's
all it was. (Pop) was incredibly great fun, and everybody looked
incredibly cool. And incredibly sophisticated. And how much fashion
was our own conceit. The diference is that, at that time, everybody
else looked like they were 42 years old except us. By the nature of
the clothes we wore and our music, it made us different. And youth
culture became an economic engine all to itself. There was a vast
chunk of money that was rolling here, and it became an export. It
wasn't just this thing that existed in a cocoon. It was literally
of global importance. And it affected manufacturing, and it
affected fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember thinking in my own head,'' Hanks grins,
exposing a little of his own naivete, ``that the Dave Clark Five
were much better than the Beatles, because they were on the Ed
Sullivan Show so many times. If the Beatles were so great, how come
the Dave Clark Five were on the Ed Sullivan Show, like, seven times
in one year? When I was in London promoting _ and I'm always
promoting _ `Apollo 13,' someone asked me what my next movie was
going to be about. I said, `It's `That Thing You Do,' and it's
going to answer the question: `Who's better, the Beatles or the
Dave Clark Five?' Because, y'know, you gotta say something.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Dave Clark called my office and said, `Is it true that Tom
is doing a movie about the Dave Clark Five?' So he came down for a
day, and we talked for about an hour and a half,'' Hanks reflects.
``And it was really quite something. He was a smart dude. I asked
him if he found that he could still make money. And he said, `Oh,
Tom. I make a bloody fortune.' He owned it all: the songs, the
publishing, everything. An incredibly smart man.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the same conclusion one could draw about Tom Hanks.

 Getting Home Address OffA Web Site   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 Q:   How do I get my home address removed from someone's Web 
 site? Over the past month I have had over 50 young men show up 
 at my front door at all hours of the day and night (i.e., 
 midnight and 4 a.m.). They are apparently all Web-surfing and 
 are given my address as the place to meet for a massage. Am I 
 doomed to this mode of home wrecking, or is there something I 
 can do to end this growing nightmare? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Now THAT'S a computing problem you don't see every day!
What you should do is contact the owner of the Web site _ or better
yet, have your lawyer do it _ and get your name taken off the site.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to do is get the address of the site from one of
your unwelcome visitors. Then you can find out who runs the site by
using Whois, a service of Network Solutions. That's the company
that registers most of the world's Internet domain names (such as
Apple.com, the domain name for Apple Computer's site). You'll find
Whois at  &LR; http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Whois lets you search for any domain name ending in .com, .net,
.org or .edu. You should be able to find the name of the person or
company who registered the site, as well as the name, address and
phone number of the site administrator.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; How can one become a Web programmer? What programming &LR; 
 &LR; languages do you have to know, and how can you go about finding &LR; 
 &LR; a job &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Jennifer Cannella, a technical recruiter in the Santa Clara
office of the Elan agency, says the prospective Web programmer
should be fluent in HTML, Java, Javascript and Perl. In addition, a
foundation in C++ is helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Good ways to search for a job include contacting agencies like
Elan, going to job fairs and perusing the Internet, where many
companies post job openings on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   One good site is the Westech Virtual Job Fair, at  &LR; www.vjf.com &LR; .
You can submit an electronic resume and search for positions that
are posted by major technology companies. There's also a list of
real-world job fairs, including a Westech Career Expo set for
tomorrow and Thursday at the Santa Clara Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; When I retrieve my e-mail there is a full page of &LR; 
 &LR; headings showing where the message came from and how it came to &LR; 
 &LR; me. It goes on and on and on. Is there a way I can choose to &LR; 
 &LR; show only the person sending the e-mail and the subject? I'm &LR; 
 &LR; using Netscape 4 as my Internet browser. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Boy, I wish every question were this easy. Go to the View
menu in the Netscape e-mail window and choose Headers. There you'll
find three choices: All, Normal and Brief. All, which is the option
you apparently are using now, gives you all the routing information
for a message. The reason there's so much of it is that e-mail can
go through many computer systems on the Internet enroute to you.
</P>
<P>
   The Normal option shows the subject of the message, the date it
was received, the address of the person who sent it and the address
of the person or mail list to whom it was sent. The Brief shows the
sender, the subject and the recipient. And that sounds like your
best bet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; We would like to copy our address book contacts from &LR; 
 &LR; Outlook 98 to a floppy disk. We were told it cannot be done. &LR;   &LR; Can
you advise us? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  It can be done, and pretty easily at that. Here's how. With
your Address Book open, choose Select All from the Edit menu. This
will highlight all your addresses in blue. Go back to the Edit menu
and choose Copy. Then open up a word processor like Microsoft Word
and use the Paste command in the Edit menu to copy all your
addresses into the new document. Finally, save the document to a
floppy disk. I'd recommend saving it in Text Only format, which
will let you open it on any Windows PC, regardless of which word
processor it has. Also, you can use the new file to make a neat
printout of all your addresses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TIP OF THE WEEK: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   America Online members, this one's for you. You don't need a
computer with AOL installed on it to check your AOL mail. You can
do it with any Internet connection by going to
 &LR; www.aol.com/netmail. &LR;  This new feature, called AOL NetMail, is
currently in a testing phase, but it seems to be pretty solid. It
lets you sign on and displays your AOL mailbox (you can't get any
other AOL features, however). You can send and receive messages
just as you would if you logged into your AOL account.

 Syquest Looks for Advice   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Normally, when a company enlists the advice of an investment bank,
it's tantamount to proclaiming, ``We're for sale.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that's not the case with Syquest, Chairman Ed Marinaro said
yesterday after the troubled disk-drive maker announced that it has
asked CIBC Oppenheimer to help chart its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is clearly to remain independent and to be able
to expand our business base considerably,'' Marinaro said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, CIBC Oppenheimer, will advise Fremont-based Syquest on
strategic partnerships, joint ventures and even possible
acquisitions that Syquest may consider.
</P>
<P>
   Syquest makes drives that let personal computer users store
large amounts of data on removable cartridges. Its chief rival is
Iomega, maker of the Zip drive.
</P>
<P>
   Like other disk drive companies, Syquest has been murdered by a
prolonged slump in the industry _ the result of a glut of drives
and a weaker-than-expected PC market.
</P>
<P>
   But Syquest's troubles go deeper than that. The company has
suffered three years of steady losses, and its stock has been
sliding.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Syquest would appear to be a fine takeover target. But
Marinaro doesn't see it that way. He believes that Syquest has
turned the corner in a two-year turnaround and is poised for a
financial rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Behind much of Marinaro's optimism is SparQ, a $199 drive whose
cartridges can store 1 gigabyte of data. (That's 700 times what you
can get on a floppy.)
</P>
<P>
   Because the SparQ made its debut last November, Marinaro said it
has outsold Iomega's Jaz drive, its only competitor. The Jaz, which
also holds 1 gigabyte per cartridge, sells for $100 more than the
SparQ.
</P>
<P>
   Syquest's revenues of $47 million in its March quarter were the
highest in more than a year, though it still suffered a net loss of
$31.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   The constant trail of red ink _ more than $200 million since
1995 _ has helped sink Syquest's stock. In August of 1995, the
shares peaked at $18.88. Yesterday, they were unchanged at $1.41.
</P>
<P>
   If Syquest isn't exactly a stellar performer, it's in a lot
better shape than when Marinaro took over in February of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week on the job, I had to raise $1 million to meet
the payroll. That's how bad things were,'' he said. ``Syquest was
on the verge of being a bankrupt company.''
</P>
<P>
   Marinaro, a 36-year computer industry veteran who had been CEO
of Network Computing Devices, embarked on a program to cut
operating expenses, which had strangled profit margins for early
Syquest products.
</P>
<P>
   He financed the company's survival through private stock
offerings that raised several hundred million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed did a great job of rounding up financing to keep the
company in good shape while they rebuilt the product line to get
out of the hole,'' said Dick Porter, president of research firm
DiskTrends.
</P>
<P>
   The private stock placements had a serious side effect, however.
The stock in those deals consisted of preferred shares, most of
which have since been converted to common stock _ thereby badly
diluting the common shares. The number of outstanding shares has
soared from 12.5 million two years ago to 127 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marinaro said Oppenheimer ``will be instrumental in
restructuring our capital accounts and raising incremental funds as
the need arises.'' The goal, he said, is to put Syquest in position
for a secondary public offering next year.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Syquest is cash-positive, with about $10 million on hand
and with long-term debt of less than $2 million. It has about 300
employees in the Bay area, and another 2,000 at its manufacturing
plant in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   However, its future success is far from assured. For one thing,
said Dataquest analyst Fara Yale, ``Iomega isn't going to roll over
and let Syquest to continue to take market share away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is new competition from Castlewood Systems, a startup
company also based in Fremont which was founded by Syed Iftikar _
who also founded Syquest.

   UNDATED _ An education professor at Arizona State University in
Tempe and two others have been ordered to shut down a Web site that
touted allegedly fraudulent investments.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stahl, a professor of secondary education for 20 years at
ASU who does research in how people think and learn, allegedly
operated the investment program, called Inve$tit Opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   It offered to put investors in touch with the president of a
``legally established corporation'' who would arrange for their
money to be invested with a European ``prime bank.'' The minimum
investment was $5 million, and it guaranteed a return of at least 8
percent, with a possible return of as much as 18 percent in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Fox, an attorney in the securities division of the
Arizona Corporation Commission, said there is no such thing as the
European prime bank debentures refered to on the Inve$tit Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, 52, of Tempe, along with Elizabeth Boyd, 54, of Fort
Myers, Fla., and David Francis, 33, of Bowling Green, Ky., were
accused of selling securities without a license, sale of
unregistered securities, and fraud in the sale of securities. All
are civil charges and could result in fines of as much as $15,000.
They will be scheduled for a hearing before a Corporation
Commission hearing officer.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said she could not comment on whether there is also a
criminal investigation. None of the people accused has a criminal
record, Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, reached at his ASU office Monday afternoon, said he has
had several inquiries during the last year, but no money ever
changed hands. Fox confirmed that there was no record of money
being invested from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfectly legal investment opportunity that is open
to certain investors,'' Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl was issued a temporary cease and desist order to shut down
the Web site, but it was still operating as of Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has never met Boyd and Francis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way we could have worked together,'' Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said that the Internet is rife with investment
schemes built around non-existent European prime bank notes.
Potential investors are told that the money is safe because it is
only used for collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Corporation Commission alleged that two Valley
companies, European Marketing Group and Planned Estate Consultants
Inc., along with four Valley residents, were running a similar
investment scheme. That case is still awaiting a decision by a
hearing officer.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the Securities and Exchange Commission has broken up
numerous cases involving the same European prime bank notes, said
Stephen Berkeley, another Corporation Commission attorney. There
have been some criminal charges filed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, who has a master's degree and a doctoral degree from the
University of Florida, also was accused of using his ASU office to
operate the investment site. His name and office phone number are
listed repeatedly on the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should not be there,'' Stahl said. ``I don't want this
associated with ASU because I was not running it out of here. It
was operated out of my office at home, although I did occasionally
respond to some correspondence from my office here.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU released a statement late Monday afternoon saying its
attorneys would seek additional information. The general counsel's
office will be asked to ``determine whether there were violations
of university policies.'' &QL;

   DALLAS _ Horacio Hernandez took a brief break from pouring and
troweling highway concrete while the temperature rose to 101 here
Monday afternoon, pulled away his tinted safety goggles and tried
to wipe them off with a T-shirt that was already soaked.
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of sweat can keep a project entirely on schedule
when crews have to quit painting once the temperature hits 100,
give up altogether on roadside plantings, and mix truckloads of ice
cubes with the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   From Florida through Texas to Colorado, nearly two months of
incessant heat and drought have caused scores of deaths, burned out
homes and withered crops.
</P>
<P>
   Although the numbers are preliminary and may prove overstated,
local and state authorities blamed the heat for 117 deaths,
including 81 in Texas, 22 in Louisiana and 11 in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the heat claimed more lives was in July 1995, when
a deadly stretch of weather baked the Eastern United States for
about a week. As many as 500 deaths were weather-related in the
Chicago area then, and refrigerated trucks were used to handle the
overflow from the morgue.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the victims this year have been elderly women and men
who, determined to get by without air-conditioning, mistakenly
believed this summer was just like any other.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida has had some recent rainfall and relief, the
outlook for Texas is more, much more, of the same. Monday, the 15th
straight day of 100-degree-plus readings in Dallas, has already
marked this summer as the worst since 1980, which was the hottest
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas County health officials declared a state of emergency
last week and other counties across the state are seeking federal
disaster assistance to compensate for more than $1.5 billion in
farming and ranching losses.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Denver, usually a mile-high summer haven, temperatures
reaching 100 degrees have forced the Public Service Company of
Colorado to threaten rolling, half-hour power shutdowns unless
customers keep their air-conditioners off when they are not home.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, which had the second-hottest June on record and
a July barely any cooler, keeping the bobcats at the Audubon Zoo
healthy and cool has required dishes considered creative even by
demanding local standards. The animals' new diet features frozen
popsicles of chicken and beef.
</P>
<P>
   Around Oklahoma City, where Sunday's high was 104, the favored
refuges are shopping malls. The Sooner Fashion Mall in Norman,
south of Oklahoma City, reported a 14 percent increase in visitors
for June and July, with similar increases in sales at many stores.
</P>
<P>
   The busiest business people are those who can fix
air-conditioners. Dewey Osborn, whose Oklahoma City repair company
bears his name, said he had never heard so many cries for help
since he went into business in 1949. With as many as 60 calls by 10
a.m., he has fallen four days behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some callers become hysterical, Osborn said. ``We want the
business,'' he said. ``We just don't want it all at once like
this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This heat wave, however, has chosen Dallas as its home base.
Compounding the heat has been the lack of any significant rainfall
here since early June, turning the earth into a vast radiator.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service predicted no let-up in Dallas or
the region through at least early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mach, a weather service meteorologist, said that with a
mass of heated, high-pressure air refusing to budge, the best hope
was for a tropical storm from the Gulf of Mexico to barrel through.
But nothing of the sort, he said, is in sight. &QL;

   As a matter of pride, many Texans want to prove how well they
can hold up.
</P>
<P>
   As an office temporary, Dachel St. Mary could stretch her salary
only far enough for a single, $15.99 window fan to cool her and her
two children in their three-bedroom apartment. In Texas, she said
Monday, even that purchase was a concession. Before the
air-conditioning era, she said, ``People made it here for hundreds
of years.''
</P>
<P>
   But then her 4-year-old son, Andre, began waking up in the
middle of the night, sweating and vomiting. She had seen on
television that the Salvation Army was among the agencies handing
out fans. So by Monday afternoon, Ms. St. Mary and Andre, who was
sucking from a plastic water bottle his mother had put in the
freezer, were waiting in a Salvation Army lobby for a friend to
take them and two new 20-inch box fans home.
</P>
<P>
   The heat has also forced more of the homeless to seek refuge
indoors. The 266 beds in the Salvation Army's shelter in Dallas
have been filled for the last two weeks, so another 40 people a
night have slept on mats on the shelter's floor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Others on the wrong side of the air-conditioning gap include
cowboys on the region's ranches and those on the football practice
field.
</P>
<P>
   For Ben Morales and the other cowboys he supervises at the
Hester Brite Ranch in West Texas, riding the range in
air-conditioned pickup trucks rather than on horseback hasn't gone
far enough to soften ranching in temperatures as high as 104. The
drought has forced the cowboys to spend extra hours checking pumps,
water lines and tanks, and feeding the cattle protein pellets to
make up for what they're missing from the ground. In a year with
only a third of the normal rainfall, Morales said, a half inch
today, however welcome, will leave the earth dry by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   At the Dallas Cowboys practice camp in Wichita Falls, Texas,
near the Oklahoma border, where the temperature reached 103 on
Sunday, the players have been treated like imperiled cattle.
Doctors and coaches weigh them before and after practice to make
sure they are getting enough fluids.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of practicing with full pads in the afternoon, the
players practice in shorts, helmets and shoulder pads then. They
wear the heavier gear only in the morning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The construction workers rebuilding North Central Expressway in
Dallas have improvised their own gear. Some have ripped apart
sheets and T-shirts to fashion extra sun protection hanging from
their hard hats down the backs of their necks.
</P>
<P>
   The new highway is going in a deep, wide trench, blocking most
breezes but reflecting the sun's glare off the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   Without ice in the concrete, it sets too fast to be shaped and
smoothed. While ice often has to be added in Dallas by midsummer,
this year's 100-degree days began in May.
</P>
<P>
   Cooling down the workers is more of a challenge. The nine-person
crew that includes Hernandez usually goes through six 5-gallon
insulated plastic jugs of water and Gatorade each day. Hernandez
worked along the concrete retaining walls with Sunkist and 7-Up
cans filled with water and within arm's reach.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Lawrence, working nearby, said the experience would improve
his motivation once he returns to Grambling University this fall.
``On days like this,'' he said, ``becoming a lawyer sounds
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   As a state engineer drove up a ramp and away from the trench, he
pointed out a newly planted bald cypress tree that, despite daily
watering, had already turned a lifeless brown.
</P>
<P>
   With few men willing to admit their limits, Arturo Gonzales, a
foreman, has to tactfully suggest to anyone looking faint that they
join him on some errands in his air-conditioned pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   To this heat spell, Gonzales sees only one ultimate solution.
``I'm just waiting for October,'' he said.

NIGERIAN LEADER ANNOUNCES PLANS TO HOLD ELECTIONS NEXT YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to fix quote in 10th graf) (sw) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Pledging democracy but also playing for time,
Nigeria's military government said on Monday that it would hold
elections in the first three months of next year and hand over
power to a civilian president on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar, who took over as president last month,
announced his plans for the creation of what he called ``an
unfettered democracy'' in a speech to the nation that amounted to a
clear rebuke of his predecessor's staggeringly corrupt
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   The president, dressed in full military uniform, said he would
release all political prisoners jailed by the former president,
Gen. Sani Abacha, allow the free formation of political parties,
reinforce the judiciary, permit international monitoring of
elections, reform the prison system and put an end to what he
called ``lapses'' in the management of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   In a thinly-veiled denouncement of Abacha, who died on June 8
with his country in a state of economic collapse and international
isolation, Abubakar said: ``We must admit that mistakes have been
made. In particularly, our most recent attempt at democratization
was marred by maneuvering and manipulation of political
institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Abacha, whose appetite for personal enrichment was matched only
by his ruthlessness in imprisoning his opponents, had made himself
the only candidate for presidential ``elections'' that were to have
been held on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The speech on Monday was clearly designed to convince the United
States and other western governments that a page has been turned in
Africa's most populous nation, and to allay seething anger here at
the death in detention this month of the leading opposition figure,
Moshood Abiola.
</P>
<P>
   But while vowing to eradicate the legacy of Abacha, the new
president opted for caution. Apparently bowing to military hawks
who argue that Nigeria is vulnerable to fragmentation among its
more than 200 ethnic groups, he rebuffed opposition calls for a
handover of power by Oct. 1 to a civilian government of national
unity that would organize elections.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the formation of such a government would be ``full
of pitfalls and dangers,'' and potentially unrepresentative because
it would not be elected, Abubakar said, ``We will not substitute
one undemocratic system for another''. He added that his
administration ``has no desire whatsoever to succeed itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That commitment may not convince many Nigerians. Democracy has
repeatedly been dangled before the 105 million citizens of this
country, a seemingly eternal mirage in sight but out of reach. It
is inevitable that the general's pledge to leave office in 10
months will be doubted until it happens.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some opposition figures were inclined to hold fire. ``The
date of May 29 is by no means as short a time as some of us have
asked,'' said Clement Nwankwo, an opposition lawyer. ``But if the
date is really respected, then it may be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The program outlined by Abubakar appeared broadly in line with
suggestions made by the Clinton administration, which was skeptical
of the idea of a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 10-month extension of military rule is perhaps
longer than American officials here had expected or favored, the
administration has been inclined toward caution in a country with
muti-billion-dollar American investments in the oil industry.
Nigeria is the fifth largest provider of oil to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Abiola, the opposition leader whose apparent
victory in the last presidential election in 1993 was annulled by
the armed forces, has sharpened Nigeria's pent-up demand for an end
to military rule and accentuated ethnic tensions in the country.
Abiola was from the southern Yoruba tribe, and the general who
canceled the elections was from the North.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar spoke respectfully of Abiola, but said calls for a
return to the past were ``unhelpful and impractical.'' He urged
Nigerians to move forward ``with confidence in the present and hope
in the future''.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who attended several military training programs
in the United States, said he would scrap the electoral commission
set up by his predecessor and create a new and independent one that
would be empowered to organize ``free and fair elections'' fought
by new political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the existing five political parties are hereby
dissolved,'' Abubakar said, referring to the groups created by
Abacha to back his plan to succeed himself, ``and their assets will
be taken over by administrators.'' The new parties, he added, would
be free to form and organize themselves without any military
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Elections for regional governments held under Abacha were also
scrapped because of ``their widespread lack of credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at a time when ethnic suspicions are intense in
Nigeria, Abubakar warned against the formation of parties along
ethnic lines. He urged all politicians to narrow their differences
and work for ``the formation of parties with a national
following.''
</P>
<P>
   It was far from clear that this call would be heeded at a time
when the Yorubas feel cheated by Abiola's death and convinced that
the next leader should come from their tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Many Yorubas say that the eventual election of somebody from the
northern Hausa or Falani tribes, which have tended to dominate
military governments, would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The armed forces have long argued that their continued
occupation of power was necessary to hold the country together. But
the debacle of Abacha's rule, the ruin of a potentially prosperous
economy and the move to democratic governments across Africa
appears to have reluctantly convinced many Nigerian officers that
power must now be ceded to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In one his most potentially significant promises, Abubakar said
his administration would ``breathe into the conduct of government a
fresh air of accountability.'' He demanded that ``all public
officers demonstrate transparency and uprightness in the conduct of
government.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before his speech, Abubakar announced that he had pardoned and
would release 10 prisoners sentenced in what Abacha had called a
1995 coup plot. Those to be freed included three prominent
journalists _ Ben Charles Obi of the now defunct magazine Weekend
Classique, George Mba of Tell Magazine and Kule Ajibade, the editor
of The New Tempo.
</P>
<P>
   However no mention was made of two other journalists, Niran
Malaolu and Bagauda Kalto, who are still in prison. Widespread
rumors suggest that Kalto may have been killed by the Abacha
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Abubakar did not name a new cabinet to replace the one dismissed
earlier this month, but indicated he would try to bring a wide
spectrum of Nigerian politicians into the government.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many critical questions hanging over the transition
plan announced on Monday is what constitution will govern it.
Abubakar suggested that a constitution formulated under Abacha but
never promulgated may be approved by his military government after
being presented to Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
   This constitution is said by officials who have seen it to call
for a system whereby the presidency would rotate between different
regions of the country, and so between different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But how such a system would work in practice remains as unclear
as the ultimate ambitions of a Nigerian army that has never stopped
promising democracy but has ruled for all but 10 years since the
country achieved independence from Britain in 1960.

FLORIDA ARENA FOOTBALL FRANCHISE OWNER BUYS TEXAS RANCH MANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (ATTN: Fla.) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1997 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARNES CITY, Texas _ Woody Kern, a big-fisted, barrel-chested
North Texas man with an Arena football franchise and an ample
wallet, is the new owner of the Veladi Ranch mansion, about 50
miles south of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The massive 4-story, 30,000-square-foot antebellum-style home
fell under the auctioneer's gavel for the unexpectedly low price of
$3.375 million on Monday. With the auctioneer's fee added, the
final sale price of the house and its 240 acres was $3.628 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' Kern said after the auction.
</P>
<P>
   Kern and his wife, Sheri, now live on their horse ranch in Pilot
Point, Texas, north of Fort Worth. He owns the Tampa Bay Storm of
the Arena Football League, but started in arena football in 1993
with the Fort Worth Cavalry, which played for one season.
</P>
<P>
   The auction lasted only a half-hour or so, after an afternoon of
food and music around the estate's 110,000-gallon solar-heated
pool. An estimated 400-plus guests joined the pre-auction party.
Nearly 200 of them were special guests of Veladi Ranch owner Arturo
Torres.
</P>
<P>
   The actual auction started 45 minutes late. Nine bidders put up
$100,000 cashier's checks to participate in the bidding, which
started at $2.5 million. By the time bidding reached $3 million,
all had dropped out except Kern and two other North Texans, Renee
Jones and Paula Thompson, who worked together, staying within
$25,000 of Kern.
</P>
<P>
   After auctioneer Eddie Haynes dropped the final gavel, Kern was
asked just how high he was willing to go. He pointed to figures on
an envelope with ``$3,500,000'' circled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has spoken,'' said William Bone, president of The
National Auction Group, the Alabama-based company that conducted
the afternoon sale. Although Torres has never revealed how much it
cost him to build his mansion, Bone guessed it was at least $15
million. Other estimates were as high as $18 million.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who sat at a table with family and friends as the
auction took place near the pool, made his fortune with a string of
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell franchises. At one time, he had the largest
individually owned chain of Pizza Hut franchises in the country. He
sold them to PepsiCo in 1991 for $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   He now owns a toy manufacturing company and a string of Veladi
Ranch Steak Houses.
</P>
<P>
   Torres said he and his family had just returned from an
around-the-world trip that took them to Rome, Spain, England and
China. They were gone for a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very nice trip, but I still have a little jet lag,''
Torres said. ``We got back last night about 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was satisfied with the selling price, Torres simply
shrugged his shoulders and said, ``It's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, who came to the United States as a refugee from Castro's
Cuba in the early 1960s, said he was ready for the gamble of an
absolute auction. Once an absolute auction begins, the property
must be sold to the highest bidder. There is no backing out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gambled all my life,'' he said. ``I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would certainly miss the place. ``But the fun part
was building it,'' he said. ``I will be tickled for somebody to buy
it. I am ready for a different phase in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The 61-year-old Torres suffered a stroke in January and decided
to sell the mansion and stay closer to his home in San Antonio and
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Kern said he is hoping the acquisition of his new property might
coincide with an additional Arena Football franchise in San
Antonio. He said the league is thinking about allowing dual
ownerships and he would like to have a South Texas team. He said he
is talking with city officials.

   During the fourth day of Graham's capital murder trial, a
forensic investigator testified that blood residue found in the car
of Diane Zamora, who was Graham's fiancee at the time, indicates
that more than one attacker was involved in Jones' slaying in
December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, a Fort Worth surgeon, told jurors that Zamora
had a surgical pin in a finger of her left hand at the time of the
slaying and that she would have been incapable of inflicting
finger-shaped bruises to Jones' neck in the manner described by a
previous expert witness.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the testimony, defense attorney Dan Cogdell said, his
argument that Graham was not present for Jones' beating and
shooting death is still viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned today that not everything comes out exactly as you
originally planned, but things work out,'' Cogdell said outside the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 20, faces life in prison if convicted of capital murder.
Zamora is serving a life sentence at a Gatesville women's prison
after she was convicted in February for her role in Jones' slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Graham and Zamora conspired to kill
Jones after Graham claimed that he had sex with Jones, a Mansfield
High School sophomore. According to previous witnesses, Graham and
Zamora lured Jones to a secluded southwest Grand Prairie road,
where Zamora struck her on the head and Graham shot her twice.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination by Cogdell, forensic investigator Max
Courtney testified that blood splatter marks in the rear of
Zamora's car could have been made by someone throwing blood-soaked
clothing into the back seat, rather than being made by a second
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concede the point that after the murder, David Graham
assisted Diane Zamora in the cleaning up of the evidence and the
disposing of the evidence,'' Cogdell said outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon, Dr. Scott Kasden, testified under cross-examination
that Zamora might have inflicted the bruises to Jones' neck if
Jones had been lying down and if Zamora was aided by the weight of
her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not useless, but her functionality was markedly
diminished,'' Kasden said, referring to Zamora's injured hand.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora received the injury about two months before Jones' death
while she was driving Graham's pickup and lost control. The pickup
flipped and landed on her hand, which was hanging out an open
window.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during testimony, Cogdell removed his tie,
unbuttoned his shirt and had an assistant grab his neck with her
right hand. Cogdell then used an ink pen to mark his neck where the
finger marks might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Examining the marks, Kasden said that he is not convinced that
the bruises were made by left-hand fingers, as previously stated by
a Tarrant County medical investigator, or even by fingers on the
right hand. Kasden later acknowledged that he had no expertise in
forensic science.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Kasden testified as a defense witness in Zamora's
trial. At that time, Zamora's attorneys argued unsuccessfully that
her hand was too weak to attack Jones, while prosecutors charged
that Zamora was fit enough to pass a Naval Academy physical a short
time later.

CRUISE SHIP CATCHES FIRE OFF FLORIDA COAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: MEXICO, Fla.)  (js) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A cruise ship with more than 3,495 people on board
caught fire shortly after leaving the port of Miami Monday
afternoon, generating huge clouds of dark smoke before U.S. Coast
Guard vessels came to the rescue and doused the flames.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported on board the Carnival Cruise line
vessel Ecstasy, which was scheduled to sail first to Key West, Fla.
and then to Cozumel, Mexico, on a four-day trip. The giant ship,
855-feet long and with nine passenger decks, halted less than two
miles off Miami Beach, where it remained until Coast Guard tugboats
towed it back to port this evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no plans to evacuate anyone,'' said Jeff Murphy, a
spokesman for the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Local television stations spoke by cellular telephone with
several people on board, who reported that after some initial
alarm, passengers put on life jackets and lined up in an orderly
fashion on upper decks at the front of the vessel. As one passenger
spoke to reporters, a voice over a loudspeaker could be heard
warning that ``no one is allowed to leave the lounge.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers said that the aft area of the vessel caught fire
almost as soon as the ship, which is registered in Liberia, left
port. The affected area, several decks high and about four porthole
windows deep, was said to house the ship's main laundry room and to
be full of towels and flammable cleaning substances.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was visible both from buildings in downtown Miami and
from the beach, drawing curious onlookers to the balconies of
apartment buildings and out of chic South Beach restaurants onto
the sand. Powerful jets of water could be seen pouring from the
half-dozen or so tugboats that were sent to put out the blaze and
remained on the scene for more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the vessel's crew of more than 900 initially
attempted to douse the fire, but were driven back by the intensity
of the flames. According to local news reports, they closed thick
firedoors as they withdrew, an action that prevented the fire from
spreading to the heart of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   The fire aboard the Ecstasy is not the first one. On July 25,
1995, the Ecstasy had an electrical fire while sailing home to
Miami. One of its two engines was shut down, but there were no
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dickinson, president of Carnival Cruise Lines, said
passengers could stay on board until they made other travel
arrangements, but those who wanted to leave would be helped with
hotel and air plans, according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Dickinson said the cost of the cruise would be refunded and
passengers could take a free cruise in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Ecstasy was within two miles of shore, it was still
under the jurisdiction of the captain of the port, who ordered the
ship to anchorage, said Lt. Cmdr. Pat Philbin, at Coast Guard
headquarters in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard inspects cruise ships like the Ecstasy every six
months or so, Philbin said. ``During the course of those
inspections, we actually require them to go through fire drills and
boat-lowering drills,'' he said. ``We also check for structural
integrity, to make sure in the event that they have a fire, they're
able to contain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Standard procedure, he said, is to seal off the area with a fire
to stop it from spreading, and then figure out how to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin said, ``The thing that sailors fear most at sea is a
fire, because there's just no where to go.'' Engine rooms, galleys
and ``anywhere where there is a source of heat'' are vulnerable to
fires, he said.

   Kile draws heat from Rockies fans, media
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ALAN TRUEX &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Prior to Monday night's game in the Astrodome, fans were leaning
over the roof of the visitors' dugout, pleading with Darryl Kile
for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the way you treated me last time,'' the pitcher said,
smiling, ``I'm not signing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hard feelings obviously remained from his previous
homecoming, when many Houstonians let him know they didn't
appreciate his abandoning their city in favor of Denver _ and a $24
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   In his second start for the Colorado Rockies in April, Kile lost
6-2 in the Dome. The fans booed him as he strolled to the bullpen
to warm up, and they hooted at him throughout a 40-pitch second
inning, when he allowed three walks and five runs, three of which
scored on a double by pitcher Shane Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Kile was hoping to redeem himself Monday, when he originally was
scheduled to face Reynolds again in the opener of the last series
between the Astros and Rockies this season. But his start was moved
up because of a blister on the pitching hand of John Thomson. So
Kile pitched Sunday at Arizona, departing in the seventh inning
with a 4-3 lead. The Rockies eventually lost 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about missing his Astrodome opportunity, Kile told Denver
reporters, ``I'm not going to lie and say I didn't want to beat
them. I want to beat them bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile was one of the first players to arrive at the park Monday,
and he chatted with his former teammates and ended up signing a few
autographs for the fans. But he tried to dodge Houston media _
something he rarely did during his seven years here.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, he's not eager to discuss a season in which he's
6-12 with a 5.26 ERA. He's a threat to become the major leagues'
first 20-game loser since 1980. He recently lost eight consecutive
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In his most recent outing at Coors, he was loudly booed for
lasting only three innings while losing 8-7 to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   He also has taken some fire from the Colorado media. Mark
Kiszla, columnist for the Denver Post, interpreted Kile's stoic
nature as a lack of passion. ``Kile has buried his personality so
deep,'' Kiszla wrote, ``nobody in Denver can see if he has a
pulse.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Kile, he has pitched well during many of his
losses. He is still the Rockies' ace. He ranks in the National
League's top 10 in innings with 143. Always the willing workhorse,
he has started twice this season on three days' rest instead of the
usual four days.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, he has had to deal with Coors Field, the Bermuda
Triangle for pitchers. Most baseball observers were surprised any
successful pitcher _ and Kile was 19-7 last year _ would go to
Colorado on his own volition. The oxygen-deprived mile-high
elevation keeps pitches from sinking and makes fly balls soar
abnormal distances.
</P>
<P>
   Kile intended to debunk the Coors curse, but he has been proved
as mortal as anyone. He's 1-5 with a 7.35 ERA at Coors Field, where
his best pitch, his curveball, lacks its usual sharp dive.
</P>
<P>
   His pitching coach, Frank Funk, believes he will yet conquer
Coors, that it's just a matter of varying the angles and speeds of
his curve and regaining command of his fastball. The 30-year-old
righthander has returned to the wild ways of his younger days. He
leads the league with 76 walks.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies outfielder Dante Bichette said, ``Maybe his stuff won't
work in Denver as well as other places. But eventually, that kind
of talent has to come through.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Kile decided to leave Houston was to show he
was not just a product of manager Larry Dierker's
confidence-boosting tutelage.
</P>
<P>
   Kile last week told Denver reporters he appreciated all the
Astros had done for him, but he added, ``I'd like to beat them or
pitch well to kind of close the door and say, `Maybe I can do it on
my own now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he can. But the proof will have to wait until next year.

GROUP PROPOSES GUIDELINES FOR INTERNET PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a continuing effort to head off new laws
governing how companies can collect and use personal information
gathered on the Internet about consumers, an industry coalition on
Monday proposed a voluntary enforcement program to certify World
Wide Web sites that comply with privacy guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan offered by the Online Privacy Alliance, Web sites
that comply with the group's guidelines could display a seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   While privacy advocates said the measure fell far short of the
level of enforcement that is needed, the Clinton administration,
which has been critical of the electronic commerce industry's
initial progress in policing itself, applauded the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the enforcement mechanisms that they are putting in
place are what we have been calling for,'' said Ira Magaziner,
President Clinton's top adviser on electronic commerce. ``Now what
we need to do is monitor it to see that it really happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was shown privately to administration officials
Monday. It will be publicly disclosed on Tuesday at a congressional
hearing on online privacy. Several recent polls have indicated that
privacy is the No. 1 concern for Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed enforcement policy calls for appointing a third
party to monitor compliance with the guidelines, which, among other
things, require that consumers be told in advance what information
is being collected and what it will used for. It would also
establish a system to resolve consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a former Federal Trade Commission member who
is working with the coalition, said, ``To increase consumer
confidence in cyberspace, companies need to have an independent and
trusted third party validate compliance with clearly stated
policies and confirm that companies are engaged in credible
self-regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   But some privacy advocates said the proposal did not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concerns that the whole process of the alliance is
voluntary, that it is a self-selecting pool of Web sites willing to
engage in fair marketing practices,'' said Jeff Chester, spokesman
for the Center for Media Education, a nonprofit children's advocacy
organization in Washington. ``This scheme does not protect all
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC earlier this year surveyed 1,400 Web sites and issued a
report that found private-sector initiatives seriously lagging,
especially regarding information collected from and about children.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the commission recommended that legislation be
passed to protect children from online marketers. Several bills
have emerged, including a proposal by Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., that
would give the FTC the authority to write and enforce rules for
protecting children on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While support for mandatory protections for children is almost
universal, business and privacy groups are divided over whether
laws are needed to cover adults.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Online Privacy Alliance, representing 50 companies and
marketing groups, is leading the push for self-regulation. Last
month, it released a set of privacy guidelines on the eve of a
meeting called by the Department of Commerce to assess
self-regulation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department is drafting a report for Clinton on
whether self-regulation is working.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce officials lauded the alliance's goals but chastised
companies for not having self-enforcement plans in place. Monday's
proposal attempts to answer that concern. The program would include
periodic reviews of companies' practices and a complaint-resolution
system for consumers.

IN A REVERSAL, CHINA WILL ALLOW A RESUMPTION OF AMWAY SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (js) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   China has backtracked from a blanket ban it imposed on direct
selling to consumers just three months ago, allowing Amway Corp. to
resume operations there.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of the order comes as a surprise, given the
vehemence with which Beijing officials defended the ban when it was
ordered this spring. The government said at the time that the
direct-selling operations functioned as financial pyramid schemes
and contributed to social unrest.
</P>
<P>
   But the reversal illustrates a reality of doing business in
China, where negotiations often take place only after the summary
passage of laws and regulations. Exceptions to new rules are often
allowed after they are instituted.
</P>
<P>
   Amway, based in Ada, Mich., was the largest direct seller in
China, with roughly 70,000 independent sales agents nationwide and
about $180 million in sales last year. It protested the ban,
lobbying with both the U.S. and Chinese governments to reverse the
order, company officials said. The company won approval for its new
business plan earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The plan requires some modifications in the way that Amway
operates, company officials said. Amway's agents will no longer
purchase the company's household products before reselling them to
consumers. Instead, the agents will act as conventional
salespeople, earning a commission on sales to the users without
taking financial risks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's crucial is that they have allowed us to retain our
independent sales force and to continue to make direct sales,''
Amway's chairman, Steve Van Andel, said.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxation of Chinese rules in this case will not
necessarily help other direct sellers. The new order requires that
direct-sales companies invest at least $10 million in China and
that they maintain similar operations in other countries, a test
that many companies that prospered before the ban are unlikely to
pass.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In virtually every way _ including the size of
their family _ John and Paula Lawrence are quintessentially middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   They live in a white brick colonial home in the verdant upper
Northwest section of Washington. He's a commercial real estate
lender; she's an audiologist. Their daughter, Candice, 12, attends
private school, plays violin in a citywide youth orchestra and
studies origami. Their son, John Paul, 6, has yet to develop the
patience needed for such pursuits, but his parents are confident
that, in time, he will.
</P>
<P>
   The Lawrences, who devote a lot of time and energy and love to
their children, are adamant that they will have only two.
</P>
<P>
   In their decision to limit the size of their family, the
Lawrences are an example of a little-noticed, but striking trend in
the nation's black population: a steep decline in the birth rate
for married African-American couples. Married black women gave
birth to 357,262 babies in 1970. But, by 1996, the last year for
which complete figures were available, that figure had dropped to
179,568, a decline of nearly 50 percent, nearly twice the drop in
the birth rate among married white women.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the reasons for the sharp drop in child bearing among
black women are universal _ higher family incomes, more education,
movement away from parents and relatives who can provide support
and child care. As more black families move up the economic ladder,
they are following the well-worn path of other ethnic groups and
reducing the size of their families.
</P>
<P>
   But some who have studied the phenomenon also say the slowdown
in the birth rate among two-parent black families is caused by some
forces not found in the larger white community. Black couples often
want to maximize the benefits they can give to their children so
that the offspring will have a better chance to compete in a
society the parents feel is racist, these expert say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to numerous African-American parents who really
are very serious about making sure their children are having rich,
rewarding experiences so that they start like with an advantage,
and not disadvantage,'' said Dr. William Turner, professor of
family studies at the University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   This sharp drop in the birth rate for black married couples has
had another equally significant, and surprising effect: It has
contributed to the appearance of what has been described as a
``crisis'' of illegitimacy within the black population, where the
percentage of births to mothers out of wedlock is approaching 70
percent. The number of single black women bearing children has
increased dramatically, rising to 415,213 in 1996 from 215,100 in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   Statisticians and demographers note that the startlingly high
percentage of black children born outside marriage is not the
result of more and more single black women giving birth. Indeed,
the percentage of single black women who have given birth has been
declining since 1989, and it reached a 40-year low in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the high proportion of black babies being born out of
wedlock is now mainly a function of its statistical comparison to
the steep drop in the number of children being born to married
black women.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the trend means that married black couples, whose
median household income is rapidly approaching parity with their
white counterparts, are able to give their children more of the
advantages of enhanced economic status: better housing, higher
quality schools, more material goods, more opportunities for travel
and cultural enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either one of us ever thought in terms of having
three or four kids,'' said Lawrence. ``I didn't have any fast or
hard ideas not to. I don't think Paula had any fast and hard ideas
not to. But I don't think we ever really contemplated more than
two.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But experts warn that since incomes for single black mothers
remain stagnant and their birth rates have not slowed as rapidly,
the sharp decline in the percentage of married black families
having children could widen the class divisions within the black
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think that the potential for these rifts to be
exacerbated is terrific,'' said Turner. ``Unless there is some
constructive, meaningful dialogue and some organizations that are
strong in the black community get involved and deal with this in a
meaningful way, I think you will see those rifts grow even more and
more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity of birth rates between married and unmarried women
is a subject that causes discomfort among the several black
families interviewed. Some expressed concern that not enough
married African-American couples are having children, though that
criticism is directed toward those who are childless, rather than
those who have only one or two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that many times,'' said Paula Jackson McClain
manager of federal disability programs for the Washington public
schools. ``We have so many young black girls having babies who
really can't afford to have them. It's a shame that our black
families who have two-parent homes and the economic resources to
provide for their children aren't having any children. If you're
not having children, how can you say what our future will look
like? If the numbers are coming from parents who are too young, or
don't have the same educational drive and don't reinforce that in
their children, then we're kind of letting down our own race.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip and Brenda Woods Francis have two sons, ages 11 and 7. The
couple lived for a time in Zaire (now Congo), and Francis said that
the help provided by others there might have allowed them to have a
larger family.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had not returned to the United States, we might have had
three, maybe, four children,'' said Francis, 46, who is director of
AIDS Research for the National Institute of Drug Abuse. ``Comparing
living there with living here, the biggest difference is
infrastructure and support system. When we lived in Zaire, we could
literally say we need to go away for two years, and the neighbors
would take the child or children and take care of them until you
come back.''

   Wanda Newman, 44, a teacher in the Prince Georges County, Md.,
public schools, has only one sister. But her husband, Dominic, 45,
a ground maintenance foreman for the U.S. Parks Service, is one of
13 children. The couple have two sons, ages 19 and 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can produce two responsible adults, I'm happy,'' Ms.
Newman said. ``If they can go to college, get out and work, have a
solid religious background, I don't feel bad about not having any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Among several families interview, the women said that small
family sized has become such an accepted norm, that hardly anyone
even talks about it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only one I've ever spoke with about it was a friend of
mine who has four kids,'' said Ms. McClain, 36, the mother a
9-year-old and a 1-year-old. ``When she was expecting her fourth
child, she said to me that only one person ever really
congratulated her. Usually people's response to the news was, Well,
I'm happy for you, if that's what you want.' It was as if she had
done something inappropriate and not something you should be
jubilant over.''

BOURSE WILL TRY TO CREATE RIVAL EUROPEAN MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Paris stock exchange, bitter about its exclusion from
negotiations to form an all-European stock market centered in
London and Frankfurt, Germany, plans to form a competing market.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris exchange, commonly known as the Bourse, is the
third-largest financial market in Europe. It said it wanted to
enlist stock exchanges in Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and
elsewhere, perhaps even the New York Stock Exchange, to create a
single market that could seamlessly trade stocks across the
Continent and in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to enlist others, which is in the exploratory stage,
has not yet yielded any alliances. It was first announced by
Jean-Francois Theodore, chairman of the Bourse, in European
newspaper interviews over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big market like Europe can support two competing stock
exchanges,'' Theodore was quoted as saying in The Financial Times.
``We will use the summer to build it carefully and bring it forward
in the autumn.'' Theodore was not available Monday for interviews,
the Bourse said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came two weeks after the London and Frankfurt
exchanges, the two largest in Europe, said they would form an
alliance aimed at creating an all-European market in time for the
January start of the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over whether a European stock exchange can be formed
is part of a flurry of merger and consolidation activity going on
in Europe and the United States as the world's financial exchanges
test new trading systems and prepare for a time when there could be
a global electronic trading network.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, dealings in stocks and derivatives have become
largely electronic, and competition is fierce. Now, with the
approach of the euro, stock and futures exchanges, if not
competing, are tying the knot.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Britain and Germany said their stock-exchange
partnership would be open to other European markets.
</P>
<P>
   But representatives of the Bourse criticized it almost
immediately, saying that London and Frankfurt intended to be pilots
offering seats to only a few passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Nathalie Boschat, a spokeswoman for the Bourse, said that
although the London and Frankfurt exchanges had said they were
opening the alliance to others, they would not discuss the
exchange's trading system, governors and rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't open talks to anyone else in Europe,'' Ms. Boschat
said. ``This doesn't sound very open to us; that's not our idea of
a real pan-European platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Muncer, a spokesman for the London Stock Exchange, said
Monday that no one had been locked out and that Paris or any other
stock exchange in Europe was welcome to join. But he also said that
the London and Frankfurt markets would decide in the next six
months how such a system would work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although no other exchange has come forward to join with Paris,
the New York Stock Exchange said Monday in a statement that it is
``exploring opportunities to partner with the Paris Bourse as well
as with other exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts emphasized that despite the bickering, the world's
financial exchanges were moving rapidly toward globalization and
that the Paris market's dispute with the London and Frankfurt
exchanges was a small matter in a larger movement.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Ms. Boschat said, would be a kind of ``one-stop
shopping'' for global investors.
</P>
<P>
   European monetary union, she added, ``is going to create a vast
unified market zone, and big investors will invest on a big, global
basis.''

DOCTOR IS ENMESHED IN CONTROVERSY IN PHOENIX AND CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER, JODIE SNYDER AND HEATHER RADCLIFFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It only takes a few miles for the stately homes and
towering trees of Dr. John Biskind's neighborhood to fade into a
rundown stretch of plain commercial buildings that house abortion
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Biskind, a Cleveland gynocologist, has lived in one
type of world and worked in the other _ both here and in the
Phoenix area _ performing as many as 700 abortions a year.
</P>
<P>
   Now both of Biskind's worlds are swirling with controversy.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, the 72-year-old doctor stands accused in two
lawsuits of practicing with a man who allegedly passed himself off
as an abortion doctor for years and sexually assaulted numerous
patients _ after having his medical license yanked in six states.
</P>
<P>
   In the Phoenix area, where Biskind and his wife own a home in a
gated Scottsdale community, he remains the target of a police
investigation after attempting to abort a 37-week-old baby that he
then delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind also is being investigated in connection with the April
case of a woman who bled to death after he performed her abortion.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the state medical board voted to suspect his medical
license, pending a hearing before an administrative law judge.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Biskind has received such official
attention. Despite solid educational credentials and a decades-long
practice, Biskind's medical career has been marked by repeated
allegations of negligence _ whether in private practice or
performing abortions at clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Biskind nor family members have responded to repeated
attempts for comment, including phone calls and correspondence, to
his Cleveland or Scottsdale homes.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ``independant contractor'' in Arizona and a
doctor who once had a substantial gynecological practice in
Cleveland, Biskind has shuttled between the two states for at least
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have worked with him describe him alternately as a
quiet, competent professional _ and as a doctor who is distant
toward patients and difficult to work with.
</P>
<P>
   One former Phoenix colleague called him a ``conscientious doctor
who tried to do good work.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a worker at a Cleveland-area abortion clinic
said the clinic was forced to stop using his services.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was brusque,'' the employee said. ``I do remember some
staff feeling that they would not work with him any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stopped scheduling him.''
</P>
<P>
   The two colleagues, like most others, agreed to talk about
Biskind only on the promise of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Kimball, a registered nurse who worked with Biskind at
A-Z Women's Center in Phoenix, said he has little interaction with
patients outside the operating room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really have much tolerance for people who got into
this kind of condition and come in for an abortion as a method of
birth control,'' Kimball said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by several accounts, Biskind worked for years in clinics
and private hospitals, providing abortions.
</P>
<P>
   His recent legal troubles in Cleveland stem from his association
with the now-defunct Academy Medical Center and Nabil Ghali.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuits, filed in 1997, Biskind is alleged to have
conspired with Ghali to defraud and mislead women coming to the
clinic for abortions and other procedures. Ghali, who owned the
clinic, allegedly practiced there illegally for three years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 women claim that Ghali performed illegal medical
procedures on them, and sometimes sexually assaulted them _ all
while Biskind and another doctor did nothing to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher Ernst, a lawyer for Biskind, said there is no
proof of wrongdoing by his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the plaintiffs) cannot even say that Biskind was on the
premises on the day these abortions took place,'' Ernst said.
``There's also no proof of any damage to these women.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no proof that he's (Biskind) done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Biskind, a World War II veteran and graduate of the respected
Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, has devoted
more than 40 years to practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents and medical board records, he
worked from suburban Cleveland medical offices and also had staff
privileges at several area hospitals. Biskind said he served as the
director of obstetrics and gynecology at one of them, Meridia
Hillcrest Hospital in Cleveland, for six years.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for at least two abortion clinics in the Cleveland
area, and at hospitals that provided elective abortions.
</P>
<P>
   One doctor who provides abortions and worked briefly at a clinic
with Biskind said, ``He appeared to handle himself in a
professional manner and treated his patients in a reasonable
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   From most accounts, Biskind kept a low-profile providing
abortions, and did not publicly join the abortion debate.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastor Ernie Sanders, founder of Cleveland's Missionaries to
the Unborn, recalls Biskind's reaction after protests were held
outside Hillcrest Hospital to stop doctors from performing
abortions. In 1993, the hosptial board eventually voted to prohibit
the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biskind was very outspoken about that,'' Sanders said. ``He
was very angry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, Biskind also served as a clinical instructor for
his alma mater and taught reproductive biology to students based at
Mt. Sinai Medical Center, which is affiliated with the university.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind and his wife made a home in the wealthy Cleveland suburb
of Beachwood, set in a lush wooded neighborhood that offers
privacy, peaceful views and, neighbors said, the perfect place for
the couple to walk their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Though neighbors said the couple has lived in the home for a
decade or more, they knew little about them and rarely spoke.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, the couple has also kept a winter home in
the Phoenix area. Most recently, they've lived in a home valued at
$220,000 in the gated Mountainview Lake Estates in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind came to the A-Z Women's Center after responding to an ad
in a medical magazine, and said he worked part-time for the clinic
and Planned Parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Michelle, who didn't want her last name used, said
Biskind performed an abortion on her earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Before the termination began, Michelle said she asked the doctor
what he would be doing, and he wouldn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only words he said to me was, `You are going to have to
scoot down more,'''she said. ``I tried to introduce myself to him,
and he couldn't have cared less. He didn't even want to talk to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Biskind has been the target of 11
malpractice, negligence or wrongful death lawsuits. A twelfth is
expected to be filed by a Phoenix lawyer representing the family of
a woman who died after receiving an abortion from Biskind.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the lawsuits have been settled, five have been dismissed
by the plaintiffs and two are still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Arizona medical board has taken disciplinary
action against Biskind three times _ for the death of a patient in
his care in 1995, for inappropriately prescribing medication in
1990, and for a near-abortion in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The board is investigating another death of a patient in his
care in April, and a June 30 incident involving a near-abortion.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the allegations against Biskind are serious
questions about Biskind's judgment and care of patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the June case, for example, peers and others wonder how an
ultrasound could show the woman to be 23 weeks pregnant when she
was actually 37 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultrasound is precise, that's why we use it,'' said Dr. Robert
Tamis, who performs abortions in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The story has quickly spread through clinics nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really amazes people is how the delivery happened,'' said
Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of National Council of Abortion
Providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is really stunning.'' &QL;

ARIZONA BOARD SUSPENDS LICENSE OF ABORTION DOCTOR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Calling Dr. John Biskind a danger to public health,
the state medical board Monday unanimously voted to suspend the
license of the Scottsdale abortion doctor who is also being
investigated by Phoenix police and the Maricopa County Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   The board's action means Biskind won't be able to practice
medicine in Arizona pending a hearing into why one of his patients
died and why Biskind attempted to abort a 37-week baby.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kazan, Biskind's attorney, said Monday that the doctor
denied all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind welcomes the investigation because he has already been
``tried and convicted in the newspaper,'' Kazan told the medical
board.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to reach Biskind for comment have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Arizona Board of Medical Examiners expressed
disbelief as they questioned how LouAnne Herron, one of Biskind's
patients, bled to death from a punctured uterus in April and how
Biskind misdiagnosed the fetus' age in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible not to be able to distinguish a 23-week
pregnancy from a 37-week pregnancy,'' said Dr. Edward Sattenspiel,
a board member and Phoenix obstetrician and gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have medical students who know how to do this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patrick Connell, an emergency room physician and board
member, said that based on independent medical records, Herron, 33,
had been indistress for awhile before she was taken to the
emergency room at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient was abandoned and left essentially to die over the
three hours,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind, 72, will have his hearing in 30 to 60 days. After that,
his case will be sent back to BOMEX for action, including possible
revocation.
</P>
<P>
   Kazan didn't present Biskind's side at the hearing because he
didn't have enough time to prepare the case since he only got word
of the hearing on Thursday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Biskind has already voluntarily stopped doing procedures at A-Z
Womens' Clinic, Kazan said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one medical-board member wanted to know why A-Z wasn't
being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that we are doing nothing to stop this clinic and
everything is going on this doctor's head,'' said Carole Dooley,
one of the board's two lay members.
</P>
<P>
   ``His people waited to ask him before they called 911,'' Dooley
said. ``It is very obvious that this clinic is very, very
incompetent,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistance of Dooley and Debra Barnes, a board member who
is a registered nurse, the board agreed to look into other doctors
who are working at A-Z.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, County Attorney Rick Romley said Monday his office
will continue their investigation into Biskind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost an individual on the table,'' Romley said. ``If
we find the facts, we will prosecute.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to prosecute the case, investigators must determine
that this is more than medical malpractice, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To prove homicide, there must be evidence that Biskind knowingly
violated the law when he aborted overage fetuses, Romley said. He
also will investigate whether the clinic and its employees violated
procedures required by state statute when performing an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Romley also said his office is also investigating whether the
state Board of Medical Examiners acted appropriately in the case.
</P>
<P>
   State statute requires the board to report any potential
criminal violations that occur involving the delivery of health
services. The statute, however, does not provide for any penalties
if the board did break the law by not reporting it to law
enforcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's suspension is the first time in at least five years
that the board summarily suspended a physician's license, but
Biskind has shown a pattern of negligent behavior, said Michael
Harrison, assistant attorney general representing BOMEX.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Biskind was issued a letter of concern after attempting
to perform an abortion on a woman who was 28 weeks pregnant,
instead of about 10 weeks as diagnosed by Biskind.
</P>
<P>
   He received another letter of concern in 1991 for
inappropriately prescribing medication.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1995, when a patient in his care bled to death, the
board censured Biskind for gross negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complications are not unknown. It happens,'' Sattenspiel said.
``It happens in the best of hands but patients don't die.''

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Craig Dollase, one of the local thoroughbred
circuit's youngest trainers, and Chris McCarron, one of its oldest
jockeys, clinched Hollywood Park championships Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dollase, 27-year-old son of veteran trainer Wally Dollase,
saddled 19 winners from 38 starters, including stakes winners Walk
in Time and Reraise, in the 67-day season. Tied for second with 16
were Bob Hess Jr., Ron McAnally and Sandy Shulman.
</P>
<P>
   Shulman could have tied Dollase by going 3 for 3 on closing day
but was winless.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, 43, who took the lead from Corey Nakatani by winning
three stakes Sunday, finished with a 52-50 margin after neither won
a race Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani had a chance to tie until he and Bolero finished third
behind upsetters Victor Espinoza and Drumm Valley in the
late-afternoon Robert K. Kerlan Memorial Handicap. McCarron and
favored Sam's were fourth in that feature race.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park finished its 60th anniversary season with a track
record for average daily wagering, $11 million, up 8 percent from
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman R.D. Hubbard said the increase, which includes money
wagered at California satellites and out of state, more than made
up for 3 percent declines in on-site wagering and attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Del Mar opens its 43-day season Wednesday at 2 p.m.

COMMENTARY: HOPING FOR AN END TO FIRST-NAME MANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is in no way intended to make light of issues
that could not be graver. But why, more and more, are we on a
first-name basis with our laws?
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, legislation about serious matters went by
serious names. The federal gun-control law is called the Brady
Bill, after Ronald Reagan's press secretary, who was shot in 1981.
No one thought that a more folksy Jim's Bill sounded better. But
now we talk about new legislation as though it were an old chum.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it started in New Jersey with ``Megan's Law,'' which
requires a public notice when a convicted sex offender moves into
the neighborhood. Whatever its origin, the practice is spreading
fast.
</P>
<P>
   New York City recently adopted ``Christopher's Law,'' requiring
trigger locks for new guns. For two years New York state has had
``Elisa's Law,'' loosening confidentiality rules in child-abuse
cases, and two weeks ago it got ``Lee-Anne's Law,'' preventing
people who kill their spouses from getting custody or visitation
rights over their children. For months, the state Legislature has
wrangled over the parole-restricting proposal called ``Jenna's
Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Please note with the new eponymic laws that the victim was
either a child (Megan Kanka, Elisa Izquierdo and Christopher
Murphy) or a woman (Lee-Anne Cruz and Jenna Grieshaber). It does
not take an ardent feminist to see that men are accorded greater
dignity. Like James Brady, they get to keep their last names.
</P>
<P>
   This latest fashion in legislation is not universally admired,
even setting aside the gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting a first name on a bill, particularly that of a child,
exaggerates the emotional appeal,'' said Assemblyman Richard
Gottfried, D-Manhattan, who is opposed to Jenna's Law. ``You don't
have to sell people on whether a bill is good or bad. You can just
focus on a victim who's appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the degrading of the public's deliberative
process,'' he said. ``It shortcuts thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps first-name bills were inevitable in a society that has
been Jimmy-fied since President Carter's day, with national leaders
insisting on being called Bill or Al or Bob; disarmingly homey
names for men itching for the power to wipe out the world with the
push of a button.
</P>
<P>
   And fast fading, indeed all but gone, is the time-honored
civility of using last names and honorifics when addressing
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Someone you have never met rings you up and calls you by your
first name, as though you and he were long-lost pals. Before you
dismiss this as a stuffy complaint, listen to Letitia Baldrige, the
etiquette expert. She is convinced that the passion for instant
first-name relationships is misguided, reflecting a false sense of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad, bad, bad,'' Ms. Baldrige said. ``It destroys
deference. It destroys authority. It destroys respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself how you cling to self-respect when you are in a
doctor's office, wrapped in a skimpy gown, and the nurse calls out
your given name to announce that Doctor Smith will see you. Sure,
he gets to be called by his last name and title. Isn't it bad
enough to stand there with your tush hanging out, without the added
first-name abasement?
</P>
<P>
   There may be no turning back, though, not when everyone from
unfamiliar store clerks to telemarketers addresses you by first
name only, not when television personalities are known mainly as
Oprah or Sally or Geraldo. Just wait. Before long, Hollywood will
remake a classic like ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' and call it
something like ``Jeff Does D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   We even have some parents and teachers urging children to call
them by their first names, offering an illusion that egalitarianism
reigns in the family and in the classroom. Schools Chancellor Rudy
Crew, for one, disapproves.
</P>
<P>
   But all may not be lost. Remember the legendary Bruce, as in,
``Hi, I'm Bruce, and I'll be your waiter tonight''? The
hyperfamiliarity that he represented has largely disappeared in New
York. ``It got to be a joke,'' said Tim Zagat, the restaurant
survey publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Meyer, an owner of Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern,
added: ``So many young people in restaurants today are serious
professionals and don't want to be called by their first names. And
guests aren't looking for a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, there is still hope that verbal displays of mutual
respect are not forever gone. At least, that's how Haberman
understands it.

shops like Club 44, on Eighth Avenue near 43rd Street, are starting
to look like anomalies in the cleaned-up Times Square area. It may
be premature to talk about the last days of porn as we know it. The

mandate it expected Monday from a federal appeals court to begin
enforcing a zoning law that could close down most of the city's
adult-oriented businesses. (Librado Romero/New York Times Photo)

SOME OFFICERS MAY HAVE BEEN WRONGLY ACCUSED IN PROSTITUTION
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some of the 20 Manhattan police officers facing
disciplinary action and possible criminal charges for suspected
involvement in a prostitution sex scandal may have been wrongly
accused, law-enforcement investigators said Monday, adding that
other officers from the Midtown South precinct could be implicated
in their places.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation centers on a brothel near Times Square and an
apartment across the street from it that the police and prosecutors
allege had been frequented by some officers in the precinct while
on duty. Prosecutors say that the brothel, at 335 W. 39th St.,
which was raided a year-and-a-half ago, had been active for more
than a decade, catering to garment workers and some police officers
from the precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also say they have footage from video-surveillance
equipment in a local massage parlor showing several officers
demanding sex from women working there.
</P>
<P>
   But several investigators, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said that a few of the 20 officers placed on modified assignments
by the Police Department, some of whose names had been released to
the media, had never been seen entering the brothel and had not
been seen visiting an apartment kept by its madam across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Others went to the apartment, called ``the coop'' by officers,
but were not known to have fraternized with prostitutes there, the
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the investigators said that at least 20 officers
from the precinct were still likely to face criminal charges that
they had falsified financial records by going to the apartment when
they were supposed to have been on patrol, that they had engaged in
official misconduct by having sex with a prostitute while on duty
or that they had committed bribery by accepting sex as payment for
turning a blind eye to the illegal prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 20 is the right number,'' one investigator said. ``It
may not be the 20 who got `modified,' but I think that's the number
we'll end up with.''

<P>
   He added that phone records indicated that at least 10 of the
officers had made phone calls from ``the coop'' to their homes. The
police said that two additional officers originally thought to have
been put on modified duty had not been given such duty.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials would not comment on whether mistakes had been
made when placing some officers on modified duty, with Commissioner
Howard Safir saying only that his department had found the illegal
activity, ``and we're going to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem faced by investigators is that many officers
thought to have used the brothel had been tipped off to the
investigation when it was shut down a year-and-a-half ago and the
department's Internal Affairs Bureau had begun making inquiries
about a police connection to it in the precinct. The point of the
inquiry became more obvious when four officers from the precinct
were placed on modified duty two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, prosecutors were stymied in their efforts to
catch officers at the apartment or wire two officers who had agreed
to cooperate in the investigation. Much of the evidence obtained is
secondhand, from talks with the two officers-turned-informants and
prostitutes who worked in the brothel, officials said.

DAVID NICHOLS, 72, PELVIC-RECONSTRUCTION SURGEON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Mass., Fla., Texas, Va.)  (lb) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. David Nichols, a surgeon whose research on pelvic
reconstruction and incontinence focused attention on the
long-neglected medical needs of women in their 60s, 70s and 80s,
died on Wednesday in his office at Brown University. He was 72 and
lived in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1970s on, Nichols worked successfully to establish a
new medical subspecialty within gynecology that covers the range of
medical problems of older women.
</P>
<P>
   The subspecialty Nichols developed is now known as urogynecology
and pelvic reconstructive surgery. It has in the last five years
become a standard part of training in U.S. medical schools, said
Dr. Donald Coustan, who succeeded Nichols as chairman of the
department of obstetrics and gynecology at Brown and as department
head at Women and Infants' Hospital of Rhode Island, in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He died the way he would have wanted it to be: seeing a
patient in the late afternoon at the Center for Women's Surgery,
which he had created,'' Coustan said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent commercials for diapers for elderly women are evidence
that medical circles and society are bringing problems like
incontinence into the mainstream, as Nichols sought to do. But
Nichols' goal was to eliminate the need for such products by
developing techniques to reconstruct the muscles and tissues of the
pelvic floor, said Dr. Dionysios Veronikis, a gynecologist in St.
Louis who trained under Nichols at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Nichols was an active professor at Brown, having
returned from five years at Harvard, where he was a professor of
obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive medicine and chief of
pelvic reconstructive surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   From 1980 to 1991, as the ob-gyn department chairman at Brown,
he developed new programs in women's oncology and reproductive
endocrinology and fashioned new instruments and surgical approaches
for some of the most complex areas of women's health, Coustan said.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Nichols' practice would be a woman in her 70s,
incontinent, with genital prolapse, in which pelvic organs drop and
sometimes protrude through the vaginal opening. He would provide
urinary reconstructive pelvic surgery, which was his specialty and
about which he lectured throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   In such a case, he would use an operation called sacrospinous
fixation, the rebuilding of a weakened pelvic floor, by sewing the
ligaments to the lowest part of the spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would often solve a miserable lifestyle, one in which
women could not be active,'' Coustan said. ``Many would not go
outside their homes because these pelvic organs lacked the support
to stay in their proper place.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols was a founding member of the national board for the
medical subspecialty that he had founded within obstetrics and
gynecology, and wrote a dozen major medical textbooks, several
still in use by medical schools.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Utica, N.Y., and received his M.D. in 1947 at the
University of Buffalo School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   He was a major in the U.S. Army Air Force from 1952-54, when he
joined the University of Buffalo School of Medicine. In 1980, he
became department chairman at Brown and served until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of two Americans named to the Vatican committee on
biogenetics and bioengineering.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 50 years, Lorraine Landel Nichols;
three daughters, Laurie Cochran of Wellesley, Mass., Nancie Svensen
of Miami, and Julie Nichols of Washington; two sons, David of El
Paso, Texas, and Daniel of Arlington, Va., and six grandchildren.

IT TAKES 17 INNINGS, BUT YANKS DROP FOURTH IN FIVE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took 17 innings and 5 hours 50 minutes, but the
Yankees re-entered an orbit not of their liking Monday night when
they lost for the fourth time in five games, something unheard of
since the first five games of an otherwise spectacular season.
</P>
<P>
   The team that dared deface the Yankees was Detroit, which came
back from a 3-0 deficit against David Wells to tie the score and
held the Yankees scoreless over the final 14 innings before
winning, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit pushed across the tie-breaking run with three singles
off Darren Holmes in the 17th. Luis Gonzalez, whose inning-opening
single triggered the winning rally, scored the tie-breaking run on
a single by Joe Randa after advancing on a single by Paul Bako. It
was Randa's fourth hit of a game that saw 15 pitchers used, eight
by Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the opener of the doubleheader made necessary by a
rainout on April 26. That had to alarm both managers, considering
that both bullpens were depleted with another game still to play.
That put the onus on the Tigers' Bryce Florie and the Yankees'
Hideki Irabu to soak up innings in the second game, lest entire
pitching staffs be worn out with two more games scheduled in the
series Tuesday night and Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The game played long enough and laboriously enough to expose
some of the niggling little leaks that have sprung on the Yankees
since the All-Star Game break two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Yankees came blasting into the second half by winning
four straight games, extending their winning streak to 10. The
Yankees then proceeded to lose four of their next seven, all on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   In dropping two of three games over the weekend in Toronto, the
Yankees not only lost a series for the first time since mid-June,
but they were also troubled by inconsistent relief pitching; the
bullpen was charged with a total of 10 earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' hitting was also inconsistent, aided by the return
of Bernie Williams, but not completely boosted by it. All told, 28
runners were stranded in the four defeats after the All-Star Game.
The Yankees were held to under 10 hits in three of those four
games, twice by the staffs of Detroit and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The stuttering at the plate continued Monday against
lesser-known Tiger pitchers. Seth Greisinger, 1-4 on the season,
limited the Yankees to three runs in six innings. Much of the
damage was done by Williams, who doubled in two runs in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The overall slowdown could be measured, alarmingly, in the
number of runners stranded once more. It began as a trickle, as
Greisinger forced the Yankees to maroon five runners through six
innings. Then a youthful and largely anonymous Tigers relief corps
really frustrated the Yankees, proving to be vulnerable when
allowing runners to reach, but remarkably impenetrable when
protecting the plate.
</P>
<P>
   From the eighth inning through the 12th, Yankee batters reached
base 12 times. All were left there. Three were stranded in the
eighth when Doug Brocail, on to clean up a bases-loaded mess
inherited from Sean Runyan, caught Jorge Posada looking at strike
three, then induced Chad Curtis to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees stranded another three in the 10th. Scott Brosius,
facing Todd Jones, went to the plate with three on and one out and
hit a slow grounder to second, where Randa made a smart pick just
past the mound despite being screened by Jones. Randa threw cleanly
to home plate for the force play. Chuck Knoblauch, already 0-for-5
to that point, then lined to right to end the inning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Yankees again loaded the bases in the 12th, against Doug
Bochtler, the Tigers' fifth reliever. Bochtler survived the two
walks and single when Derek Jeter lined to the warning track in
right.
</P>
<P>
   What had to frustrate the Yankees was that their pitching was
almost as spectacular. Almost. The starter, David Wells, after
missing a start because of an infected big right toe, allowed only
three runs in six and two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers' big moments against Wells were minimal, but did
include a sixth-inning triple by Randa and a run-scoring grounder
by Damion Easley. The Tigers drove Wells from the game in the
seventh with another run, though, built on Geronimo Berroa's
single, Gabe Alvarez's double and a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Wells departed, he left a runner on third with two
out _ and he had a 3-2 lead. But the Tigers' third run crossed
immediately after he left.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza came on and induced Randa into hitting a
grounder. But instead of the ball finding a glove, it found right
field, a run-scoring single.

 &HT;    American adds N.Y. flights via Houston
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Passenger airlines can't fly non-stop from
Austin to New York without breaking the rules, so American Airlines
is doing what it says is the next-best thing.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 9, American, the second-biggest carrier at
Robert Mueller Municipal Airport, will add three daily flights from
Austin to New York's LaGuardia Airport, with a relatively brief
20-minute stop at Houston's Hobby Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much faster turnaround time than we are able to do at
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport,'' where layovers average
40 minutes to one hour, said Tim Smith, a spokesman for American,
which is based at the Dallas-Fort Worth airport. ``Obviously we'd
like to fly non-stop to LaGuardia, but the rules prevent it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey prohibits non-stop
flights from landing at LaGuardia if they come from more than 1,500
miles away. The distance to Austin exceeds that limit by 15 miles,
Smith said, but a brief landing at Hobby brings the flight within
LaGuardia's accepted range.
</P>
<P>
   American's New York service, aimed primarily at business
travelers, is touted as the quickest available, although other
airlines also fly there and to nearby New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines offers a daily non-stop flight from Austin
to its hub in Newark, N.J.; it routes its LaGuardia-bound flights
through its Houston hub at George Bush Intercontinental Airport.
Delta Air Lines connects Austin-to-LaGuardia flights through
Dallas; Southwest Airlines, the biggest carrier at Mueller, does
not fly into LaGuardia.
</P>
<P>
   American's New York service will be the latest in a number of
expansion moves for the airline in Austin. In May, it said it would
offer 14 flights from Mueller to Dallas' Love Field beginning Aug.
31. ``We've doubled our number of flights out of Austin in the past
couple years,'' said Mark Capell, manager of passenger sales for
American.

   ISRAEL-CULTUREWAR (Jerusalem) _ The dispute between religious

common now to hear references to a ``Kulturkampf,'' a culture war,
in which the secular ``Tel Aviv'' and the religious ``Jerusalem''
are battling for the very soul and future of Israel. By Serge

   JAPAN-KAJIYAMA (Tokyo) _ Courting world opinion is not something
most Japanese politicians are good at or consider important to
their electoral chances, but Seiroku Kajiyama, one of three
candidates to head the governing Liberal Democratic Party and thus
become this country's next prime minister, took a stab at it today.
Kajiyama held a news conference for the foreign media at party
headquarters where he fielded questions about his policy proposals,

   IMMIG-GLOBALVILLAGE (Chinantla, Mexico) _ Almost every migration
story is the psychodrama of a family. For the Cruz family of
Chinantla, Mexico, it is also the story of a town. Like many modern
immigrant families, those from Chinantla straddle a border, abetted
by newly inexpensive air fares and now, by a new Mexican law that
allows them to retain their Mexican nationality as U.S. citizens
and even confers it on their American-born children. The story of
Chinantla is a multigenerational saga of a pueblito that has been
bled of its working-age population through a half-century of
emigration. Yet it has not faded but flourished, a would-be ghost
town kept alive by emigrants who consider the place a state of
mind, an affair of the heart and their spiritual anchor. By Deborah
Sontag.

   EAST-ST.LOUIS-GAMBLE (East St. Louis, Ill.) _ For East St.
Louis, gambling has been something of a life saver. Since
entrepreneurs opened a riverboat casino here, the city's operating
budget has increased from about $7 million a year to about $20
million, all as a result of taxes on gambling revenue. The city has
been able to do things like double the police force, pave the
streets, etc. The argument here is not about whether gambling is a
bad thing; it's about how good it is. By Brett Pulley.

waterways around Butte are so contaminated they comprise the

been another (albeit subtle) way to proclaim membership in a
professional community that scorns conventional social images.
Physicists often get into the habit of looking somewhat scruffy,

SPORTS COLUMN: A GREAT TIME AND A BETTER FRIENDSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They have moved well beyond their fantasy-come-true
in a haven called Golden State, when they unlocked the Iron Curtain
to build a friendship and an opportunity in the wild and capitalist
West. Donn Nelson and Sarunas Marciulionis remain tethered, though,
a bicultural statement about goodwill, sports and the best time of
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   International basketball competitions are the stage for their
reunions, on the bench of the Lithuanian national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Sarunas when I made the commitment that I was in for
the long haul,'' Nelson said Monday after Lithuania defeated
Argentina, 81-77, in overtime at Madison Square Garden, the
near-empty site of the Goodwill Games basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Turner's first Goodwill Games in 1986, and his sending of
the Atlanta Hawks to the Soviet Union two years later, quite
possibly contributed to their meeting in the first place. It was
before the crash of communism in Eastern Europe that Nelson began
recruiting the Soviet star Marciulionis to play for his father's
team, the Warriors of the California Bay Area, and after
Lithuania's independence that Marciulionis lobbied his country's
federation to bring Nelson on as assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   Close friends by 1992, they went to the Olympics in Barcelona,
Spain, and to the bronze medal stand. Mixing politics with sport,
they stirred the passions of every Lithuanian by defeating the
Russians in the game that small country loves most. Marciulionis
merely calls that victory ``the greatest moment of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the shooter and Nelson was support, but even before the
Olympics, they were a team, promoting the cause and raising some
cash, which in the process produced a cachet. Lithuania rocked the
Olympics, sponsored in part by the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been doing every speaking engagement we could get, for
$50 or $75,'' Nelson said. ``Someone wrote a story in one of the
Bay Area papers, and a couple of the Grateful Dead members read it
and called to say they wanted to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Marciulionis said he'd never heard of them, but he went with
Nelson to their concert, where he was introduced to the fashions of
the tie-dyed nation. In Barcelona, the hottest merchandise at the
basketball venue was the splashy Lithuania warmup shirt with the
skeleton on the front, which in Europe remains essential to the
look of the true Lithuanian fan.
</P>
<P>
   Who can forget Marciulionis roaming the medal stand and ordering
his teammates to slip on the tie-dyed shirts, infuriating the
company that paid to have its logo on the team's uniform? Too bad,
he said. In contrast to their rich peers from the National
Basketball Association, the Lithuanians' Olympics were not about
corporate fidelity but were instead a pledge of renewed national
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, of Swedish and German descent, did not have to be
Lithuanian to participate in the spraying of Champagne on the
country's former president, Vytautas Landsbergis, in a dramatic
locker room scene. He did not have to be fluent in the language to
join in the singing of the anthem with Landsbergis, Marciulionis
and the others, tears running down all their cheeks. Nelson knew
he'd hit a note he would likely never reach again if he spent a
dozen more lifetimes in sports. He knew at that moment a part of
him would always be with Lithuania, his adopted country, home of
his very good friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is Swedish and every summer I go back to Lithuania, I
drop her off,'' Nelson said. ``It works out.''
</P>
<P>
   In two years, he is scheduled to slide into the seat of his
father _ same name, less one `n' in Donn _ as head coach of the
Dallas Mavericks. But he expects to remain an assistant to Jonas
Kazlauskas or whoever is coaching the Lithuanian team. He promised
Marciulionis, who retired a couple of years ago to run Lithuania's
modest pro league, that he would stick with the program ``in good
times and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a young, star-less Lithuanian team, feeling its way when
basketball's global expansion seems to have flattened from the
dizzying summer of 1992. Croatia, the silver medalist in Barcelona,
did not even qualify for next month's world championships in
Greece, an event devalued by the NBA's lockout and resulting
player-inspired pullout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost sacrilege,'' is what Nelson calls this job action,
though he admits his perception is skewed because of his
relationship with Marciulionis, the ultimate player-patriot. And
then, Lithuania's best player, center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, won't be
playing in Athens either. He's a Cleveland Cavalier free agent,
afraid to risk injury and lose a windfall that Marciulionis'
pioneering helped make possible.
</P>
<P>
   This is progress, apparently.

O'MEARA PUT VARIED SKILLS ON DISPLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHPORT, England _ With a dramatic victory Sunday in the
British Open, his second major championship of the year, Mark
O'Meara guaranteed himself the kind of year most golfers only dream
about.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Masters in April gave O'Meara his first major title
at age 41. But to win again Sunday, to prevail in a playoff against
Brian Watts, to hold off the charge of Tiger Woods and to withstand
four days of treacherous and changing weather conditions proved
that O'Meara is a special player.
</P>
<P>
   Next month at the PGA Championship, O'Meara will have a chance
to win three majors in the same year, something that has not been
done since Ben Hogan won the Masters, the U.S. Open and the British
Open in 1953. But regardless of what happens next month, O'Meara
proved that winning a major was not a one-time thing for him, and
that he is more driven than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I come here and don't play any good, you guys say, `How can
the Masters champion not play any good?''' O'Meara said when asked
if winning the Masters gave him a sense of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes with the territory. When I tee it up, I play the game
for pride. I play to win. I realize that winning doesn't happen
that frequently, because the talent is so good. But for me to win
the Masters, knowing I had crossed that hurdle, I would say I used
that to my advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara and Woods, neighbors in Windemere, Fla., outside
Orlando, and close friends, would have much to talk about on their
flight home Monday. A love of golf is the common bond between
O'Meara, a devoted husband and father of two who avoids the
limelight, and Woods, a 22-year-old bachelor who is one of the
world's most recognized athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and O'Meara practice together, fish together, travel
together and trade tips. O'Meara and Woods went to Ireland a week
before the British Open to play links courses and to prepare
themselves for the four-day challenge at Royal Birkdale Golf Club.
And O'Meara lent Woods a backup putter before the tournament, which
Woods used to finish in third place, one stroke behind O'Meara and
Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Woods has influenced her husband, O'Meara's wife,
Alicia, said: ``He has been a great friend and a great help to
Mark. I think he's brought new life to golf for Mark. Tiger has
such a love for the game, and Mark has always had it, but it really
came back when they started playing together.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara agrees, and by winning the Claret Jug, the trophy given
to the British Open champion, O'Meara has given Isleworth, the
plush development where Woods and O'Meara live, another reason to
throw a party. Isleworth has become a residence for the winners of
majors. Woods, last year's Masters champion, and O'Meara live and
play golf at Isleworth, as does Lee Janzen, the U.S. Open champion.
When O'Meara wants competition, he does not have to travel far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our relationship has been good for both sides,''
O'Meara said, referring to Woods. ``I admire Tiger Woods
tremendously. I think he has been a tremendous asset to the game.
Our friendship is a unique one. He can confide in me if he has
difficulties or problems. He has been a driving force, to play with
such a talented player who has taken the game to another level. He
has helped everybody else work on their games. For me, I've used
that to my advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells my friends, `Mark can really play; he doesn't get the
recognition he deserves.' I'm not looking for that. Let him be in
the limelight. Privacy is an important part of my life. I'm
probably more recognized with this victory. I'll deal with it. But
I look at Tiger's talent and his technique, his swing, and I think
he's a better player than I am. That motivates.''
</P>
<P>
   But O'Meara deserves the credit for reaching his peak at an age
when some players are in decline. O'Meara has always been a
splendid putter, but with 14 PGA Tour victories and seven
international victories, O'Meara has proved he has the versatility,
poise and toughness to win anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Winning at Royal Birkdale on Sunday, with narrow fairways, 35
mile-an-hour crosswinds and rough featuring shin-high grass,
required different skills from winning the Masters at Augusta
National, an immaculate course with no rough and lightning-quick
greens.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara proved Sunday that he could handle either challenge. And
when he walked toward the 18th green on the final playoff hole,
surrounded by a gallery that had burst through the restraining
ropes to get a closer look, O'Meara knew he had reached the
pinnacle of his profession.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The walk up the 18th hole was phenomenal,'' said Alicia, who
joined her 11-year-old daughter, Michelle, and 8-year-old son,
Shaun, following O'Meara down the fairway. ``It was a great
experience for the kids, to walk along and really see everything.
I've never experienced anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   So O'Meara left as the champion after a week that will be long
remembered. Justin Rose, a 17-year-old amateur from England, was a
bigger story in England than O'Meara, finishing tied for fourth
place and announcing he would turn professional this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's incredible, in my opinion,'' O'Meara said of Rose's
performance. ``At 17, there's no way I could even come close to
playing like that. It goes to show you the game has changed. More
and more young people are coming on board. That's good for the
game. These players are strong, they start at early ages. The
intimidation factor is not there.''
</P>
<P>
   At next month's PGA Championship at Sahalee Country Club in
Redmond, Wash., O'Meara will try to join Hogan in even more elite
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scheduled to play again until the PGA,'' O'Meara said.
``I want to savor this victory as much, if not more, than what
happened at Augusta.''

HOMEOWNER AND SHOPOWNERS FOIL TRUMP'S BID FOR THEIR PROPERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Miss.)  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ It was a case that pitted a widowed homeowner and
the owners of two small businesses in Atlantic City against the
state and Donald Trump, one of the brashest personalities in the
casino business. And on Monday, the little guys won.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge in Atlantic City ruled Monday that New
Jersey was not allowed to seize three small properties that stand
in the way of an expansion of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. The
decision ended a five-year condemnation dispute that had raised the
fundamental question of whether the government could condemn land
on behalf of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, a
state agency, had sought to seize three properties _ an elderly
widow's home, a family-run Italian restaurant and a pawnshop _ by
invoking the federal and state constitutions, which allow property
to be condemned for ``public use.'' The authority then planned to
turn the properties over to the Trump Organization for additional
landscaping and parking, including a waiting area for guest
limousines.
</P>
<P>
   In an oral decision, the judge, Richard Williams, rejected the
authority's request, saying that there were no guarantees that the
Trump Organization would use the land appropriately. If the
properties were transferred, he said, Trump Plaza could just as
easily choose to extend its casino floor instead of adding the new
parking and trees that were the basis of the authority's
condemnation request.
</P>
<P>
   With the owners of the properties and their families crowded in
the front row of the Atlantic City courtroom Monday morning,
Williams said, ``The court considered the consequences and effects
of these three condemnation actions and concluded that the primary
interest served here is a private rather than a public one and as
such the actions cannot be justified under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Location, location, location,'' said Peter Banin, one of the
owners who emerged victorious from Monday's ruling. ``I am quoting
Donald Trump,'' Banin said, clearly elated as he sat in his
pawnshop, the Golden Island, which buys gold from cash-strapped
gamblers. ``How do you spell relief? Case dismissed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nicholas Ribis, the president of Trump Hotels, did not return
telephone calls seeking comment on Monday. James Kennedy, the
executive director of the authority, also did not answer a
telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is a setback for the Trump Organization and for the
authority. In the last 13 years, the authority has rebuilt Atlantic
City by condemning 300 to 400 properties, almost all to make way
for expansions and improvements to casinos along the city's
boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Williams cited a case in Vicksburg, Miss., in
which a condemnation that would have benefited a Harrah's casino
was rejected because a judge found no guarantee between the
government and the casino that the condemned land would be
expressly used for the reasons outlined in the condemnation
request.
</P>
<P>
   Williams also said in his decision that he would have granted
theauthority's condemnation applications had there been a firm
contract between the authority and Trump Plaza as a guarantee that
the seized properties would be used solely for additional parking
and new trees. Lawyers for the property owners suggested that the
Trump Organization's true interest in the properties was to expand
its casino and hotel space and that the company would not be
interested in acquiring the land with restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision was the first time a judge had blocked a
condemnation in New Jersey on the ground that there was no
guarantee for the use of the seized properties, and the case could
have implications for other eminent domain cases being litigated in
Atlantic City and throughout the state. Lawyers for the property
owners also said they hoped the decision signaled a new nationwide
trend in stricter judicial scrutiny of condemnation applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really thrilled that we have been able to set a
precedent that this condemnation was not for a public purpose,''
said Dana Berliner, a staff lawyer with the Institute for Justice,
a nonprofit public-interest law firm in Washington that
concentrates on property rights cases. ``If this kind of analysis
is adopted throughout the country, it will be a revolution in
condemnation law and a very important restraint on the ability of
government to take private property and hand it over to other
private parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berliner helped represent Vera Coking, the elderly widow
whose house on Columbia Street was one of the properties that the
authority sought to seize. Mrs. Coking's house is wedged between
the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Caesar's Palace, so close to
Trump Plaza that visitors knocking on her front door can feel the
spray from sprinklers used to water the hotel's grass.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Coking's daughter, Branwen Torpey, said she and her mother
were overjoyed by the judge's decision. ``It feels good,'' she
said. ``It feels like a big weight's been lifted off us. We have
had a lot of help from the American people, little people just like
us who work and earn what they have.''

THE QUEEN OF TRACK RETIRES THE WAY SHE RULED: WITH CLASS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Her grandmother named her after Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis, because she wanted her to grow up to be ``the
first lady of something.'' Jackie Joyner-Kersee fulfilled her
grandmother's dream. She retires this week at 36 as the greatest
female athlete of her generation, the first lady of track and
field.
</P>
<P>
   From modest beginnings in East St. Louis, Ill., Joyner-Kersee
began her long-jumping career on the front porch. She and her two
sisters walked to a nearby park, loaded sand in potato-chip bags,
carted the sand home and fashioned a jumping pit.
</P>
<P>
   She was called a tomboy for years, the girl in pigtails, cut-off
jeans and a T-shirt who hopped the railroad tracks and became so
accomplished at the local recreation center that the phone at home
rang off the wall, driving her mother to distraction, strangers
wanting Jackie to play on their basketball and softball and
volleyball teams.
</P>
<P>
   She quit being a tomboy and became simply an athlete during her
sophomore year in high school, when her teams won the state
basketball and track titles. The girls got the gym after school and
it was the boys who had to trundle back for practice after dark.
</P>
<P>
   One sport was never enough for Joyner-Kersee, who would play
basketball at UCLA and would win three Olympic gold medals, two in
the heptathlon, a third in the long jump. On Tuesday and Wednesday,
she will compete in her final heptathlon at the Goodwill Games. On
Saturday, she will perform a farewell long jump in suburban St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   She leaves knowing that her place in history is secure and that
there is another queen, Marion Jones, to whom to hand her crown.
Jones said that Joyner-Kersee was her childhood idol and that, ``in
my mind, she is the best female athlete who ever lived.'' ``If I
can achieve one-quarter of what she achieved, I'd be happy,'' Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gold medals and world records aside, Joyner-Kersee's
greatest achievement was that she helped make it OK for women to
sweat. Along with Wilma Rudolph and Billie Jean King and others,
Joyner-Kersee was a pioneer, boldly crossing what was an athletic
desert for women. As she retires, that barren landscape has
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Title IX mandates equal opportunities for female athletes.
American women are the Olympic champions at basketball, soccer and
softball. Not one but two professional basketball leagues exist for
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we ever wanted was respect for what we were trying to
do,'' Joyner-Kersee said on Monday at a news conference. ``That's
what's happening now. It's OK for girls to play soccer or softball
or football and not be criticized or thought of as different.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner-Kersee looks at Jones and sees a reflection of herself.
They first met in the early 1990s, when Jones was still a high
school star. It wasn't how fast Jones ran that impressed
Joyner-Kersee. It was that she was nice and respectful and that she
had set goals for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her being successful,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jones came to watch Joyner-Kersee play basketball in
Virginia and Joyner-Kersee told her, ``You are the one we should be
reading about now.'' Several months later, Jones defeated her in
the long jump at the 1997 national championships and she has rarely
lost anything since. More important to Joyner-Kersee, Jones has won
with graciousness, not arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't rub it in people's faces,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
``You do it with class and style.''
</P>
<P>
   That was always her own way. At the 1991 world championships in
Tokyo, she injured her leg during the 200 meters in the heptathlon,
but still gave interviews while she lay on a gurney. At the 1996
Summer Olympics, after dropping out of the heptathlon with a
hamstring injury, she willed herself to a bronze medal in the long
jump, leaping from sixth place to third on her final attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Always, she had to overcome asthma that sometimes forced her to
run while wearing a mask and left her gasping for breath. And she
also had to overcome unsubstantiated accusations at the 1988 Summer
Olympics, leveled by the Brazilian half-miler Joaquin Cruz, that
she and her sister-in-law, Florence Griffith Joyner, had won their
gold medals through better chemistry. This drug accusation stung
her so deeply that she mentioned it today, a decade later.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the drug issue, my performance was swept under the
carpet,'' Joyner-Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations have long been drowned out by the valedictory of
retirement. Now she will have as many jobs as she had sports.
Sports agent, marketing expert, the head of a foundation that will
help kids in East St. Louis realize that ``if you work hard, you
can be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   That if you dream, as her grandmother once dreamed, the dreams
can come true. &QL;

 &HT;    O'Brien answers questions about his fitness, wins decathlon
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ For the first time since the Atlanta Olympics,
Dan O'Brien stepped on the track and sweated out a decathlon. And
rather than his fitness abandoning him early, the Olympic gold
medalist crafted a near record-breaking performance and a smashing
statement about his future for Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien scored 8,755 points, 13th-best ever, and put to rest
talk of his demise.
</P>
<P>
   No one had reason to expect this. Rather, the issue before his
two-day performance was not how many points he'd run up, but if
O'Brien would even hang around for the finish. Since Atlanta,
O'Brien a step away from retirement _ dabbling as an occasional TV
track analyst and playing the role of celebrity fitness guru.
</P>
<P>
   Even his shoe sponsor, Nike, lost faith _ unable to agree on a
new contract.
</P>
<P>
   But with one event left Monday night, the 32-year-old O'Brien
had 8,245 points, the most in history at that point. All he needed
was to run the 1,500 meters, a race he's never had a stomach for,
in 4 minutes and 45.42 seconds or faster _ something he'd done
seven times, but not since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   If he could, he'd dig into Ted Turner's pocket for a $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, O'Brien sucked more than his share of the heavy night
air, laboring home last in 5:08.77 _ more than 23 seconds off pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had the wind but not the legs,'' said O'Brien, exhausted.
''I just wanted to prove I'm the best in world. ''
</P>
<P>
   In the hour or so between the end of the javelin and the 1,500,
O'Brien received an IV to get fluids back into his system. The
problem is he'd done minimal distance training. And after the first
lap, he was already three seconds behind pace and fading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just having a chance at the world record going into the 1,500
is very encouraging,'' he said. ''Now, I'd really like to go out in
style in the 2000 (Games) and score 9,000 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Any shot at the record probably was lost when the decathletes
ran the 100 meters into the wind early on the first day, which made
for a slower than anticipated time and cost him at least 100
points.
</P>
<P>
   That saw O'Brien enter the second day trailing countryman Chris
Huffins by 45 points. He quickly made it up with a decathlon
personal-bests in the 110 hurdles (13.67) and pole vault (17 feet,
3/4 inches) _ an event he failed to clear a height at in the 1992
Olympic Trials, costing him a spot in the Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   His showing climaxed a day that saw several outstanding
performances, among them:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sprint queen Marion Jones closed out her double, cruising to
a 21.80 clocking in the 200 meters after taking the 100 the night
before. Again, she demolished the field in a meet-record and the
fastest time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is unbeaten this season in 23 finals, and owns the world's
top showings in both sprints and the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   -- Former Decatur teacher Tisha Waller capped off U.S. indoor
and outdoor titles this year by winning the high-jump gold with a
6-5 1/2 clearance _ good for $20,000. Waller was perfect until
three failed attempts at 6-7.
</P>
<P>
   Waller, who has quit her teaching job to purse a graduate
degree, is also picking up her competitive schedule with meets next
month in Europe and World Cup in September. ''This is the best I've
jumped at this time of the year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the 3,000 steeplechase, Bernard Barmasai of Kenya won in a
Goodwill Games record 8 minutes, 14.26 seconds. Former world
record-holder Moses Kiptanui may have seen his career finale after
he ruptured his left Achilles coming off a hurdle.

SHAW NOTICES DODGERS' MATURE APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been only 17 days since the Los Angeles
Dodgers got reliever Jeff Shaw in a trade with the Reds. Shaw, who
saw his former teammates for the first time on Monday, said he has
noticed the differences in both teams' clubhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is a little more laid back,'' Shaw said. ``They treat
you like men here. Over there, they treat you like a young player
in the minor leagues; every day it was like a drill sergeant.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw admitted the Reds took that approach simply because the
Reds are carrying five rookies entering the Dodgers series,
including Paul Konerko, one of the players Shaw was traded for on
July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have won before,'' Shaw said while dressing in the
Dodgers clubhouse. ``They haven't had that luxury over there.''
</P>
<P>
   His quickest impression as a Dodger?
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a lot more talent than the Reds do,'' he said.
Shaw, 32, was surprised that he was traded, especially after he
signed a three-year contract extension with the Reds on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' he said. ``I didn't think they were going to
make the deal. The (trade rumors) died down so fast.... I guess it
was the calm before the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did show some loyalty (by signing the contract) and they
burned me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's been relatively inactive since the trade _ Shaw
had thrown only 17 pitches in four appearances with the Dodgers _
he's been effective. Entering Monday's game, he retired 15 of the
17 batters he faced and made two saves.
</P>
<P>
   Although he empathizes with the plight of Antonio Osuna, who he
replaced in the closer's role, Shaw isn't about to let go his
stopper role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work to get my job,'' he said, referring to 5{
seasons spent in the minor leagues and another four years in the
majors in middle relief. ``My job wasn't handed to me. I had to
pitch well to get where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not satisfied: Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, who knows he is
signed through the end of the season and not beyond, wants to win
every series. The Dodgers managed to just split the four-game
series in St. Louis over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted more,'' Hoffman said. ``I'm greedy.... I'd like to
see us win, that's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has been a manager for six seasons. His teams have been
over .500 just once _ in 1991 when he guided rookie-level Great
Falls to a 46-24 record. He said he couldn't imagine managing in
the majors for 20 years, like Tommy Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you don't lose a lot, you can make it a long
time,'' Hoffman said.

 CHINANTLA: they thought. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One Community, But Divisions, Too
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, it was clear that the only way for a Chinantecan
to survive financially was to leave Chinantla. This reality
produced a collective pang of conscience, and a kind of unspoken
social contract emerged. From the beginning, Chinantecans tithed a
portion of their earnings to their town. They formed a committee
and developed a census of Chinantecan immigrants. When they were
raising money for a specific project, they divided up addresses and
crisscrossed the metropolitan area on what they called ``la
colecta.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority has been to give this little town its most basic
needs,'' said Abel Alonso, the committee's president. ``We have
changed the physiognomy of the town.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's motto is immortalized on an ink stamp: ``To
Chinantla and its future: The absent ones are always present.''
</P>
<P>
   To the official government of Chinantla, the motto has the faint
ring of a threat. But that has to be ignored, said Dr. Francisco
Calixto, the mayor, because, ``We have no other source of income
besides New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorkers send about $2 million a year home to Chinantla,
according to Smith. Scores of American pension checks and Social
Security checks also arrive every month to help support retirees.
</P>
<P>
   But there are tensions between the two communities about what
should be done in Chinantla. The New Yorkers want to preserve the
town's charm, and the locals want to modernize. And there are also
tensions about who should have power, who should get credit, and
who really needs help, the town or the immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Small-Town Girls Trapped in the City
</P>
<P>
   The Cruz sisters returned to New York for the second half of
their childhood in the late 1970s. At first they savored the
luxuries of the developed world. They reveled in indoor showers
after a lifetime of crouching beneath upturned pots of bracing well
water.
</P>
<P>
   But they also mourned the loss of their small-town freedom. They
bounced off the walls of their family's first residence, outdoorsy
girls trapped in an efficiency apartment.
</P>
<P>
   While their parents worked, the sisters competed to get 97s and
98s on tests. When home, their father hovered and lectured,
drilling them in geography and world politics. He did not tolerate
television watching. He did not let the girls date. They were very
good girls, and remain loyal to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents gave us everything, and they gave up everything
for us,'' Melissa said. ``All they wanted us to do was go to school
and make a better person of ourselves, and not end up doing the
jobs they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first eight years, they could not afford a single trip
to Mexico. Then, when their father landed the One Penn Plaza job,
which paid union wages, they began the custom of regular visits
home. On one of those trips, Elizabeth met her future husband,
Cuauhtemoc, a Chinantecan.
</P>
<P>
   But Antonia, the youngest, married first. She met her husband,
Claudio, then a new immigrant from the state of Morelos, at a
volleyball game organized by a Chinantecan youth group.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth, the most studious sister, waited until she completed
her master's degree in bilingual education to marry Cuauhtemoc.
After their wedding, Elizabeth, the only daughter born in Mexico,
forced herself to become a U.S. citizen. She mouthed the words
while thinking to herself, ``I'm doing this for my husband,'' who
obtained a green card through their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Monica and Melissa joke that all the Chinantecan boys are taken
and that they will have to range farther afield. But they are in no
hurry, for their ambitions, if at times scattered, are great.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat on a crate between bottles of hot sauce and bags of
rice in her store in Chinantla, Mrs. Cruz was asked if she was
proud of how far her family had come in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   She pursed her lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two are still single, and they don't have all their diplomas
yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For a demanding immigrant mother, the jury is still out.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Comfort In Padre Jesus
</P>
<P>
   Every Chinantecan home has a photograph of Padre Jesus, and some
have wooden replicas of the statue. When she was pregnant with her
first child, Elizabeth Cruz lowered herself to her knees in her
Brooklyn apartment and crossed herself before his photo. It had
been a difficult pregnancy and she was confined to bed. ``If we
survive,'' she promised, ``I will bring my baby to you in Chinantla
to be baptized.''
</P>
<P>
   By early this year _ ``miracle of miracles,'' she said _
Elizabeth was sending out engraved invitations, inviting all of
Chinantecan New York to the biggest baptism party of the season, on
her parents' terraced patio in Chinantla during the winter fiesta.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the party, skinned goats swung from the trees
in the backyard. The four Cruz sisters were stringing the patio
with baby blue streamers and setting out long banquet tables and
plastic chairs bearing the Corona beer logo.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen college-age women arrived to help with the
preparations. Leticia Lopez, a business major at Berkeley College
in Paramus, N.J., turned her face to the sun, and sighed, rubbing
her Fila sneaker in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish the sky back there was like this, nice and blue,'' she
said. ``It's so nice and quiet here, too. Down here, life has time
to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, the boy of honor, 2-year-old Christian de
Jesus, was plunked into the official town barber's chair for a $1
baptism-special buzz cut.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., the town band showed up to parade Christian and his
parents through Chinantla. Christian was dressed in a white
captain's suit with gold braiding. A toy saber hung from his side.
Holding his parents' hands, he climbed the steep, rocky path to the
church.
</P>
<P>
   Exhausted by the anticipation, Christian fell sound asleep just
as the ceremony began. As his godfather, his Uncle Claudio, held
him in his arms, the priest, in green robes, poured cups of water
over his closed eyes. His parents' faces crumpled; tears spilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my promise has been fulfilled,'' Elizabeth said.
</P>
<P>
   A Healthy Attachment, Despite Cultural Tensions
</P>
<P>
   The New York-born Chinantecans are not conflicted about their
identities. They know instinctively that their attachment to
Chinantla is healthy, that it gives them a rich identity, and a
keen, even enviable sense of community in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But they do maintain a kind of jokey banter that reflects some
tension. When the sisters' uncle settled into an armchair with a
bottle of tequila to narrate the tale of their grandfather's role
as messenger for Zapata, Antonia rolled her eyes. ``I hate it when
he gets so Mexican,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when Antonia's husband, at her request, wore the Baby Bjorn
to the cock fights, their uncle rolled his eyes. ``All this
kowtowing to the wives, it's so un-Mexican,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   While they all idealize Chinantla, most of the young people know
in their guts that it would be difficult to live permanently in
such a small, conservative society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite spot in the world,'' Monica said. ``I
count the days until my next trip down here. But I'm afraid I've
outgrown it a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnestly, her sister Melissa says that if she had to make a
choice, she would rather live a tranquil life in Chinantla. In the
next breath, though, she acknowledges that her loyalty will never
have to be put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're lucky,'' she said. ``We really don't have to choose
between here and there.''
</P>

SHAW NOTICES DODGERS' MATURE APPROACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's been only 17 days since the Los Angeles
Dodgers got reliever Jeff Shaw in a trade with the Reds. Shaw, who
saw his former teammates for the first time on Monday, said he has
noticed the differences in both teams' clubhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is a little more laid back,'' Shaw said. ``They treat
you like men here. Over there, they treat you like a young player
in the minor leagues; every day it was like a drill sergeant.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw admitted the Reds took that approach simply because the
Reds are carrying five rookies entering the Dodgers series,
including Paul Konerko, one of the players Shaw was traded for on
July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have won before,'' Shaw said while dressing in the
Dodgers clubhouse. ``They haven't had that luxury over there.''
</P>
<P>
   His quickest impression as a Dodger?
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a lot more talent than the Reds do,'' he said.
Shaw, 32, was surprised that he was traded, especially after he
signed a three-year contract extension with the Reds on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' he said. ``I didn't think they were going to
make the deal. The (trade rumors) died down so fast.... I guess it
was the calm before the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did show some loyalty (by signing the contract) and they
burned me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's been relatively inactive since the trade _ Shaw
had thrown only 17 pitches in four appearances with the Dodgers _
he's been effective. Entering Monday's game, he retired 15 of the
17 batters he faced and made two saves.
</P>
<P>
   Although he empathizes with the plight of Antonio Osuna, who he
replaced in the closer's role, Shaw isn't about to let go his
stopper role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work to get my job,'' he said, referring to 5{
seasons spent in the minor leagues and another four years in the
majors in middle relief. ``My job wasn't handed to me. I had to
pitch well to get where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Not satisfied: Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, who knows he is
signed through the end of the season and not beyond, wants to win
every series. The Dodgers managed to just split the four-game
series in St. Louis over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted more,'' Hoffman said. ``I'm greedy.... I'd like to
see us win, that's the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman has been a manager for six seasons. His teams have been
over .500 just once _ in 1991 when he guided rookie-level Great
Falls to a 46-24 record. He said he couldn't imagine managing in
the majors for 20 years, like Tommy Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as you don't lose a lot, you can make it a long
time,'' Hoffman said.

BOMB SUSPECT DESCRIBES PLOT TO KILL JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of two Palestinians charged with plotting to
explode a powerful pipe bomb in the New York City subway testified
Monday that he had planned to kill as many Jews as possible in a
suicide bomb attack, though he insisted not on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Ghazi Ibrahim Abu Maizar, also told the jury in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn that before he came to New York,
``I failed to assassinate President Clinton in Seattle,
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar was not asked to elaborate on this claim and said
nothing more about it. Later, both prosecutors and defense lawyers
in the case said this was the first time they had ever heard such a
claim. And some investigators privately expressed skepticism about
the claim, pointing out that a note found with a pipe bomb in Abu
Maizar's Brooklyn apartment when the police raided it last July
claimed responsibility for the 1996 crash of Trans World Airlines
Flight 800, which federal officials have said was not the result of
a criminal act.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar's testimony Monday was also at odds with the
contentions of his own lawyers, who have argued that he had not
intended to explode the pipe bomb but rather had planned to use it
as a prop in a scheme to collect reward money from a government
antiterrorism program.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar's appearance on the stand _ which occurred against
the advice of his lawyers _ capped a case in which he has sometimes
displayed bizarre behavior, at one point getting into a fight with
his co-defendant and at other times trying to escape during
pretrial hearings, according to court officials.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony Monday, a prosecutor, Bernadette
Miragliotta, asked him: ``You wanted to make sure that you took as
many Jews as possible with you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``As many as I could take,'' the 24-year-old Abu Maizar declared
in the dramatic testimony, in which he also asserted to the jury
that he had ``come to the United States because I feel that the
United States is supporting the Jewish state and the United States
should be punished for supporting Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Abu Maizar denied that he had planned to explode the bomb in the
subway, but, under questioning, did not say where he intended to
explode it. He also insisted that the second Palestinian man on
trial with him in the case, Lafi Khalil, 23, was not involved in
the bombing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he contended that another immigrant from the Middle
East who told the police about the plan, a roommate named Abdel
Rahman Mosabbah, had in fact been a participant in the plot _ a
statement investigators said was false.

CRICKET INVADERS TURN AN AUCITON INTO `MADNESS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The administration of Mayor Rudolph has seen many
protests, but perhaps never one so large in number but so small in
girth.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters released 10,000 crickets at Police Headquarters in
lower Manhattan on Monday to protest the city's auction of several
community garden lots and a building that houses a Hispanic
cultural center on Manhattan's Lower East Side. The result,
unsurprisingly, was bedlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were screaming and standing on chairs,'' said Elsa
Rensaa, an artist who was at the auction in the auditorium of One
Police Plaza. ``It was madness.''
</P>
<P>
   The crickets were the work of a group of Lower East Side
advocates calling themselves _ what else? _ Jiminy Cricket. ``We
wanted something more symbolic than a stink bomb,'' said Wendy
Madison, a spokeswoman for the group.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, two Jiminy Cricket members had been arrested and
charged with obstruction of government administration and
disorderly conduct. Three others, unrelated to the group, were also
arrested. Two police officers sustained minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madison said the group bought the crickets via the Internet
_ ``You can find anything on the Web,'' she said _ and then
smuggled them into Police Headquarters inside mailing envelopes in
briefcases.
</P>
<P>
   The police had no comment on the protest Monday night. Asked
about the the crickets' whereabouts, Detective Robert Samuel, a
police spokesman, said, ``They are no longer with us.'' Some were
apparently killed; some were captured and released in parks.
</P>
<P>
   As for the auction, Patrick Muldowney, a spokesman for the
Department of Citywide Administrative Services, called it ``the
most successful the city has had.'' A city official speaking on the
condition of anonymity said it raised about $19 million.

LATSHAW WHIPS RIVIERA INTO SHAPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wherever he goes, he is hailed as a golf legend.
</P>
<P>
   Four times he brought Augusta National to its knees.
Congressional, site of last year's U.S. Open, was no match. Neither
was Oakmont when it hosted the PGA Championship in 1978 or the U.S.
Open in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Latshaw tamed them all without so much as swinging a club.
</P>
<P>
   If the Riviera Country Club course looks good and plays tough on
the Stimp meter at this week's U.S. Senior Open beginning Thursday,
then golf course superintendent Latshaw will add another layout to
his list of those conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do good, you're a hero,'' he said. ``If you do bad,
you're a bum.''
</P>
<P>
   Hero is a word Latshaw often hears. When it comes to preparing a
course for a major championship, he's the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the king,'' said Tim Moraghan, a U.S. Golf Association
agronomist who says Latshaw is among the top 1 percent in his
profession. ``He's very precise in what he does, and most of all,
he's very thorough. I don't know anyone who knows Paul who doesn't
respect him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who remembers Riviera during the 1995 PGA Championship
knows the course could use the help. The then-year-old greens
browned in some places and appeared charred in others. Spike marks
in the turf were widespread. The brown greens didn't look good on
television. The players complained about the quality. Riviera
members were embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   They heard about Latshaw and heard comments like this one from
Rees Jones, architect of Pinehurst No.7: ``Obviously, with Paul
Latshaw, who I worked with at Congressional, you have the best in
the business. He surely knows how to grow grass.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't plan on letting it happen again, obtaining Latshaw on
loan from Congressional in January to get Riviera ready for the
U.S. Senior Open. But not without a little pressure. Some members
knew he could work wonders, but even he can't make the grass grow
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first come on site, people expect things to improve
faster than possible,'' he said. ``But over time, when they see the
changes, they're appreciative.''
</P>
<P>
   Latshaw, 58 and with 33 years of course work to his name,
welcomed the challenge and set about fixing the greens without
replanting. The El Nino rains this season made it difficult, but
Latshaw nonetheless managed to air out the greens and run a
fertility program that corrected soil problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``These greens are not as healthy and strong as I'd like them to
be, but they'll get us by,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will the greens be a perfect shade of green, as they often
are when Riviera hosts the Nissan Open in the winter. Latshaw said
the greens, made of poa annua grass, tend to brown in the heat.
Some might find that offensive, he said, ``but the last five U.S.
Opens had a combination of poa annua and bent grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Riviera members such as Dan Stevenson, who's doubling as
the U.S. Senior Open's general chairman, said he is impressed with
Latshaw's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The members are amazed,'' Stevenson said. ``The members, they
stand up and cheer him at board meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tournament begins Thursday, Latshaw will take his
customary spot behind the scenes and let the players take over.
Soon after, he will return to Congressional with the intent of
never having to prepare a course again for a major championship.
</P>
<P>
   But you never know. If another course in need of work for a
major comes calling, he'll listen and likely delay his plans to
farm in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had my way, this would be the last one,'' he said. ``But
I'm a glutton for punishment.''

 &HT;    O'Brien answers questions about his fitness
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects headline)
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ For the first time since the Atlanta Olympics,
Dan O'Brien stepped on the track and sweated out a decathlon. And
rather than his fitness abandoning him early, the Olympic gold
medalist crafted a near record-breaking performance and a smashing
statement about his future for Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien scored 8,755 points, 13th-best ever, and put to rest
talk of his demise.
</P>
<P>
   No one had reason to expect this. Rather, the issue before his
two-day performance was not how many points he'd run up, but if
O'Brien would even hang around for the finish. Since Atlanta,
O'Brien a step away from retirement _ dabbling as an occasional TV
track analyst and playing the role of celebrity fitness guru.
</P>
<P>
   Even his shoe sponsor, Nike, lost faith _ unable to agree on a
new contract.
</P>
<P>
   But with one event left Monday night, the 32-year-old O'Brien
had 8,245 points, the most in history at that point. All he needed
was to run the 1,500 meters, a race he's never had a stomach for,
in 4 minutes and 45.42 seconds or faster _ something he'd done
seven times, but not since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   If he could, he'd dig into Ted Turner's pocket for a $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, O'Brien sucked more than his share of the heavy night
air, laboring home last in 5:08.77 _ more than 23 seconds off pace.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had the wind but not the legs,'' said O'Brien, exhausted.
''I just wanted to prove I'm the best in world. ''
</P>
<P>
   In the hour or so between the end of the javelin and the 1,500,
O'Brien received an IV to get fluids back into his system. The
problem is he'd done minimal distance training. And after the first
lap, he was already three seconds behind pace and fading.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just having a chance at the world record going into the 1,500
is very encouraging,'' he said. ''Now, I'd really like to go out in
style in the 2000 (Games) and score 9,000 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Any shot at the record probably was lost when the decathletes
ran the 100 meters into the wind early on the first day, which made
for a slower than anticipated time and cost him at least 100
points.
</P>
<P>
   That saw O'Brien enter the second day trailing countryman Chris
Huffins by 45 points. He quickly made it up with a decathlon
personal-bests in the 110 hurdles (13.67) and pole vault (17 feet,
3/4 inches) _ an event he failed to clear a height at in the 1992
Olympic Trials, costing him a spot in the Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   His showing climaxed a day that saw several outstanding
performances, among them:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sprint queen Marion Jones closed out her double, cruising to
a 21.80 clocking in the 200 meters after taking the 100 the night
before. Again, she demolished the field in a meet-record and the
fastest time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is unbeaten this season in 23 finals, and owns the world's
top showings in both sprints and the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   -- Former Decatur teacher Tisha Waller capped off U.S. indoor
and outdoor titles this year by winning the high-jump gold with a
6-5 1/2 clearance _ good for $20,000. Waller was perfect until
three failed attempts at 6-7.
</P>
<P>
   Waller, who has quit her teaching job to purse a graduate
degree, is also picking up her competitive schedule with meets next
month in Europe and World Cup in September. ''This is the best I've
jumped at this time of the year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the 3,000 steeplechase, Bernard Barmasai of Kenya won in a
Goodwill Games record 8 minutes, 14.26 seconds. Former world
record-holder Moses Kiptanui may have seen his career finale after
he ruptured his left Achilles coming off a hurdle.

 &HT;    Hurdler Bronson stays unbeaten as Georgia Tech soph Taylor takes
silver
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ It wasn't the potential $1 million payday that
he eyes later this summer, but Bryan Bronson will take a Goodwill
Games gold medal _ and $20,000 check.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeaten this season in the 400-meter hurdles, Bronson easily
dispatched a field that included Olympic champion Derrick Adkins,
who grew up four miles away on a street now named after him, while
circling the track in 47.15 seconds, seventh fastest ever. Adkins
faded badly to last, but Georgia Tech sophomore Angelo Taylor
rallied for a silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   It was a repeat for Bronson, who last month held off Taylor at
the national championships. Taylor finished in 47.92, his second
sub-48-second performance.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bronson can go back to pursuing the IAAF Golden League
jackpot. The $1 million prize is to be shared by athletes who win
their event at the six meets on the European circuit, plus the
Grand Prix Final in Moscow. After two meets, Bronson is among six
athletes still eligible for the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if I keep running consistently, I should do it,''
Bronson said. ``I like my chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronson, a converted 200-meter sprinter, jumped on the field in
his usual fashion Sunday night and ran unchallenged to the finish.
Adkins was second at the halfway point, but his training has been
disrupted by a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins said he ran only because the meet was in his hometown,
and a large gathering of family and friends greeted his
introduction warmly. ``That was the best part of the day, I
guess,'' he said. ``I tried to cram in a lot of training because I
wanted to perform here, but I just couldn't pull it through.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins will call it a season and ponder his track future, while
Taylor has put himself on track for the 2000 Olympic Games. He
managed another valiant late rally, but he also admitted to having
to slow as he approached the hurdles early in the race because his
stride pattern was off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real pleased,'' Taylor said. ``As time goes on, and I work
on things, I'll get closer (to Bronson).''
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights from the opening day:
</P>
<P>
   _ In his first decathlon since claiming gold in Atlanta, world
record-holder Dan O'Brien was second at the midway point with 4,575
points, 45 behind U.S. teammate Chris Huffins. O'Brien is usually a
stronger second-day performer.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Godina captured gold in the shot put and bronze in the
discus. Lovett graduate Adam Nelson took bronze in the shot put
with a personal-best 66-10 1/4. The PR brought a $1,000 bonus and
his bronze also earned him $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   _ Olympic champion Deon Hemmings prevailed again in the women's
400 hurdles. Ireland's Susan Smith, who lives in Atlanta, finished
fifth.

GIULIANI PLANS TO TIE WELFARE TO WORK FOR MOST RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vowing to make good on his promise to radically
reshape welfare in New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said on
Monday that he would require virtually all adults on welfare to
work for their benefits by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, only the most severely disabled people will
continue to receive cash assistance without working. The rest _
currently about 340,000 adults _ will be required to participate in
workfare or to find private-sector jobs. The initiative, modeled
after a similar policy in Wisconsin, would become the largest
welfare program in the country to have a universal work
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who revolutionized New York City's welfare system by
creating a workfare program that has sharply reduced the welfare
rolls, has been promising to enforce a universal work requirement
for months. He has already pushed hundreds of the disabled and the
drug-addicted into workfare.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare officials have begun to discourage the poor from
applying for welfare, urging them to rely on relatives, charity and
work. And this year, the number of people on public assistance
plunged to its lowest point since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But putting the universal work requirement into practice will be
a much more daunting feat. Only about 22 percent of adult welfare
recipients are currently working, and city officials must now
confront the mammoth task of moving about 260,000 people into
workfare or private-sector jobs over the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Some welfare caseworkers, union officials and advocates for the
poor doubt the city can develop enough workfare positions,
private-sector jobs or child care slots to support such a
large-scale transition in such a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   A similar plan announced in 1996, in which Giuliani promised to
create a workfare force of 100,000 over two years, never
materialized. On Monday, about 36,000 people participate in
workfare, and city officials say that number is expected to
increase by only about 4,000 over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani dismissed doubts about his plan on Monday, saying
he was confident that New York City's strong economy and workfare
program could easily absorb thousands of welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to end welfare by the end of this century
completely,'' Giuliani said during a news conference in Manhattan.
``Everybody in this city will work, with the possible exception of
people who are truly disabled or, for some short period of time,
are unable to work.

   It was just another weekend in the Hamptons for the polo-playing
businessman Neil Hirsch. No seaplane accidents like the one the
previous weekend that trapped him, a female passenger and the pilot
in the East River for several minutes until Police Department
divers freed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played practice'' this weekend, but sat out the main
afternoon match at his Bridgehampton Polo Club, he said. (His team
had not been scheduled to play that day.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the accident, which sent the pilot to Bellevue Hospital
Center for observation and left Hirsch and the other passenger
unhurt, he said the problem was that the landing gear was in the
wrong position. In other words, the wheels were down. ``You have to
have the wheels up when you land on water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But old habits are hard to break, like avoiding Sunday night
traffic jams on the way home to Manhattan. Hirsch said he flew back
to Manhattan on Sunday, this time in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   `Titanic,' `Titanic' Everywhere
</P>
<P>
   Guess which film was scheduled when Eileen Ivers, a New York
violinist, settled in for a flight to London? Here is a clue: She
was on her way to a recording session for a compact disk called
``Back to Titanic'' with the London Symphony led by James Horner,
who won an Academy Award for the score for the film ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh, no,''' Ms. Ivers said. ``Half the plane was
weeping when the lights went on, all these red eyes, and breakfast
was being served.'' But her eyes were dry. ``It was tempting,'' she
said, ``but I watched the beginning and said, `I can't do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Can a soundtrack sequel match the original? ``Back to Titanic,''
which is scheduled to be released next month, features a new piece
called ``Titanic Suite and Epilogue: The Deep and Timeless Sea.''
There are also two new symphonic themes and a new version of Celine
Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On,'' which until now has been heard only
on radio.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ivers played Irish dance tunes and a solo in ``Nearer My God
to Thee,'' which was played as the ship sank in the film (never
mind that some accounts say the vaguely similar hymn ``Autumn'' was
played that night in 1912). Of the ``Nearer'' arrangement, Ms.
Ivers said, ``It was pretty chilling.''
</P>
<P>
   How big was Ingmar Bergman's 80th birthday? Big enough to knock
``Titanic'' off a movie screen.
</P>
<P>
   The theater in Faro, Sweden, where Bergman lives, canceled
showings of ``Titanic'' and ``As Good as It Gets'' last Tuesday to
run his 1983 film ``Fanny and Alexander'' _ all three hours of it.
</P>
<P>
   Candid Choirboy
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daniel Heilmann, the 11-year-old soloist with the
70-voice Zurich Boys Choir, sang for Holocaust survivors at a
nursing home in Queens last week and, later, at St. Patrick's
Cathedral. The adults who organized the choir's U.S. tour expected
the nursing home performance to have special meaning for Daniel,
for he is the grandson of Jews who fled the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I announced we would go to this Jewish center,'' said
Beatrice Lombard, the choir's tour coordinator, ``his mother called
and said, `Beatrice, we do not talk much about religion, we are
free-thinking people, but his grandparents came to Switzerland from
Germany.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel is, after all, only 11. ``I'm here because the choir
is here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dribblers Welcome at His Restaurant
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first item sold at the gift shop at Michael
Jordan's Grand Central Terminal restaurant, which opened Monday,
was an autographed basketball. It went for $900.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was, the restaurant had not expected such a pricey
item to go so soon. ``He only signed one,'' said a spokeswoman.
``Now we have to get more.''

BRAZIL TOPS PUERTO RICO IN OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With another large pro-Puerto Rico crowd in
attendance at Madison Square Garden ready to urge on the Goodwill
Games' unofficial home team, the stage appeared set on Monday night
for Puerto Rico to win its second straight game and assure itself
of a spot in the semifinal round of the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Rogerio Klafke's 3-point play with 1 minute 29 seconds left in
overtime helped Brazil rally for a 96-92 victory. Klafke, who led
his team with 26 points, gave Brazil (2-0) a 90-88 lead with his
layup and free throw after his team had fallen behind, 84-80, 47
seconds into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Every Brazil starter scored in double figures, led by Klafke.
Center Aristides Dos Santos added 22 points and a team-high 9
rebounds while guard Demetrius Ferraciu chipped in with 14 points
and a game-high 9 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Despite leading by 48-43 at halftime, Puerto Rico (1-1) once
again needed the heroics of guard Eddie Casiano to rally from a
second-half deficit. With his team down by 79-75 in the game's
final minute, Casiano nailed a deep 3-pointer from the right wing
with 46.9 seconds left to make it a 1-point game.
</P>
<P>
   After Dos Santos made one of two free throws 16 seconds later,
Casiano was fouled and made both free throws to tie the score at
80-80 with 9.2 seconds to go in regulation. Casiano finished the
game with 24 of his game-high 32 points after the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico center Jose Ortiz had his second straight
double-double, scoring 20 points and grabbing a game-high 12
rebounds. Guard Javier Colon, who teamed with Casiano to score 10
of Puerto Rico's 12 points in overtime, added 11 points off the
bench. Both teams shot well, with Brazil shooting 57 percent from
the floor and Puerto Rico at 54.2 percent. Puerto Rico also made 21
of 23 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier overtime game on Monday, Lithuania squandered a
19-point lead before beating Argentina, 81-77, behind 15 points
apiece from Gintaras Einikis, Satulius Stombergas and Danius
Adomaitis. Hugo Sconochini had 23 points for Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the referee was about to toss the ball for the jump ball
to start overtime, the scoreboards at the Garden went blank. A
faulty control box knocked out the score and game clocks on the big
boards at either end of the arena, as well as the game and shot
clocks over each basket. Repairs took about 10 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russia never trailed as it rebounded with an 81-73 victory over
Australia in the other afternoon game. Sergei Panov had 20 points
for Russia, while Australia's Andrew Gaze had a game-high 29.

<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Not too long ago, Marlon St. Julien was
another clean-pants rider in the rundown jock rooms of Louisiana's
Evangeline and Delta Downs, an afterthought on a second-rate
circuit waiting for a break. He was young, inexperienced and black.
</P>
<P>
   He was aware of the rich heritage of 19th century
African-American jockeys in thoroughbred racing. But day after day
after day, as he got passed over for mounts and saw how few other
African-Americans were riding, he began to wonder what it would
take to succeed in a profession dominated by white and Latin
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 26, St. Julien is ready to find out. His is a tale of
how talent and perseverance sometimes needs a 49-1 long shot in the
very first race at a brand-new Texas track to find the winner's
circle. And stay there. Two Aprils ago, St. Julien brought home a
colt named I Are Sharp in Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie's Premier
Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   His pants have shown the shadows of sweat ever since. He won the
riding title at this summer's Lone Star meet, which ended Sunday,
with a runaway 78 victories worth more than $1.7 million in purses.
He is closing in on 1,000 career victories with nearly $8 million
in purse money despite a slow start in picking up good mounts that
seems at odds with the talent he has shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked hard to become a good rider,'' St. Julien said in
a recent interview, ``and I believe the trainers think of me in
only that way.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien has already moved his tack to Hawthorne and the
high-profile Chicago circuit at the invitation of the longtime
jockey agent Harry Hacek. The Hat, as Hacek is known, has
previously helped move riders such as Steve Cauthen, Alex Solis and
Chris McCarron to the sport's top level. ``The goal is to ride in
California, to become one of the best and to ride in the Kentucky
Derby,'' St. Julien said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-2-inch, 110-pound Louisiana native is focused on the
future, but conscious of the past. He rattles off the fact that
black jockeys won 15 of the first 28 Kentucky Derbys. That a pair
of black 15-year-olds are the two youngest jockeys ever to win the
race _ Alonzo Clayton aboard Azra in 1892 and James Perkins on
Halma in 1895.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know about Isaac Murphy? How he won three Kentucky Derbys,
two of them back to back?'' he asked, referring to the Hall of Fame
rider who won the 1884, 1890 and 1891 derbys. ``We've been around
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but no African-American has ridden in the Kentucky
Derby since Jess Conley in 1911. When asked to name the current
crop of black riders, St. Julien was silent.
</P>
<P>
   The Jockey's Guild has 900 registered riders, according to the
organization's national manager, John Giovanni. But race is not
specified in the registration process, and Giovanni said he could
not be sure how many African-Americans are actually riding. Best
guesses are less than 5 percent. This much is sure: None have made
a dent on the rich New York, California and Kentucky circuits.
</P>
<P>
   African-American jockeys began disappearing from the race tracks
as the last century turned and the economy shifted from agrarian to
industrial. ``Most were very young and either employees of the
farms or former slaves,'' said Phyllis Rogers of the Keeneland
Library in Lexington, Ky., which houses an extensive collection of
works about African-American riders of that era. ``Like a lot of
people at that time, they went to the cities for jobs in
manufacturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the disappearance of African-American
riders were factors such as the influx of new immigrants and the
difficulty of making weight, factors that are still at work today.
First, it was the Germans and Irish who began appearing as riders.
Now, jockeys from Latin America and the Caribbean are major players
at tracks across America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each generation of Americans has gotten bigger,'' Giovanni
said. ``It's hard to make the scales. We've seen the Latin riders
come. Now we have growth in women riders who don't have as
difficult a time making weight.''
</P>
<P>
   At Lone Star, a successful second-year track that is part of the
Texas-Louisiana-Arkansas circuit, St. Julien is known as a talented
money rider. Three weeks ago, he powered the Texas-bred Mocha
Express to an upset, come-from-behind-victory over a talented field
_ which included Bob Baffert's graded stakes winner, Anet _ to
capture the $200,000 Lone Star Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   For St. Julien, it was the richest victory of his career. For
many trainers here, it was a sign that the rider who has earned the
nickname ``The Saint'' wasn't going to be around much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robideaux, one of Lone Star's leading trainers, compares
St. Julien to Eddie Delahoussaye and Kent Desormeaux, whom he once
used as riders before they moved on to bigger tracks. ``He's a
strong finisher,'' Robideaux said. ``He can ride a speed horse. He
listens to instructions. He's got the timing, power and soft hands.
He's the best I've seen come up in a long time. He's ready for
California or New York right now.''

 GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas: right now.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   St. Julien was introduced to horse racing as a boy by his
mother, Cynthia Sargent, an elementary school teacher whose
brothers owned and raced thoroughbreds in the horse-crazy country
around Lafayette, La.
</P>
<P>
   As an honor student in high school, St. Julien was determined to
play football. He said he became obsessed with weight training and
dietary supplements enough to blow up to 140 pounds. A couple of
good hits at practice made him think it was less dangerous on top
of a 1,000-pound horse. He lost the weight, though not the
strength, and in the summer before his senior year applied for a
jockey's license. ``I was surprised and more than a little
scared,'' his mother recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to go to college,'' she said. ``I didn't want him
to get hurt. It crossed my mind that we hadn't seen but a few
African-American riders in the time we went to the races.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first month of his riding career, St. Julien had a nasty
spill at Evangeline. When he woke up at Lafayette General Hospital
with a fractured sternum, broken ribs, lacerated liver and ruptured
spleen, St. Julien told his mother he was college bound. But he
recovered ``too quickly and returned to the track,'' she said with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Harder to take, however, were the idle days he spent in the
jockey room waiting for a break. St. Julien is careful about
blaming racism for his slow start in Louisiana. But he conceded
that he got frustrated when his childhood friend Robbie Albarado
and other white riders got mounts he knew he could ride. ``I got
paranoid,'' St. Julien said. ``There's still a lot of prejudice in
this world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I might have lost some mounts.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is difficult to duck. Robideaux, who is based in
Louisiana, said St. Julien had to earn the benefit of the doubt in
the minds of some owners and trainers. Albarado, now based in
Kentucky, moved more quickly through the Louisiana circuit and this
year rode in the Kentucky Derby. Although he is a year younger than
St. Julien, Albarado has ridden nearly 2,000 more races, has 500
more victories and has earned more than $25 million in purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a few people tell me they would never ride him,''
said Richard Price, St. Julien's agent for the last two years,
``but eventually they come back around because he's a great
rider.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien has established a reputation as an intelligent,
hard-working rider who will exercise up to a dozen horses for
trainers in the mornings. Shy and easygoing off the track, he turns
professorial when breaking down a horse's workout performance as
the trainers step quickly to follow him back to the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an intelligent, very polite kid,'' said the trainer J.
Keith Desormeaux, whose brother Kent rides Real Quiet. ``I wanted
to put him on a horse before I ever saw him race because he has so
much respect for the game. Looking good on a horse, which he does,
is only half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to be level-headed. Not carouse at night. Show up in
the mornings. He does all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an urgency to St. Julien's climb up the jockey ladder.
He and his wife, Denise, are expecting their first child in the
winter. And though their addresses have changed over the years,
Vinton and Shreveport in Louisiana and now the Dallas area, their
home has remained the same: a 40-foot trailer. More than getting to
ride in the Kentucky Derby, St. Julien longs to land a job at a top
track and build a house for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, St Julien rode the fair circuit in California after
Gary Stevens, a Hall of Fame rider, encouraged him to go West. The
two met last year at the inaugural All-Star Jockey Challenge
created by Lone Star Park. Stevens was impressed with St. Julien
and said, ``He's got all the tools.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien did well on the fair circuit, then went to try his
luck at Santa Anita. He worked out horses but never got a mount,
which is not unusual for the toughest jockey colony in the country.
He was discouraged, but took heart in what Stevens told him one day
in the jockey room: that he had proved his talent. Now it was time
for patience.
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien said he had thought about that conversation a lot and
what it would take to reach the big time. ``I know about
patience,'' he said. ``I'll get there.''

JURORS DIVIDED OVER BALDWIN-PHOTOGRAPHER VERDICT; ACTOR MUST PAY
$4500

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the end, actor Alec Baldwin and tabloid
photographer Alan Zanger each were losers in Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   Losers, the jurors said Monday, because these two men should
have been adult enough to settle their differences without getting
into a fistfight, let alone take the brouhaha into court.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin, who must pay $4,500, failed to convince the jury that
Zanger invaded his privacy by videotaping him and his wife, Kim
Basinger, as they returned to their home in Woodland Hills, a Los
Angeles suburb, with their newborn daughter in 1995. And Zanger
failed to persuade the jury that Baldwin was liable for battery and
emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
   Both were found to be negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet attorneys for each man chose to describe their client the
winner in what amounted to a split-decision case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that they should be more respectful,''
Baldwin's attorney Philip D. Weiss said about paparazzi. ``We seem
to have found a profession that's one step below attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Zanger's attorney applauded the rejection of Baldwin's
invasion-of-privacy claim, stemming from the use of the videotape
camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First Amendment is alive and well in California,'' said
Leonard Steiner, although he added that Zanger was ``obviously
disappointed'' that the jury did not find in his favor on all
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the case would provide a legal legacy in the tense
relationship of celebrities and paparazzi was a matter of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see how it's going to stop the paparazzi. They didn't
have to pay any money. It's going to embolden them to be as bold as
they've ever been,'' said John Shaeffer, a partner with the law
firm of O'Donnell and Shaeffer, which handles entertainment cases.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Trappler, a videographer for Paparazzi TV who settled a
lawsuit against Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee for an undisclosed
sum, said the Baldwin-Zanger case is important for its message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photographers are now fighting back,'' Trappler said in a
statement released through his attorney Gloria Allred. ``This case
shows that photographers are people with rights, and they are not
going to be mistreated by celebrities and go silently into the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity photographer Russell Einhorn, who was awarded $600,000
in May after he filed a lawsuit against the Viper Room, was
dismayed by the verdict's finding about Zanger's negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was legally doing his so-called job,'' Einhorn
said. ``I think it was wrong that Alec Baldwin went ballistic on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors thought they all were losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally saw it as a case that probably shouldn't have
gone to the courts,'' said jury foreman Ronald G. Meyersburg, 49, a
business consultant from Sherman Oaks, a Los Angeles suburb.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Typically, civil court cases cost taxpayers about $3,053 a day,
according to county estimates. That brings the cost of the
seven-day Baldwin-Zanger trial at the Van Nuys Courthouse to
roughly $21,370.
</P>
<P>
   The two men scuffled after Baldwin confronted Zanger as he
videotaped the couple from inside the tinted-window camper shell of
a truck parked on a street across from their home.
</P>
<P>
   Zanger, who claimed to have suffered a broken nose and other
physical ailments in the fight, wanted at least $35,000 in damages
plus pain and suffering. He claimed his ailments cost him hundreds
of thousands of dollars in income after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jury rejected Baldwin's counterclaim of invasion of
privacy, the verdict wasn't unanimous. The jurors voted 9-3, with a
few jurors saying they felt Zanger went too far when he videotaped
the actor and his Oscar-winning wife as the couple returned from
the hospital with their new baby girl, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, jurors gave him minimal compensation: $4,500. They
awarded him for his damaged eyeglasses, a few days of missed work
and the medical treatment he sought immediately after the incident,
among other things. The figure represents $6,000 minus 25 percent.
The jury found Zanger one-quarter responsible for the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   They rejected his contention that he suffered vertigo because of
the episode and some jurors said they questioned the 54-year-old
photographer's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   As the court clerk read the verdict Monday, the 40-year-old
``Hunt for Red October'' star mouthed ``thank you'' to jurors. He
later shook their hands as they left the room.
</P>
<P>
   Zanger's lawyers, meanwhile, said the verdict affirmed their
client's right to take pictures on a public street. Zanger insisted
he won't do his job any differently.
</P>
<P>
   According to several jurors, the majority on the panel felt
Zanger had the right to photograph the star since he didn't
trespass on Baldwin's property.
</P>
<P>
   The jury decided that Zanger egged the actor on by loudly
demanding to take pictures after the actor asked him to leave. Nor
were jurors convinced that Baldwin acted out of self-defense,
despite the actor's insistence that he was merely fending off
Zanger when he knocked the camera into his face.
</P>
<P>
   Juror Karen Greenberg, an attorney from Woodland Hills, an
L.A.-area suburb, called the episode ``an unfortunate incident.
Both sides were at fault. Both sides could have avoided it if they
chose.''
</P>
<P>
   And while most of the jurors believed Zanger had the right to do
his job, a few believed Baldwin ``had a right, coming home from the
hospital, to have that private moment,'' Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Meyersburg, the jury foreman, who later called
the invasion-of-privacy claim ``the big issue here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my own personal consensus it's an issue that needs to be
addressed on a larger scale,'' Meyersburg said.
</P>
<P>
   While the jury also found Zanger negligent in the scuffle, they
declined to award Baldwin any damages, later explaining that
Baldwin hadn't asked for any.

UNCOMMON SACRIFICE EARNS HUNDLEY PRAISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Bernie Williams returned to the Yankees' defense
on Monday for the first time since June 10, he was not crouched
behind home plate clad in catcher's gear.
</P>
<P>
   What, Williams catch? ``Never,'' the Mets' Todd Hundley had said
a day earlier, responding to the suggestion in a tone of
incredulity. ``You kidding me? Never. He'd tell you to take a
hike.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, when the subject was broached before the Yankees'
doubleheader with Detroit, did not react so rudely. But the idea
was the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no way, man,'' he said, almost laughing. ``Are you kidding
me?''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who epitomizes so much of what has become right with
the Yankees, is back from an extended stay on the disabled list. He
missed 31 games, and even though the team's record during that
stretch does not reflect it, the Yankees missed him. In his first
three games back, including Monday's 4-3 loss to Detroit in the
first game, Williams collected 7 hits in 16 at-bats (raising his
average to .358), hit a home run and drove in five runs. He
returned to the lineup during the weekend but served as the
designated hitter for two games because the artificial turf at
Toronto's Skydome is no place to test a rehabilitated knee.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre sent Williams out to center field in the first
game on Monday, then made him the d.h. for the second game just to
make sure the right knee did not have to work overtime. But, Torre
said, it is center field from here on out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind I'm ready to play in the outfield,'' Williams
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   That means Joe Girardi and Jorge Posada can relax. Williams will
not cut into their playing time.
</P>
<P>
   At Shea Stadium, on the other hand, Hundley was in left field
for the seventh game on Monday night. A catcher by profession,
Hundley has turned to the outfield after elbow surgery as a way of
solving two problems _ his and the team's. In taking that step,
Hundley has shown himself to be a remarkable human being and an
even more remarkable athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows he's not selfish,'' Williams said, expressing
admiration for Hundley. ``He's not thinking about himself. He's
thinking about the team.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is one thing players want to avoid at all costs, it is
putting themselves in a position where they can embarrass
themselves. Volunteering for on-the-job major league training for
an alien position is doing exactly that. Hundley knew from the
moment he thought of the idea that he was putting himself precisely
in that precarious position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, I knew to begin with that a position change was going
to be a whole different world, and it is,'' Hundley said. So why
did he do it?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's better than not playing at all,'' he said. ``I could have
sat out the whole year and let my elbow recover. That would've made
me crazy. I'm fortunate enough that I'm in a position that I can
say, hey, I want to play left field, and a major league team will
let me play left field for them.''
</P>
<P>
   With only four weeks of preparation, in workouts and minor
league games, Hundley was sure to have a nightmarish game or two,
and last week he encountered his first. Every fly ball the
Philadelphia batters hit last Thursday night seemed to find
Hundley, and he butchered too many of them. But he survived the
nightmare, living to tell about it in a frank and admirable manner
rather than hiding in the trainer's room and pretending the world
did not see him make a fool of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude I've taken is go out and have fun,'' he said.
``The first couple games, I was nervous trying to be perfect. But
now it's, who cares? Go out there and have fun. I got the most
embarrassing night _ knock on wood _ out of the way. Now I'm not as
nervous getting to the ball park, not racking my brains, my guts
jumping all the time. Now it's more relaxed. I feel a lot more
comfortable out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley has won everlasting respect and appreciation from his
teammates for sacrificing himself for the team. He has returned to
play before his elbow would have allowed him to catch, and even if
he were ready to assume his real job, the Mets would have a dilemma
because in Hundley's absence, they acquired Mike Piazza to catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing it for the better of the team,'' John Franco said.
``He realizes he's not the best outfielder, but he also realizes
with his bat in the lineup, we're a better team. He's not
embarrassing the team. He might hurt the team with a couple of
plays, but if he lets in one and knocks in three, we'll take
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging how the players feel about their new left fielder,
Franco added: ``I don't think there's a guy in here who doesn't
appreciate what he's doing. Having his presence and his bat in the
lineup means a lot to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of Hundley's act can best be put in perspective
by understanding the feeling of most experienced outfielders about
changing positions _ in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to switch,'' said Brian McRae, the Mets' center
fielder, articulating a common view among outfielders. ``I can't
play anywhere but center. I've played center for eight years. I got
it down a little bit. I don't want to go and learn another
position. I'd be like Todd out there in left.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Hundley's presence in left temporary?
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on what Mike is going to do,'' he said of
Piazza, who will become a free agent after the season. ``I have no
problem playing on the same team with him. I might tell Steve
Phillips to take the catcher's gear and burn it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Neagle, Wohlers have pitching woes in 11-4 loss
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Splat.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves rotation gets kicked around like this once every 614
games, a fun fact that doesn't do much for Denny Neagle right now.
Nor reduce the trauma to his ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs tortured Neagle for the longest four innings of
his career Monday night, not letting go until the left-hander had
given up nine runs, two homers and suffered the ignominity of a
grand slam by sweet-swinging Kevin Tapani, the Cubs' starter.
Atlanta lost 11-4 in a homely session at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're out there,'' said Neagle, ``and you're
naked.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle (10-8), whose ERA has crept up from 3.01 to 3.62 since
May, has never given up so many runs, nor had any Atlanta starter
since John Smoltz was mugged in Cincinnati June 19,1994, when he
surrendered nine in a 12-4 loss. Neagle was hurt again by a
change-up that stayed up, a problem the club thought he'd corrected
last month but is now faced with again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm to the point where I'd get a guy 1-2 and I can't bury
him,'' said Neagle, who walked five and struck out five inbetween
eight hits. ``It used to be automatic. I'd get ahead with fastballs
and it was a no-brainer. I'd throw my change-up and I'd get a
pop-up or a ground ball. Now I'm getting ahead and I feel I have to
make a perfect pitch, even when it's 1-2 or 0-2.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wohlers made his third appearance since rejoining the club,
allowing two runs in the eighth inning on a double and four walks.
Seventeen of the last 18 pitches he threw were balls. Wohlers has
yielded five runs on four hits and six walks in his 1-2/3 innings
since returning to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have a good night, that's for sure,'' said manager
Bobby Cox. ``Yeah, there's some concern there. I'll be honest. It
wasn't real good again tonight. Hopefully, it'll get better. He's
getting some work, which we didn't know if we could get him in
there that many times. That part of it is okay but you'd like it a
little better than what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle gave up four runs in both the third and fourth innings
but the third will sting for some time, after he served up Tapani's
first homer, the first grand slam by a fellow pitcher in 23 months
(St. Louis' Donovan Osborne). The last slam by a Cubs pitcher came
off Burt Hooton's bat 26 years ago. Jeff Blauser, limited to just
one homer in his first Chicago season, nailed Neagle for a
three-run job in the fourth for a 9-0 lead. After allowing 18
homers in all of 1997, Neagle has given up 19 this year.

STAGE 1 ALERTS REVERSE 6-YEAR DECLINE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SMOG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Breaking a six-year streak of increasingly cleaner
air, Southern California already has suffered six times as many
Stage 1 smog alerts as last year _ and nearly as many as during the
entire 1996 smog season.
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys, and other parts of
the Southland received health advisories again Monday, warning that
``unhealthful air'' could increase the risk of breathing problems
for children, the elderly or people with respiratory diseases. By
last Friday, only seven weeks after the May 31 start of smog
season, Southern California has suffered six Stage 1 smog alerts _
compared to only one last year, and seven for the entire five-month
smog season in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our meteorologists have said the rest of the summer will be
very hot, with very strong inversion layers,'' said Sam Atwood,
spokesman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District. ``So
we are already smoggier this summer than last summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the cooling effects of El Nino, the 1998 smog season
kicked in at the end of June, a month late _ and later than any
other year on record, the AQMD reported.
</P>
<P>
   But it hit with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, during a record-breaking heat wave, the district
declared Stage 1 smog alerts on four days in parts of the Inland
Empire, and issued health advisories for parts of Los Angeles, and
the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Children at Arminta Street School in North Hollywood were placed
on an ``inclement weather'' schedule last week and again this week
said Sandy Carruthers, secretary to the principal. Students play
outside during the cooler morning hours, but spend most of their
lunchtime indoors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   While Providence St. Joseph's Medical Center in Burbank reported
an increase in patients with lung problems during the peak of the
heat wave last week, area hospitals reported there were no
additional respiratory illnesses related to the smog Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Air-quality officials attributed the clean air last year, and
the late start of smog season this year, to the cool, moist air
generated by El Nino, which kept hot inversion layers from trapping
pollutants over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what last year's good air quality was related to El
Nino, and we're seeing a more traditional weather pattern this
year, which leads to higher readings, higher smog levels,'' said
Peter Whittingham, deputy to Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, who
represents parts of the valleys and also serves on the AQMD board.
</P>
<P>
   Air-quality activists said the worsening smog should signal that
tougher pollution restrictions are needed in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a steady downward trend in air pollution over the past
20 years, ``Our air is dirtier and more unhealthful than any other
part of the county. And that's not just because of the weather,''
said Linda Waade, executive director of the Coalition for Clean
Air.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Ruderman-Feuer, an attorney with the Natural Resources
Defense Council, said the cleaner year last year was falsely
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people last year were hailing the cleaner year as being
the result of our great progress in the smog war,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an abnormality that last year was clean, but the
fact is that we have a lot of pollution in L.A. and we need to do
something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Air Resources Board, which regulates vehicle
emissions, will be taking up that issue at a workshop Wednesday on
new exhaust standards that would cut the average car's emissions by
84 percent by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The board is also proposing an even cleaner, ultra-low-emission
vehicle that would release only 6 percent of the pollution of an
average 1998 car. And it is proposing holding pickup trucks and
sport-utility vehicles to the same standard as passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the board expects that those measures will meet
resistance from auto makers, spokesman Rich Varenchik said they are
necessary to meet federal standards that require the state to
remove 2,000 tons of pollution per day from the air by 2010. &QL;
