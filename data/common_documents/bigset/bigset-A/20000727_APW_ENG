<HEADLINE> Spinal Tap Returns With Web Song  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Spinal Tap is back from the dead on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The spoof British band created for Rob Reiner's cult favorite
rockumentary ''This Is Spinal Tap'' from 1984 has recorded a new
song that will be available for download starting Thursday from
tongue-in-cheek Tapster.com.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back From the Dead'' features Michael McKean, who played
Spinal Tap's lead singer David St. Hubbins, Christopher Guest, who
was lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel, and Harry Shearer, who was bass
player Derek Smalls.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're putting it on the Internet because we want the people
who really care that we're still alive to have it in their hands
and their machinery and then in their ears,'' McKean said, copping
a British accent for a telephone interview in character as St.
Hubbins.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're a Spinal Tap fan, and God knows there aren't many of
them, we wanted to lay it on you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This Is Spinal Tap'' parodied a pretentious hard rock band
trying to soldier on despite a dwindling fan base. The movie is
being rereleased in theaters and on DVD and videotape in September.
</P>
<P>
   McKean, Guest and Shearer have periodically regrouped for
recordings, appearances and even a guest spot on ''The Simpsons.''
The new song fits the Spinal Tap theme, dealing with ''this bunch
of old dinosaur bones that can still move around,'' McKean said.
</P>
<P>
   Spinal Tap's future lies in a ''carefully regulated series of
breakups and comebacks,'' McKean said. ''That's what attracts the
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The group is using Tapster.com as a spoof of Napster, a site
that allows computer users to download copyrighted songs for free.
In a Spinal Tap news release, ''Tufnel'' said Napster simply offers
too many songs. A Federal judge on Wednesday barred the real
company, Napster, from trading music online pending a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the brilliant things about Tapster is that there's only
one song to choose from,'' Tufnel said.

<HEADLINE> Dems Beat GOP 13-8 in Baseball Game  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWIE, Md. (AP) -- Fired-up Democrats and Republicans chucked
their lawmaking duties Wednesday night for some real hardball. When
the dust settled, the Democrats were savoring a 13-8 drubbing of
the GOP, having broken a four-year losing streak in the 39th
congressional baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   They scored eight runs in the last inning to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats haven't been this happy since they controlled the
House,'' said former Rep. Marty Russo, D-Ill., who was announcing
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans led 8-5 at the top of the seventh, but Democrats
walked in three runs to tie the game. Then the GOP brought in their
fourth pitcher, Olympic miler Jim Ryun of Kansas, who promptly
allowed Rep. Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania, the game MVP, to drive in
two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ryun, playing in his first congressional ball game, walked the
next batter, then gave up two more runs to New Jersey Rep. Bill
Pascrell to make it 12-8. After the GOP replaced him with New
York's Vito Fossella, California Rep. Joe Baca stole home to make
it 13-8.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't win everything,'' Ryun said after the game. ''My
real motivation was to spend time with members in another
atmosphere other than the partisanship of the House floor.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was plenty of partisanship in the crowd of 2,948 at
Prince George's Stadium. Republicans tossed a hail of balls on the
field in the sixth, when umpires ruled Democratic Rep. Jay Inslee
unfairly tagged out trying to steal home with a ball thrown on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were without their primary threat, Steve Largent of
Oklahoma, who played but didn't pitch because of a sore arm.
Largent struck out on three pitches in his first at bat. Fellow
Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Coburn caught a foul tip off Largent's bat in
the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Seahawks wide receiver fared better in center field,
where he caught a fly ball from Rep. William Jefferson, D-La., for
the first out of the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We missed Steve, but we had some gamers,'' said Rep. Kenny
Hulshof, R-Mo., the Republican MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking forward next year -- we need to recruit a good,
common-sense conservative who happens to pitch,'' added Hulshof, a
first baseman who had two hits and an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., was 0 for 2 with an RBI on a fielder's
choice. He flew out to shortstop Anthony Weiner, D-N.Y., to end the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored annually by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, the
charity game raised an estimated $100,000 for charity.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes Social Security Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation to repeal a 1993 tax increase on
the Social Security benefits of millions of senior citizens is up
next for tax-cutting House Republicans, even as President Clinton
admonished the GOP to ''stop passing tax bills you know I'll
veto.''
</P>
<P>
   The House was to vote Thursday on the bill, which would reduce
taxes on Social Security for people with certain incomes -- above
$34,000 for individuals and above $44,000 for married couples --
from 85 percent of benefits to the pre-1993 level of 50 percent.
The bill's cost was estimated at $100 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said the original purpose of the tax increase -- reducing
the federal budget deficit -- has disappeared now that projections
indicate surpluses of $2 trillion over the next decade, not
counting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''The budget surplus is real, not imagined, and it means that
the tax is no longer needed,'' Archer, R-Texas, said Wednesday in a
letter to Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, money would be transferred out of the general
budget surplus to make up for any losses in Medicare, where the tax
proceeds are now transferred. About 9 million senior citizens now
pay the higher tax rate, a number expected to reach 13 million by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the bill's promise to use general tax revenue for
Medicare could come up short if the surplus projections are wrong.
They planned to offer an alternative that would cut the Social
Security tax for all but those beneficiaries with incomes above
$100,000 -- but only if the surplus actually materializes.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP bill, Summers said in his own letter, ''is the latest in
a series of costly and poorly targeted tax proposals'' to emerge in
Congress, reinforcing Clinton's comments at a news conference
Wednesday that this summer's series of tax cuts wasn't the wisest
use of the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say to Congress: Stop passing tax bills you know I'll
veto,'' Clinton told reporters at the White House. ''Start working
with us on a balanced budget that cuts taxes for middle-class
families, continues to pay off the national debt and invest in
America's future.''
</P>
<P>
   The president repeated his charge that the combined cost of all
GOP tax bills over the past two years -- some of which are
duplicates -- would all but consume the $2 trillion in budget
surpluses projected over the next decade, not counting money for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''In good conscience, I cannot sign one of these tax breaks
after another without any coherent strategy for safeguarding our
future and meeting other national priorities,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders also intended, as early as Thursday, to send the
president the marriage penalty bill passed last week that would
reduce income taxes by $292 billion over 10 years for millions of
married couples, including the 25 million who pay higher rates than
they would if single.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills have drawn veto threats, as has a bill to gradually
repeal inheritance taxes at a cost of $104 billion over 10 years.
House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said Republicans believe
the individual tax cuts are winners politically, especially if
voters think the surplus would otherwise be spent on government
programs.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton vetoes the marriage penalty bill, DeLay said an
attempt to override the veto with a two-thirds House vote would be
''the first order of business'' when lawmakers return in September
from their summer recess. The estate tax repeal bill, DeLay said,
will not reach Clinton's desk until September to allow voters a
chance during August to ''raise the pressure'' on the president to
sign the bill.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Reno Lawyer Got Info  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department searched a criminal
database for a lawyer from Attorney General Janet Reno's former
Miami firm and passed along the response in a deviation from normal
practice, current and former officials report.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to access the database was made by then-Associate
Attorney General John Schmidt, who overruled a subordinate when the
case arose in 1995 and defended his judgment in an interview
Wednesday. Reno had disqualified herself, telling aides in a memo
not to contact her in the case because ''a close personal friend''
was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Rebekah Poston, an acquaintance of Reno, sought arrest records
on a Japanese religious leader on behalf of a client. While Poston
successfully worked around the normal practice, she didn't get the
answer she wanted: She was informed there were no records on the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   Poston apparently was not the friend referred to in Reno's
recusal, although it may have been a lawyer in the same firm.
</P>
<P>
   House Government Reform Committee investigators, examining
whether Poston received favored treatment, also questioned in an
internal memo whether private investigators working for Poston
broke the law by surreptitiously obtaining information from the
database.
</P>
<P>
   The private investigators told Poston they initially learned
there was an entry about the religious leader but speculated that
it was deleted following their inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department chief spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed that
Reno and Poston worked for the same Miami law firm, Steel Hector &AMP;
Davis, but said they were employed there at different times. He
also confirmed that Poston's sister, Roberta Forrest, worked on
Reno's successful campaign as Florida state attorney for Dade
County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a practice of not providing information'' from the
database, Marlin said. ''In this case, we believed it was
appropriate to clear a person's name by indicating we had no
criminal record on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was associate attorney general and the third-ranking
Justice Department official in 1995. He said he recalls the 1995
decision but does not remember Poston.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt overruled the department's freedom of information
official, who initially turned Poston down because of the policy of
neither confirming nor denying information from the National Crime
Information Center database.
</P>
<P>
   Now a private attorney in Chicago, Schmidt said in an interview,
''I talked with anybody who wanted to complain about decisions made
within parts of the Justice Department that were my responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case we had no records. I concluded it made sense to
disclose that and put the matter to rest, and avoid the need to
litigate. I made exceptions in particular cases that did not
undermine the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts to reach Poston's lawyers were unsuccessful.
Government Reform Committee investigators, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said Poston told them that she believed the
department changed its practice in this case because of her strong
legal arguments. She pointed out, correctly, that federal privacy
law does not apply to foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to discuss the work of the private investigators,
the committee sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Billing records indicate Poston was hired in 1994 by the
Japanese Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai to obtain criminal justice
records on Nobuo Abe, who led a rival Buddhist sect called Nichiren
Shoshu. The lawyer was attempting to confirm an account that Abe
was arrested in Seattle in 1963 for soliciting prostitutes --
information that never was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Poston retained the private investigation firm Philip Manuel
Resource Group to determine whether Abe had a record in the
database, according to committee documents. Investigator Richard
Lucas wrote Poston that he learned from ''a source within the U.S.
government'' that there was ''an inquiry for information'' on Abe
by the Seattle Police Department -- but not an arrest record.
</P>
<P>
   A committee staff memo said it could violate the law to
surreptitiously obtain information from the database. A federal
statute makes it illegal to obtain any government record with
intent to use it for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hiring the investigators, Poston tried to obtain
information through a freedom of information request with Justice.
The request was denied on Feb. 3, 1995, because of the department's
policy on the database.
</P>
<P>
   Poston contacted high-level Justice Department officials at
least 22 times in an effort to reverse the denial, and in April
1995, Reno said she wanted no part of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, an attorney who is a close personal friend of mine
and participated in my confirmation hearing preparation, has
requested my intervention in the matter and I want to make it very
clear that I have chosen to disqualify myself from any
participation,'' Reno wrote in a memo to her staff. She did not
identify the individual who contacted her, although committee memos
said it was a now-deceased lawyer who worked for the Miami firm.

<HEADLINE> Caroline Kennedy Lauds Father  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The thousands of visitors who daily pass
through the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts see
little to recall the 35th president except a huge sculptured head
in the building's Grand Foyer.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy is out to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to forge a tighter bond between the center and her late
father -- and mother -- their 42-year-old daughter narrates a new
10-minute film debuting Friday that gives a brief history of the
center and includes clips of her father's speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Her role begins with a quotation from President Kennedy on art
as a ''contribution to the human spirit.'' In another segment, she
tells how President Eisenhower signed the law to create a National
Cultural Center, and how her mother, the late Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis, and Mamie Eisenhower helped lead the fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   The columned building along the Potomac River, with its concert
hall, opera house and six other stages, was named as a memorial to
Kennedy in 1965 after his assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am certain that after dusts of centuries have passed over
our cities,'' Kennedy says in the film, ''we too will be remembered
not by our victories or defeats in battle, but for our
contributions to the human spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter said in an interview that the film was part of a
larger effort to make the center more informative about the
dedication of her father and mother to the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the end of the year there will be some interactive
exhibits,'' she said. ''This is just a first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can see the film every quarter-hour on the Grand
Foyer's Millennium Stage, where the center presents a free program
of music, drama or dance every evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center's president, Lawrence J. Wilker, said there
is a plan for an ''enhanced Kennedy bust'' with quotations from his
speeches on a backdrop behind it. On either side video monitors
will tell the story of his presidency, with special attention to
commitment that he and his wife made to the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a short time it will give a full sense of what he was and
what his accomplishments were, especially for some of our younger
visitors who are not as well versed in history as they might be,''
Wilker said.
</P>
<P>
   In the two halls leading to the Grand Foyer, other monitors will
inform visitors about the center's programs. The new exhibits will
be ready in December, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caroline Kennedy, a mother of three, said she had no plans to
take part in the exhibits but that ''it would be great to do more''
for the center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that I have children of my own, I see how important it is
to get introduced early to the arts.''

<HEADLINE> States Warned About Medicaid Numbers  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than a dozen states falsely inflate their
Medicaid costs by temporarily transferring money into their public
nursing home programs, which then earn higher matching funds from
the federal government, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharply worded letter to officials in all 50 states on
Wednesday, the agency that ovesees Medicaid told states to stop the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, Timothy M. Westmoreland, director of the Health
Care Financing Administration, said many states allow their
Medicaid providers to keep only a fraction of the nearly $2 billion
generated by the transfers. In some cases, he said, as little as 5
percent is properly allocated.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Under the practice, which is legal, some states transfer either
their own funds, borrowed money, or property taxes into state
coffers to qualify for more matching funds. The states then siphon
off a portion of the federal funds to use for non-Medicaid
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The practice drives up the cost of Medicaid, the federal-state
program that provides health benefits to low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland said the states' estimates of federal Medicaid
spending for 2000 have already increased by $3.4 billion over
earlier projections -- with an estimated $1.9 billion due to the
states' fund-shifting.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA officials say they became concerned recently as some states
have gotten more creative with their transfer programs and bolder
about using the matching funds for programs other than Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Some states simply keep a portion of the money in their general
fund for other programs. A Department of Health and Human Services
official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said New Jersey has
used the money to fund tax cuts, while Kansas and Louisiana have
used it to trim budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Since January 1998, Nebraska has received $139 million in
matching Medicaid payments, but has paid only an estimated $500,000
to county-owned nursing homes that qualified for the money, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Seiffert, the administrator of the Nebraska Medicaid
program, said he wasn't familiar with the figure quoted, but
defended the state's use of Medicaid funds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that all our decisions on the use of federal
dollars are reasonable,'' he said. ''All expenditures are made in
accordance with our approved federal plan for Medicaid services.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Westmoreland said 17 states are using the
transfers to get extra federal funding and 11 others are
considering the practice.
</P>
<P>
   He said the HCFA's inspector general's office, which
investigates possible waste, fraud and abuse, is examining how
states are using the Medicaid funds. The General Accounting Office,
Congress' investigative and auditing arm, may also investigate, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Medicaid officials say they have been using the so-called
intergovernmental transfers for years without a peep from the HCFA.
They contend that a change could lead to service cuts or nursing
homes not being able to afford to take new Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some states could lose millions in Medicaid payments if the fund
transfers are stopped. It could dramatically reduce federal
matching funds in many states that have come to rely on the money
to shore up struggling county-run nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Intergovernmental transfers vary from state to state. Michigan
routes $300 million in state funds through county-run nursing homes
to increase its matching funds, which are then used for health
services for the poor. Louisiana plans to have county-run nursing
homes borrow money from banks and hand the funds over to the state,
which will use the money to boost what it can qualify for. The
loans are paid back out of the federal funds and nursing homes get
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid cost an estimated $181 billion last year. The federal
government's share was $103 million.

<HEADLINE> GOP Abortion Debate Struggling  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The struggle over the Republican Party's
position on abortion is shaping up as one-sided, a blow to GOP
abortion-rights activists already disappointed in George W. Bush's
choice of a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The group of platform committee members chosen to take up the
issue in pre-convention meetings Friday is led and dominated by
anti-abortion Republicans, a hurdle in attempts by the other side
to rewrite party principles.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is ''overloaded with those who disagree with us,''
Susan Cullman, head of the Republican Pro-Choice Coalition, said
Wednesday. ''It will be very hard to get a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said all along he would not push for changes in the
party's anti-abortion plank calling for a constitutional amendment
to ban abortion, even though he believes abortion should remain
legal in cases of rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that he would choose a running mate who supports abortion
rights -- several had been considered -- were dashed with the
selection of Dick Cheney. The former Wyoming congressman built a
strong anti-abortion voting record, although he has said more
recently that the party should be open to differing views on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion-rights coalition called Cheney ''reactionary'' on
issues important to women.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, the only opportunity for our party to show
respect for women is to abandon the platform language calling for a
constitutional amendment to ban all abortion, without exception,''
Cullman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not calling for a pro-choice platform. We're asking for
party principles that respect all our views.''
</P>
<P>
   Platform committee members are expected to meet privately
Thursday to receive a draft of the document.
</P>
<P>
   They will break into eight groups Friday, each dealing with
different parts of the platform, and go over the language line by
line, recommending changes. The full committee will sign off on the
platform Saturday, two days before the national convention opens.
</P>
<P>
   The ''family and community'' subcommittee is led by two
anti-abortion rights Republicans: Chris Georgacas, former state
party chairman in Minnesota; and Ellen Sauerbrey, a two-time
candidate for Maryland governor.
</P>
<P>
   Cullman said the panel, with about 15 members, has at least
three abortion-rights members she knew of.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the rest are social conservatives, she said. Among them
is Illinois Rep. Henry J. Hyde, who as 1996 platform committee
chairman oversaw a process that turned divisive when party factions
fought over an attempt to moderate abortion principles.
</P>
<P>
   The effort failed even though it had the support of the nominee,
Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Although the panel's makeup favors the party's social
conservative base, contrary views on abortion at least are expected
to get an airing. One of the members is Candace Straight of New
Jersey, head of a political action committee that raises money for
abortion-rights candidates for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights activists have said they will try to bring the
issue to the convention floor if the platform is left unchanged.
The rules, however, make such a challenge difficult.

<TEXT>

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Kirk Douglas has avoided
helicopters ever since escaping from one that crashed in 1991. But
the king of Jordan finally made him an offer he couldn't refuse: A
scenic tour of his kingdom by royal chopper.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hadn't ridden in a helicopter since the accident but I had
no fear at all,'' the actor said last week. ''I guess I'm a
fatalist. I figured, what are the chances that I would have two
helicopter crashes in my lifetime?''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, 83, suffered cuts and bruises when the helicopter he
was riding in collided with a small plane over Santa Paula in 1991.
Two people in the plane were killed.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the Middle East recently to dedicate two playgrounds
in Jerusalem, one for Jewish children and one for Arab children,
that he and his wife, Anne, financed. It was his first lengthy trip
since suffering a stroke in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''King Hussein had seen me accepting my honorary Oscar at the
Academy Awards in 1996, my first public appearance since my
stroke,'' he said. ''He invited me to come and visit him. After he
died, his son Abdullah repeated the invitation, So I decided to
go.''

   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- Some big name entertainers are
rallying behind a rap star who is serving a prison term for
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Recording artists such as LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes, Redman, Nas
and pop singer Britney Spears are among those lending their support
to Keith Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 25, is serving a three year prison term after his
conviction for taking part in a 1995 fight at The Sting, a New
Britain nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said he beat David Hughes, 16, with a bar stool,
leaving him with disfiguring scars on his head. Murray began
serving his sentence in October 1998 after his appeals were
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   At a New York City news conference Tuesday, Joseph Moniz, an
attorney handling Murray's appeal, said there is new evidence that
justifies a new trial including allegations that some helpful
witnesses were scared away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Keith told me he was innocent and I knew he wasn't lying,''
said Erick Sermon, a member of the Def Squad rap group that
included Murray and rapper Redman.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's first album, ''The Most Beautiful Thing in the World,''
went gold after its release in 1994. His second album, ''Enigma,''
also sold well after its 1996 release.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a shift from matrimony to manhunt, the
television network that brought viewers the Darva Conger-Rick
Rockwell wedding is now on the prowl for the country's most
appealing single man.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Sexiest Bachelor in America,'' a two-hour special, is
scheduled to air Oct. 2 on Fox, the network announced Wednesday. It
will feature 50 men -- one from each state -- and will be broadcast
from the MGM Grand hotel and casino in Las Vegas. All of the judges
will be women.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also broadcast the much-maligned ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' special that rocketed Conger and Rockwell to
short-lived fame.
</P>
<P>
   The network has established a Web site, www.sexiestbachelor.com,
for people interested in entering the pageant. But be forewarned:
The competition includes both a formal wear and bathing suit
competition as men are judged on their ''looks, style and
personality.'' Any male U.S. resident who is single and 21 or older
may enter.

<P>
   But in a boost to non-technology stocks, the second-quarter

   With labor costs under control, it could be enough for the

<HEADLINE> GOP Weighs House Vote on Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Eager to clear some budget business before
Congress' summer recess, Republicans prepared to bring a package to
the House floor Thursday that would finance several agencies'
budgets and repeal the federal tax on telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and the Clinton administration, however, were unhappy
with the measure, which raised questions about whether the GOP
would be able to achieve its goal. Thursday's session was likely to
be Congress' last until September.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to ease various objections from members of both parties,
Republicans had already dropped provisions that would have boosted
the $5.15 hourly minimum wage by $1 over two years, and cut taxes
for some small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thursday morning, that left them with a measure containing
$30.3 billion for the Treasury Department and several smaller
agencies next year; $2.5 billion for Congress' own operations, and
elimination of the 3 percent federal excise tax on telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of that measure would let Republicans take some of the
load off what looms as a frantic September, when lawmakers will be
trying to adjourn quickly so they can campaign for re-election.
Republicans worry President Clinton will have leverage over
spending bills negotiated in September.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's an appealing package that would be difficult for
him (the president) to veto,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the
No. 3 House GOP leader.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained that the package was still about $300
million short of the $8.9 billion Clinton wants for the Internal
Revenue Service and cut some of his other proposals. Some lawmakers
were also unhappy that the bill did not include provisions from an
earlier version that would have eased restrictions on travel with
Cuba and U.S. sales of food and drugs there.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were also upset that the Senate has not yet debated
its own version of the Treasury spending measure. They want to use
that bill for debate over a GOP-written provision blocking
preferences Smith &AMP; Wesson would receive from federal agencies as a
result of the arms maker's agreement to begin using trigger locks
and other safety steps.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Democrats continued stalling work in the Senate
because of GOP leaders' failure to act on some of Clinton's
judicial nominees. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
conceded that his chamber was unlikely to vote on the spending
package until September.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding GOP problems, some conservatives were unhappy with
spending increases in the bill. The measure would add $1.2 billion
to the House's original $29.1 billion Treasury spending bill, which
had received a White House veto threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're hearing from reports raises serious questions,''
Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office, said of
the new spending package.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the extra money was expected to go to home-state
projects requested by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   One participant said it included $3.2 million to consolidate
some federal law enforcement agencies in St. Petersburg, Fla., a
city represented by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill
Young, R-Fla. Also included was $2.5 million for a road to be built
by the General Services Administration in Columbus, N.M., home
state of Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., a member of the Senate
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also would allow members of Congress' salaries to
rise by 2.7 percent next year, to $145,100.

<HEADLINE> Miller Relaces Coverdell in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a ceremony more somber than celebratory,
former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller was sworn in Thursday to fill the
Senate seat left vacant by the death of Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to taking the oath from Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the
president pro tem, Miller watched from the gallery as predecessors
eulogized Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's first floor speech was dominated by memories of his
Republican predecessor. The new Democratic senator acknowledged the
emotional response by senators last week when word spread that one
of their colleagues had died.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank you for your words, your tears and your testimonies
for one of Georgia's finest sons,'' Miller said. ''You who served
with Paul knew him well. I served with Paul and knew him well
also.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's unexpected death July 18 following a stroke made for
a low-key swearing-in ceremony. Fellow senators welcomed him
warmly, applauding lightly after he officially became the state's
junior senator, cutting the Republican majority to 54-46.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows we have heavy hearts,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss. ''We appreciate the way he has approached this
already. He is one of our colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I will serve no single political party, but rather 7&AMP;frac12; million
Georgians,'' Miller said. ''And every day I serve, I will do my
best to do so in the same spirit of dignity, integrity and
bipartisan cooperation that were the hallmarks of Paul Coverdell's
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Coverdell and
Miller have many similarities, despite their political differences.
''Like Paul Coverdell, Zell Miller builds bridges, not walls,''
Daschle said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Drops 116; Dow Adds 27  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday as technology shares
fell after some disappointing earnings reports from Amazon.com and
Nokia Corp., but blue-chips were rebounding thanks to an
encouraging inflation reading.
</P>
<P>
   At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
27.45 at 10,545.11.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index was down 116.47 at 3,871.25, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 was down 2.36 at 1,450.03.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell $5.50 to $30.313 after the online retailer
reported lower than expected revenues late Wednesday. The data
reinforced growing pessimism about the company's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amazon has perhaps the best franchise in the sector and they
are having trouble meeting revenue estimates ... and that hurts the
entire tech sector,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist for SG Cowen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In another hit to tech stocks, wireless equipment maker Nokia
said third-quarter earnings per share will likely fall from
second-quarter levels due to the timing of new product
introductions and seasonal factors. Nokia dropped $12.375 to
$42.688.
</P>
<P>
   But in a boost to non-technology stocks, the second-quarter
reading of the government's employment-cost index, a widely watched
inflation gauge, met forecasts. The index, which measures wages as
well as fringe benefits, rose 1 percent after increasing 1.4
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With labor costs under control, it could be enough for the
Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets
next month.
</P>
<P>
   That particularly helped interest-rate sensitive financial
services issues, such as Mellon Financial, up 75 cents to $38.375.
</P>
<P>
   Biotech stocks were rising after a glowing earnings report late
Wednesday from Amgen, which was up 0.625 cents to $70.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital stocks continued to add to their recent rally, as the
nation's largest hospital chain, HCA, added $1.06 to $32.675.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 553.45 million
shares, up from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 10.32 at
503.49.

<HEADLINE> Investigators: Osprey Pilot Erred  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Marine Corps investigators have concluded that
the pilot of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft that crashed in the Arizona
desert in April, killing 19 Marines, erred by hurrying his descent
upon approaching Marana airport, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the investigators' final report were to be released
later in the day at a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot's too-rapid approach produced a phenomenon known as
''vortex ring state'' -- essentially a stall, the investigators
concluded. The Osprey plunged into a fatal nose dive, killing the
crew of four and their 15 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the worst aviation disaster for the Marines since
22 were killed in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps halted flights of its remaining Ospreys after
the April 8 accident, then resumed flying in early June.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps, which had previously announced that
investigators found no evidence of mechanical, engineering or
structural flaws in the Osprey, ascribed the cause of the crash to
''human factors.'' Officials said they would not label it as
''pilot error,'' although they acknowledged that the aircraft
commander, Maj. John Brow -- considered one of the Marines' most
skilled pilots -- committed mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Brow brought the Osprey into its approach to Marana airport at a
rate of descent far in excess of the plane's maximum safe descent
rate of 800 feet per minute, officials familiar with the
investigation have said. What remained a mystery is why Brow did
this. The plane had no cockpit voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rapid rate of descent and a slow forward air
speed, the Osprey lost lift, investigators previously disclosed. It
was less than 300 feet off the ground when it flipped to the right
and plunged nose first into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey is unique in its ability to take off like a
helicopter, rotate its propellers 95 degrees and fly like an
airplane. A group of four Ospreys were participating in a mock
''noncombatant evacuation'' exercise at Marana, about 30 miles
northwest of Tucson, when Brow's aircraft crashed and burned.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers -- Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron -- are
due to deliver 11 Ospreys to the Marines this year. Eventually the
Marines are to field 360 of them to replace the corps' Vietnam-era
CH-46 helicopters as the primary means of transporting troops into
combat from ships offshore.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force and the U.S. Special Operations Command are to buy
a smaller number of Ospreys.

<HEADLINE> Sherwood Schwartz Gives Comedy Tips  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Does Sherwood Schwartz, creator of ''The
Brady Bunch'' and ''Gilligan's Island,'' know the value of
one-liners? C'mon. Does Jan envy Marcia? Are the castaways TV's
real survivors?
</P>
<P>
   The 83-year-old Schwartz, asked about his health, complains of a
pulled muscle. ''I told my wife I shouldn't take Viagra,'' he says,
his face a study in deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who wrote for Bob Hope, prince emeritus of the
punchline. But to Schwartz, a sitcom that relies on cheap laughs is
taking a misguided approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think writers have become hypnotized by the number of jokes
on the page at the expense of character,'' Schwartz said. ''When
you say the name Gilligan, you know who that is. If a show is good,
if it's written well, you should be able to erase the names of the
characters saying the lines and still be able to know who said it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can't do that, the show will fail,'' said Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   He gets no disagreement from comedy comrades Garry Marshall
(''Laverne &AMP; Shirley,'' ''Happy Days''), Norman Lear (''All in the
Family,'' ''The Jeffersons'') and Carl Reiner (''The Dick Van Dyke
Show'').
</P>
<P>
   The television veterans gathered recently at a Beverly Hills
lunch that was both a tribute to them and a 15th birthday
celebration for Nick at Nite, the cable channel that provides a
cozy retirement home for old sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Nick at Nite is running favorite episodes
handpicked by Schwartz, Marshall, Lear, Reiner and James L. Brooks
(''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ''Taxi'') intercut with their
comments. The ''creators salute'' begins at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Did they know they were writing for the ages -- or at least the
decades?
</P>
<P>
   ''No,'' replied Schwartz. ''If you think that, you're a fool.
Unless you're Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the start they knew how to write for television, a new
medium that played by old rules: Give the audience engaging
characters in compelling circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall recalled advice he got from Reiner, his onetime boss.
</P>
<P>
   '''You write jokes. Nobody wants that. Write a story.' And he
allowed me to learn how to write a story on 'The Dick Van Dyke
Show,''' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner's creation of the 1961-66 CBS series starring Van Dyke
and Mary Tyler Moore, a behind-the-scenes look at a fictional TV
comedy, illustrates that the best work is the most heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   A regular on Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca's famed 1950s revue
''Your Show of Shows,'' Reiner saw that sitcoms were the hot new
opportunity. He also figured he could write a better series than
the scripts coming his way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I asked myself a question: What piece of ground do I stand on
that nobody else stands on?'' Reiner recounted. ''Well, you live in
New Rochelle, you have a wife and two kids and you work in
television on a variety show.''
</P>
<P>
   The starring role, that of head comedy writer on the imaginary
''The Alan Brady Show,'' ended up going to Van Dyke, while Reiner
was launched as a producer, writer and director. TV got one of its
all-time great sitcoms. (Reiner, who played the neurotic Alan, has
said he suspects the network thought he was ''too Jewish'' for the
lead.)
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz looked outward for inspiration for ''Gilligan's
Island'' and ''The Brady Bunch.'' As fluffy as the sitcoms might
be, serious reflection went into both.
</P>
<P>
   The former was ''my version of a social microcosm where seven
people from various backgrounds had to learn to live together,''
Schwartz said. The latter was inspired by a newspaper article about
the rising number of second marriages and families with
stepchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realized change was occurring, that the traditional nuclear
family was being replaced by other forms of marriage and
relationships,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz and his fellow TV pioneers aren't living in the past.
Marshall, 65, is a film director (''Runaway Bride'') who also acts
(''A League of Their Own''). Reiner, 78, acts (''The Adventures of
Rocky &AMP; Bullwinkle'') and writes (''How Paul Robeson Saved My
Life,'' a short-story anthology). Lear, 78, produces and works with
his political advocacy group People for the American Way. And
Schwartz delights in hearing parallels drawn between ''Gilligan's
Island'' and the reality show ''Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, however, works very nicely for Nick at Nite. Coupled
with daytime partner Nickelodeon, it helps make up one of cable
TV's most popular channels.
</P>
<P>
   The durability and popularity of sitcoms makes sense to Jim
Burns, Nick at Nite's senior vice president for programming.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're funny. They're still funny,'' he says. And then
there's the nostalgia factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people remember not only what they were watching but
that they were watching with their parents,'' Burns said. ''They
remember the carpeting in the room they were watching, that they
lay on the floor and they remember they had shag carpeting because
they used to put their fingers through it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a real visceral memory to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clever packaging is also part of Nick at Nite's appeal. During a
''Bewitched'' marathon, viewers had the chance to choose actor Dick
York or successor Dick Sargent as their favorite Darrin (York won),
while a new Brady sister, Phoebe, suddenly appeared in episodes of
''The Brady Bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   It was explained that Phoebe had been previously ''edited out''
for her un-Brady ways. It's dead-on satire but lovingly delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to understand what makes a show resonate with the
audience. ... I don't think we have a jaundiced view,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>

   BROKAW ON HATE: In the last two years, America has witnessed a
rash of hate crimes against gays, blacks, Jews and Asian Americans.
Why? One of the more powerful tools for spreading hate now seems to
be the Internet. In a one-hour ''Dateline NBC'' entitled ''Web of
Hate,'' Tom Brokaw reports on how Benjamin Smith, an educated young
man with a diverse group of friends, came to embrace racial hatred.
Smith, an unassuming English major at Indiana University, went on a
multi-state shooting rampage last July that left two dead and nine
wounded, all of them black, Asian or Jewish. Then he killed
himself. Brokaw examines what may have provoked Smith's attacks,
learns the source of his white supremacist ideas, and discovers
that the answers may have been just a few computer key strokes
away. Brokaw's report airs tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern.

<HEADLINE> Oprah Copyright Suit To Go on Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A lawsuit accusing Oprah Winfrey of using
copyrighted pictures in her best-selling book will go to trial next
month, a federal judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ruben Castillo this week issued an opinion saying
photographers Paul Natkin and Stephen Green own the copyright on 11
pictures in the book. But the judge said only a trial can decide
whether Winfrey was licensed to put them in ''Make the Connection:
Ten Steps to a Better Body and Better Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey claims she paid the photographers more than $250,000 for
the license to use the pictures not only in the book, but anywhere
she wants.
</P>
<P>
   Natkin and Green said the money allowed Winfrey to put the
photos in publicity packages for her TV talk show but not in the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Winfrey was out of the country and unavailable for comment
Wednesday. But attorney Charles Babcock said she likely would be on
hand for the trial and take the stand herself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's face it,'' he said. ''She'll make an awfully strong
witness.''

<HEADLINE> Oasis Walks Off Stage at Concert  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NYON, Switzerland (AP) -- Oasis left the stage at a Swiss rock
festival after band members complained that concert-goers threw
bottles and cans on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Approximately 30 minutes into the performance, several
bottles, cans and coins were thrown on the stage, hitting several
band members,'' the band said in a release. ''Liam Gallagher and
the other members of Oasis walked off stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers at the annual Paleo Festival near Geneva said the
British band's decision was ''totally irrational and motivated by a
paranoid reflex.'' They said Gallagher insulted festival-goers and
his ''arrogant and provocative attitude'' incited the reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Oasis apologized to fans ''who were unfortunately robbed of what
started out as a fantastic show.''

<HEADLINE> Goldie Hawn Protests Use of Her Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Goldie Hawn doesn't see any humor in a
timber sale that resembles her name.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Bureau of Land Management named a 100-acre timber sale
the ''Goldie Fawn'' sale, prompting the actress to fire off an
angry letter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must insist that you desist from using my name (in)
association with such a destructive proposal,'' Hawn wrote in a
letter dated July 11.
</P>
<P>
   The project, which calls for logging Douglas firs near the
headwaters of two creeks, has drawn criticism from officials who
say it threatens drinking water and salmon spawning habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Hawn's secretary, Deloris Horn, confirmed the letter's contents
and stressed that Hawn is not an anti-logging spokeswoman. ''But
she doesn't want to see beautiful timber land destroyed in her
name,'' Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hershey, natural resource staff administrator at the BLM's
Salem office, could not say whether the person who named the sale
was thinking of Goldie Hawn. But he said managers take occasional
liberties when naming timber sales, such as ''Rusty Saw,'' ''Hide
and Seek'' and ''Sinker Swim.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If it offends her, we can change the name,'' he said. ''It's
not a big deal.''

<HEADLINE> Reno Lawyer Won't Discuss Efforts  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawyer from Attorney General Janet Reno's
former Miami firm cited attorney-client privilege Thursday and
declined to discuss her efforts to obtain confidential information
from a Justice Department criminal database. The department
provided a response to the lawyer in a deviation from normal
practice, according to current and former department officials.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to access the database was made by then-Associate
Attorney General John Schmidt, who overruled a subordinate when the
case arose in 1995. He defended his judgment in an interview
Wednesday. Reno had disqualified herself, telling aides in a memo
not to contact her in the case because ''a close personal friend''
was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Rebekah Poston, an acquaintance of Reno, sought arrest records
on a Japanese religious leader on behalf of a client. While Poston
successfully worked around the normal practice, she didn't get the
answer she wanted: She was informed there were no records on the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   Poston apparently was not the friend referred to in Reno's
recusal, although it may have been a lawyer in the same firm.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would describe my relationship with Janet Reno on more of a
professional basis, certainly a friend,'' Poston told the House
Government Reform Committee at a hearing. But she cited
attorney-client privilege repeatedly when asked about her quest for
the database information.
</P>
<P>
   Committee investigators, examining whether Poston received
favored treatment, also questioned in an internal memo whether
private investigators working for Poston broke the law by
surreptitiously obtaining information from the database.
</P>
<P>
   The private investigators told Poston they initially learned
there was an entry about the religious leader but speculated that
it was deleted following their inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department chief spokesman Myron Marlin confirmed that
Reno and Poston worked for the same Miami law firm, Steel Hector &AMP;
Davis, but said they were employed there at different times. He
also confirmed that Poston's sister, Roberta Forrest, worked on
Reno's successful campaign as Florida state attorney for Dade
County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a practice of not providing information'' from the
database, Marlin said. ''In this case, we believed it was
appropriate to clear a person's name by indicating we had no
criminal record on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt was associate attorney general and the third-ranking
Justice Department official in 1995. He said he recalls the 1995
decision but does not remember Poston.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt overruled the department's freedom of information
official, who initially turned Poston down because of the policy of
neither confirming nor denying information from the National Crime
Information Center database.
</P>
<P>
   Now a private attorney in Chicago, Schmidt said in an interview,
''I talked with anybody who wanted to complain about decisions made
within parts of the Justice Department that were my responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this case we had no records. I concluded it made sense to
disclose that and put the matter to rest, and avoid the need to
litigate. I made exceptions in particular cases that did not
undermine the policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts to reach Poston's lawyers were unsuccessful.
Government Reform Committee investigators, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said Poston told them that she believed the
department changed its practice in this case because of her strong
legal arguments. She pointed out, correctly, that federal privacy
law does not apply to foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to discuss the work of the private investigators,
the committee sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Billing records indicate Poston was hired in 1994 by the
Japanese Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai to obtain criminal justice
records on Nobuo Abe, who led a rival Buddhist sect called Nichiren
Shoshu. The lawyer was attempting to confirm an account that Abe
was arrested in Seattle in 1963 for soliciting prostitutes --
information that never was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Poston retained the private investigation firm Philip Manuel
Resource Group to determine whether Abe had a record in the
database, according to committee documents. Investigator Richard
Lucas wrote Poston that he learned from ''a source within the U.S.
government'' that there was ''an inquiry for information'' on Abe
by the Seattle Police Department -- but not an arrest record.
</P>
<P>
   A committee staff memo said it could violate the law to
surreptitiously obtain information from the database. A federal
statute makes it illegal to obtain any government record with
intent to use it for personal gain.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hiring the investigators, Poston tried to obtain
information through a freedom of information request with Justice.
The request was denied on Feb. 3, 1995, because of the department's
policy on the database.
</P>
<P>
   Poston contacted high-level Justice Department officials at
least 22 times in an effort to reverse the denial, and in April
1995, Reno said she wanted no part of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, an attorney who is a close personal friend of mine
and participated in my confirmation hearing preparation, has
requested my intervention in the matter and I want to make it very
clear that I have chosen to disqualify myself from any
participation,'' Reno wrote in a memo to her staff. She did not
identify the individual who contacted her, although committee memos
said it was a now-deceased lawyer who worked for the Miami firm.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Falls 116; Dow Gains 51  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday as technology shares
fell after some disappointing earnings reports from Amazon.com and
Nokia, but blue-chips were rebounding thanks to a benign inflation
reading.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 51.62 at 10,565.11.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index was down 116.47 at 3,871.25, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 was down 2.36 at 1,450.03.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell $5.50 to $30.313 after the online retailer
reported lower than expected revenues late Wednesday. The data
reinforced growing pessimism about the company's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amazon has perhaps the best franchise in the sector and they
are having trouble meeting revenue estimates ... and that hurts the
entire tech sector,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist for SG Cowen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In another hit to tech stocks, wireless equipment maker Nokia
warned third-quarter earnings per share will likely fall from
second-quarter levels due to the timing of new product
introductions. Nokia dropped $13.375 to $41.125.
</P>
<P>
   But in a boost to non-technology stocks, the second-quarter
reading of the government's employment-cost index, a widely watched
inflation gauge, met forecasts. The index, which measures wages as
well as fringe benefits, rose 1 percent after increasing 1.4
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   If labor costs are indeed under control, it could be enough for
the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The employment costs report did help some Old Economy stocks
such as Coca-Cola, up $2 to $60.625 and interest-rate sensitive
financial services issues, such as American Express, up $2.125
cents to $57.25.
</P>
<P>
   With traders uncertain what the Fed will do with interest rates
and lackluster earnings reports defining the market activity,
stocks have been largely drifted downward in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   One exception has been hospital stocks, which continued to add
to their recent rally Thursday, as the nation's largest hospital
chain, HCA, added $1.313 to $33.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about energy prices is pushing oil service stocks
ahead, including Exxon Mobil, up $2.50 to $78.375.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 784.45 million
shares, up from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 10.67 at
503.17.

<HEADLINE> Day of Mourning for Concorde Victims  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOENCHENGLADBACH, Germany (AP) -- Margret Frentzen longed for
adventure. Her husband, Klaus, preferred to spend his vacations
fixing up the couple's property.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, she celebrated her 50th birthday and got her way:
The couple dipped into their savings and booked an extravagant trip
for a family living on a teacher's salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was always reminiscing about her summer vacations up north
as a child,'' recalled Guenther Robert, a retired butcher who lived
next door to the couple for 18 years in the western city of
Moenchengladbach. ''She was always lamenting, 'If only Klaus would
do that ...'''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the mass-circulation Bild Zeitung newspaper carried
a photo of the Frentzens in a front-page spread featuring snapshots
of 29 of Germany's 96 Concorde crash victims. The couple was
dressed formally, Margret wearing a high-collared black-and-red
blouse, Klaus wearing a silk bow tie and suit.
</P>
<P>
   The collection of family photos, some out of focus, brought home
the depth of the tragedy as Germany observed a national day of
mourning. Whether they were teachers or soccer coaches, cabinet
makers or executives, business owners or medal of honor holders,
the Concorde flight and the prospect of 16 days on a luxury cruise
liner was a once-in-a-lifetime event.
</P>
<P>
   There was 71-year-old Fritz Schmidt from Isernhagen who worked
as a cabinet maker. A neighbor recalled the last time he saw him:
''He left with two suitcases at 8:30 a.m. and said, 'I'll be gone
eight weeks. I need to enjoy myself a bit.'''
</P>
<P>
   Helga and Friedrich Werth, ages 59 and 61, pictured sitting at a
dinner party sipping wine, had planned the trip so Friedrich, the
head of a large advertising agency in Cologne, could get a break
from the office after a heart attack two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bespectacled and balding, Karl-Heinz Seeber, 68, died with his
69-year-old wife Renate. The Berlin salesman was remembered for
having been awarded the federal medal of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Fassnacht and his wife Sigrid were shown standing in
front of shelves of perfume in one of their Cologne-based chain of
perfume stores. Fassnacht, 66, had coached three German soccer
clubs from 1970-73.
</P>
<P>
   Though he only stayed half a season in Berlin, club director
Klaus Schumann remembered him as a dedicated coach, urging his
players on during games.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to watch him from the stands,'' Schumann said. ''He was
very committed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another couple, Andreas and Maria Schranner, 64 and 62, made
millions from the sale of their bus company a few years ago and
regularly went on cruises. Two other recent retirees, Rolf and
Doris Madry, 68 and 64, had saved for years from their post office
salaries to afford the trip they'd long dreamed of.
</P>
<P>
   So it was, too, with the Frentzens -- among 13 citizens of
Moenchengladbach killed in the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Robert, their neighbor, remembered Klaus Frentzen, 53, as a
teacher beloved by his students. While he preferred fixer-up
projects to vacations, he was an avid skier and the two men
belonged to the same ski club, Robert said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They weren't big spenders. They always saved their money,'' he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Robert learned the Frentzens were on the crashed jet only
Wednesday morning when he went to a regular card game. Another
acquaintance also booked on the cruise, the mayor's protocol chief,
Bernd Coentges, had taken another flight and was all right, other
players told him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say what kind of feeling I have now'' to suffer grief
at the loss of one friend and relief at the escape of another,
Robert said.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, Moenchengladbach struggled to confront the loss. The
local soccer club, one of the oldest and most popular in Germany,
canceled fireworks planned to celebrate its season opener Saturday
-- the same day the city plans a memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Coentges and other cruise passengers from Moenchengladbach who
decided against flying on the Concorde planned to go ahead with the
cruise. Aboard the MS Deutschland in New York, Coentges told the
Rheinische Post the captain called them together and said for the
sake of the other 500 passengers, the cruise had to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the absence of the Concorde passengers made itself felt.
''We had already determined the seating arrangements at dinner,''
Coentges told the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Election Facts  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Details of the Yugoslav general elections called by
President
Slobodan Milosevic for Sept. 24:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   -- For the first time, voters in the Yugoslav federation -- Serbia
and Montenegro -- will directly elect the president. Previously, the
president was chosen by the Yugoslav parliament. Milosevic is for
now the only candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FEDERAL ELECTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   -- Upper House of Parliament, or Chamber of Republics: Voters in
Serbia and Montenegro will select 20 legislators from each republic
to the 40-seat chamber.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lower House of Parliament, or Chamber of Citizens: Voters in
Serbia will elect 108 deputies and Montenegrin voters 30 deputies
to the 138-seat lower house.
</P>
<P>
   -- For lower house races, electoral districts have been redrawn
to allot Serbia 26 districts instead of the previous 29 while
Montenegro remains a single election district.
</P>
<P>
   -- Three election districts previously covering the territory of
Kosovo have been merged with two other districts of Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL ELECTIONS:
</P>
<P>
   -- Local elections will be held only in Serbia because the
Montenegrin parliament has not called for balloting there.
</P>
<P>
   -- Voters in municipalities, towns and cities will elect their
governments and local assembly deputies. The majority of Serbia's
towns and cities are currently run by Milosevic's opponents, after
the opposition won the last local ballot in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   -- Balloting will also take place for the assembly of Vojvodina,
Serbia's northern province with a substantial Hungarian minority.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   All races are decided by a simple majority regardless of the
turnout.

<HEADLINE> Pavarotti Agrees To Pay Back Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- It's not over until the fat guy writes a check.
</P>
<P>
   Luciano Pavarotti brought down the curtain Thursday on a
four-year tax battle that saw the world's most famous tenor
threatened with indictment. In a command performance before Italy's
finance minister, Pavarotti sealed a deal that will have him paying
nearly $12 million in taxes and interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot live being thought not a good person,'' said
Pavarotti, who donned a pinstripe suit over black sneakers for his
litigation-closing handshake with Finance Minister Ottaviano del
Turco.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until 20 minutes ago, I felt like I had a knife in my stomach.
But now, no more,'' said a frazzled-looking and tousle-haired
Pavarotti, still unable to muster more than forced smiles for his
day of reckoning with the taxman.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti lost a protracted legal battle last year in which he
unsuccessfully claimed the tax haven of Monte Carlo rather than
Italy as his official residence.
</P>
<P>
   Italian prosecutors turned up the pressure in April when they
sought his indictment on tax fraud charges. The crime carries an up
to five-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with examples of fellow tax-taxed celebrities in Italy --
Alberto Tomba, who settled this year after courts set a date for
the ski champ's tax trial, and Sophia Loren, briefly jailed in a
tax-evasion tussle in the 1980s -- Pavarotti ultimately agreed to
fork over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want at last to have myself free of a big, big strain,'' he
said Thursday. ''It ruined my private life.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finance Ministry said Pavarotti will pay in installments.
Rome-based La Repubblica newspaper said he would pay about $5
million now, with the rest coming over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian case was the latest to take center stage among
Pavarotti's tax troubles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Pavarotti paid an undisclosed six-figure sum to settle
a tax evasion probe opened against the Three Tenors -- Pavarotti,
Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras -- in Germany. Domingo also paid
an undisclosed sum. The status of the investigation regarding
Carreras was not known Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, tax problems kept the Wagnerian soprano Birgit
Nilsson from performing in the United States for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti has always denied wrongdoing, saying he pays taxes
where ever he performs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to explain the life of one who travels the
world, and who every year visits 50 different cities,'' he said on
state TV Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suffered a lot in these four years,'' he added Thursday.
''I'm still going to suffer, because I'm still going to have to pay
-- but finally I'm free.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Croatia Leaders To Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will meet next month with
Croatia's new president and prime minister, the White House
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will meet with President Stipe Mesic and Prime Minister
Ivica Racan on Aug. 9, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   ''We see this visit as an important step in strengthening the
growing cooperation between the United States and the Republic of
Croatia in the wake of that country's democratic transition,''
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic took office in February, two months after the death of
President Franjo Tudjman, who led Croatia to independence in 1991.
Tudjman's nationalist party had kept a tight grip on the country of
4.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   But support for the party waned after Tudjman's death amid
growing suspicion of corruption and the subsequent loss in
parliamentary and presidential elections to pro-democratic
reformers led by Mesic.
</P>
<P>
   Mesic has called for cooperation with Western institutions,
including the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands. The tribunal is prosecuting those -- including Croats --
who committed war crimes during the wars in former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Loses 117; Dow Gains 95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday as investors dumped
poor performing technology shares and loaded up on Old Economy
stocks such as pharmaceuticals and oil concerns that have more
reliable earnings in a slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of tech selling was spurred by disappointing
earnings reports from Amazon.com and Nokia. Blue Chips were helped
by a benign inflation reading.
</P>
<P>
   At late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 95.10 at 10,611.11.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index was down 116.91 at 3,872.25, the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 was up 2.03 at 1,450.33.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell $5.25 to $30.125 after the online retailer
reported lower than expected revenues late Wednesday. The data
reinforced growing pessimism about the company's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amazon has perhaps the best franchise in the sector and they
are having trouble meeting revenue estimates ... and that hurts the
entire tech sector,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist for SG Cowen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In another hit to tech stocks, wireless equipment maker Nokia
warned third-quarter earnings per share will likely fall from
second-quarter levels due to the timing of new product
introductions. Nokia dropped $13.875 to $41.063.
</P>
<P>
   But in a boost to non-technology stocks, the second-quarter
reading of the government's employment-cost index, a widely watched
inflation gauge, met forecasts. The index, which measures wages as
well as fringe benefits, rose 1 percent after increasing 1.4
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   If labor costs are indeed under control, it could be enough for
the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The employment costs report did help some Old Economy stocks
such as Coca-Cola, up $1.75 to $60.375 and interest-rate sensitive
financial services issues, such as American Express, up $2.188
cents to $57.813.
</P>
<P>
   With traders uncertain what the Fed will do with interest rates
and lackluster earnings reports defining the market activity,
stocks have been largely drifted downward in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   One exception has been hospital stocks, which continued to add
to their recent rally Thursday, as the nation's largest hospital
chain, HCA, added $1.313 to $33.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about energy prices is pushing oil service stocks
ahead, including Exxon Mobil, up $4 to $80.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 912.17 million
shares, up from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 10.67 at
503.17.

   MALIBU, Calif. (AP) -- Actor Brad Pitt and ''Friends'' star
Jennifer Aniston will get married this weekend at a ceremony on an
ocean bluff, their publicist confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors the couple were engaged and planning a wedding have been
swirling in Hollywood for months, but the couple and their
representatives have repeatedly issued denials.
</P>
<P>
   Publicist Cindy Guagenti said 200 people were expected to attend
the wedding of Pitt, 36, and Aniston, 31, in Malibu sometime this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment reporters and paparazzi have been staking out the
wedding site for days. A large white tent has mushroomed at the

<HEADLINE> Teams Work to Identify Crash Victims  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France (AP) -- Forensic experts in white hooded suits
combed a charred, rain-slicked field Thursday for anything --
wedding rings, teeth, scraps of clothing -- that might help identify
the victims of the doomed Concorde flight.
</P>
<P>
   As relatives paid tribute in Paris to the 113 people killed when
their burning Air France Concorde jet plunged to earth Tuesday,
experts converged on the crash site in this town of factories and
pastures to begin the painstaking task of putting names to bodies.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall Thursday, all the bodies had been transported to a
morgue in eastern Paris for autopsies, said Fabien Tillon, a
spokesman at the regional police headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   But some 40 experts continued their grueling work at the site in
Gonesse, a gritty industrial suburb north of Paris, which was
cordoned off and heavily guarded by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bodies are terribly mutilated, and some are so badly
burned that it's impossible to recognize them,'' Tillon said.
</P>
<P>
   For every plane crash in France, the Catastrophe Victim
Identification Unit follows these steps, according to the police
force that oversees the unit:
</P>
<P>
   First, specialists rush to the scene of the crash, dividing the
crash site into quadrants and assigning each team a patch.
</P>
<P>
   Team members turn over clumps of earth, charred cinders and
pieces of metal from the plane during the search for the victims'
bodies and possessions. They number each body or body fragment,
mark the spot with a traffic cone or a pole, and snap pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Units begin calling the families, requesting details that might
help identify the remains: hair color, broken bones, jewelry,
tattoos. Dental records are crucial, as the bodies are often
unrecognizable.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies are transported to the morgue for autopsies.
</P>
<P>
   German Transport Minister Reinhard Klimmt, who went to Paris
after the crash to follow the investigation and comfort relatives
of the German victims, said he doubted the remains would be
returned to Germany quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult because no identification was possible,''
he told the Saarbruecker Zeitung paper. ''It will take even longer
with some victims.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Radio Station Head Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The head of an independent radio station in the
western Russian town of Smolensk was shot to death in his apartment
stairwell, a police spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Novikov, 37, was found Wednesday night between the second
and third floors of the building, said police spokesman Alexei
Kurtsev. He had been shot four times, Kurtsev said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said no one heard the shots and it was possible a
silencer was used.
</P>
<P>
   Novikov was head of the Vesna radio station and was also
chairman of the board of directors of a glass factory in Smolensk,
250 miles west of Moscow. Both journalists and businessman have
been targets of violence in Russia, and police did not immediately
link the killing to his work in either industry.
</P>
<P>
   But a journalist at the station, Galina Illarionova, said ''all
our staff thinks it to be purely political ... We are the only
independent radio station in the Smolensky region and we are in
opposition to the local regional administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Novikov participated in a show broadcast Wednesday on local
television where journalists discussed corruption allegations
against a deputy governor of the region, the Union of Journalists
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   It said that Vesna was the sole independent radio station in
Smolensk, and that the killing had to be considered ''a political
crime, and the gunshot into the journalist an attack against
freedom of speech, against the right of society to know the truth
about itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Novikov was married and had two sons, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Jailed in U.S. Teen Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A Costa Rican teen-ager has been
sentenced to 14&AMP;frac12; years in prison for his role in killing two
American women in this Central American country.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old defendant was convicted of murder and aggravated
robbery in the deaths of Emily Eagen of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Emily
Howell of Lexington, Ky., both 19. The teens' bodies were found
March 13 beside a highway near the town of Cahuita, 120 miles
southeast of San Jose. Both had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was announced Wednesday night after a three-week
trial, which was closed to the public. The 16-year-old was
identified by two witnesses who claim he forced them at gunpoint to
burn the sport utility vehicle the victims had been driving.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the defendant's age, Costa Rican law prohibits the
release of his name. A second suspect, Jorge Alberto Urbina, 19,
was also charged in the case and is awaiting trial in the same
court in the Caribbean city of Limon, 75 miles east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Howell was a student at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio,
and Eagen was a former student. Their deaths shocked Costa Rica,
whose reputation for safety and stability in an otherwise turbulent
region has helped attract thousands of U.S. retirees and $1 billion
a year in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are still searching for a third suspect, who is
believed to have fled the country.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Try To Quit Smoking  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID PITT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Americans are trying to quit smoking four times
more often than they did in the years before the introduction of
nicotine gum, patches and other products that help people kick the
habit, the government reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data
from pharmacies and over-the-counter purchases of smoking cessation
products to conclude that Americans made more than 8 million
attempts to quit smoking in 1997 and 1998, the latest years
available. That's up from about 2 million in 1991, the year before
the introduction of the nicotine patch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the nicotine patch accounted for 49 percent of the
drug-assisted attempts to quit, nicotine gum 28 percent and Zyban --
a prescription drug -- 21 percent. The nicotine inhaler and nasal
spray accounted for less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said attempts to quit increased nearly every time a new
product was made available.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said the survey may overestimate attempts to quit
because the numbers are based on sales data rather than questioning
users. It's also impossible to determine if smokers were buying the
product to quit or using it as a substitute for smoking in places
where it is banned.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC, which says about 48 million U.S. adults smoke, did not
track how many of the attempts to quit failed.
</P>
<P>
   Having a variety of products helps smokers find ways to quit,
said Rod Todd of the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smokers are always looking for something that will be helpful
and you never know with product might work the best for a
particular smoker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of people who smoke want to quit and 35 to 45
percent of them will try to quit in any given year, Todd said. It's
common for smokers to go through several cycles of attempting to
quit, going back to smoking and then trying to quit again.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that all of these work and they've been shown to
work,'' said Saul Shiffman, a professor at the University of
Pittsburgh's smoking research group. ''The challenge is getting
people to use them. Even though these products work and people are
so eager to quit smoking, too few people use these treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC recommended that smoking-cessation products be included
as an insured medical benefit. The report also said decreasing the
cost of treatment could increase the number of people who try to
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prevalence of smoking is higher among persons of low
socio-economic status and access to these treatments must be
assured to these populations,'' the report said.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Jailed in Teen Murder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- A Costa Rican teen-ager has been
sentenced to 14&AMP;frac12; years in prison for his role in killing two
American women in this Central American country.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old defendant was convicted of murder and aggravated
robbery in the deaths of Emily Eagen of Ann Arbor, Mich., and Emily
Howell of Lexington, Ky., both 19. The teens' bodies were found
March 13 beside a highway near the town of Cahuita, 120 miles
southeast of San Jose. Both had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence was announced Wednesday night after a three-week
trial, which was closed to the public. The 16-year-old was
identified by two witnesses who claim he forced them at gunpoint to
burn the sport utility vehicle the victims had been driving.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the defendant's age, Costa Rican law prohibits the
release of his name. A second suspect, Jorge Alberto Urbina, 19,
was also charged in the case and is awaiting trial in the same
court in the Caribbean city of Limon, 75 miles east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Howell was a student at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio,
and Eagen was a former student. Their deaths shocked Costa Rica,
whose reputation for safety and stability in an otherwise turbulent
region has helped attract thousands of U.S. retirees and $1 billion
a year in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are still searching for a third suspect, who is
believed to have fled the country.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Faces Stiff Opposition  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez holds a
commanding lead in the run-up to Sunday's presidential election.
But the races for congressmen, governors and mayors might give rise
to a strong opposition that would resist Chavez's ''social
revolution'' for Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   The local and congressional races are far closer than the
presidential fight, polls show, with many of Chavez's preferred
''revolutionary'' candidates losing out to incumbents from
traditional parties with far greater name recognition in their
regions. In all, Venezuelans might cast as many votes against
Chavez's leftist Patriotic Pole coalition as for it.
</P>
<P>
   The president's movement is expected to garner at least a simple
majority in a new, 165-member unicameral legislature. But Chavez
may fall short of the two-thirds congressional advantage needed to
rubber-stamp presidential appointments, spending decisions and
proposed laws.
</P>
<P>
   And the governorships of nearly half of the country's 23 states,
including oil-rich Zulia, home to Chavez's main presidential
challenger, will likely go to the opposition: Polls indicate
opposition candidates are likely to take at least 10 states.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking power 17 months ago, Chavez -- a former army
paratrooper who staged an unsuccessful 1992 coup attempt -- has
shaken up Venezuelan politics like few leaders in history. He
pushed through a new constitution last year that dissolved Congress
and the Supreme Court, reorganized the state and weakened
traditional political parties that ruled during 40 years of
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The president has been criticized for his perceived attacks on
that democracy, and for ''handpicking'' transitional officials in
the interim between last year's approval of the new constitution
and this Sunday's election of new public officers. Yet several of
Chavez's hand-picked officials, including the attorney general,
have shown surprising independence, bringing high-profile legal
cases against powerful Chavez allies.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's detractors are hoping those kind of checks on the
president's power will be strengthened by the weekend balloting. A
sweep by Chavez forces, they say, will augur poorly for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Chavez gets a significant majority in the congress, he will
own the country,'' said political historian Guillermo Moron.
''There will be a legal dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential race, polls show Chavez is ahead of his
nearest challenger, former Zulia Gov. Francisco Arias Cardenas, by
20 percentage points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's persistent cheerleading for his candidates and a
complicated ballot in which voters pick both party lists and
individuals could allow the governing coalition to make last-minute
gains in non-presidential races. The coalition has distributed a
yellow rectangular ''Key of Chavez,'' which lists the president's
preferred candidates in every race.
</P>
<P>
   Lenin Martinez, an avid Chavez supporter, plans to follow the
guide exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I need it so that I don't get confused,'' said Martinez, a
28-year old Caracas electrician.
</P>
<P>
   The president, a skilled orator, has garnered almost religious
support among Venezuela's poor majority. However, Chavez opponents
are hoping to capitalize on an anemic economy and rising crime to
get votes and mount an effective opposition after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The economy shrank 7 percent last year despite a surge in the
international price of oil, Venezuela's main export, and grew by
only 0.3 percent this year. There were 70 percent more murders in
the first five months of this year compared to the same period in
1999, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Luis Miquilena, a key Chavez ally who leads the
interim congress, ''guarantees'' the government's candidates will
win 60 percent of the Congress and more than half the
governorships.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't, I wouldn't call it a failure. But we'd have to
figure out exactly where we're falling behind,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Adjourns Until Aug.  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Prosecutors and defense attorneys
in the Lockerbie bombing trial agreed on Thursday to skip testimony
from more than 60 witnesses and adjourned the proceedings until
Aug. 22, a court official said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first official indication of the expected length of
proceedings, Scottish prosecutors said in a statement they expect
to conclude their case ''before the end of September.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-week recess in the trial of two Libyans accused of
blowing up Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 21, 1988, had been scheduled
to begin Friday as a summer break. Proceedings began May 3. The
bombing killed 270 people -- all 259 people aboard the Boeing 747
and 11 people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The court adjourned a day early because prosecutors wrapped up a
part of their case dealing with airport security procedures in
Frankfurt, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment says Frankfurt was a transfer point for the bomb
that Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah allegedly
planted in a suitcase on a flight from the Mediterranean island of
Malta.
</P>
<P>
   The unaccompanied suitcase was routed with fake tags to London,
where it was loaded onto the doomed, New York-bound airliner,
according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the two sides presented the court with an agreement
on evidence from more than 60 witnesses, meaning they will not have
to be called to testify, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those witnesses apparently were relatives of the 270
victims. Two relatives are still scheduled to appear before the
three-judge panel, said the official.
</P>
<P>
   Another agreement was reached regarding background evidence on
''persons incriminated by the accused'' including Mohammed Abu
Talb, a Palestinian jailed in Sweden for bombing Jewish targets in
Europe, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In entering innocent pleas for the two Libyans at the trial's
outset, the defense indicated it would try to implicate Abu Talb
and nine other suspects, casting enough doubt on the prosecution's
case to win a dismissal. The statement described Abu Talb as a
prosecution witness.
</P>
<P>
   When hearings resume, prosecutors will conclude evidence on
events in Malta and Frankfurt and then move to security at Heathrow
Airport in London, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The special Scottish court sitting at Camp Zeist, a former U.S.
air base about 50 miles east of The Hague, has held 40 days of
hearings in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The $18 million courthouse was built after Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi agreed to hand the men over for trial in the Netherlands
following nearly a decade of sanctions.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Media Softens Anti-US Tone  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Once common anti-American polemics by North
Korea's state-run media have given way to more respectful treatment
of the United States, reflective of radical changes Pyongyang is
undertaking in its international relations, a U.S. government
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean media on occasion has praised the United States
for helping to feed the north's hungry population and it has been
particularly free of criticism since the first steps toward an
accommodation with South Korea began this past spring, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, the analyst noted, the North Korean media
was tame, at least in the initial stages, in its treatment of the
United States compared with the South Korean media in the aftermath
of disclosures by the Associated Press about the massacre of South
Korean civilians at No Gun Ri by U.S. Army troops in July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in Pyongyang's evolving attitude toward former
enemies was to come Friday when North Korean Foreign Minister Paek
Nam Sun planned to meet with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
in Thailand. It would be the first meeting of officials of that
rank from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The previously reclusive North Korea has established diplomatic
ties this year with Australia and Italy and has also planned talks
with Canada and Japan. All four are military allies of the United
States. The momentum of North Korea's international contacts has
been accelerating since the successful summit meeting last month
between North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official, asking not to be identified, said
that in an earlier era, the North Korean media would routinely
accuse the United States of trying to ''stifle'' Pyongyang and to
undermine it. North Korea also saw itself as a barrier to an
expansion of U.S. influence in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, to the extent that negative articles appear, they
are in the form of pickups from foreign media outlets; it is not
common for articles hostile to the United States to be generated
internally.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, eager to build a relationship with
North Korea, has refrained from criticizing Pyongyang as well. But
this restraint has not been emulated by many members of Congress,
especially House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The House Policy Committee, a GOP group, issued a report
Thursday accusing the administration of damaging U.S. national
security and subsidizing North Korea's military dictatorship
through its foreign aid program.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has provided North Korea with increased capacity for the
development of nuclear weapons and the long-range missiles to
deliver them,'' the report said. ''As its military capabilities
have advanced, time has worked to Pyongyang's advantage -- and will
continue to do so, as long as the Clinton-Gore administration
continues to invest its faith, its naivete and U.S. taxpayer
dollars in this despicable Stalinist regime.''
</P>
<P>
   One example of the change in North Korea's tone occurred June
25, the 50th anniversary of the start of the Korean War. While the
milestone has been used as a propaganda weapon in the past, the
anniversary passed without comment in the North Korean press this
year.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Lab Eases Computer Rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Nuclear scientists at the Los Alamos
National Laboratory have won a battle against a new security
restriction they said was making it difficult to use their
computers for weapons work.
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory officials Tuesday reinstated a long-standing rule
that allows weapons scientists to keep classified weapons programs
running on computers while they take breaks -- as long as they leave
the computers locked inside offices.
</P>
<P>
   After two laptop hard drives with nuclear weapons designs were
missing in June, Department of Energy security officers rescinded
what is known as the ''two-hour rule,'' which had let scientists
run unattended classified material for up to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The change forced scientists to shut down computers if they left
their offices for a cup of coffee or a break. Weapons designers
complained during a July 13 visit by Gen. John Gordon, head of the
new National Security Administration, that they couldn't get any
work done.
</P>
<P>
   Weapons designers use software called weapons codes to simulate
the stages of nuclear detonations. ''Production computing'' with a
weapons code can take hours or days on a supercomputer, and a
designer often needs several runs.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 135; Dow Gains 70  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors went on the defensive Thursday,
selling shaky technology stocks and loading up on steadier
pharmaceutical, utility and oil concerns that do better in a
slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of tech-selling was spurred by disappointing
earnings reports from Amazon.com, WorldCom and Nokia. Meanwhile,
blue-chips were helped by a benign inflation reading.
</P>
<P>
   At the close on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 69.65 to 10,586.13.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader market indicators, the technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index was down 145.46 at 3,842.26, while the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 was down 2.79 at 1,449.62.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stocks that are doing well are defensive ones,'' said Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''Drugs,
health care, insurance, utilities, soft drink -- those stocks that
tend to post good earnings regardless of what happens to the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell $4.689 to $31.375 after the online retailer
reported lower than expected revenues late Wednesday. The data
reinforced growing pessimism about the company's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amazon has perhaps the best franchise in the sector and they
are having trouble meeting revenue estimates ... and that hurts the
entire tech sector,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist for SG Cowen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In another hit to tech stocks, wireless equipment maker Nokia
warned third-quarter earnings per share will likely fall from
second-quarter levels due to the timing of new product
introductions. Nokia, the most heavily traded stock of the day,
dropped $13.937 to $41.063.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, WorldCom fell $5.437 to $39.313 after the
telecommunications giant said it sees sales slowing for the rest of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a boost to non-technology stocks, the second-quarter
reading of the government's employment-cost index, a widely watched
inflation gauge, met forecasts. The index, which measures wages as
well as fringe benefits, rose 1 percent after increasing 1.4
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   If labor costs are indeed under control, it could be enough for
the Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The employment report did help some Old Economy stocks such as
Coca-Cola, up $1.183 to $60.438 and interest-rate sensitive
financial services issues, such as American Express, up $2.688
cents to $58.313.
</P>
<P>
   With traders uncertain what the Fed will do with interest rates
and lackluster earnings reports defining the market activity,
stocks have been largely drifted downward in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   One exception has been hospital stocks, which continued to add
to their recent rally Thursday, as the nation's largest hospital
chain, HCA, added $1.189 to $32.938.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about energy prices is pushing oil service stocks
ahead, including Exxon Mobil, up $4.189 to $80.063.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.15 billion shares,
down from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 12.18 at
501.63.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.94 percent,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.63 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.55 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indictment in vampire-style assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW CITY, N.Y. (AP) - A man who said he got ''instructions from
a higher authority'' before allegedly trying a vampire-killing
technique on his neighbor was indicted Thursday on an attempted
murder charge.
</P>
<P>
   David Bolton, 45, who lives in a boarding house in Nanuet, was
interrupted just as he was about to hammer a sharpened wooden cross
into the chest of a sleeping fellow resident on July 19, the
indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   The target, 22-year-old Jeffrey Todd, woke up just in time to
avoid being impaled, said Rockland County District Attorney Michael
Bongiorno. Though battered with the hammer, he was able to escape
from his room and Bolton was arrested later at the boarding house,
known as the Laurel Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The county grand jury charged Bolton with attempted murder,
burglary, assault and weapon possession. At his arraignment
Thursday he pleaded innocent to all charges and bail was set at
$150,000. Bolton is being represented by the public defender's
office, which did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Steve Morgan of the Clarkstown police force, which covers
Nanuet, said after the arrest that the men had no previous dispute
and Bolton told officers he had ''received instructions from a
higher authority.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is right out of the Twilight Zone,'' said Detective Lt.
Charles Delo.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Seeks More Nursing Home Staff  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress should reconsider its efforts to
provide more money for nursing homes in order to force homes to
hire more staff, the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on
Aging said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've learned that too many nursing home residents suffer from
bedsores, malnutrition and dehydration,'' said Sen. Chuck Grassley,
R-Iowa. ''These incidents turn the stomach and hurt the conscience.
They beg for a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley's comments came with the release of a federal report
that found that many of the nation's nursing homes are so
understaffed they may be endangering the welfare of their patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Health Care Financing Administration found:
</P>
<P>
   --More than half of nursing homes -- or 54 percent -- were below
what the study has identified as the minimum staffing level of two
hours a day for residents with nurses aides.
</P>
<P>
   --Nearly one in four nursing homes -- or 23 percent -- is below the
suggested minimum level of 45 minutes a day with total licensed
staff.
</P>
<P>
   --One-third of nursing homes -- or 31 percent-- are below the
suggested minimum level of just 12 minutes per resident day for
registered nurses.
</P>
<P>
   The inadequate staffing levels were associated with potentially
avoidable hospitalizations such as pneumonia, urinary tract
infections and dehydration, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Bedsores and malnutrition were also a problem for residents in
understaffed homes, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley said Congress is considering a proposal that would give
nursing homes some extra money, but added, ''Based on today's
report, I'm not willing to give the nursing home industry a blank
check.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1.6 million elderly and disabled Americans receive care in
approximately 16,500 nursing homes across the United States.
Medicaid pays for the majority of nursing home patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined 1,786 nursing homes in three states.
</P>
<P>
   ''The results are troubling and suggest that many facilities may
need to increase staffing levels,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle,
administrator for the Health Care Financing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   A second part of the study will examine the feasibility of
implementing minimum safety requirements, DeParle said.
</P>
<P>
   Current law and regulations require only that nursing homes
provide ''sufficient nursing staff to attain or maintain the
highest practicable ... well-being of each resident.''
</P>
<P>
   A group representing nursing homes said state and federal
governments must do their part, adding that Medicaid and Medicare
reimbursement levels are inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ''State and federal governments are failing their moral
obligations to provide funding to reach even minimal staffing
levels,'' said Len Fishman, president of the American Association
of Homes and Services for the Aging.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that the federal government is considering adopting
staffing standards, it must accept its responsibility to provide a
significant infusion of funds to pay for these levels of care,''
Fishman said.

   Glen Liscinsky, 37, was charged with third-degree assault after
an argument with a parent at a Pop Warner football meeting July 20.
He was scheduled to return to Superior Court on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the argument erupted as the Trumbull Rangers Pop
Warner board, which was meeting at a parent's house, discussed a
coaching candidate for the youth football league. Liscinsky has
since been removed from the board.
</P>
<P>
   Liscinsky, who declined to comment Thursday to The Associated
Press, also is head coach of the high school's freshman baseball
team and an assistant wrestling coach. He also manages the town's
Babe Ruth all-star baseball team for 13-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes after a high-profile case in which eight
Trumbull High wrestlers were accused earlier this year of injuring
a younger teammate during violent hazing incidents stretching over
months. Three of the eight were granted a special form of court
probation this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Reading, Mass., a father allegedly beat his 10-year-old-son's
hockey coach to death on July 5 in front of his three sons. The
fight ensued after the 42-year-old father complained to the coach
that the checking in practice was getting too rough.
</P>
<P>
   In October, police in Swiftwater, Pa. had to be called to quell
a brawl in which at least 50 parents and players went at one
another following a football game for 11- to 13-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   A Tamaqua, Pa., police officer was convicted of corruption of a
minor and solicitation to commit simple assault for giving $2 to a
10-year-old Little League pitcher to hit a batter with a fastball
in August.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions and high intensity of parents, coaches and players
have created an atmosphere in which physical clashes have become
more likely, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''These overt displays of violence are the worst examples
parents can set for their child,'' said Steven Kant, a child
psychologist at Bridgeport Hospital. ''Youth sports are meant to
develop a child's physical and mental skills. Many parents have
lost sight of that and just look at the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Vitulano, associate professor of the Yale Child Study
Center, is teaming with sportswriter Frank Szivos on a book about
children in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think parents are investing more in their child's sporting
experiences in terms of time, money and their own psychological
involvement,'' Vitulano said. ''I think they're expecting more in
return. They want scholarships, fame and special awards for their
child.''
</P>
<P>
   But those active with children say steps can be taken to improve
the atmosphere of youth sports.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Markham, parks and recreation director in Trumbull, said
that town's recreation programs are noncompetitive; everyone plays
for an equal amount of time, and players are not cut from teams.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Dix, who coaches recreational soccer and baseball in
Fairfield, sent a letter to parents before the season started,
saying abusive behavior would not be tolerated. He acted after a
boy cried because of foul language and unnecessary roughness by the
other team during a game last season.
</P>
<P>
   Dix urged parents to be calm, not to coach from the sidelines or
goal line and to cheer positively.
</P>
<P>
   ''That letter was so effective it was almost scary,'' Dix said.
''I had to almost encourage parents to cheer.''

<HEADLINE> Cellular One agrees to change deceptive practices  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Cellular One can no longer hide fees on
''free'' minutes and other unpleasant surprises in tiny print on
its contracts under a settlement with the state announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Following up on consumer complaints, the attorney general's
office found that the cellular phone company would have consumers
sign 12- or 24-month contracts only to change the rates and terms
of the contracts midstream.
</P>
<P>
   Customers who complained would discover they had no recourse,
because in ''microscopic print'' on the back of their contracts
Cellular One said it retained the right to unilaterally change the
terms, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One also was accused of tacking on network fees to
minutes offered as free.
</P>
<P>
   ''The terms of the contract, if you read it very literally, was
a page of very small print,'' Spitzer said. ''When you expanded
that print to ordinary size print, that one page became six and a
half pages.
</P>
<P>
   ''That gives you a sense of how microscopic the typeface was and
as a consequence how impossible it was really for consumers to read
it or understand it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers would suddenly find charges for previously free
services like voice mail and be hit with penalties of $15 to $25 a
month if they tried to cancel their contracts, Spitzer said. On top
of that, the company would make the customers give back their free
phones or charge for them, Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Pieszala watched her cell phone bill slowly grow as
Cellular One added a penny or two to her per-minute rates and
dollars to her basic service fee.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it boiled down to was the contract was only for the
length of service,'' she said. ''It had nothing to do with the rate
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Several frustrating conversations with the company led her to
the attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew they were wrong and I was right,'' she said, but ''they
couldn't care less. They had such a huge group of customers it
didn't matter. They saw they were getting away with it and they
just got greedier.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One would not disclose the number of customers it
serves in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''A deal is a deal,'' Spitzer said. ''It is simply unfair for
Cellular One to unilaterally raise its rates during its contracts
with customers. Even worse, Cellular One would then punish
customers who wanted to cancel their contracts,'' he said. ''This
settlement ensures that the company will disclose all of its
charges up front so that consumers can make an informed choice when
choosing a wireless cellular phone service.''
</P>
<P>
   The state began investigating last year after receiving hundreds
of complaints from the Buffalo-based company's upstate customers,
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular One, in a statement, said the agreement with the state
was not an admission of any violation of state law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The settlement agreement resolves the investigation, avoids
unnecessary legal expense, and allows the company to focus its
attention on continuing to provide its customers with the highest
levels of wireless phone service,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said the state continues to look into the practices of
other wireless communication providers. The Cellular One settlement
is not perfect, he said, because it contains no restitution for
customers hurt by unfair contracts in the past. However, he said,
it protects existing and future customers.

<HEADLINE> Airline Employees Seek Immunity  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aviation interests urged Congress on Thursday
to give pilots and other airline personnel immunity from federal
prosecution in exchange for cooperating in crash investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not asking for the freedom to exercise willful
misconduct during the course of fulfilling our duty. What we are
asking for is protection from overzealous prosecution,'' said Capt.
Paul McCarthy, executive air safety chairman of the Airline Pilots
Association.
</P>
<P>
   A federal prosecutor argued before the House Transportation
Committee's aviation subcommittee that criminal prosecutions in
airliner crashes have made travel safer for the flying public.
</P>
<P>
   Airline advocates complain that, unlike in the past, federal
authorities now quickly try to open criminal investigations when an
airplane goes down, even before the Federal Aviation Administration
and the National Transportation Safety Board finish their
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Quinn, a former chief lawyer for the FAA, told the House
panel that airlines now voluntarily talk to safety regulators,
thinking that information they provide can be used to help stop
future accidents.
</P>
<P>
   But if they face the prospect of being prosecuted by local U.S.
attorneys, the pilots, mechanics, air traffic controllers and
others will refuse to cooperate with any federal official without
the consent of their lawyers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And lawyers most likely will tell their clients to not to say a
word, said Robert Warren, an attorney for the Air Transport
Association. ''The judgment may be made that in certain
circumstances that cooperation is not worth the risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, Quinn said, is that the FAA will be delayed in
telling other airlines how to prevent similar accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ''I respectfully suggest we are better off ensuring candor and
the admission of mistakes or bad judgment to prevent the loss of
life, than we are putting people behind bars and inviting further
tragedy,'' Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not have a public policy that encourages prosecution
first and safety second,'' Warren added.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Campbell, the NTSB's managing director, agreed, saying a
consequence ''of criminal investigation and prosecution has the
potential to jeopardize witness cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Miami area alone, criminal investigations were ongoing
for the Valujet flight 592 crash in 1996 and the Fine Air cargo
crash in 1997 during the NTSB's probes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Guy Lewis, U.S. attorney in Florida's southern district,
said their investigations didn't stop anyone from cooperating with
federal safety officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have successfully achieved model compliance programs,
including independent auditors and consultants, that have increased
security measures, leading to industrywide adoption of important
policies and procedures,'' Lewis said. ''As a result, we submit
that select criminal prosecutions in the aviation industry have
assisted in providing safer travel for the flying public.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline advocates want legislation exempting statements to the
FAA and the NTSB from use in federal criminal prosecution, except
for perjury or giving a false statement. The Justice Department,
the FAA and the NTSB also need to have guidelines for when
prosecution is appropriate, said Marshall Filler, lawyer for the
Aeronautical Repair Station Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''A person whose actions cause or contribute to an accident
should not have to fear a criminal investigation unless those
actions were deliberate and done with the intent to cause injury or
bodily harm or are otherwise so egregious that prosecution is
warranted,'' Filler said.

<HEADLINE> Group Decries Hezbollah Connection  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Arab-American and Muslim organizations
said Thursday that media reports about an alleged
cigarette-smuggling ring with suspected ties to the Middle East
terrorist group Hezbollah are being blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for a coalition of groups said Thursday that the
coverage has focused on the Hezbollah angle even though none of the
defendants is charged with terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that we are being portrayed and characterized in an
extremely unfair and damaging manner, which could lead to
discrimination and hate crimes,'' said Bilal Shammout, Charlotte
chapter president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Eight suspects are being held in Charlotte and one in Michigan
on charges of involvement in the ring. Deportation hearings are
pending for most of them.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are among 18 people charged last week with
involvement in the smuggling ring, which allegedly bought
cigarettes in low-tax North Carolina and sold them at a profit in
high-tax Michigan. Authorities said some of the profits went to
Lebanon to support Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Ibish, communications director of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee's national office in Washington,
denied that there was any link to terrorist activity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smuggling cigarettes is an old thing in North Carolina,'' he
said. ''If what they did was illegal, they must be prosecuted. But
it's not terrorism.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) - While rain kept the city from dousing Manhattan
with pesticides to quell an outbreak of the West Nile virus, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday that he hoped spraying will occur
soon.
</P>
<P>
   We have to determine ''if the ground is dry enough so that

after mosquitoes carrying the potentially deadly virus were found
in Central Park this week.

decision to spread insecticide, saying it can cause illnesses in

<HEADLINE> Rabbi's lawyers want newspaper reporter's interview notes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Lawyers for a Cherry Hill rabbi accused of
arranging to have his wife killed want a reporter from The
Philadelphia Inquirer to turn over notes from interviews with a
private investigator who says the rabbi hired him for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers Dennis Wixted and Jeffrey Zucker assert that reporter
Nancy Phillips ''crossed the line from reporter to witness'' in her
dealings with investigator Leonard Jenoff and became an agent for
the Camden County Prosecutor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff confessed his role in the killing to Camden County
Prosecutor Lee A. Solomon and county homicide Detective Martin
Devlin at an Audubon diner on April 28, with Phillips present.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers, in documents filed in state Superior Court in
Camden in support of a subpoena served on the reporter, said
Phillips should be ordered to give the defense any notes of
interviews with Jenoff and with law enforcement officials in the
prosecutor's office and the Cherry Hill Police Department since
Nov. 1, 1994, the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Inquirer editor Robert J. Rosenthal said the newspaper would
fight the subpoena, adding that New Jersey and federal laws give
reporters the right to protect all unpublished material.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe we should voluntarily provide testimony or
unpublished material in a criminal case because it could create a
misperception that we are partisans for the side benefiting from
the testimony,'' Rosenthal said in Thursday's editions of The
Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the contention that Phillips acted as an agent for
the prosecutor's office was ''absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Nancy takes seriously her ethical obligations as a journalist
and conducts herself accordingly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the court documents, Wixted and Zucker cited a report in
which Devlin said the prosecutor had told him on April 20 that
Phillips ''had information concerning the possible participation''
of Jenoff in the killing. That was eight days before Jenoff
confessed to Solomon and Devlin.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this allegation by Solomon is true, Phillips was already
acting on behalf of the state in delivering Jenoff on a silver
platter,'' the lawyers said, adding that she was acting as an
informant rather than a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon's office declined comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said a hearing will be held on their request on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, charged with capital murder, is being held at the
Camden County jail. He is accused of arranging to have his wife,
Carol, killed at their Cherry Hill Home. Prosecutors say he wanted
his wife dead so he could pursue a relationship with Philadelphia
radio personality Elaine Soncini.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander has maintained his innocence. No date has been set for
his trial.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff, 54, of Collingswood, has said the rabbi promised to pay
him $30,000 to kill his wife. Jenoff and his alleged accomplice,
Paul Daniels, 27, of Pennsauken, have both pleaded guilty to
aggravated manslaughter and have agreed to testify against
Neulander.

<HEADLINE> 'Man Who Came To Dinner' Returns  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- You might not want to break bread with him -- for
one thing, he'd probably throw the rolls -- but ''The Man Who Came
to Dinner'' remains a delight, more than 60 years after one of the
theater's more celebrated curmudgeons first arrived on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The ''man,'' of course, is Sheridan Whiteside, professional
raconteur and perpetual blusterer. He is the creation of those
skilled playwrights, George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, who modeled
the acerbic Whiteside after their good friend, drama critic and
writer Alexander Woollcott.
</P>
<P>
   Monty Woolley played Whiteside the first time around in 1939 and
in the 1941 movie version. These days, in the Roundabout Theater
Company's generally spiffy revival, he is being impersonated by
Nathan Lane, no slouch in the grouch department either.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman and Hart were practical guys, commercial craftsmen who
knew how to tailor their work for a populist Broadway audience.
They could write jokes as well as superb comic situations that
often ballooned right into farce.
</P>
<P>
   The setup for ''The Man Who Came to Dinner'' couldn't be
simpler: famous, world-traveling lecturer and radio personality
slips on doorstep of Ohio home, fractures hip and is forced to
remain with overwhelmed middle-America family. Chaos ensues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dinner'' unfolds leisurely -- a bit too leisurely -- over three
acts. It takes director Jerry Zaks a while to crank up the mayhem,
but by Act 2, characters and complications arrive in droves. This
production has 23 actors, not to mention a boys choir, a crate of
penguins (the birds are unseen) and a large glass case containing a
city of cockroaches.
</P>
<P>
   Any ''Dinner'' worth its guest of honor has to have a commanding
Whiteside. Lane, more short and stout than tall and imposing, would
not seem to be an ideal choice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here, done up with slick-backed hair and a close-fitting
beard, he gets the job done, thanks to a natural comic timing that
can make frustration seem very funny indeed. He also hurls
Whiteside's invective with glee. ''You have the touch of a
sex-starved cobra,'' he shrieks at Miss Preen, his hapless nurse,
in one of Whiteside's choicer moments of outrage.
</P>
<P>
   The love-story subplot is a bit dippy, a fact accentuated by the
absence of chemistry between Harriet Harris, who plays Whiteside's
much abused secretary, and Hank Stratton, the newspaperman who wins
her heart. Far more interesting is the relationship between
Whiteside and the secretary, a tug-of-war that finally reveals the
man has a heart after all. At first Whiteside tries to bust up the
romance and then has the more difficult task of putting it back
together.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the highlights of ''Dinner'' remain its comic turns by
characters modeled after celebrities who were well-known when the
comedy first opened on Broadway. Even today, they are readily
recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Smart plays a voracious theater actress, who appears to be
an amalgam of Tallulah Bankhead and several lesser eccentrics.
Smart could use a little more outrageousness in a role that is more
grasping and greedy than genteel.
</P>
<P>
   Byron Jennings does a witty, charming turn as an urban English
playwright who is a stand-in for Noel Coward. Best of all, though,
is Lewis J. Stadlen, who ricochets around the stage as a character
clearly modeled after the madcap Harpo Marx.
</P>
<P>
   The playwrights were generous even to their minor characters,
giving them moments to shine center stage. Zaks makes sure they do.
William Duell as a dithering doctor turned aspiring writer, Mary
Catherine Wright as Whiteside's harassed nurse and Ruby Holbrook as
the dottiest of relatives contribute mightily to the joyous
insanity of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman and Hart pepper the play with celebrity references,
dropping names as if they were confetti. The famous folk range from
H.G. Wells to Zasu Pitts with stops in-between for Admiral Byrd and
Katharine Cornell, among others. Some of these long-departed may
leave today's audiences scratching their heads, but they come and
go so quickly that they don't interfere with the comic giddiness on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Lane and company are holding forth at the corporately
rechristened Selwyn Theater, now known as the American Airlines
Theater, one of the nonprofit Roundabout's major donors. The
Selwyn, built in 1918, was one of 42nd Street's glorious old
theaters. It's now been restored and redone in brilliant golds and
light reds. Whatever the name, the new-old theater makes a fitting
home for Kaufman and Hart's all-American classic comedy.

<HEADLINE> Marines Reprimand 2 Osprey Pilots  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps disciplined the pilot and
co-pilot of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft flying a short distance ahead
of the Osprey that crashed in the Arizona desert in April, killing
19 Marines, a senior Marine general said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, the head of Marine aviation, told a
Pentagon news conference that an internal review board concluded
that the two pilots of the lead Osprey were partly responsible for
the accident because they failed to follow the flight plan and put
themselves in a position of having to descend too rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the pilots of the first aircraft to continue
their approach to the Marana airport -- instead of pulling up and
trying a new, safer approach -- despite an excessive rate of descent
''resulted in the mishap aircraft chasing (the lead aircraft) into
the (landing) area,'' a summary of the accident investigation
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The crews of neither Osprey ''recognized the dangerous potential
of the flight profile,'' the summary said.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the two pilots will not be allowed to fly as
aircraft commanders of any Marine Corps aircraft for six months,
and after that period they will be required to requalify for that
designation. He did not identify the pilots and said details of the
disciplinary action are ''privileged information.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation report summary released by McCorkle said that
although the crew of the Osprey which crashed made mistakes and
misjudgments, the main cause of the accident was ''human factors,''
not pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the difference, McCorkle said the pilot and
co-pilot of both aircraft had committed ''human factor errors.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said it appears in retrospect that the pilots should
have broken off their approaches to the airport and circled for
another landing attempt. As to why they did not, he said he could
only speculate that, ''as Marines, they were trying to complete the
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events and mistakes that apparently led to the
crash began with the fact that both Ospreys arrived at their final
approaches to the airport 2,000 feet higher than the mission had
called for.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the attention of the co-pilot in the lead aircraft
was distracted at a point when the pilot should have begun his
descent, and so the descent was begun late at an accelerated rate.
The co-pilot apparently dropped a map or some other article in the
cockpit and spent 25 seconds searching for it, McCorkle.
</P>
<P>
   The lead aircraft began his descent at an estimated 1,200 feet
per minute -- far more than the maximum recommended rate -- and a
tailwind estimated at between eight and 15 knots aggravated the
problem. The pilot of the second Osprey followed a similar pattern,
but at an even faster rate of descent. He apparently fell into an
uncontrollable nose dive after making a 15 degree banking maneuver,
McCorkle said.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey is unique in its ability to take off like a
helicopter, rotate its propellers 95 degrees and fly like an
airplane. A group of four Ospreys were participating in a mock
''noncombatant evacuation'' exercise at Marana, about 30 miles
northwest of Tucson, when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The too-rapid approach of the second Osprey produced a
phenomenon known as ''vortex ring state'' -- essentially a stall,
the investigators concluded. The Osprey plunged into a fatal nose
dive, killing the crew of four and their 15 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the worst aviation disaster for the Marines since
22 were killed in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps halted flights of its remaining Ospreys after
the April 8 accident, then resumed flying in early June.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps had previously announced that investigators
found no evidence of mechanical, engineering or structural flaws in
the Osprey. The final report released Thursday affirmed that
finding.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey that crashed was piloted by Maj. John Brow,
considered one of the Marines' most skilled pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Brow brought the Osprey into its approach to Marana airport at
more than 2,000 feet per minute -- far in excess of the plane's
maximum safe descent rate of 800 feet per minute, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rapid rate of descent and a slow forward air
speed, the Osprey lost lift. It was less than 300 feet off the
ground when it flipped to the right and plunged nose first into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers -- Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron -- are

<HEADLINE> Poll shows Corzine with lead over Franks in U.S. Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful Jon Corzine
has a 20-point lead over Republican opponent Bob Franks, according
to the latest Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine holds a 50-30 advantage over Franks in the poll, which
was taken last week. There has been no movement between the
candidates since a June poll showed the Democrat with a 46-26 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows that Corzine, despite his lack of political
experience, also had a higher favorable rating and name recognition
than Franks, a sitting congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, a retired Wall Street executive, shattered national
spending records in winning his party's primary. He is expected to
outspend Franks in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has a 23 percent favorable rating compared to a 12
percent rating for Franks. Only 33 percent of the respondents had
no opinion of Corzine, while 67 had no opinion of Franks. The
remainder of those polled either had an unfavorable opinion or
''mixed'' opinion of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side put much stock in the poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point in the campaign, we don't take it that
seriously,'' said Corzine spokesman Tom Shea. ''It's encouraging,
but we know we still have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said he expects the race to become more competitive in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Franks spokesman Charlie Smith agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just another mid-summer poll. It shows what the other
mid-summer polls showed and that is, that Corzine spent a lot of
money and has higher name recognition among voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's primary campaign, in which he spent $36.7 million to
defeat former Gov. Jim Florio for the Senate nomination, boosted
his name recognition around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he is not troubled by Franks' status as a relative
unknown at this stage. He blamed it on scant coverage given the New
Jersey congressional delegation by Philadelphia and New York
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over the next 101 days, we'll raise the necessary resources
and run a campaign. Name recognition will follow,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The university surveyed 910 registered New Jersey voters. The
poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuses GOP On Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Thursday accused
Republican lawmakers of trying to sneak out of the nation's capital
''with a trunkful of unfinished business,'' namely his legislative
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gathered congressional Democrats in the White House Rose
Garden for a pep rally that essentially launched a game of
political dare for the fall. The implicit message was that if GOP
leaders keep ignoring Democratic legislative proposals, Clinton
will kill their tax cuts with his veto pen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will support your veto of every single Republican tax
bill,'' Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told Clinton.
''America's families deserve better than what Republicans are
offering them, and we can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Management and Budget estimates that tax cuts
either passed by or moving through Congress this year amount to
$712 billion over 10 years. Last year, GOP lawmakers sent Clinton a
tax-cut package that would have cost $792 billion over 10 years,
and he vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton did not threaten outright to veto the new
tax bills. But he said he's frustrated that the Democratic agenda --
from a prescription drug benefit under Medicare and a patients bill
of rights to gun safety and school construction proposals -- has
gone unaddressed, while ''reckless tax cut after reckless tax cut''
continue to pass through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's congressional session likely was the last until
September. Most GOP lawmakers are leaving Washington to focus on
their re-election bids and to attend the Republican National
Convention next week in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the congressional Republican leadership is leaving
town with a trunkful of unfinished business,'' Clinton said. ''This
is not a list to be read. It is a list to be acted upon. I hope
when Congress comes back, they'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said he has counted
78 bills passed by Congress this year, and one of four renamed post
offices and buildings. ''Not exactly the most important matters
before us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said GOP leaders would not be wise to cite their tax
proposals as proof of action on behalf of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Republican chest-beating and self congratulations aside, a
legislative accomplishment is not an accomplishment by definition
until President Clinton signs it into law,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Custody Extended For Activist  </HEADLINE>
By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A prominent Egyptian-American human rights
activist, detained without charges for nearly four weeks, was
ordered Thursday to remain in custody at least 15 days more.
</P>
<P>
   Saad Eddin Ibrahim, who has been outspoken in his criticism of
Egypt's elections as well as how its minority Christians are
treated, can be held up to six months without trial under Egyptian
law.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Ibrahim was questioned Thursday about his reports
on sectarian violence that occurred in January -- 21 Coptic
Christians and one Muslim were killed in southern Egypt. He was
also asked about receiving money from foreign sources for writing
about the treatment of Copts by Egyptian police, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian government is extremely sensitive to discussion
about how it treats its Coptic minority, insisting that Christians
enjoy the same rights as the Muslim majority. Copts make up some 10
percent of Egypt's 64 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, a sociology professor at American University in Cairo
who is the director and founder of the Ibn Khaldun Center think
tank, was arrested June 30. His center has been closed and
surrounded by police ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim, who in the past has charged the government with
vote-rigging, has said he is also accused of harming Egypt's image
with a documentary about its elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no ground'' for any of the accusations, he said in an
interview earlier this month with Freedom House, a Washington-based
human rights group. He called the allegations politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian authorities often detain rights activists but it is
rare for an academic of Ibrahim's standing to be arrested.
International human rights groups have pressed Egypt to release
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were ''deeply disappointed'' by the extension,
State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, we don't understand the decision to prolong this
detention, and we call upon the Egyptian government to make clear
the formal charges against him or to release him,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Schumer says Durbin's his choice for VP  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer says he's got the
perfect pick to be Al Gore's running mate - Schumer's own Capitol
Hill roommate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the guy Schumer has in mind - Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill.
- is among the names being tossed about as a possible Gore running
mate. Schumer said Durbin had his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'd be great,'' the New York Democrat said Thursday. ''He's a
hard-working, honest-as-the-day-is-long, all-American boy from
Springfield, Illinois.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer added he had some selfish motives for backing Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could hang out in our shorts in the Naval Observatory,''
Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidential mansion is located on the grounds of the
observatory, far more plush than the crowded rowhouse Schumer and
Durbin share with two other Democratic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer splits his time between the Brooklyn home he shares with
his wife, Iris, and their two daughters, and Washington. He has
lived with Durbin for about eight years now.
</P>
<P>
   Durbin wasn't aware his roommate had been cheerleading for him,
but speculated Schumer had more on his mind than merely boosting
his career.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just wants to get me out of the house!'' Durbin laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if perhaps that was because he hadn't been holding up his
share of the domestic duties, Durbin turned the tables on Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, he never does the dishes,'' Durbin said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 145; Dow Gains 70  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors went on the defensive Thursday,
selling shaky technology stocks and loading up on steadier
pharmaceutical, utility and oil concerns that do better in a
slowing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of tech-selling was spurred by a trifecta of
disappointing earnings reports from Amazon.com, WorldCom and Nokia.
Meanwhile, blue-chips were helped by a benign inflation reading.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 69.65 to 10,586.13 while
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 145.49 to
3,842.23. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 slipped 2.80 at 1,449.62.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stocks that are doing well are defensive ones,'' said Hugh
Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. ''Drugs,
health care, insurance, utilities, soft drinks -- those stocks that
tend to post good earnings regardless of what happens to the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com fell $4.689 to $31.375 after the online retailer
reported lower-than-expected revenues late Wednesday. The data
reinforced growing pessimism about the company's long-term
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amazon has perhaps the best franchise in the sector and they
are having trouble meeting revenue estimates ... and that hurts the
entire tech sector,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist for SG Cowen Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In another hit to tech stocks, wireless equipment maker Nokia
warned third-quarter earnings per share will likely miss
expectations due to the timing of new product introductions. Nokia,
the most heavily traded stock of the day, plunged $13.937 to
$41.063.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the tech woes, WorldCom fell $5.437 to $39.313 after
the telecommunications giant said it sees sales slowing for the
rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In a boost to blue chips, the second-quarter reading of the
government's employment-cost index, a widely watched inflation
gauge, met forecasts. The index, which measures wages as well as
fringe benefits, rose 1 percent after increasing 1.4 percent in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This sign that labor costs are under control could move the
Federal Reserve to leave interest rates unchanged when it meets
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, traders are unsure what the Fed will do with interest
rates and lackluster earnings reports defining the market activity,
stocks have been largely drifted downward in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the slowing economy-- caused in part by six
interest rate increases since last summer-- has shifted investors to
load up on some Old Economy stocks. Those include Coca-Cola, up
$1.183 to $60.438, Drug giant Merck &AMP; Co., up $2.25 to $72.25 and
American Express, up $2.688 cents to $58.313.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism about energy prices is pushing oil service stocks
ahead, including Exxon Mobil, up $4.189 to $80.063. Enron led
utilities higher, gaining $4.672 to $77.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital stocks continued to add to their recent rally as the
nation's largest hospital chain, HCA, rose $1.189 to $32.938.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.40
billion shares, down from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 12.20 at
501.61.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.94 percent,
Germany's DAX index was down 1.63 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.55 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 0.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Internet task force charges prison guard with kidnap try  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A prison guard who thought he was going
to meet a 13-year-old Colorado girl for sex was arrested Thursday
when the ''girl'' turned out to be an undercover police officer,
state police said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force
charged Millard J. Lonkey, Jr., 47, with attempted kidnapping and
attempting to disseminate indecent materials to minors, both
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Lonkey had arranged a bus ticket for the ''child'' and tried to
meet her in a Buffalo bus station. Police said Lonkey wanted to
have sex with the child then raise her as his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Lonkey was sent to Jefferson County Jail in lieu of $30,000 cash
or $60,000 bond. He will be prosecuted by the state attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Lonkey has been a guard at Cape Vincent's Correctional Facility
since May 1990. He is required to report his arrest to the prison.
Corrections officials will take action according to the guard
union's contract.
</P>
<P>
   The task force is a two-year-old effort comprised of local,
state and federal law enforcement agents.

<HEADLINE> 9 Hurt in German Train Station Blast  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- An explosive device blew up at a
train station Thursday, injuring nine people and sending bleeding
commuters rushing from the station in panic.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the injured -- a man and a pregnant woman in her 20s who
miscarried and lost a leg in the blast -- were in critical
condition, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My whole body shook,'' said Schendran Swaminathan, who runs a
nearby pub.
</P>
<P>
   Police ruled out accidental causes and said the blast in the
heavily traveled station was likely caused by a fragmentation
grenade or a homemade explosive device.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not believe the attack was politically
motivated. ''There was no warning beforehand and so far we haven't
found any note claiming responsibility,'' said police spokesman
Andre Hartwich.
</P>
<P>
   Police later received a call from a pay phone in the area
warning that another bomb was hidden at the station. Authorities
closed the station again to search but didn't find anything.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion appeared aimed at causing injury and not damaging
the train station, which suffered only minor damage, said fire
department spokesman Joachim Schmitz.
</P>
<P>
   The device was apparently on the ground when it exploded,
Hartwich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had just served a customer when I heard an extraordinarily
loud explosion that shook the bottles on the shelves,'' said Erkan
Postal, who owns a liquor store across from the train station in
the residential neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Postal said he then ran outside and heard a woman scream as a
huge cloud of white smoke rose from the station. The windows of a
nearby bus stop broke.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters, many of them bleeding, fled from the station
entrance, said Robert Schweds, who works at a kiosk outside the
station.
</P>
<P>
   Police and rescue officials arrived quickly at the station,
located in the center of the western commercial city on a street
lined with shops and small bars.
</P>
<P>
   A rescue helicopter was used to ferry victims to area hospitals,
which appealed for blood donations to help the injured.
</P>
<P>
   All train traffic between Duesseldorf and neighboring Duisburg
was cut off for several hours, and train officials said delays were
expected throughout the evening. But later, trains were running
through the station again with passengers boarding from another
entrance.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- A top State Department official will travel to
several Arab countries next week to exchange views on the recently
concluded Mideast summit at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Walker, who heads the State Department's Middle East
bureau, will visit Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and perhaps other
countries, an administration official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He departs on Saturday and begins talks on Monday, although his
precise itinerary is not yet clear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart, responding to a
comment by an Israeli official in Jerusalem, said Thursday the
administration is encouraged that Israel and the Palestinians ''are
anxious to get back to the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the time is short,'' Lockhart said. ''It's the end of
July now. Sept. 13 is the deadline on this.''
</P>
<P>
   That still is the target date for reaching agreement on the
issues that defied solution at Camp David. Complicating the picture
is Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's statement that he will
declare an independent Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said issues such as statehood should not be decided
unilaterally but within the context of the peace process.

By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Janet Warner-Reyes was happy to
oblige Thursday when a man knocked on her door and asked where the
local Megan's Law sex offender lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right over there, the cream-colored house,'' said
Warner-Reyes, 40, pointing at the house as she stood on her front
lawn.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't alone. Two other neighbors who had received
notification from police about the presence of Rickie P. Misito,
46, identified him by name and pointed out the home where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told the kids: If he touches you, you tell me and I'll whip
his (expletive),'' said John Edgar, 41, who lives across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   On July 12, a federal judge gave New Jersey prosecutors the
go-ahead to resume notification of neighbors when a sex offender
moves into their community. Under the law, people who are notified
are banned from sharing the information with anyone, under threat
of contempt-of-court charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the ban isn't stopping people from talking - at least not
here. Misito, who pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting two
12-year-old Clifton boys in 1984 and 1985, is a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, neighbors complained about him at a Township
Council meeting, calling for stepped-up police patrols of the
working-class Pine Lake Park neighborhood where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am enraged,'' said Laura Osterhoudt, the mother of a
14-year-old girl, who lives two streets over. ''He is a kid in a
candy store back here. The town is a ghost town since the police
notified people. Nobody wants him here.''
</P>
<P>
   Named for 7-year-old Megan Kanka, who was raped and strangled in
1994 by a sex offender who lived across the street, Megan's Law
requires sex offenders to register with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials evaluate the risk the offender poses to commit more
crimes and then notify area schools, day care centers, or
neighbors, depending on the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are notified are under court order not to tell anyone.
But attorneys for the state Public Defender's office say the
confidentiality rules are being routinely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper report on the Manchester Township case prompted the
Public Defender's office to file a motion Thursday in a Megan's Law
court case currently before the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
in Philadelphia, according to Jeff Beach, press officer for the
Public Defender's office.
</P>
<P>
   It was filed under seal and not available for public review, he
said. He would not discuss its contents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to say this information should not be given
within the context of the guidelines that have been established. We
just want to make sure that the privacy interest that has been
established continues to be a protected privacy interest,'' Beach
said.
</P>
<P>
   The state is well aware of the potential for word-of-mouth
notifications. Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. has just
finished recording a 60-second public service announcement warning
people to keep the information to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The radio spot, which will begin airing next week, tells people
the success of Megan's Law success depends on discretion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our choice is simple: Use that information responsibly or lose
our right to receive it,'' Farmer says in the ad. ''If you misuse
it, you may be prosecuted. And we all may lose the protection the
information provides.''
</P>
<P>
   Manchester police have no plans to file contempt charges against
those violating the ban, according to Lt. Frank Magnapera, a watch
commander on duty Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point in time, there is not an active investigation.
All the questions we get - and we've gotten several today - we
direct to the Ocean County prosecutor's office,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for the attorney general's
office, nor Executive Assistant Prosecutor Gregory Sakowicz would
say how vigilantly authorities would enforce the gag order on
Megan's Law notification recipients. It would depend how
''egregious the misconduct is,'' Loriquet said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The point of the law is not to punish people for expressing
their concerns when they learn of a convicted sex offender living
in their neighborhood. But it is important to have them use the
information appropriately and responsibly,'' Loriquet said.

<HEADLINE> Sewage runoff blamed in 12 closings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) - Twelve Westchester beaches were closed
Thursday after heavy rains overwhelmed two pump stations in
Larchmont and sewage was discharged into Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The sewage was diluted by rain and chlorinated, but not
otherwise treated, the county Health Department said. It said there
was no public health threat and the beaches were closed as a
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the closed beaches are in New Rochelle: Beckwith Point,
Davenport Club, Glen Island, Greentree, Hudson Park, Marina's Edge,
New Rochelle Rowing Club, Sans Souci, Surf Club and VIP Club.
</P>
<P>
   The other two are in Larchmont, at Larchmont Manor Park and the
Larchmont Shore Club.
</P>
<P>
   Health Department spokeswoman Mary Landrigan said health
officers would re-evaluate the beach conditions on Friday morning
before reopening them.
</P>
<P>
   She said the pump stations, which normally direct sewage to a
treatment plant, reached their capacity at about 4 p.m. Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Approves Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seeking to avoid a U.S.-European trade war,
the House's tax-writing panel on Thursday overwhelmingly approved
legislation that would end tax breaks totaling $4.1 billion a year
used by 6,000 U.S. companies that set up export subsidiaries in tax
havens such as Barbados.
</P>
<P>
   The measure that cleared the Ways and Means Committee would
create new tax breaks applied equally to exports by American
companies and products they manufacture abroad. The Clinton
administration supports the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the class of companies that could benefit would cost
U.S. taxpayers $300 million more a year than the current system,
experts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest potential beneficiaries are U.S. arms
manufacturers, according to lawmakers, which brought criticism from
some Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., denounced the legislation as
expanding ''corporate welfare for U.S. businesses, including
military arms sales.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization ruled earlier this year that the
current program is an illegal export subsidy, as the European Union
claimed. The United States faces an Oct. 1 deadline to comply or
face possible EU retaliation in the form of higher tariffs or other
trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would satisfy the WTO's objections by creating a
new system of taxes to replace a special exception, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were ecstatic after the committee's
34-1 vote sending the bill to the full House, which is expected to
take it up in September after Congress returns from its impending
summer recess. The Senate has yet to act.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are frankly thrilled by the outcome,'' Deputy Treasury
Secretary Stuart Eizenstat told reporters in a conference call
after the vote. He said the measure was ''a remarkable cooperative
effort among the administration, the Congress and the business
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The sole opposing vote came from Rep. Fortney ''Pete'' Stark,
D-Calif., who objected to tax benefits U.S. arms makers would be
expected to receive under the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Sales Corporation program, created in 1984, enables
some 6,000 companies, including Microsoft, Boeing, General Motors
and United Technologies, to reduce income taxes by 15 percent by
creating export subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, notably in the
Caribbean. It was designed to offset an EU tax rebate given to
European companies for products sold overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate executives have warned that if it were to
disappear, the United States could lose a competitive edge that
would eventually result in higher prices, fewer jobs and lower
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee's chairman,
insisted the legislation ''is critical for continued U.S.
competitiveness in the global marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would bring the U.S. tax system closer to those
in several European countries.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said any loss of income for
Caribbean countries and territories caused by termination of the
Foreign Sales Corporation program is expected to be ''extremely
modest.'' The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   An EU official in Washington, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that ''considerable effort seems to have been
made'' but the legislation will have to be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   European authorities are believed to be developing a preliminary
list of $26 billion of American products, or 17 percent of U.S.
exports to EU member countries, that would be targets of
retaliatory sanctions, according to the European American Business
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're certainly pleased that it looks like something will pass
Congress,'' said Michael Bergsman, director of government affairs
for the group, which is comprised of 85 U.S. and European
companies. The new legislation, he said, ''will put off the
possibility of sanctions for some time.''

<HEADLINE> MS Deutchland sails, with ghost of the Concorde crash  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - It was a luxury cruise like no other.
</P>
<P>
   As the MS Deutschland prepared to sail from New York on
Thursday, the captain spoke of death and passengers wept for those
who never checked in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everywhere, there are signs of people missing - seats and
cabins empty,'' said Brigitte Schoeneberg, a teacher from Lunen,
Germany, as she boarded the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneberg and her husband, Willi, had crossed the Atlantic on
another ship, while 100 other would-be passengers, mostly Germans,
died en route in Tuesday's Concorde crash near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   On Manhattan's Pier 88 Thursday, three American flags flew at
half staff.
</P>
<P>
   Docked opposite the carrier USS Intrepid, the snow white ship
with red stripes was ready to sail, its own flags fluttering in the
breeze.
</P>
<P>
   On the first evening of the five-star cruise through the Panama
Canal to Ecuador, there would be no ball as planned. Instead, a 4
p.m. memorial service was arranged in memory of those who perished
in the flaming crash on their way to the Deutchland.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the cool, overcast July day matched what
Schoeneberg described as the ''depressed, quiet, sad'' mood aboard.
</P>
<P>
   When the captain gathered passengers to give them the bad news
this week, ''many people weren't able to speak, many cried,'' she
said. ''People are discussing again, and again, about the accident.
It won't be like other cruises.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband had considered canceling, ''but it's a very
expensive voyage and this is our holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   The last passengers boarded minutes before the 1:30 p.m.
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman arrived with a bag of drugstore supplies, heading
for an escalator that led to the pierway attached to the ship.
</P>
<P>
   For two days since she heard about the plane crash, said Julia
Spaete, she'd had ''a bad feeling in the stomach, and it's always
there. You can't get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But with vacation in sight, said the young woman from Essen,
Germany, ''you try to be happy and enjoy the journey. ... We will
try to forget.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no pierside good-byes. Police blocked off the way to
the visitors' gallery that is usually the site of maritime
farewells.
</P>
<P>
   The MS Deutchland drew in its ropes on time, at exactly 2 p.m.,
its foghorn blasting three times. Two ducks bobbed along as the
large ship pulled away into the Hudson River, releasing a plume of
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   A somberly dressed German woman shed tears as she stood by the
pier. She reached into her purse, pulled out a white tissue and
waved it high in the air as passengers along the top deck waved
back with handkerchiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very much for those who died,'' said Erna Borchert.
</P>
<P>
   On lunch break from her job in midtown Manhattan, she came to
bid bon voyage to the tragedy-touched vessel ''that is a piece of
my homeland,'' she said, her voice quivering.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad they're going - going on, going forward!''

<HEADLINE> Industry restructuring leaves GPU with loss, but brighter prospects </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Deregulation of the utility industry in New
Jersey and Pennsylvania has zapped GPU Inc., with the
Morristown-based utility holding company on Thursday reporting a
second-quarter loss of $211 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the company posted a net profit of $84 million, excluding a
hefty charge for ridding itself of a bad investment, and is
diversifying into the unregulated telecommunications and
construction industries as it attempts to recover from the effects
of utility deregulation and its own missteps.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few months, GPU paid about $215 million for the MYR
Group of suburban Chicago. The construction company specializes in
utility infrastructure, such as electric transmission and gas
pipelines, towers for cellular phones, and wiring and fiber optic
cable installation for everything from commercial real estate to
telecommunications companies and traffic control.
</P>
<P>
   GPU also appointed a president for its two-year-old GPU Telcom
Services subsidiary, which is teaming up with five other utility
and communication companies across the Northeast. They are uniting
and expanding their private fiber-optic networks to sell the extra
bandwidth to telephone companies and Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   And GPU has joined a joint venture called Telergy Mid-Atlantic
to market advance voice, video and data services directly to
commercial customers. The new company's first prospects will be
8,000 small businesses that buy electricity from GPU's Advanced
Resources subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're getting to where they want to be,'' said Linda Byus, a
vice president and analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in Chicago.
''This is a very tough year for this company, and they knew that
earnings would be hurt by some of the things they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look for this to be the low year in earnings,'' with a
rebound next year, Byus added.
</P>
<P>
   GPU reported a net loss for the April-June quarter of $211
million, or $1.74 per share, on revenues of $1.28 billion. A year
earlier, it posted a second-quarter profit of $47 million, or 38
cents per share, on revenues of $892 million.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding a one-time, after-tax charge of $295 million, or $2.43
per share, GPU earned $84 million, or 69 cents per share, in this
year's second quarter. That beat the average forecast of analysts
surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial by 3 cents.
</P>
<P>
   GPU's stock closed at $27 Thursday, up 12.5 cents on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The $295 million charge represented the company's loss from the
June 30 sale of its GPU PowerNet subsidiary, an electric
transmission company in Australia, to Singapore Power International
for $1.26 billion. While that was considerably below what GPU paid
for the business, GPU spokesman Ned Raynolds said it was better
''to bite the bullet'' because Australian regulators increasingly
have been limiting the rates it could charge.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that loss, GPU blamed its net loss on fallout from the
industry's restructuring, including its sale of its
power-generating facilities, lower electric rates charged to its
New Jersey customers and higher costs to buy energy in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The company has sold all its gas- and coal-fired plants, its
interest in the Three Mile Island nuclear plant's Unit 1 and is
about to sell its only remaining generating plant.
</P>
<P>
   GPU still transmits electricity to more than 2 million if
propercustomers in the two states through its subsidiaries,
Pennsylvania Electric and Metropolitan Edison in Pennsylvania, and
Jersey Central Power &AMP; Light Co., which serves about 1.1 million
customers in northwest and central New Jersey. Both states have
deregulated the power-generating end of the energy business - but
not transmission and distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Byus said in hindsight it was a mistake for GPU to sell all its
power plants without first having contracts at guaranteed prices
from other suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have no way of controlling prices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have enough (energy) supply in your part of the
country,'' Byus added, and market conditions discourage any
companies from building new power plants in the area, so prices
distributors such as GPU must pay suppliers for energy are likely
to remain high.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Raynolds said Parsippany-based GPU Energy plans by
Aug. 1 to sell the Oyster Creek nuclear plant in Lacey Township,
Ocean County, to a multinational conglomerate called AmerGen Energy
Co. The $10 million price tag is far below the $600 million book
value of the problem-plagued plant.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deregulation process, New Jersey regulators are
allowing GPU to recover the $590 million difference from customers
over the next decade, in exchange for a 5-percent cut in rates
charged its Jersey Central customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we had had to mothball it, it would have cost the
ratepayers (customers) another $150 million,'' Raynolds noted.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Voters say Whitman used poor judgment in frisking suspect  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - By more than a 5-to-1 margin, New Jersey
voters say Gov. Christie Whitman's decision to frisk a black man
was a ''bad idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman couldn't agree more.
</P>
<P>
   And even the magnitude of that sentiment - 78 percent to 14
percent of voters polled in a university study - pleases the
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really pleased that 78 percent of the people thought it
was a bad thing,'' Whitman said Thursday, the day the poll was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's ride with police, the frisk and the photograph taken
that night four years ago in Camden were no joke, she said. The
poll results confirm that, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is reflective of the fact that people in New Jersey
take this thing seriously,'' Whitman said. ''I really wouldn't want
people to take that sort of thing lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since The Associated Press first published the photograph July
7, Whitman has repeatedly said she should have thought twice before
putting her hands on an unarmed drug suspect who was never charged
with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman even went so far as to call the pat-down search
''dumb'', but has refused so far to apologize specifically for the
frisk.
</P>
<P>
   The search was her attempt to learn the rigors of police work,
and not an example of racial profiling, the practice where police
target suspects based solely on race, Whitman said. Both the
governor and her administration have been dogged by accusations
that they were insensitive to charges by minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac University poll, which has an error margin of 3.3
percent, surveyed 910 voters registered voters from July 19-24.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters solicited views on crime, race and racial profiling.
And they asked voters to rate Whitman's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Overall voters responded favorably to Whitman with a 55 to 37
percent approval rating. The number of voters who approve of her
handling of race issues dropped to a margin of 49 to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly more than half of white voters approved of the way
Whitman is handling race relations in New Jersey. But only 30
percent of blacks approved.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found the same racial differences when it came to
questions about crime, racial profiling and the state of race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   With whites, 58 percent said race relations are good. Almost the
same number of blacks - 57 percent - said relations are bad. Less
than a third, 29 percent, agreed that things are good between
whites and minorities
</P>
<P>
   But all agreed that crime is a problem. And roughly the same
margins said race relations are not improving, but staying the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ''Voters do agree, overwhelmingly that her frisking a suspect
showed a lapse of judgment,'' said Scott McLean, a Quinnipiac
University political science professor.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman is not surprised by the different responses from blacks
and whites.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about education, economics or any other issue would
likely show a divide, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on who you ask what the answer is,'' Whitman said.
The governor's answer to dissatisfied groups: Look at her
administration's record.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we are working on these things together. I hope at the end
of the day, people will look at the total record,'' Whitman said.

<HEADLINE> Levy storms out of court during state's summation on NYC school funding </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - City Schools Chancellor Harold Levy stormed out
of a Manhattan courtroom Thursday during a state lawyer's closing
arguments on whether the state is shortchanging the city's public
school children.
</P>
<P>
   Levy's dramatic departure, banging the door loudly as he left,
was apparently caused by Assistant Attorney Martin Beinstock's
assertion that an eighth-grade education is sufficient for city
high school graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the State of New York to claim that an eighth-grade
education should be the constitutional standard for children in New
York City is astonishing,'' Levy said in a statement issued later
by his office.
</P>
<P>
   He said this position ''contradicts the Regents' own minimum
standards for graduation in this state. I doubt that any of the
lawyers working on behalf of the state would want this standard
applied to their own children.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Board of Regents, of which Levy is a former member,
sets education standards for New York schools. Pam McDonnell, a
spokeswoman for the chancellor, noted that Levy, as a Regent, voted
for higher standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a slap in his (Levy's) face for them to say that an
eighth-grade education is enough for a New York City high school
graduate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A court officer followed Levy out of the room and told him,
''Sir, you have to act in a civil manner.'' The officer, unaware
who the man was, said he simply wanted to let him know ''that kind
of behavior doesn't fly here.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his abrupt exit, Levy spent about 10 minutes in the
courtroom where the Coalition for Fiscal Equity (CFE), a public
education advocacy group, is suing the state to get a larger share
of the $13 billion education budget for New York City's 1.1 million
public school students.
</P>
<P>
   During the past several months of trial, coalition lawyers have
argued that the city should get more money because its pupils, most
of whom are black and Hispanic, are 38 percent of the state's
public school students but get only 35.5 percent of the state's
education money.
</P>
<P>
   The state replies that it is required only to provide a sound,
basic education that gives students the literacy, math and verbal
skills they need to become productive members of society, and it is
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses for the state have testified that if city students lag
behind those in the rest of the state, it is because of their
social backgrounds, not because too little money is spent on them.

<HEADLINE> Clifton entrepreneur's home searched in Colts Neck double death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLIFTON, N.J. (AP) - The lawyer for a man whose Clifton home was
searched as part of an investigation into the October
execution-style death of two stock promoters in Colts Neck says
authorities were wasting their time.
</P>
<P>
   ''My client is not a suspect in any homicide,'' said Michael
Critchley, who represents Joseph T. Logan Jr., an entrepreneur who
once promised to save bankrupt Kiwi International Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could have jacked up my client's house and towed it away
to be searched and not find any evidence of criminal activity,''
Critchley said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and Monmouth County law officers on Wednesday searched
the home of Logan, who court records said had met with the victims
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Logan was at the Colts Neck mansion the day of the killings and
was one of the last people to see the victims alive, according to
unidentified police sources cited in Thursday's editions of the
Asbury Park Press of Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley would not comment on that report.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities hope Logan's financial records provide information
about people with a motive to kill Maier Lehmann and Alain Chalem,
whose corpses were found in a pool of blood on Oct. 26, 1999, the
newspaper said, citing unnamed sources.
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth County Assistant Prosecutor Peter Warshaw on Thursday
said investigators would not talk about the case.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Sandra J. Carroll, a spokeswoman for the
Newark office, would only confirm a search warrant was executed at
Logan's home.
</P>
<P>
   Critchley said he did not know what authorities were looking for
at the home during the seven-hour search.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone messages to a Clifton listing for Logan were not
immediately returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Logan, Chalem and Lehmann met at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in
late December 1997, according to court filings of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The trio talked about using cheap stocks as collateral in a
day-trading brokerage account but did not make a deal, according to
the court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Logan beginning in 1996 used two publicly traded companies he
was in charge of - Wasatch International and Aviation Industries -
to raise money in an effort to revive Kiwi, which is now out of
business since struggling since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Lehmann, 37, and Chalem, 41, were partners in the overseas Web
site www.stockinvestors.com. A federal grand jury in Newark has
been trying to untangle the complex financial dealings in which the
men were involved, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Lehmann and Chalem were not registered stock brokers. But they
promoted low-cost, or ''penny'' stocks on their site, accompanied
by real reports from stock brokerages and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Their site, which has since been taken down, had said it offered
''prestige investment information.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the site was operated from Budapest and
registered in Panama City.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey stock analyst, Stuart Bockler, has claimed that
Lehmann and Chalem stole his copyrighted reports and e-mailed them
to millions of investors to lure them to their Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Bockler's attorney, John Milling, who practices in Edgewater, in
October said he planned to file court papers seeking a permanent
injunction against further unauthorized use of Bockler's material
as well as damages.
</P>
<P>
   Milling did not immediately return calls placed to his office
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth County authorities have said they are considering a
possible organized-crime link to the killings. They also have said
they are examining whether the attack was the work of a disgruntled
investor who lost money to the victims' Internet promotions.
</P>
<P>
   The killing took place at the mansion Chalem shared with his
fiancee. Lehmann lived in Woodmere, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The affluent community is home to some of the country's top
horse breeders and Wall Street executives.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Leak Grounds El Al Jet in Canada  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GANDER, Newfoundland (AP) -- An El Al airliner with 339
passengers aboard made an unscheduled landing in eastern Canada
after a hose leaked fuel over the Atlantic Ocean, the Israeli
airline said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Flight 011 from Tel Aviv to New York departed Wednesday
afternoon and was forced to land that evening in Gander,
Newfoundland, one of the easternmost points of Canada, said airline
spokesman Nachman Kleiman.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot suspected a fuel leak toward the end of the ocean
crossing and chose to land as a precaution, Kleiman said. Another
plane was being sent to Gander to complete the flight, which was to
resume Thursday evening and land at Kennedy Airport after midnight,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people voiced their displeasure and anger at the delay
but after seeing what happened two days ago, most understood that
safety and precaution was most important,'' Kleiman said in
reference to the crash of an Air France Concorde outside Paris that
killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   While the airline had earlier reported 400 passengers, El Al
spokeswoman Sheryl Stein said later there were 339 people aboard
the Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Vey, a local airport official, said the pilot initially
requested a refueling stop, which was unusual because the Boeing
747 has the capacity to make the trip without stopping. Once on the
ground, the cause of the fuel leak was detected, Vey said.
</P>
<P>
   Trans-Atlantic flights that must make unscheduled stops often
use the Gander airport, which is linked to a military airport at

<HEADLINE> Strawberry leaves clinic; seeks early return to baseball  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - Five months into his year-long suspension
from baseball, Darryl Strawberry has left a drug clinic and is
trying to get back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry wrote a letter to commissioner Bud Selig several
weeks ago asking for reinstatement, a high-ranking baseball
official said Thursday on the condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees outfielder, serving his third drug-related
suspension, asked for an early end to his one-year ban, currently
scheduled to run through February.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball official confirmed that the eight-time All-Star
left a clinic where he was being treated for his cocaine problem.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry told the New York Daily News that he left the
Sobrenity, Inc., clinic in Fort Lauderdale after 3&AMP;frac12; months because
he needs to support his wife and children and explore returning to
work in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's agent, Eric Grossman, did not immediately return
telephone messages from The Associated Press. However, officials of
the St. Paul, Minn., Saints minor league club confirmed there have
been discussions about hiring the 38-year-old slugger.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are the independent minor league team Strawberry
played for in 1996 when no big league club was interested in him.
General manager Bill Fanning said the club was talking to
Strawberry about an arrangement but nothing had been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Marvin Goldklang emphasized that Strawberry would not join
the Saints as a player. The minor league team also doesn't want to
give the impression it is trying to enhance his chances of
returning to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever we may do for Darryl Strawberry will have nothing to
do with whether he plays another baseball game,'' Goldklang said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm assuming (he wants to return to baseball). Darryl hasn't
said that to me,'' the owner added. ''At this point in his life,
that's the thing he does best and wants to do. I'm assuming given
the opportunity he'd like to play again. That has nothing to do
with our relationship with Darryl.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldklang, also a Yankees limited partner, said an arrangement
might be made within a week or so, although it appears the closest
fans might come to seeing Strawberry play in St. Paul would be some
rounds of batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already have spoken to a physician and a counselor who are
familiar with Darryl's situation. It has been suggested to us that
that would be a positive element for Darryl because that would help
keep him in an environment where he does feel comfortable. That's a
distinct possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported that baseball has ''serious questions''
concerning Strawberry's fitness to resume his career.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, Strawberry was suspended by Selig after his third
violation of baseball's drug policy. The suspension came after
Strawberry had tested positive for cocaine during a routine check.
</P>
<P>
   After playing briefly with the Saints, Strawberry's contract was
purchased by the Yankees in July 1996. Two years later, the
outfielder was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While still undergoing chemotherapy, Strawberry returned to
baseball in March 1999. A month later, he was charged with
possessing cocaine and soliciting a prostitute. Pleading no
contest, Strawberry was sentenced to 18 months' probation and 100
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the Yankees on Sept. 1, 1999, and finished the
season with a .327 batting average, three homers and six RBIs. In
the postseason, he hit .333 (5-for-15) with two homers and four
RBIs as the Yankees won their second straight World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Goldklang said the Saints' interest in helping the slugger get
back on his feet is personal, not a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there may be some skeptics out there who question why
we would do this for Darryl Strawberry,'' he said. ''I'm not
claiming that we never do things in our economic interest or
selfish interest. ... I think we are just motivated by caring for
another human being. He's been good to us in the past and we
remember our friends.''

<HEADLINE> Police search for mother of newborn found in building  </HEADLINE>
AP Photo
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) - Police searched Thursday for the parents
of a newborn boy left with a bottle of baby formula in the entryway
of an apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The infant was found clothed and wrapped in a blanket Wednesday
night, said Deputy First Assistant Hudson County Prosecutor Ed
DeFazio. A neighbor called the police after spotting the baby on
the floor of the vestibule, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-pound, 7-ounce baby was hospitalized in good condition at
Children's Hospital of Hudson County, spokeswoman Lynn McFarlane
said. The baby appeared to have been born in a hospital because its
umbilical cord had been clamped and the infant still had ink stains
on its feet from footprinting for identification, McFarlane said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby is between three days and two weeks old, McFarlane
said. He had suffered no dehydration or exposure from his time
alone, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were checking hospitals to track any recent births in the
area to try and find the boy's mother, DeFazio said. They had no
immediate leads.
</P>
<P>
   A new state law signed earlier this month gives parents or other
citizens the opportunity to drop off unwanted children at ''safe
havens,'' such as a hospital or police station, no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Only parents who had harmed their children before dropping them
off would face prosecution under the law.

<HEADLINE> Second infected crow found; mosquitoes test negative for virus  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) - State health authorities said Thursday that a
second dead crow - found in Hopkinton over the weekend - tested
positive for the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the mosquitoes taken from the Boston pond where
an infected bird was also found over the weekend have tested
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Boston officials planned to begin anti-mosquito spraying
Thursday night at four locations around the city: the Hatch Shell
along the Charles River, Franklin Park, Jamaica Pond and Willow
Pond, where a dead crow with the disease was found Saturday. It was
the first confirmed finding of the virus in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   After the crow was found in Boston, the state Department of
Public Health tested 70 mosquitoes, all of which tested negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, we don't take this as a sign that there is no
mosquito in the city of Boston that has this virus, as it was a
relatively small sample,'' said Dr. Anita Barry, director of the
Boston Health Department's communicable disease control division.
</P>
<P>
   The second crow was seen staggering in a street in Hopkinton
Friday and was picked up by an animal control officer in the town,
located about 25 miles west of Boston. The crow, which died shortly
after it was found, was sent to the state lab on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes are more worrisome to health authorities because they
can transmit the virus to people, whereas birds cannot. So far,
there are no reported cases of the disease in humans in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Results of a second type of test on the mosquitoes were expected
Friday, and officials said they will conduct extensive trapping and
monitoring of mosquitoes around the state once weather improves.
</P>
<P>
   An outbreak of the West Nile virus in New York City killed seven
people last summer, the first time the virus was ever detected in
North America. The virus has since been found in New Jersey,
Connecticut and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   In people, the virus usually causes mild, flu-like symptoms, and
most who contract it never realize they have it. But a small
minority - usually the elderly or infirm and about 7 percent of
those who become sick enough to be hospitalized - die from the
disease. There is no known treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said people should take routine precautions to
avoid exposure to mosquitoes, including wearing long-sleeved shirts
and long pants, using insect repellant, repairing screens and
cleaning up standing water.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Bill Moves Forward  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would substantially change
U.S. trade relations with China cleared a procedural hurdle
Thursday and Majority Leader Trent Lott said it will be at the top
of the Senate agenda when Congress returns from its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted 86-12, well over the 60 needed, to move ahead
with legislation that would give China normal trade status on a
permanent basis and end the annual battle over whether to link the
trade benefit with China's human rights or arms proliferation
record.
</P>
<P>
   The trade bill, which passed the House in May, is backed
strongly by the White House and is a top priority of business
groups. The Senate has been slow to take it up because of partisan
disputes over other legislative matters and questions over how to
deal with China's sales of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., said the Senate would spend much of the first
week after it returns in September debating the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a major international trade agreement and needs to be
done carefully and with thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said senators will have the opportunity to offer
amendments, a major concern of bill supporters who fear they could
lose momentum if the legislation is altered and has to go back to
the House for another vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''The challenge before us today is this: Maintain the integrity
of the House legislation and move to vote a permanent trade deal
with China at the earliest possible date when we return in
September,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a chief advocate of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., and Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
are seeking a vote on a proposal that would impose sanctions on
China if it violates arms nonproliferation agreements. The
administration has strongly opposed the measure, saying it is a
mistake to single out China and it sets the threshold for imposing
sanctions too low.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says he has modified the language, extending it to
cover countries beyond China and giving the president more
flexibility, and is willing to have his bill considered either
separately or as part of other legislation. But he said if that
doesn't occur he will offer it as an amendment to the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   Voting against the motion to take up the legislaiton were Sens.
Jim Bunning, R-Ky., Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
R-Colo., Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., James
Inhofe, R-Okla., Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.,

<HEADLINE> Seven-minute dates help busy Jewish singles mingle  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMETTE, Ill. (AP) - Dressed in a crisp button-down shirt and
flashing a pearly grin, Robert Orenstein was ready to charm his
blind date Thursday night. All eight of them.
</P>
<P>
   Orenstein was SpeedDating, the latest trend among Jewish singles
who want to meet but don't want to commit to hours of uncomfortable
blind-date banter.
</P>
<P>
   Participants switch partners every seven minutes at the sound of
a bell and fill out cards indicating who they'd like to meet again.
Matches are contacted later so they can arrange a real date.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like the idea of being able to communicate with people in
kind of bite-size moments,'' said Orenstein, a 44-year-old
insurance agent. ''I'm looking for somebody where I feel a spark, a
connection on some level.''
</P>
<P>
   SpeedDating is the brainchild of Rabbi Yaacov Deyo, educational
director of Aish HaTorah in Los Angeles, a Jewish resource group
with branches throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year ago, Deyo quizzed the 20- and
30-somethings in his weekly Torah class on how young Jewish singles
could meet. Many disliked the bar scene, yet found social
gatherings at synagogues or Jewish centers too stiff. They came up
with SpeedDating.
</P>
<P>
   At a session Thursday night in Wilmette, a tony suburb north of
Chicago, 43 people crowded around tiny folding tables on the dance
floor of an American Legion hall. The women took their places on
the east side of each table, and coordinator Elsa Malinsky assigned
the men to their first ''date.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven minutes later, she rang a cowbell, and the men shifted
down a seat.
</P>
<P>
   The singles were advised not to talk about where they live or
what they do for a living. That forces them to focus more on what
the other person is really like, Malinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this session, 14 women and 10 men had matches - meaning
both they and their date checked ''yes'' on the date card. They
will be contacted by Monday to arrange a lengthier date.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is everybody gets a chance to meet,'' said
Malinsky, who runs a Jewish dating service. ''I always tell people
to come with an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind SpeedDating is to preserve Jewish culture in
countries where interfaith marriage has become common.
</P>
<P>
   No one is expected to figure out marriage prospects in seven
minutes, Deyo stressed. But the availability of a fun way to meet
makes it easier for Jews to date within their faith, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Orenstein, for example, says dating women of another faith would
complicate his relationship with his children from a previous
marriage. Near the end of Thursday's session, he had been on eight
dates - and found four women he'd like to see again.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Appell, a 46-year-old insurance marketer, also gave
SpeedDating rave reviews. She said it was well worth the $25 cost
to meet so many available Jewish men.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm better at one-on-one,'' said Appell, who has attended
singles dances in the past. ''It's a much more comfortable
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Yitzchak Rosenbaum, program director of the National
Jewish Outreach Program in New York, called SpeedDating a ''great
idea.'' His educational group fights the assimilation and
intermarriage of Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that it's going to make so many marriages, but it
can't hurt,'' Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The response to SpeedDating so far has been phenomenal, Deyo
said. Sessions are now available in 15 metropolitan areas: Chicago;
Cleveland; Detroit; Kiev, Ukraine; Las Vegas; London; Los Angeles;
New York; Philadelphia; San Francisco; South Florida; St. Louis;
Sydney, Australia; Toronto; and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations in Boston, Seattle and South Africa also have
signed up.
</P>
<P>
   There are some glitches, Malinsky admitted. Some women,
disappointed that there weren't enough men to go around, left
early. And Malinsky had to scold men who gravitated out of their
age group toward the younger women.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the response has been mostly positive, Deyo said. Los
Angeles already has seen six marriages - and one baby - result from
SpeedDating.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can go out and take a chance at a bar or you can go here
and literally meet 40 people in an hour,'' said Michael Mandelman,
a 49-year-old attorney. ''It's a great way to meet people all the
way around.''

<HEADLINE> McGreevey gets labor support  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - For the second time this week, Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Jim McGreevey Thursday flexed his organized
labor muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, likely McGreevey opponent U.S. Sen. Robert
Torricelli later released a list of his union supporters.
</P>
<P>
   All this almost one year before a possible face off between the
two Democratic powerhouses in the June 2001 primary.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey, who nearly upset Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997 in his
first gubernatorial bid, held a Statehouse news conference at which
scores of union members loudly proclaimed their support.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the New Jersey State Building and
Construction Trades Council, unions representing state workers and
other labor organizations crowded his news conference to greet him
with thunderous applause.

<P>
   ''This is the single largest labor endorsement in a primary in
the state's history,'' he said. ''In 2001, this state will see a
labor force unparalleled in history rumble across New Jersey to
elect the best New Jersey governor for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate held a similar rally in a Newark hotel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, D-N.J., who said last week he would consider running
for governor, later released his own, shorter, list of individual
union endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll, meanwhile, measured both candidates' favorable
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday,
Torricelli has a 27 percent rating, with 22 percent rating him
unfavorably, 22 percent ''mixed'' and 29 percent registering no
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey rated a 19 percent favorable rating, 9 percent
unfavorable, 15 percent mixed and 56 percent no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted of 910 registered New Jersey voters last
week and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Experiments Suggest 'Fat Virus'  </HEADLINE>
By MATT CRENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   A cold-like virus may cause obesity, new experiments suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Wisconsin in Madison have found
that mice and chickens infected with a common human virus put on
much more fat than uninfected animals. They have also discovered
that the same virus is more prevalent among overweight people, a
strong indication that it may also cause obesity in humans.
</P>
<P>
   In four experiments, the Wisconsin researchers inoculated
chickens and mice with adenovirus-36, a member of a viral family
that includes about 50 strains. Most adenoviruses cause colds,
diarrhea or pinkeye.
</P>
<P>
   After several months, animals infected with adenovirus-36
weighed only 7 percent more on average than those without the
virus, but their bodies contained more than twice as much fat.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first human virus that has been shown to cause
obesity in animals,'' said Nikhil Dhurandhar, one of the study's
authors.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the first virus the researchers looked at, raising
the possibility that other human viruses may also cause obesity.
Dhurandhar and his colleagues picked adenovirus-36 simply because
little is known about it and the strain is relatively easy to work
with.
</P>
<P>
   Their study is being published in the August issue of the
International Journal of Obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It raises a host of very interesting questions,'' said John
Foreyt, an obesity expert at Baylor College of Medicine. ''If it
really does play a role I think it's a real breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest results do not indicate that all obesity is caused by
viruses, Foreyt said. But they strongly suggest that infection
plays an important role.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's just so much more we need to do on this before we can
say anything definitive,'' said Richard Atkinson, a University of
Wisconsin professor and author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Unpublished studies in humans show that 20 to 30 percent of
overweight people are infected with adenovirus-36, compared to
about 5 percent of the lean population.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are not completely surprised by the Wisconsin group's
results. In the last few years, they have found signs that many
chronic health conditions are caused by infections. Three different
microbes are thought to contribute to clogged arteries. Long
thought to be a product of high stress and a poor diet, ulcers are
now known to be caused by the bacterium Helicobacter pylori.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several animal viruses are already known to cause
obesity in both animals and humans. But adenovirus-36 is the first
human virus known to cause an increase in fat.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers do not know yet how adenovirus-36 causes obesity.
Infected animals did not eat more than uninfected ones, suggesting
that the virus decreases energy expenditure rather than increasing
appetite.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that it increases the number of fat cells, which
encourages them to store more fat,'' said Dhurandhar, who recently
joined Wayne State University in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The animal obesity viruses appear to work differently from
adenovirus-36, by damaging the part of the brain that controls
appetite. The Wisconsin researchers saw no brain damage in chickens
and mice infected with adenovirus-36.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a day or two of cold-like symptoms, Atkinson said,
the virus produced no observable effects besides obesity.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, animals infected with the virus also had
decreased levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in their blood.
Generally, obesity is associated with high cholesterol and
triglyceride levels.
</P>
<P>
   Far more research is needed before any practical benefits can be
reaped from this research, Atkinson said. It is still too early to
know whether it may be possible to develop an effective vaccine
against obesity or otherwise counteract the effects of the virus.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Plan Talks  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian negotiators prepared
Thursday to resume talks this weekend following the failure of the
U.S.-mediated summit, each side looking for crucial support and
staking out bargaining positions.
</P>
<P>
   Saeb Erekat, a top aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, was
to meet Sunday with Israeli negotiator Oded Eran.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will discuss how we will arrange the new relationship
between us and the Israelis after the collapse of Camp David,''
said Arafat aide Nabil Amr.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's office said he would soon
visit Egypt for talks with President Hosni Mubarak, who along with
other Arab leaders has supported Arafat's claim to all of east
Jerusalem. The meeting was originally set for Friday, but was
postponed because of scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, whose nation in 1979 became the first Arab state to
make peace with Israel, is a key regional mediator and has worked
to form Arab consensus on issues like the future of Jerusalem and
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Abdul-Illah Khatib of Jordan, home to 1.5
million refugees, said Thursday that his King Abdullah II was to
meet Mubarak in Cairo on Monday. The foreign minister, who met
Thursday with Palestinian negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo, said Jordan
will also play host to an unidentified Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat also had travel plans -- to Paris on Saturday to meet with
French President Jacques Chirac. Both Arafat and Barak had
conferred with Chirac before the summit, with Arafat pressing for
more European involvement, perhaps to counter what is seen as U.S.
bias toward Israel. France assumed the six-month rotating European
Union presidency this month.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally outside his offices in the Palestinian-controlled
West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday afternoon, Arafat was firm
on his claim on Jerusalem, a position that scuttled the Maryland
talks, which ended Tuesday in deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every boy and girl of my people will see the Palestinian flag
on every mosque in Jerusalem,'' Arafat told a cheering crowd of
more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long insisted that Jerusalem remain united under
exclusive Israeli sovereignty. But at Camp David, Barak reportedly
offered the Palestinians control of certain Arab neighborhoods just
inside Jerusalem, a vaguely defined ''special regime'' in the
Muslim and Christian quarters of Jerusalem's walled Old City,
administrative autonomy over Jerusalem's Muslim holy places and
unhindered access to the Al-Aqsa mosque.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiators rejected anything short of sovereignty
over east Jerusalem as their national capital.
</P>
<P>
   Kifah Othman, who traveled from the nearby village of Beit Ur
for Arafat's rally, said she would be willing to accept Palestinian
compromise on some points, such as whether Israel could keep a few
settlements in Palestinian territory or have some kind of security
arrangement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we can't get everything we want,'' she said. ''But we
must have all of east Jerusalem and the refugees must be able to
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Israelis, for their part, indicated how far they had been
willing to go on Jerusalem. Gilead Sher, a member of the Israeli
delegation at Camp David, told Israel army radio Thursday that the
Israelis discussed a proposal for a Palestinian presidential office
in Jerusalem's Muslim Quarter. Such an idea would have been almost
inconceivable not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Besides renewing contacts with the Palestinians, Barak began
trying to restore his shattered parliamentary majority Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faced a new threat from within his own One Israel party
late Thursday. Foreign Minister David Levy said he told Barak in a
one-on-one meeting that the ''grave'' concessions he had made at
Camp David ''did not please me.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also met Thursday with his principal political rival,
Ariel Sharon, to brief him on the summit. Sharon heads the
right-wing Likud party, which has bitterly opposed the concessions
Barak offered at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Sharon said the meeting failed to change his
opposition to the negotiations. What he heard left him ''very
worried,'' he said, and ''If I'm worried, all of Israel should be
worried.'' He called for early elections.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Unveil Dinosaur Skeleton  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ASTOR
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Scientists on Thursday unveiled
the reconstructed skeleton of a sheep dog-sized dinosaur they said
was an ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Kellner, a professor at Federal University of Rio de
Janeiro who led the team that found the Santanaraptor in Brazil,
said the discovery was important, both because of how well it was
preserved and the clues it provided about the origins of
Tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   ''The material is perfect, it's as if it was buried yesterday,''
Kellner said.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner's team uncovered the bones in 1991 during a dig in
southern Ceara state, 1,200 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro, but
it was only recently that the team confirmed it as the only
specimen of an extinct species belonging to a group that evolved
into the Tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Santanaraptor lived right at the time when the South
American continent was separating from Africa, Kellner believes the
discovery proves the Tyrannosaurus rex's roots lie in the Southern
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his team only managed to uncover the dinosaur's two
legs and parts of the hips and tail, they were able to reconstruct
the whole body by looking at dinosaurs with similar bone structures
at around the same stage of evolution and extrapolate.
</P>
<P>
   What they eventually pieced together was a carnivore standing
around two-and-a-half feet tall, measuring about six feet from head
to tail and weighing about 65 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   So well preserved were the remains that scientists even found
fossilized soft tissue -- such as blood vessels and muscle -- along
with the bones. Although scientists had already found fossilized
impressions of soft tissue, Kellner said this marked the first time
that tissue itself had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This discovery opens up whole new avenues of research that
weren't available to us before. We're still trying to figure out
what questions we can ask with this material,'' Kellner said.
</P>
<P>
   Kellner said it was entirely possible that they would one day be
able to retrieve DNA from the specimens, which they could use to
determine the dinosaurs outward appearance, such as color and
musculature.

<HEADLINE> House Passes African AIDS Measure  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House passed a measure Thursday
establishing a trust fund to help AIDS-devastated Africa. The
measure now goes to the White House for President Clinton's
signature.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has said Clinton will sign the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world today is confronted with the greatest health crisis
in human history,'' said the Banking Committee chairman, Rep. James
Leach, R-Iowa. ''Infectious diseases, like HIV/AIDS, know no
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease kills 6,000 people a day in Africa, has orphaned
some 15 percent of children in the worst affected cities, and by
some estimates will lower life expectancy in sub-Saharan Africa
from 59 in the early 1990s to 45 by 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The House bill, passed by voice vote, directs the Treasury
Secretary to negotiate the creation of a trust fund in the World
Bank to gather public and private funding to combat the spread of
HIV and AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, which has 10 percent of the
world's population but 70 percent of the world's AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   The bill authorizes U.S. contributions of $150 million a year
for two years with the aim of using that as a springboard to bring
in up to $1 billion a year from international donors. The House had
originally pushed for a $500 million U.S. contribution over five
years, but the Senate scaled it back.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of the money has been earmarked for orphans in Africa
while other resources will go toward preventing mother-to-child
transmission of the HIV virus and bolstering HIV/AIDS education and
prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. representative to the World Bank's Board of Trustees
would administer the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   American attention to the AIDS crisis has taken on a new
dimension in recent months since the administration declared it a
national security threat that could destabilize fragile democracies
and crush economic progress for whole continents.
</P>
<P>
   Five major pharmaceutical companies, responding to complaints
that new effective AIDS treatments are beyond the reach of millions
of Africans with the disease because of high costs, have agreed to
make substantial cuts in the price of AIDS drugs for Africa and
other developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Adoption Legislation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation needed to implement an
international treaty on foreign adoptions unanimously passed the
Senate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty, known as the Hague Convention on Intercountry
Adoption, was created to establish guidelines for international
adoptions and include provisions to end smuggling and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would give various federal agencies the authority to
implement the treaty once it is ratified by two-thirds of the
Senate. The United States signed the measure in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides say lawmakers expect the House to ''move swiftly''
in final passage of the implementing language. Once that is
completed, the Senate will consider ratification of the treaty,
although lawmakers have given no indication when that may happen.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have said international guidelines on adoptions are
needed to ease and streamline the adoption process as well as
prevent abuses like trafficking, misrepresentation of a child's
medical condition and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said the legislation ''is intended to bring
some accountability into agencies that provide intercountry
adoption services in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Adoption Attorneys released a statement
saying the measure ''holds tremendous potential to correct some
significantly flawed international adoption practices.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving authority to various federal agencies to
implement the treaty, the measure also includes guidelines for
federal authorities to begin accrediting adoption agencies that
work internationally.

<HEADLINE> Whitman announces third round of faith-based grants  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Thirty-six community based groups will share
$2.26 million in state grants, with just under half going to aid
people leaving welfare programs, Gov. Christie Whitman announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the basement of a church that collected one of the
first grants two years ago, Whitman said she sees this program as
the best hope to revitalize New Jersey's cities.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, the Whitman administration will have given $15
million to local social service agencies affiliated with a
community church group.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders and cabinet members joined Whitman in boasting
that New Jersey's program is the most extensive of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the largest direct contribution to faith-based
community initiatives in America,'' Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to nearly 100 community organizers at the Woodland
Avenue Presbyterian Church, Whitman said local organizations
deserve the praise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Truly it is through all of you and your commitment to your
communities that we are making a difference in the state of New
Jersey,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Faith-based programs work because community groups know what
local neighborhoods need, Whitman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are the leaders in your communities and we should be there
to help you help others,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodland Community Development Corporation funds a summer
camp program and other outreach efforts, pastor Floyd White said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to do God's work here on earth,'' White said.
''Without the faith-based community initiatives, we wouldn't be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Community groups get more than money, said Jane Kenny,
commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs. The state
offers management training and other tools, Kenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen groups will share $1 million to support people leaving
state welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those organizations will contact every person and advise them of
other state programs, such as child care and job training,
according to Human Services Commissioner Michele Guhl.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1,300 people each month end welfare to join the
work force, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be the most aggressive outreach to these people we
have,'' Guhl said.
</P>
<P>
   Faith-based groups were selected in part because welfare
recipients tend to respond better to them, she said.

<HEADLINE> Tentative agreement addresses disability, overtime concerns  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Westchester County and its prison
guards reached tentative agreement Thursday on a contract that
addresses a long-standing sore point - the alleged abuse of
disability pay and the resulting overtime costs to the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither side would divulge terms of the deal, both said
it includes provisions meant to deal with officers who take
advantage of disability rights. The current contract allows a union
member who claims disability to leave work until a doctor certifies
that he has recovered. If fraud is suspected, it is up to the
county to prove it, rather than up to the worker to prove he is
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, a task force found that about 35 percent of the
county's 750 correction officers had been filing injury claims each
year since 1993, costing taxpayers almost $15 million a year. The
county publicized videotapes of supposedly disabled officers
engaged in rigorous pursuits and even subpoenaed a bowling league's
records to show that a guard who claimed a shoulder injury was well
enough to break 200 on the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Goodstein, counsel to the Correction Officers Benevolent
Association, said the new contract has elements ''to deal with each
party's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have different views on what causes overtime problems,'' he
said. ''The county blames it on officers out on compensation; we
blame it on the fact that in 1991 there were 986 officers and now
it's below 800.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Schwartz, chief adviser to County Executive Andrew Spano,
said the new contract ''will hopefully end and resolve the
longstanding problems and controversies and issues that have
existed between the union and county government.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I say 'hopefully,''' he emphasized. ''Nobody has a crystal
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   If ratified by the 780-member union next month and approved by
the county Legislature, the contract would cover six years, dating
back to 1996. It expires at the end of 2001.

<HEADLINE> Grand jury declines to indict officer in Dorismond shooting  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A grand jury cleared an undercover narcotics
officer of criminal charges Thursday in the March slaying of
Patrick Dorismond, prompting both the mayor and the Manhattan
district attorney to express their sympathy to the unarmed victim's
family.
</P>
<P>
   The decision clears Detective Anthony Vasquez, who fired the
fatal shot into Dorismond's chest, of any criminal wrongdoing in
the death that inflamed racial tensions and raised political
problems for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond shooting occurred just three weeks after the
acquittal of four officers in the Bronx slaying of Amadou Diallo,
another unarmed black man.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, while offering
their condolences to the Dorismond family, both defended the
decision by a grand jury that heard 24 witnesses and saw 42
exhibits in its monthlong probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people may be disappointed that this investigation has
not resulted in an indictment,'' Morgenthau said in announcing the
grand jury finding.
</P>
<P>
   ''The grand jury is not a forum for the expression of political
views, or the resolution of policy disputes,'' he said. ''To allow
it to be used for those purposes would simply layer an injustice
upon a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's parents and sister, joined by the Rev. Al Sharpton
at an emotionally wrought news conference, issued a call for the
U.S. Justice Department to take over the case - now an almost
standard request by grieving families in police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's father stood holding his dead son's watch, while his
mother wept and shouted an angry attack on Giuliani. ''Mr. Mayor
... you just took everything from my son,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White in Manhattan said
her office routinely reviews evidence in cases such as the
Dorismond death. She said the review would include the report
issued by Morgenthau Thursday and all other evidence ''to determine
whether there were any violations of the federal criminal civil
rights laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, a Brooklyn native whose family came from Haiti,
was fatally wounded on March 16. The fight began after the officer,
part of an undercover drug sweep in the neighborhood north of
Madison Square Garden, asked where he could buy marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, speaking at City Hall on Thursday, said he wanted to
''extend my sympathy and my prayers to the people most affected by
this: the Dorismond family, who will have a very hard time
accepting this.''
</P>
<P>
   The family, Morgenthau said, ''has suffered an irreparable loss.
I want to extend my sympathy to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor extended the same wishes to Vasquez and his family.
</P>
<P>
   The case assumed added significance when Giuliani, then still
running for U.S. Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, set off a
furor by publicly releasing Dorismond's sealed juvenile criminal
record. The mayor also publicized a toxicology report showing
Dorismond, a security guard, had marijuana in his system when he
died.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's decision to go public with the records infuriated the
dead man's family, black activists and the city's Haitian
community. Dorismond's father, Andre, was a renowned Haitian
singer.
</P>
<P>
   In Dorismond's East Flatbush neighborhood, word of the grand
jury verdict was greeted angrily.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no justice,'' said Verona Gray, who stood with a
friend across the street from Dorismond's building. ''I am so
angry. I am so outraged ... It's all politics, and politics
stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau, questioned about whether the black victim of a
police shooting could receive justice from a grand jury, said the
panel was ''racially mixed ... took its duties seriously and
reached a fair result.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days after the shooting, tensions ran so high that
Dorismond's funeral broke into a free-for-all, with 27 people
arrested and 23 officers injured.
</P>
<P>
   The Dorismond family, which is represented by prominent lawyer
Johnny Cochran Jr., has filed a $100 million civil claim against
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The family also has rebuffed Giuliani's efforts to sit down and
talk, apparently angered by the mayor's earlier character attacks
on the dead man.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vasquez and his partner, the incident began when
Dorismond threw a punch at the second officer during a
confrontation outside a bar on Eighth Avenue. Dorismond and a
friend, Kevin Kaiser, then allegedly attacked the officer.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez said that as he came to his partner's aid, he heard one
of the two men scuffling with the officer saying, ''Get his gun!''
Vasquez claimed that he shouted ''Police! Police!'' before pulling
his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   When Dorismond grabbed at the gun, it went off and a single
bullet struck him in the chest, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Kaiser, in a news conference five days after the
shooting, insisted that the officers threw the first punch and
Dorismond was only defending himself. Kaiser also alleged that
neither cop identified himself as a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The officers still face a departmental review. First Deputy
Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher promised to look at the case
''from A to Z.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Roth Offers Drug Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elderly couples with incomes less than $17,800
a year could get emergency assistance apart from the Medicare
program in buying prescription drugs under a proposal put forth
Thursday by the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said his proposal would at least make
targeted relief available to the most needy if the Republican
Congress and President Clinton can't agree on adding a prescription
drug benefit to the Medicare program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants a 10-year, $250 billion prescription drug program
run by the government and covering all Medicare beneficiaries at a
premium cost to them starting at $25 a month and rising over
several years to $50 a month. The House has passed a Republican
bill based mainly on subsidizing private insurance to cover
prescription costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the challenges that have emerged, I will continue to
seek bipartisan consensus on a comprehensive package of reforms in
Medicare,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his fallback plan, modeled on the state-run Children
Health Insurance Program, would begin Oct. 1 and run for four years
or until Congress passes a broader Medicare prescription drug
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   States would have the option of covering the elderly with
incomes of up to 150 percent of the federal poverty level -- which
would include elderly couples with annual incomes of less than
$17,800. States could base the coverage on Medicaid's benefit, on
what's provided in their most popular state employee health plan or
on any other model approved by the U.S. Health and Human Services
Department, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   States also could extend eligibility to people with
state-defined catastrophic drug expenditures, he said. However, in
case states don't want to participate, the federal government will
set up a new drug board outside of the Health Care Financing
Administration to deliver benefits, Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   Roth wants the Congressional Budget Office to tell him by
September how much his proposal will cost so that lawmakers can
consider it when they return after Labor Day from the political
party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   He also is advocating a new ''Expanded Option'' Medicare plan in
which the government would share costs of prescription drugs above
a certain deductible. Recipients also would get improved hospital
coverage under a separate deductible.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Sex Trade Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill intended to protect thousands of
foreign women and children forced into the sex trade in the United
States and crack down on their victimizers passed the Senate on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this is a wonderful day for freedom,'' said Sen. Sam
Brownback, R-Kan., as the Senate approved the legislation on a
voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   A similar version of the bill also has passed the House. It will
now go to conference committee, but ''the differences are pretty
minimal,'' Brownback said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who first started working on the
legislation more than two years ago, said more than 50,000 women
are brought into the United States annually as sex slaves.
Internationally, more than 700,000 woman and girls are being used
as sex slaves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this to be a very important piece of human rights
legislation,'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would stop the practice of immediately deporting
victims by providing them interim immigration relief of up to three
years. Supporters of the bill say that would give them enough time
to bring charges against sex trade traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   It also toughens current federal trafficking penalties,
criminalizing all forms of trafficking in persons.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just lighting a candle for the world,'' Wellstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, countries that encourage trafficking in persons
won't be hit with immediate economic sanctions but officials will
provide the president with a list of such countries, at which point
he can decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I see it doing is providing the president with tools, not
requirements,'' Brownback said.
------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 3244.

<HEADLINE> Council Extends S. Lebanon Mission  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council voted Thursday to
keep the U.N. peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon for another
six months and urged the country to quickly deploy its own forces
to the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimously approved resolution, the council also called on
Lebanon and Israel to respect the United Nations-drawn frontier
dividing them and to exercise restraint near the border.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came as the U.N. envoy for the Middle East, Terje
Roed-Larsen, and the Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss said U.N.
peacekeepers and Lebanese security forces would soon deploy to
border areas after one remaining Israeli encroachment of Lebanese
territory is corrected.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 peacekeepers of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or
UNIFIL, had been scheduled to begin deploying on Wednesday from
their current positions in Lebanon north of the border. But Lebanon
put those plans on hold after discovering four new Israeli
violations in border areas.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four violations have been corrected, and Israel has
promised to end the last infraction on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday, the Israeli army urged Lebanon and the
United Nations to speed deployment, saying the troops were needed
as a buffer between Israeli citizens and radical Hezbollah militia.
The army said 27 incidents had taken place along the border in the
last week, including one in which two Israeli soldiers were
slightly injured by rock-throwing Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Nancy Soderberg said the council decision
to keep the U.N. mission in southern Lebanon through Jan. 31 sent a
''positive signal'' throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is now up to the government of Lebanon to move forward to
reassert its full control, including the checkpoints along the
border and ensure calm,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution hints that the council would like to see
the U.N. mission, launched in 1978, eventually wind down once
Lebanon has reasserted its authority in the areas recently vacated
by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution drafted by France emphasizes the ''interim
nature'' of the mission and says the council ''looks forward to the
early fulfillment of the mandate of UNIFIL.''
</P>
<P>
   It asks Secretary-General Kofi Annan to include in an upcoming
report recommendations for jobs that could be carried out by
another U.N. mission in the region -- the U.N. Truce Supervision
Organization in the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Phila. man admits role in drug ring that operated in barbershop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A Philadelphia man pleaded guilty Thursday
to his role in a methamphetamine ring that operated out of a south
Philadelphia barbershop, said U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Santaguida, 53, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute
and possession with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of
methamphetamine between June 1999 and April 12, when he and nine
others were charged.
</P>
<P>
   He faces between 10 years and life in prison and a $4 million
fine when sentenced Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Santaguida is the brother of noted criminal defense attorney
Joseph Santaguida, who has defended numerous people accused of
being members of the Philadelphia-southern New Jersey mafia.
</P>
<P>
   During his guilty plea, Louis Santaguida said he bought pound
quantities of methamphetamine from co-defendants Sammy Bonaccurso,
55, and Phillip Whelan, 49, both of Philadelphia. He also said he
distributed the drug in several ounce quantities to others,
including several co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities conducted a series of raids in April that they said
dismantled the ring that had sold methamphetamine, or ''crank,'' as
it is known among users, in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   They seized two pounds of methamphetamine, 8.5 pounds of
marijuana, $193,000 cash and three firearms, Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   The April arrests wrapped up an 11-month probe that began with a
tip developed in a drug arrest in Clementon. The information led
authorities to a drug ring centered at Rocco and Elmer's Hair
Styling on Seventh Street in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Undercover agents bought methamphetamine from members of the
ring for up to $12,000 a pound, Cleary said.
</P>
<P>
   The others charged are: Louis Grosso, 36, of Havertown, Pa.;
Richard Zammer, 34, of Lindenwold; Billy Cicalese, 54, of
Philadelphia; Thomas Sees, 36, of Williamstown; Vincent Gori, age
unavailable, of Turnersville; Theodore Iannone, 43, of Egg Harbor
Township; and Dominick Imbesi, 49, of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   All were charged with conspiracy to distribute and possession
with intent to distribute methamphetamine. Each could face 10 years
to life in prison and $4 million in fines if convicted.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 16, Rockies 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Adrian Beltre had a career-high six RBIs,
including his second grand slam of the year, and Alex Cora had two
homers and five RBIs Thursday as the Los Angeles Dodgers outlasted
the Colorado Rockies 16-11.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre went 4-for-6 and Cora was 4-for-5, setting career highs
for hits and RBIs as the Dodgers won for the seventh time in nine
games.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which overcame four errors, tied its season high
for runs and set a season high with 20 hits.
</P>
<P>
   As both teams scored in double digits at Coors Field for the
fourth time this season, Dodgers starter Eric Gagne was pounded for
nine runs -- six earned -- and 11 hits in 4 1-3 innings. He is
winless in his last seven starts.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Kevin Jarvis was tagged for seven runs -- just one
earned -- and seven hits in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Walker went 4-for-4 with a home run and two RBIs and Jeff
Cirillo had two hits and three RBIs for the Rockies, who lost for
the 18th time in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles fell behind 3-0 in the first, took a 7-3 lead with a
six-run third, then saw Colorado tie it in the fourth. The Dodgers
broke open the game with four runs in the fifth and three in the
sixth, taking a 14-8 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Onan Masaoka (1-0) pitched two-thirds of an inning for the win.
Loser Giovanni Carrara (0-1), who followed Jarvis, gave up seven
runs and seven hits in two-thirds of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Neifi Perez's RBI single and Cirillo's two-run single put
Colorado ahead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre hit an RBI single in the second, and the Dodgers went
ahead in the third on Gary Sheffield's RBI single, Beltre's slam
and Cora's solo homer -- the fourth time this year the Dodgers hit
consecutive homers. The inning was set up by Cirillo's throwing
error on Mark Grudzielanek's one-out grounder to third.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have hit eight slams in a single season for the
first time since the Brooklyn Dodgers did it in 1952. Beltre also
hit one May 21 at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which had 15 hits, closed to 7-5 in the third on
Cirillo's RBI single and Brent Mayne's run-scoring grounder, then
tied it in the fourth on Todd Helton's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles regained the lead in the fifth on Beltre's RBI
single and Cora's three-run homer off Carrara (0-1).
</P>
<P>
   Mayne hit a solo home run in the bottom half, but RBI singles by
Sheffield, Todd Hundley and Cora increased the lead to 14-8 in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White and Sheffield had RBI singles for Los Angeles in the
eighth. Walker homered in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Los Angeles Hundley from the 15-day DL and optioned C Paul
Loduca to Triple-A Albuquerque. ... RHP Ismael Valdes, acquired
Wednesday from the Chicago Cubs, will meet up with the Dodgers in
Philadelphia, the team's next stop on a 10-day road trip. ...
Mayne's sixth homer matched his career high. ... A Walker homer
reached the third deck for the sixth time. Overall, there have been
13 homers into the third deck.

<HEADLINE> Lazio's state PAC hands out money to local pols  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A state political action committee set up by
Rick Lazio, Hillary Rodham Clinton's U.S. Senate opponent, doled
out a total of $72,500 one day this month to all 62 county
Republican committees in New York, campaign records showed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazio PAC also gave $1,000 to Conservative Party committees
in Erie, Brooklyn, Queens and Suffolk counties that same day.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has been endorsed by both the Republican and Conservative
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan said the funds were intended to be
used by the local GOP committees for such things as
get-out-the-vote drives and other party-building activities.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the money was also designed to boost Lazio's Senate
campaign effort, McLagan said, ''It is good for New York, good for
the party and good for democracy.'' He repeated that statement when
pressed on whether the largesse would benefit Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   In a related story, the state Board of Elections Thursday failed
to disqualify petitions that could leave six Democrats on a primary
ballot in the race for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic commissioners - Evelyn Aquila and Carol Berman -
abstained from voting on the motion to diqualify, which died for
the lack of a three-vote majority, according to Republican
commissioner Neil Kelleher. Kelleher and Helena Donohue opposed the
petitions by Irving Geld, Jimmy McMillan, Eric Ruano Melendez and
Peter Ruane.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, those four, frontrunner Clinton and New York City
doctor Mark McMahon could all be on a Sept. 12 Democratic primary.
The move could take anti-Clinton voters away from McMahon, his camp
said.
</P>
<P>
   A laywer for McMahon said the other candidates filed faulty
petitions and he has submitted court papers to get them
disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the first lady called for a series of debates against
the congressman from Long Island, starting as soon as possible. She
said the two have clear policy differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we should debate across New York state so that
people can see us and hear us and know what those differences
are,'' she told the Federated Hispanic Chambers of Commerce
breakfast in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Absolutely! We look forward to debating Mrs. Clinton,''
McLagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also picked up the endorsement of the state's largest
gay and lesbian political organization, the 25,000-member Empire
State Pride Agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio found himself facing questions over a report in the New
York Post that he was lobbying federal officials to give money to
the Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of HIV/AIDS, an
organization that claims the HIV virus doesn't cause AIDS. A Lazio
spokesman said the congressman doesn't agree with the theory, but
wanted to help it get money for ''alternative treatment'' methods.
</P>
<P>
   A major advantage of Lazio's state PAC, established in 1995, is
that it can accept huge donations. His federal Senate campaign
committee is limited to $2,000 contributions from individuals and
none from corporations. The state PAC can take in up to $76,500
annually from individuals and $5,000 from corporate donors.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of the state PAC is that the money can't legally be
spent directly on Lazio's Senate campaign. However, it can be
donated to local party committees that can use it to get out GOP
voters, an effort that could be helpful in a close race, especially
in a state where Democrats enjoy a 5-3 edge over Republicans in
voter enrollment. Independent polls have shown Clinton and Lazio
running neck-and-neck.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's state PAC represents a sort of ''soft-money'' operation
that he has been critical of Clinton for utilizing at the federal
level.
</P>
<P>
   Records filed with the state Board of Elections show Lazio's PAC
sent out the checks to the local party committees on July 10. The
contributions, first reported Thursday by The New York Times, range
from $500 for GOP committees in smaller counties such as Essex up
to the $4,000 checks given to committees in Nassau, Suffolk,
Westchester, Rockland, Onondaga, Monroe and Erie counties.
</P>
<P>
   The state records show that since January of last year, Lazio's
state PAC has raised almost $390,000 and spent just over $300,000.
His federal Senate campaign committee has raised $5 million in
April, May and June alone.
</P>
<P>
   The state PAC raised $130,000 over the past six months, much of
it coming from a June fund-raiser held at the Long Island home of
Christopher Quackenbush, a Lazio friend who is head of investment
banking at Sandler, O'Neill &AMP; Partners, according to the Times.
Quackenbush gave $25,000 to the congressman's state PAC. Lazio
serves on the House Banking Committee and is chairman of the
House's subcommittee on housing.
</P>
<P>
   Other big contributors to the Lazio state PAC include the New
York Association of Mortgage Brokers ($5,000); Manhattan physician
Jerome Levy ($25,000); Long Island contractor William Haugland
($25,500); National Jewish Coalition board member Lawrence Kadish
($10,000); and Adele Smithers ($50,000).
</P>
<P>
   Smithers is the widow of the founder of the Smithers Addiction
and Treatment Research Center in New York City, Robert Brinkley
Smithers. The celebrity rehab center's alumni include professional
baseball player Darryl Strawberry and author Truman Capote.

<HEADLINE> Mets' Roberts Endures Painful Debut  </HEADLINE>
By DOMINICK BALSAMO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Grant Roberts waited a long time for his major
league debut. Now he wishes he could get a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't show the real Grant Roberts and I think the team
knows that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, the New York Mets' top pitching prospect, was hit hard
in his first major league start. He lasted only 1 1-3 innings,
giving up seven runs and six hits Thursday in the Mets' 9-8
come-from-behind victory over the Montreal Expos in the first game
of a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   He threw 65 pitches in his brief stint, walking three, striking
out none, and getting only two Expos to swing and miss. He also was
hurt by an unearned run.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grant was up in the zone and missing pitches,'' manager Bobby
Valentine said. ''He was probably nervous, but he is only human.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was in uniform more than three hours before the game,
pacing the Mets clubhouse. He was admittedly rattled by pitching in
New York for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very nervous, I tried to get a rhythm but it didn't
work,'' he said. ''I have been waiting for this for a long time and
was very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine suspected that his young right-hander was a bit
unsettled in his debut. After Roberts walked the first two batters
of the game, Valentine made a rare trip to the mound to try to
relax him with some humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him that he looked good in his uniform and that the
last time I checked the mound it was 60 feet, 6 inches, just like
all the rest,'' the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his nerves, Roberts lacked control and was unable
to display the entire arsenal that has made the 22-year-old one of
the top pitching prospects in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only threw fastballs and sliders, no change-ups or curves; I
was really choking the ball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon being removed in the second inning, Roberts buried his face
in a towel as he sat in the dugout, but was not worried about the
impression that he left,
</P>
<P>
   Following the game Roberts was sent back to Triple-A Norfolk as
expected to make room for Kurt Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a little taste and got the fire burning some more, and I
will be back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has been very successful at the minor league level since
the Mets drafted him in the 11th round of the 1995 draft. He caught
the Mets' attention by going 9-1 in his first full professional
season.
</P>
<P>
   He was also selected to the 2000 All-Star Futures game along
with fellow Mets prospect, outfielder Alex Escobar. Both players
have been prominently mentioned in the Mets trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   As the July 31 trade deadline nears, Roberts certainly did not
increase his value, although the Mets do not believe it will hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were looking at a young player for a while, one major
league game wouldn't change our opinion one way or another,'' GM
Steve Phillips said before Roberts pitched.

<HEADLINE> Johnny Bench Quits Radio Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Johnny Bench has quit a daily radio show with
Reds announcer Marty Brennaman after the two had a dispute over
whether the broadcaster should have referred to Pete Rose in a Hall
of Fame speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bench has quit WLW-AM's daily morning ''Brennaman and Bench on
Baseball'' show, station operations manager Darryl Parks said
Thursday. Parks said he had been told Bench had resigned from the
show, but did not have any official communication explaining
Bench's reason for leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Before Brennaman's speech at his Hall of Fame induction ceremony
on Sunday, Bench approached the announcer to warn him against
saying too much about Rose. Brennaman believes Rose should be in
the Hall of Fame and said so during his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Rose is ineligible for the Hall because he agreed to a lifetime
ban from baseball in 1989 following an investigation of his
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Bench opposes Rose's reinstatement to baseball and election to
the Hall of Fame. A group of Hall of Famers, including Bob Feller
and Ralph Kiner, reportedly were ready to walk out of Sunday's
ceremony had Brennaman used his own induction speech to campaign
for Rose.
</P>
<P>
   Brennaman said he intends to sit down with Bench, a special
consultant to Reds general manager Jim Bowden, and work the problem
out amicably.
</P>
<P>
   ''I intend for that to happen,'' Brennaman said Wednesday.
''Bench has been a very close friend of mine. I've told my wife a
number of times that if anything ever happened to me, he would be
the first person to step forward, whether it be with financial
assistance or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bench and Brennaman were together Wednesday to tape a week's
worth of the five-minute shows. The program airs Mondays through
Fridays. Brennaman said he hopes Bench can be persuaded to return.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough shows already taped to keep the program on air
into next week, Parks said. If Bench does not return, guests can
participate in the program with Brennaman, Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morgan, a former Rose teammate on Cincinnati's ''Big Red
Machine'' championship teams of the 1970s, called WLW on Wednesday
while Brennaman was at the station. Morgan offered to mediate the
Bench-Brennaman dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan gave good advice, Brennaman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just told me that Johnny and I had been friends for too
long to let something like this happen,'' Brennaman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has nothing to do with Marty,'' Bench said. ''It's just my
own decision to make with the station and the way some of the
things were handled.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Meets Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada said he
received support Thursday from President Clinton for efforts to
achieve peace in areas threatened by Muslim insurgents and for
helping long-neglected Filipino war veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada, speaking to reporters at the White House, said the two
leaders discussed Asian security concerns, economic development,
and trade and investment. Clinton did not make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I informed President Clinton of the Philippines' continuing
support of America's regional security presence in the
Asia-Pacific,'' Estrada said, noting an agreement he helped push
through the Philippine Congress that allows a resumption of joint
U.S.-Philippine military training. That was a switch from Estrada's
position in 1991, when as a senator he helped expel the last U.S.
base from the former American colony.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada said direct military assistance was not discussed. He
assured Clinton of his commitment to achieve peace in a region
where foreign hostages have been held since April, and said that
Clinton offered support for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked Clinton for helping with legislation that gives
greater access for Filipino World War II veterans to U.S. benefits,
even if they now live in the Philippines. Pending are other
measures that would further compensate Filipino veterans who fought
under the American flag during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after the Estrada meeting, Clinton said
he directed the Department of Veterans Affairs to study the health
needs of aging Filipino WWII veterans in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am eager to find a way to fulfill the needs of this
deserving group of veterans,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In advance of their meeting, Estrada told the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, ''Our alliance has seen both bad and good times.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''No other ally in the region has stood by you
through all the wars in the last six decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Groups representing 3 million Philippine-Americans welcomed
Estrada but also expressed concern over veterans' compensation and
toxic waste, said Jon Melegrito, president of the National
Federation of Filipino American Associations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The veterans' plight has been a long-neglected matter of
justice, and it also has a lot to do with America's honor,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Filipino-Americans also are concerned about debris left behind
by U.S. forces because they have relatives living in the areas
around former Subic Naval Base and Clark Air Base, Melegrito said.
</P>
<P>
   As Estrada met with Clinton, hope increased for release of a
$325 million loan disbursement from the International Monetary
Fund. The fund's board of directors scheduled a meeting Monday to
consider the installment under a $1.37 billion Philippine loan
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The board had been scheduled to meet before Estrada's visit, but
delayed the session because of renewed concern over the his
government's budget deficit and decline of the currency.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dawson, bank spokesman, said the delay was ''so we can
take a look at what these developments are.'' Financial officials
traveling with Estrada met with IMF officials during the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Estrada is accompanied by several members of his Cabinet and
about 100 Philippine business leaders. He also was meeting with
other business groups and with Filipino-Americans in Washington and
New York.

<HEADLINE> Congress Passes Church Zoning Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- City officials will not be able to zone a new
church out of its area simply because they don't want it around
under a bill sent to President Clinton on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Religious groups had complained that cities and towns would try
to use zoning laws to stop them from building new churches or
temples or moving into their area.
</P>
<P>
   Some city officials would ''deliberately exclude all new
churches from an entire city, others refuse to permit churches to
use existing buildings that nonreligious assemblies had previously
used and some intentionally change a zone to exclude a church,''
said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill passed by the House and Senate, land use
regulations that hinder the building of religious buildings to be
justified by a compelling government interest. Also, religious
organizations can't be totally zoned out of a jurisdiction, said
Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The bill doesn't exempt churches from zoning, though. If the
group can't prove the regulations puts a substantial burden on
sincere religious exercise, the claim fails, Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also protects the right of prisoners to practice their
religion as long as it does not disrupt the security, discipline or
order of their institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also said prisoners and mental health patients have been
prevented from practicing their faith, including simple things like
letting Jewish prisoners have matzo and unleavened bread during
Passover even when Jewish groups donated the food for free.
</P>
<P>
   ''The legislation would require that a substantial burden on an
institutionalized person's religious exercise be justified by a
compelling interest,'' Canady said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is S. 2869.

<HEADLINE> D.H. Blair and 15 of its brokers indicted in securities fraud  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A stock brokerage and 15 of its officers and
employees have been indicted on charges of enterprise corruption
for using numerous schemes to defraud investors of tens of millions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Thursday that
D.H. Blair &AMP; Co., a target of several probes over the past 30
years, stole client lists from other firms, manipulated stock
prices, and cheated customers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the Blair employees manipulated the stock prices
of at least 10 initial public offerings (IPOs) to keep them
artificially high.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers are accused of lying or omitting facts about the
stocks, making unreasonable price and profit predictions, and
revealing - or suggesting they had - valuable insider information,
when trying to sell the stocks to customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Blair's customers came from client lists that had been
stolen from Solomon Smith Barney, Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 defendants arraigned Thursday, State Supreme Court
Justice Bernard Fried released 13 on bonds ranging from $250,000 to
$1 million. He jailed the other two until Friday so their
fingerprints could be checked.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's lawyers, Andrew Lawler and Theodore Wells, issued a
statement:
</P>
<P>
   ''D.H. Blair &AMP; Co. and its executives are innocent of these
charges, absolutely deny that they engaged in any criminal activity
whatsoever, and anticipate their ultimate vindication.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The indictment is based on novel theories of securities law
which we believe cannot be the basis for criminal charges,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The 173-count indictment calls Blair a ''criminal enterprise''
that bilked its customers for almost 10 years, from 1989 through
1998 when the firm went out of the brokerage business. Blair still
has an investment banking arm.
</P>
<P>
   One customer was a 70-year-old Florida resident who was a
retired New York Philharmonic trumpet player. He lost about
$250,000 after he was given false price guarantees and subjected to
high-pressure sales tactics.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn tugboat pilot lost $45,000 she had saved to buy a
house. While she was at sea, Morgenthau said, brokers made
unauthorized trades in her account.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Daniel Castleman, chief of
Morgenthau's investigations bureau, said the Blair investigation
grew out of a probe of the defunct brokerage, A.R. Baron. Baron was
begun by former Blair brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Three Blair employees who are not named in the indictment
pleaded guilty in April and apparently are cooperating with the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 15 Blair defendants are also charged with grand
larceny and falsifying business records. All are charged with
enterprise corruption, the top count which is punishable by up to
25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, the regulatory division of the National
Association of Securities Dealers imposed a $2 million fine on
Blair for allegedly fraudulent activity - one of the biggest
penalties ever resulting from the group's market enforcement
activities. Blair also agreed to repay nearly $2.4 million to
customers who were allegedly overcharged through excessive markups
for small-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The firm neither admitted nor denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD also fined Blair's chief executive officer, Kenton E.
Wood, $225,000 and suspended him from the market for 60 days. The
firm's head trader, Vito Capotorto, was fined $300,000 and
suspended for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the New York Stock Exchange fined Blair $250,000 and
censured the firm in February 1997 for allegedly failing to prevent
misconduct by its brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Blair agreed to repay customers a second time in October 1998,
this time in a deal with state securities regulators, setting up a
$2.25 million fund to compensate investors who lost money because
of its allegedly abusive sales practices.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Coup Leader May be Charged  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's president announced a new interim
government Friday lacking supporters of former coup leader George
Speight, a day after the military said Speight may face charges for
treason.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cabinet, which was due to be sworn in later Friday, was
similar in lineup to one announced last week, except for the
removal of three men closely associated with Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Laisenia Qarase, a banker, was named Friday as Fiji's next prime
minister. Qarase was named prime minister last week and Speight had
demanded he be replaced with a coup supporter.
</P>
<P>
   With every post except one held by ethnic Fijians, the Cabinet
met one of Speight's original demands -- that political power in
this Pacific island nation not slip into the hands of Fiji's large
ethnic Indian minority. The only non-Fijian was an ethnic Indian
named as a junior minister.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and an armed gang stormed the Parliament on May 19 and
took dozens of lawmakers hostage for two months to protest the
election of a prime minister of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the three men from the Cabinet is likely to
further anger Speight's supporters, who have already begun making
reprisals for the arrest Wednesday of Speight and hundreds of other
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, supporters kidnapped two New Zealand civilian
pilots in retaliation for Speight's arrest. The two were released
overnight, military spokesman Maj. Howard Politini said.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots were taken hostage by rebel supporters as they landed
on the island of Vanua Levu, hours after troops stormed a rebel
stronghold in the capital, Suva, to arrest Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Military representatives met with the hostage takers and local
tribal chiefs to secure the men's release. There was no word on
whether the military had offered any concessions in return for
their freedom. Both pilots were believed to be in good health.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel supporters also briefly took up to 50 hostages in another
town on Vanua Levu, but released them after being warned of
military action, a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at continuing intimidation by Speight, who threatened
a new round of civil unrest unless he was given greater influence
over Fiji's next government, the military decided to move against
him and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   After arresting Speight at a checkpoint, dozens of heavily armed
troops stormed a school in Suva early Thursday morning where
several hundred Speight supporters had been camped for the past two
weeks after they gave up control of Fiji's Parliament, where
Speight staged his coup.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini told a news
conference that Speight was arrested for threatening the life of
Fiji's new President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, and for refusing to hand
in all weapons stolen from the army for his coup.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening Iloilo's life ''can be seen as an act of treason,''
and Speight could face such a charge after a full police
investigation, Tarakinikini said. The investigation is expected to
take up to a week.
</P>
<P>
   Launching an emergency budget aimed at curbing the economic
devastation wreaked by the coup, Qarase, who is currently caretaker
prime minister, promised Thursday to ''religiously pursue'' a
government blueprint which discriminates against ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fijians do not seek permanency as an expression of racial
superiority, their motivation is to ensure the survival of a small
and distinct race,'' Qarase said, adding that ''aggressive''
foreign critics such as Australia and New Zealand should leave Fiji
to solve its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand and the United States are demanding the
restoration of democracy in Fiji and have imposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims ethnic Indians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's
population, have too much power and are threatening Fijian culture.
The Indians were first brought to Fiji in the 1870s by British
colonialists as indentured laborers.

<HEADLINE> Miller Replaces Coverdell in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY McMURRAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a ceremony more somber than celebratory,
former Georgia Gov. Zell Miller was sworn in Thursday to fill the
Senate seat left vacant by the death of Paul Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking the oath from Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the
president pro tem, Miller watched from the gallery as colleagues
eulogized Coverdell.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's first floor speech was dominated by memories of his
Republican predecessor. The new Democratic senator acknowledged the
emotional response by senators last week when word spread that one
of their colleagues had died.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thank you for your words, your tears and your testimonies
for one of Georgia's finest sons,'' Miller said. ''You who served
with Paul knew him well. I served with Paul and knew him well
also.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's unexpected death July 18 following a stroke made for
a low-key swearing-in ceremony. Fellow senators warmly welcomed
Miller, applauding lightly after he officially became the state's
junior senator, cutting the Republican majority to 54-46.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows we have heavy hearts,'' said Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss. ''We appreciate the way he has approached this
already. He is one of our colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I will serve no single political party, but rather 7&AMP;frac12; million
Georgians,'' Miller said. ''And every day I serve, I will do my
best to do so in the same spirit of dignity, integrity and
bipartisan cooperation that were the hallmarks of Paul Coverdell's
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said Coverdell and
Miller have many similarities, despite their political differences.
''Like Paul Coverdell, Zell Miller builds bridges, not walls,''
Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller attended his first Senate fund-raiser before being sworn
in, holding a breakfast that supporters said was well-attended. No
other details were released.
</P>
<P>
   A special election will be held Nov. 7 in Georgia to determine
who will complete the final four years of Coverdell's term.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Republican congressmen announced Thursday night that
none of them would run in that contest. Rep. Bob Barr was the last
to bow out, citing the GOP's slim 223-210 majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. Mack Mattingly, Georgia Schools Superintendent
Linda Schrenko and state Rep. Bob Irvin are among those said to be
interested in the post.

<HEADLINE> First gold medals awarded as Empire State Games begin  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - Nathan Jauvtis stood at the end of the
pole vault runway Thursday afternoon, a big smile creasing his
face, as Empire State Games track-and-field officials tried to
figure out how to raise the bar some more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a real tall ladder,'' someone shouted.
</P>
<P>
   So, up went the bar - to 17 feet, three-quarters of an inch -
and over went Jauvtis to win gold for the Central region in the
open men's division and set a new ESG record for the event, not to
mention a personal best.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew from warmups that things were going all right,'' said
Jauvtis, who just completed his first year of doctoral studies in
mechanical engineering at Cornell University and hardly trained for
this competition. ''I hadn't planned on doing what I did today.
Guess I'll have to get a new shopping list.''
</P>
<P>
   Jauvtis easily broke the record of 16-6 set in 1995 by Mike
Thompson of Chenango Forks, also in the Central region. By the time
Jauvtis missed, at 17-4&AMP;frac34;, a small throng was cheering his every
move, including Scott Lundy, another Cornell student, who finished
second and snapped a photo of the winner afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I could do it. I just had to put it together,'' Jauvtis
said. ''It's one thing to jump in practice and do pretty well. It's
another thing to do it in a meet. I'm just really psyched.''
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes after Jauvtis finished, another ESG record fell,
this one in the hammer throw for scholastic men. JP Smolenski of
New Hyde Park, Long Island, had a toss of 198 feet to eclipse the
record of 186-6 set by Adirondack's Steven Dering way back in 1986.
It wasn't close to his personal best of 202-5, but that was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not complaining,'' said Smolenski, whose father, Ed, won
gold in the event at the inaugural Empire State Games in 1978.
''I'm happy I've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   By evening, the Western region had 11 gold medals and was atop
the medal count with 33. Central was second with 26 medals, seven
of them gold, and Long Island had 21 medals, 11 of them gold.
Adirondack was next with 19 medals including five gold, followed by
New York City with 14 total and six gold. Hudson Valley had a dozen
medals, four of them gold.
</P>
<P>
   The scholastic women's high jump had a familiar happy face atop
the podium. Toni-Lee McDaniels of Oneonta in the Central region won
her third straight gold medal, clearing 5 feet, 3.8 inches to edge
Micha Simon of Paul Robeson High School in Brooklyn and Siobhan
Fogarty of Cortlandt Manor in the Hudson Valley. All three cleared
the same height; McDaniels won because she had fewer misses.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, McDaniels could have soared higher, but a certain part
of her anatomy kept getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''At camp, (former world record holder) Dwight Stones told me I
should be a 6-foot jumper, if I could just get my butt in the
air,'' said McDaniels, who left immediately to compete in the
National Junior Olympics in Buffalo on Friday morning. ''That
really wasn't what I wanted to hear. It kind of made me angry.''
</P>
<P>
   In the scholastic men's decathlon, Matthew Spaccarelli of Hudson
Valley was the leader after the first day with 2,895 points. In
second was Michael Couch of Adirondack with 2,794, and Chad
Caldwell of Long Island was third, only another eight points
behind.
</P>
<P>
   In the open men's decathlon, Mario Wilson of Long Island was the
leader with 3,491 points. Central's Ryan Williams was in second
with 3,388, and Jeff Moulton of Hudson Valley was third with 3,298.
</P>
<P>
   Oneithea Lewis of Port Washington, Long Island, switched events
this year and still was golden. A year after she won the open
women's shot put, Lewis finished first in the discus with a throw
of 129 feet, 1 inch. Elizabeth Shope of Rochester took silver for
the Central region and Amanda Miller of Ithaca won bronze, also for
Central.
</P>
<P>
   In the open men's javelin, Don Ampansiri of Catskill took gold
for the Adirondack region, easily beating Steve Jochum of the
Hudson Valley region and Edward Hausdo of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Kaisa Ajaye of Manhattan captured the open women's 10-kilometer
racewalk in 56 minutes, 52.4 seconds, beating Laura Feller of
Carthage in the Central region by more than a minute and a half.
Christine Quirke of Long Island took bronze.
</P>
<P>
   In the open men's 10k racewalk, Allen James of Clifton Park won
gold for Adirondack in 44:56.1, beating Western's Dave Lawrence, of
Kenmore, by nearly eight minutes. Bill Vayo of Scarsdale took
bronze for the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's scholastic long jump final, Trumaine Pendleton of
Southampton, Long Island, won gold, while Marquis Harrison of
Latham took silver and Kevin Ferrone of Mechanicville got bronze
for Adirondack.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Allie Silverman saw people running in Central
Park and decided that was for her. ''It looked like they were
having a good time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman had the time of her life on Thursday morning, although
it wasn't exactly a run in the park. She won the scholastic women's
10,000-meter race at the games.
</P>
<P>
   The diminutive Silverman, representing New York City, and the
much taller Lauren Truesdell of Williamsville in the Western region
pulled away from the field early, with Truesdell setting the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman sped to the lead with just over six laps remaining and
won by 25 seconds in 40:46.41. Tara Sheedy of the Albany suburb of
Latham in the Adirondack region was third.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Silverman kept on running so she wouldn't get tight,
and officials had to corral her from crossing the finish line again
so she wouldn't foul up the electronic timing. She was still
beaming broadly as she cut across the infield grass and finally
stopped to receive congratulations from her family, friends and
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided to go for it because I wasn't too tired,'' said
the 5-foot-1, 85-pound winner, who finished dead last in the 5,000
meters a year ago. ''It feels really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Truesdell was sort of a rookie at the distance - her first race
at 10,000 meters was in the trials - and it didn't take her long to
figure out that her strategy was a little questionable.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like I was going a little too fast and maybe I couldn't
keep that up,'' she said. ''But I just liked being in front because
it was a lot of fun hearing them call your name. I just decided to
go for it. I really didn't know what to do or how to pace it. I
just wanted to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Rappole of the Western region won the first medal of the
games, capturing the 10,000-meter run for scholastic men.
</P>
<P>
   With a light rain falling, Rappole, the favorite, began to break
away from the pack halfway through the race around the 400-meter
track at Binghamton University. But at his heels were George Weiner
and Ryan Harmon, teammates on the New York City squad.
</P>
<P>
   Running second, Harmon checked his watch with eight laps
remaining, then Rappole checked out, opening an 80-yard lead with
five laps to go and avoiding a late-race duel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then, you're just running scared, hoping nobody catches a
second wind and comes back on you,'' said Rappole, of Bemus Point
on the shore of Lake Chautauqua.
</P>
<P>
   Rappole atoned for a third-place finish in the event a year ago,
even though his time Thursday of 33:56.40 was not as fast.
</P>
<P>
   ''I couldn't see how far behind me they were,'' said Rappole,
who shook his head in dismay when his father told him his time,
about 30 seconds off his personal best. ''You just keep saying to
yourself in your mind that somebody's coming back. I was hoping to
improve (over last year), but it's nice to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiner, of Brooklyn, edged Harmon for the silver.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was moving pretty fast,'' said Harmon, of Valley Stream,
Long Island. ''We knew he was the one. We heard about him before.
We tried to work together to catch him, but he was pretty good.''

<HEADLINE> Elections board OKs five primary opponents for Hillary Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By RIK STEVENS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Over the objections of its two Republican
commissioners, the state Board of Elections Thursday failed to
disqualify petitions that could leave six Democrats on a primary
ballot in the race for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democratic commissioners - Evelyn Aquila and Carol Berman -
abstained from voting on the motion to disqualify, which died for
the lack of a three-vote majority, according to Republican
commissioner Neil Kelleher. Kelleher and fellow Republican Helena
Donohue opposed the petitions by Irving Geld, Jimmy McMillan, Eric
Ruano Melendez and Peter Ruane.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, those four, front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and
New York City doctor Mark McMahon could all be on a Sept. 12
Democratic primary for the right to face Republican Rick Lazio in
the race for the Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said it was a ''cop-out'' for the Democratic
commissioners not to vote on petitions that he said fell far short
of minimum requirements set by state election law. Only McMahon
gathered enough signatures to legally be included on a primary
ballot, Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   A stringent and oft-criticized state election law requires
15,000 signatures statewide of party members with at least 100 of
them coming from each of 16 of the state's 31 congressional
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four other candidates, one had 127 signatures, another
214 and a third about 3,000, Kelleher said. Aaron D. Maslow,
election attorney for McMahon, said one of the candidates had
14,000 signatures written in very similar handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   ''This isn't right,'' Maslow said of the board's maneuver. He
said he has filed papers in Supreme Court in New York City to get
the four candidates thrown off the primary ballot. He expects
arguments to be heard next week.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Daghlian, spokesman for the board of elections, could not be
reached for comment Thursday night. Neither Aquila nor Berman could
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for the Clinton campaign, declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Piling six candidates into one voting booth on Primary Day could
have the affect of taking anti-Clinton Democrats away from McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess that's what (the Clinton camp) is hoping and what
Hillary's people fought for,'' said McMahon spokeswoman Gaye
Carleton. ''I'm guessing it detracts from the challenge she thinks
is in front of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said abstaining from votes is a ''cop-out'' and when he
asked what criteria exist for abstention, he was told ''that's the
way (the board has) always done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher, a former state Assemblyman from Troy, said a
commissioner who wishes to abstain should have to provide a reason,
such as a conflict of interest, as required in the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a flagrant use of abstaining from voting on
Board of Election matters,'' Kelleher said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher said if the board has no guidelines for abstaining, he
will support drafting new regulations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Raises $2M for House Dems  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trading golf jokes with comedian Chevy Chase,
President Clinton raised $2 million Thursday for House Democrats to
stay out of the economic rough.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, who starred in the movie ''Caddyshack,'' told
contributors that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators can't be
blamed for failing to reach a peace accord at Camp David because
the entertainment of golf and movies is too distracting at the
presidential retreat in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too fun. It's not their fault,'' said Chase, who had
stayed at Camp David for Easter.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quipped that Chase's skills on the links are pure
Hollywood magic.
</P>
<P>
   '''Caddyshack' was not only a comedy, it was a fraud,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 people contributed $5,000 to $10,000 each to attend
the event at the Mayflower Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee will divide the money between his
personal campaign fund and the fund that distributes all party
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton thanked contributors for trying to regain control of the
House, which Democrats lost in 1994. If Democrats pick up seven
seats in November, Gephardt could become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are deciding how to use our prosperity,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt said Democrats probably lost the House early in
Clinton's term because of unpopular votes aimed at balancing the
federal budget. But he said losses were worth the result of the
current strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad we took those votes and I'm glad we worked it out,''
he said.

<HEADLINE> Lab Chief, FBI Agent in Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A dispute has arisen between an FBI
agent and a retired Los Alamos National Laboratory security chief
over an allegation that scientist Wen Ho Lee likely aided China's
nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn statement, the FBI's Robert Messemer contends Robert
Vrooman told him in April 1999 ''that in his opinion Lee probably
had assisted the (People's Republic of China) nuclear weapons
program by fixing the Chinese hydrocodes.''
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman denies making that comment. ''Messemer has trouble
accurately reporting what he hears,'' Vrooman told The Associated
Press on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Computer hydrocodes are used to model how materials might behave
during a nuclear explosion, said Steven Aftergood, who directs the
Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American
Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer's statement was filed by the government this month in
federal court in an effort to debunk defense allegations that Lee,
born in Taiwan, was singled out for prosecution because of his
Chinese ancestry. Lee faces trial on 59 counts alleging he
downloaded restricted nuclear weapons codes from secure to unsecure
computers and to computer tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, who retired last August, said he couldn't know what Lee
did during trips overseas in 1986 and 1988 -- ''I was not with him
in China.''
</P>
<P>
   The allegation involving hydrocodes is potentially more serious
than the unsecure transfers Lee now is accused of making, Aftergood
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although this kind of computer code could have nonmilitary
applications, it could also have nuclear weapons applications,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Vrooman, who gave a statement last month supporting a defense
motion seeking government documents on ethnic profiling, said he
thinks Messemer is trying to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   Messemer declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racial profiling was a crucial component in the FBI's
identifying Dr. Lee as a suspect,'' Vrooman said in the June
document. ''Caucasians with the same background and foreign
contacts as Dr. Lee were ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   In its response, the government asked a federal judge to throw
out the racial profiling allegation, contending there were similar
prosecutions of people who were not ethnic Chinese.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Assad Releases Prisoners  </HEADLINE>
By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Syrian President Bashar Assad has ordered
the release of members about 30 members of an opposition group
crushed by his father in a violent confrontation nearly two decades
ago, the movement's leader said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been informed from our sources that some 30 members of
the Brotherhood movement have been released from prison,'' Muslim
Brotherhood leader Ali Sadreddine al-Beyanouni, based in London,
said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the release as a ''positive step'' but called on
Syria to further loosen political restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ''All Syrians in exile should return home without any security
harassment, all past files should be closed and emergency laws
abolished,'' al-Beyanouni said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have asked the new president, who took
office July 17, to release political prisoners or grant them fair
retrials. Al-Beyanouni said there are at least 1,500 political
prisoners in Syria, a number also claimed by Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian Brotherhood, a Sunni Muslim fundamentalist movement,
led a violent campaign against the government of Assad's father,
late President Hafez Assad, in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Assassinations and bomb attacks killed hundreds as the group
attempted to install Islamic rule in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Assad's army crushed an uprising by the Brotherhood in
the city of Hama, killing an estimated 20,000 people and flattening
much of the city over a period of three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, many of the leaders and members of the Muslim
Brotherhood have been either living in exile or in prisons.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox and Rockies Trade Players  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox think they have the pitcher
they need for the pennant race. Better yet, they barely had to dent
their roster to get him.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox completed a seven-player trade with Colorado on
Thursday, receiving pitcher Rolando Arrojo and infielder Mike
Lansing for second baseman Jeff Frye and demoted pitchers Brian
Rose and John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   Boston also acquired pitcher Rick Croushore and an undisclosed
amount of cash. The Rockies also got minor league pitcher Jeff
Taglienti.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought we could add to our ballclub for this season and
not really affect our major league ballclub,'' Red Sox general
manager Dan Duquette said on a conference call before Boston's game
against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced after the Rockies lost to Los Angeles
16-11, their 18th defeat in 22 games. Colorado trails New York by
seven games in the NL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an opportunity for us to continue with our plan. ... We
aren't done yet. We are not raising the white flag,'' Rockies
general manger Dan O'Dowd said. ''A lot has to do with the players
we get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston is in the middle of the chase for the AL East title and
the wild-card slot.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what everybody plays for, a chance to win the
championship,'' said Lansing who is batting .258 with 11 home runs
and 43 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching has been a prime commodity as Monday's trading deadline
approaches, with Curt Schilling, Andy Ashby and Denny Neagle all
recently acquired by contenders. Duquette had said the Red Sox were
looking for a hitter, but the team just lost Pete Schourek, perhaps
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some gaping holes now that Schourek has gone down,''
Red Sox reliever Rod Beck said. ''Arrojo will help fill those
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo, 32, has had trouble adjusting to Coors Field since he
was traded from Tampa Bay to the Rockies last December, going 5-9
with a 6.04 ERA in 19 starts this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to evaluate pitchers in Colorado,'' Duquette said,
adding that Arrojo has a 4.90 ERA on the road this season. ''It's
not unusual for pitchers to have trouble in Colorado.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, Wasdin and Frye are expected to join the Rockies in
Milwaukee this weekend. Taglienti will report to Double-A Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Arrojo is expected to start on Sunday. He and Lansing are
expected to be with the team in time for Friday night's game at
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a very good player, very aggressive. He's a steady
defensive player. He's a streaky batter and if he gets going, can
carry you,'' Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez said of Lansing, a former
teammate in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   About Arrojo, Martinez said: ''I saw him at the All-Star game in
1998. He's Cuban, so that mains he speaks Spanish, so that's good.
And he seems like a good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   To get Arrojo and Lansing, the Red Sox barely had to dent their
major league roster; only Frye was with the Boston club. He was
hitting .289 with one homer and 13 RBIs but had also drawn
management's ire with his criticism, later recanted, over the way
Mike Stanley was released.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no regrets about what I said. Sometimes you just have
to stand up and speak out. Everybody on this team appreciated what
I said about Mike Stanley,'' Frye said. ''I probably burned some
bridges, but life goes on. This is a business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, 24, had been one of Boston's most promising prospects. But
after opening the season on the Red Sox roster he went 3-5 with a
6.11 ERA and was sent back to Triple-A Pawtucket; there, he went
4-1 with a 3.19 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin, 27, was best known as the pitcher Boston acquired from
Oakland in exchange for Jose Canseco. He was 1-0 with a 2.25 ERA in
five games at Pawtucket and 1-3 with a 5.04 ERA in 25 games with
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an opportunity for them to pitch for another
organization. They're both young and they have good arms and they
should have good major league careers,'' Duquette said. ''We
thought we could add to our ballclub for this season and not really
affect our major league ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Croushore, 30 next month, has also been demoted after spending
time in the majors this season. Although he has struggled this
season, he did have more success last year in St. Louis, when he
had a 4.14 ERA out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really like Croushore's arm,'' Duquette said. ''Although he
was in the minors, we think that he'll do much better in Boston
than he did in Colorado. We hope that he returns to the form he
showed in St. Louis.''

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves $198 Loan for Kenya  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recognizing progress by Kenya in battling
corruption, the International Monetary Fund on Thursday resumed
help for the East African nation by approving a $198 million loan.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as Kenya is suffering its worst economic crisis
since independence from Britain in 1963, along with severe drought
and nationwide power and water shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, President Daniel arap Moi made a rare personal
appeal for international help, saying 3 million of Kenya's 22
million people were ''absolutely destitute.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF spokeswoman Lucie Mboto-Fouda said the three-year loan will
be used to support the government's economic programs. The first
installment of $18 million will be available immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF decision will clear the way for other international
lenders such as the World Bank to resume their programs with Kenya
and may spur renewed private investment. Both organizations
suspended loans to Kenya in August 1997, demanding it end
corruption and speed up privatization of state corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the deputy head of the IMF, said Wednesday in
London that Kenya had made sufficient progress in battling
corruption to justify a policy of constructive engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 12 months, Moi has initiated a series of reforms
that included paring down the bloated civil service. Last July, he
appointed renowned paleontologist Richard Leakey, a
third-generation Kenyan, to push through reforms.
</P>
<P>
   A drought in the Horn of Africa is so severe that Kenya will
have to import almost half of its corn over the next 18 months, a
U.N. food agency recently announced.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya will have to import at least 1.4 million tons of corn, its
staple food, the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization said.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Kenya's food is grown during the
March-to-May rainy season. The food agency said most of Kenya
hasn't had rain for months.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Seeks To Sue FAA  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- American Airlines sought court
permission Thursday to sue the Federal Aviation Administration and
the air-traffic controller on duty the night a plane fatally
crash-landed in a thunderstorm at Little Rock National Airport.
</P>
<P>
   American claims the air traffic controller failed to give the
pilots accurate information about the weather, runway condition and
the airplane's approach, contributing to the crash June 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Flight 1420 had been adequately advised ... the flight crew
of Flight 1420 would not have attempted the landing, and the
accident, and the personal injuries to and wrongful death of
passengers ... would not have occurred,'' the Fort Worth,
Texas-based airline said in a federal court filing.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is being sued by many passengers and victims'
relatives who claim American was negligent in landing the McDonnell
Douglas MD-82. The captain and 10 passengers died and scores of
others were injured when the plane ran off the end of the runway,
broke apart and caught fire.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Henry Woods had set an Aug. 1 deadline for
trying to bring other parties into the case. A hearing also is
scheduled for Aug. 1 on unrelated issues.
</P>
<P>
   American attached the proposed lawsuit to its request to be
allowed to file it. The lawsuit names the United States and FAA
air-traffic controller Kenneth Kaylor.
</P>
<P>
   Airline attorney Randal Craft Jr. refused to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks a judgment placing part of the liability for
the crash on the federal government and an order that the
government pay a proportionate share of any judgment that might be
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not unheard of for the FAA to be named in legal
proceedings following a crash,'' said Eliot Brenner, an FAA
spokesman in Washington, ''but I would decline to comment about any
specifics.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaylor could not be reached for comment Thursday. A
directory-information operator said he had an unlisted telephone
number.
</P>
<P>
   A lead attorney for the crash victims said he likely would
oppose efforts to bring the government into the case. The victims
also could have sued the government, but chose not to do so, said
attorney Ted Boswell of Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen no negligence by the air traffic controller,''
Boswell said. ''He can't close a runway, he can't forbid a plane to
land. All he can do is give them the information, and he gave them
solid information that they were going into crosswinds and
thunderstorms.''
</P>
<P>
   Boswell accused American of trying to delay the court
proceedings by seeking to sue the government. The first wrongful
death trial is scheduled for Aug. 14.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Leaves Drug Clinic  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Five months into his year-long suspension
from baseball, Darryl Strawberry has left a drug clinic and is
trying to get back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry wrote a letter to commissioner Bud Selig several
weeks ago asking for reinstatement, a high-ranking baseball
official said Thursday on the condition he not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees outfielder, serving his third drug-related
suspension, asked for an early end to his one-year ban, currently
scheduled to run through February.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball official confirmed that the eight-time All-Star
left a clinic where he was being treated for his cocaine problem,
and returned to his home in a gated community outside Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry told the New York Daily News that he left the
Sobrenity, Inc., clinic in Fort Lauderdale after 3&AMP;frac12; months because
he needs to support his wife and children and explore returning to
work in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's agent, Eric Grossman, did not immediately return
telephone messages from The Associated Press. However, officials of
the St. Paul, Minn., Saints minor league club confirmed there have
been discussions about hiring the 38-year-old slugger.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are the independent minor league team Strawberry
played for in 1996 when no big league club was interested in him.
General manager Bill Fanning said the club was talking to
Strawberry about an arrangement but nothing had been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Marvin Goldklang emphasized that Strawberry would not join
the Saints as a player. The minor league team also doesn't want to
give the impression it is trying to enhance his chances of
returning to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever we may do for Darryl Strawberry will have nothing to
do with whether he plays another baseball game,'' Goldklang said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm assuming (he wants to return to baseball). Darryl hasn't
said that to me,'' the owner added. ''At this point in his life,
that's the thing he does best and wants to do. I'm assuming given
the opportunity he'd like to play again. That has nothing to do
with our relationship with Darryl.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldklang, also a Yankees limited partner, said an arrangement
might be made within a week or so, although it appears the closest
fans might come to seeing Strawberry play in St. Paul would be some
rounds of batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already have spoken to a physician and a counselor who are
familiar with Darryl's situation. It has been suggested to us that
that would be a positive element for Darryl because that would help
keep him in an environment where he does feel comfortable. That's a
distinct possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported that baseball has ''serious questions''
concerning Strawberry's fitness to resume his career.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, Strawberry was suspended by Selig after his third
violation of baseball's drug policy. The suspension came after
Strawberry had tested positive for cocaine during a routine check.
</P>
<P>
   After playing briefly with the Saints, Strawberry's contract was
purchased by the Yankees in July 1996. Two years later, the
outfielder was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While still undergoing chemotherapy, Strawberry returned to
baseball in March 1999. A month later, he was charged with
possessing cocaine and soliciting a prostitute. Pleading no
contest, Strawberry was sentenced to 18 months' probation and 100
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the Yankees on Sept. 1, 1999, and finished the
season with a .327 batting average, three homers and six RBIs. In
the postseason, he hit .333 (5-for-15) with two homers and four
RBIs as the Yankees won their second straight World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Goldklang said the Saints' interest in helping the slugger get
back on his feet is personal, not a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there may be some skeptics out there who question why
we would do this for Darryl Strawberry,'' he said. ''I'm not
claiming that we never do things in our economic interest or
selfish interest. ... I think we are just motivated by caring for
another human being. He's been good to us in the past and we
remember our friends.''

<HEADLINE> Researchers Make Microscopic Parts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Carbon nanotubes, a kind of carbon that makes
tubes just one-10,000th the width of a human hair, can be turned
into microscopic bearings or springs for tiny machines, researchers
report.
</P>
<P>
   In a study appearing the journal Science, researchers at the
University of California, Berkeley, said they created the
microscopic bearings by clipping the end of a telescoping pair of
nanotubes. This allowed the inner tube to spin freely inside the
outer tube.
</P>
<P>
   When the inner tube slides in and out of the outer tube, the
researchers said, the telescoping tubes act like a spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''These nanoscale bearings just slide as if there's no
friction,'' said John Cumings, a co-author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotube got its name because it is so small it is measured on a
scale of nanometers. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotubes are hollow cages of carbon atoms similar to carbon-60,
a molecule of carbon atoms that resembles a soccer ball. Nanotubes
are elongated carbon-60 balls that form inside of each other.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments with the carbon material, at Berkeley and elsewhere,
suggest that eventually nanotubes and related forms of carbon might
be used in electronic machines, such as computers, whose components
would be so small they would be measured on a nanometer scale.
</P>
<P>
   To manipulate the nanotubes, the researchers used a scanning
tunneling microscope to move atoms of carbon while being guided by
an electron microscope, a device that can image objects only a few
nanometers in size.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Generals Face Accusations  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's attorney general on Thursday
accused four army generals and a colonel of allowing the massacre
of 18 civilians by a rightist paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, the second this week implicating senior
officers in a massacre, follows the approval in Washington this
month of a $1.3 billion anti-narcotics aid package for Colombia
despite concerns about the army's ties to deadly paramilitary
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The army angrily denounced the investigations, saying they were
sapping military morale.
</P>
<P>
   According to Attorney General Jaime Bernal, the five officers
took no actions to prevent a May 1997 massacre of unarmed villagers
in the southern town of Puerto Alvira. Their troops stood by idly,
he added, despite warnings from local officials that the rightist
militiamen were going to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the officers -- Maj. General Jaime Cortes, Brig. Gen.
Freddy Padilla, and a lieutenant colonel -- are on active-duty and
could be suspended or court-martialed should an expected appeal be
rejected. The other two, Brig. Gen. Jaime Uscategui and Maj. Gen.
Agustin Ardila, are retired but could prohibited holding public
office.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, the attorney general can dismiss public officials,
but has no role in criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Puerto Alvira killings, right-wing militias
were moving into territory previously dominated by rival leftist
guerrillas. Their ''scorched-earth'' strategy involved dragging
suspected rebel sympathizers from their homes and executing them in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the charges Thursday, army chief Gen. Jorge Mora
claimed that no troops were stationed closer than 60 miles to
Puerto Alvira at the time of the massacre, in which the militia
burned and mutilated many of the corpses. He also said two of the
accused generals were not even in command of troops in the region
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneous threats from guerrillas, drug traffickers and
paramilitary groups stretch the military thin, Mora added, making
it ''impossible to be in every place in the country where terrorist
acts and massacres take place.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Bernal announced he was investigating four army
officers and a police colonel for similarly failing to prevent an
August 1999 paramilitary massacre of 27 villagers near Colombia's
border with Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Miller Skips Gymnastics Events  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- This might be the shortest meet of Shannon
Miller's career.
</P>
<P>
   Still nursing a hairline crack in her right leg, Miller skipped
the balance beam, floor exercise and vault, her first three events
Thursday night at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships.
</P>
<P>
   But she took a ''0.00'' in all three, allowing her to move on to
her last event, the uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
   It was a bizarre sight as an unhappy-looking Miller stepped up
to the balance beam, saluted the judges, stepped on the
springboard, touched the beam and then saluted the judges again,
signaling the end of her routine. When her score flashed, there
were three, bright red zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a similar scene at the floor and vault, with Miller
acknowledging the judges, touching the floor and vault and then
quickly leaving the competition podium.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's coach, Steve Nunno, said before the meet that Miller
would warm up on each apparatus and see if she could compete. If
she could, she'd go. If she couldn't, she'd touch the apparatus and
move on.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, competing on the uneven bars would be the easiest on
Miller's leg, which she injured July 6. There's very little
pounding her legs would have to absorb, unlike the other three
events.
</P>
<P>
   Skipping her first three events means Miller will likely have to
withdraw, skip Saturday's all-around finals and petition for a spot
at the Olympic trials. The top 12 gymnasts from nationals advance
to next month's trials, and Miller wouldn't make it if she's got a
bunch of zeroes for her score.
</P>
<P>
   She could simply have withdrawn without doing any events. But if
she competes on bars and happens to win, she'd make a strong case
for being put on the Olympic team as an event specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes will be ranked based on their combined scores from
nationals (40 percent) and trials (60 percent), but a selection
committee headed by Bela Karolyi will pick the six-person team.
Three or four all-arounders will be chosen, and the remaining will
be specialists who can help bolster the team's weak spots.
</P>
<P>
   According to USA Gymnastics' petition process, athletes can
petition for a spot at trials due to ''Extraordinary and Unforeseen
Circumstances.'' For her petition to be granted, Miller would have
to prove she's got an ''injury, illness or other unforeseen
circumstance'' that keeps her from competing.
</P>
<P>
   She'd also have to submit her petition ''as soon as practical''
after realizing she couldn't compete. Though she's had the stress
fracture for almost three weeks and has had to curtail her training
because of it, Miller could make the case that she thought she'd be
able to compete this week and didn't know until the last second
that she couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting out either trials or nationals is becoming somewhat of a
tradition for Miller. In 1992, still recovering from elbow surgery,
she withdrew after the compulsories because she hadn't had enough
time to train. She competed at the trials and went on to win five
medals in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   She skipped the Olympic trials in 1996 because of an ongoing
problem with her left wrist. She won two gold medals at the Atlanta
Games, including an individual gold on the balance beam.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign won the
endorsement of two gay advocacy organizations Thursday, the Empire

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays' Mondesi Put on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Outfielder Raul Mondesi has ligament damage in
his right elbow and was put on the 15-day disabled list Thursday by
the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi was examined Thursday in Los Angeles by Dr. Frank Jobe,
who said more testing is needed to determine the extent of damage.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's right fielder had missed the previous four games, and
the injury is believed to have been sustained from throwing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll probably know more tomorrow,'' Blue Jays manager Jim
Fregosi said before Toronto played Seattle. ''When you lose a key
player for any extent of time, it's a blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, 29, has been one of the Blue Jays most effective
players season. He is hitting .272 with 24 homers, 67 RBIs and a
team-leading 22 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ''You just can't throw in the towel,'' Blue Jays general manager
Gord Ash said. ''Other teams have had injuries, too.''

<HEADLINE> Daschle Urges Gore On VP Choice  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore intends to select a running mate who
is ready to serve ''from day one,'' a campaign spokesman said
Thursday, despite prodding from the leader of Senate Democrats to
avoid a pick that would erode the party's chances of capturing the
Senate this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The polite brushoff, from spokesman Chris Lehane, came after
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said he hoped Gore would
consider the impact of his choice on the congressional elections.
Selection of a Democratic senator from a state with a Republican
governor -- a description that fits many of the contenders on Gore's
list -- would give the GOP a chance to add to their majority.
</P>
<P>
   Among the men mentioned most prominently as potential runing
mates, Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Bob Graham of Florida,
Dick Durbin of Illinois and Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut are all
from states with Republican governors. Should one of them win
election as vice president, the governor would be able to appoint a
Senate successor.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin represents a state with a Democratic
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin's name surfaced recently as a running mate prospect. The
Iowa Democrat also has been tapped for surrogate campaign duties
for Gore, including in Philadelphia during the GOP convention next
week.
</P>
<P>
   The swearing-in this week of Sen. Zell Miller of Georgia -- named
to replace the late Paul Coverdell, a Republican -- reduced the GOP
majority to 54-46 and prompted party leaders to declare they have a
chance to win control in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very optimistic about our prospects of taking back the
Senate,'' Daschle said. ''I said that I hope as they consider all
of the factors, that one of the factors is whether or not we'll
have a Democratic senator filling the shoes of whomever they may
take from the Senate, if they choose to take a senator from my
caucus.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle emphasized that he told the Gore campaign he would be
''enthusiastically supportive'' of Gore's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said Gore very much wants a Democratic Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vice president has made it clear that he's going to work
in this cycle to elect Democrats at every level -- presidential,
Senate, House and local level,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said Gore's campaign was not ''getting into
the game of saying what criteria we're going to use to make this
decision. The vice president will make the decision based on who
can assume duties from day one, someone who will work as a partner
with him and somebody who will join with Al Gore to fight for the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Gov. Gray Davis used a meeting with reporters to
take his denials of interest in the job one step further, saying he
hoped he would not be asked to join Gore's ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've said that six different ways, and it's always been my
hope, and so far my goals have ben realized, that I would not be
asked by the vice president to change my mind,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite taking unexpected possession of the Georgia seat,
Democrats still face an uphill battle to regain the Senate. Four
Democratic senators are retiring -- Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey, Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and
Richard Bryan of Nevada -- while Connie Mack of Florida is the only
Republican stepping down.

<HEADLINE> GOP Drops Tax, Spending Plan Push  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Short of time and votes, Republicans dropped
plans to push a modest tax-cut and spending package through
Congress before lawmakers began their monthlong break for the party
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans had hoped to muscle a House-Senate compromise bill
through the House on Thursday, repealing the century-old federal
tax on telephone calls and financing several small agencies. The
bill took its final shape during all-night, closed-door meetings in
which several sweeping but controversial provisions were weeded
out.
</P>
<P>
   But after the bill survived a procedural vote by just 214-210 --
and with lawmakers clamoring to begin their August recess -- GOP
leaders decided to postpone further action until September.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a gut check vote,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford, R-S.C., a
conservative who opposed some of the measure's spending increases.
He said he came to Congress in part to stop ''these midnight
deals'' that he said Democrats had long used when they were in the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic delays in the Senate already had forced Majority
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to concede that his chamber would not
consider the bill until after Congress' break.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Republican plans to push the measure through
Congress only added to the mammoth workload lawmakers will face
when they return in September. At that point, they will be rushing
to adjourn by early October so they can return home for re-election
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one of the 13 annual spending measures for fiscal
2001, which begins Oct. 1, has become law. The Senate voted 90-10
Thursday to give final congressional approval to a second spending
bill, a $288 billion Pentagon measure that is nearly $20 billion
above this year's level.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 remaining spending bills, eight face Clinton
administration veto threats. Republicans worry that President
Clinton will have added leverage to press his spending demands as
Congress' session nears its end.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't want us to pass these bills because they want to
force us into some sort of summit with a big omnibus bill so they
can get more spending,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas,
said of Democrats. ''Well, we ain't going there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., boasted of GOP
accomplishments that included House passage of initial versions of
12 of the 13 spending bills, such as several tax cuts, financial
services modernization, keeping the budget balanced, and repealing
the earnings limit for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a great record to leave town on,'' Hastert told
reporters as Republicans began heading to Philadelphia for their
presidential nominating convention. ''We've changed how America
works.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill GOP leaders wanted to push through the House contained
$30.3 billion for the Treasury Department and several smaller
agencies next year and $2.5 billion for Congress' own operations.
Republicans had added $1.2 billion to the House version of the
Treasury measure in hopes of winning Democratic and White House
support.
</P>
<P>
   It also would have eliminated the 3 percent federal excise tax
on telephone service beginning Oct. 1, a widely supported measure
that would have cost the Treasury $55 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dropped were provisions boosting the minimum wage, which
conservatives disliked, and cutting taxes for some small
businesses, which Democrats opposed. Even so, there still was broad
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained that the remaining package was still about
$300 million short of the $8.9 billion Clinton wants for the
Internal Revenue Service and cut some of his other proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also dropped curbs on federal agencies that might give
preferences to buying Smith &AMP; Wesson guns, following the
arms-maker's agreement to start using trigger locks and other
safety devices and practices. Many Democrats were reluctant to deny
the Senate an election-season debate on those curbs, which are in
the Senate version of the bill that has yet to be considered by
that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers also were unhappy that leaders eliminated
provisions that would have eased restrictions on travel with Cuba
and U.S. sales of food and drugs there.
</P>
<P>
   There also was unease among some members over a congressional
pay raise that was included in the bill, a 2.7 percent increase to
$145,100 next year.

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced for Lying to Jury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man was sentenced Thursday to nearly six years
in prison for lying to a grand jury that was investigating the
World Trade Center bombing and related terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa Elnore, 40, of Linden, N.J., had pleaded guilty to lying
to a grand jury in 1997 and 1998 that was investigating the 1993
World Trade Center bombing that killed six people and injured more
than 1,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had the opportunity to be in front of the grand jury, I
would not make the same mistake,'' he said in court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Elnore also admitted lying when he said he had never heard of
Wadih El Hage, who is among the defendants charged with conspiring
to bomb two U.S. embassies in Africa in August 1998. The bombings
killed 224 people, including a dozen Americans, and injured more
than 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after the sentencing, U.S. Attorney Mary
Jo White said the case demonstrated that ''we will not allow
perjury or obstruction of justice to stand in the way of pursuing
justice for the victims of terrorism.''

<HEADLINE> Curry Leads John Deere Classic  </HEADLINE>
By JAY HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVIS, Ill. (AP) -- Englishman Paul Curry is brand new on the
PGA Tour, and so is the golf course he humbled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Curry shot an 8-under-par 63 in the first round of the John
Deere Classic, good enough for a two-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   He had a bogey-free round at the Tournament Players Club at
Deere Run, which opened last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just one of those days when the putts go in,'' Curry
said. ''When you have days like this, you wonder why you don't do
it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry, who is from Essex, played on the European tour until
1997, when he had to take six months off due to a back injury.
Since then, he has been on the Nike tour.
</P>
<P>
   Six players were tied for second. Two of them, Tim Herron and
David Frost, were 7-under going to their final holes, but bogeyed.
</P>
<P>
   Former PGA and Bristish Open champion John Daly was five shots
back.
</P>
<P>
   Frost's 3-iron approach shot on the 18th drifted left and into
the edge of a pond guarding that side of the green. Herron landed
in a sand trap to the right of the No. 9 green, then chipped to
within 2 feet of the hole but missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of doesn't taste too well 10 minutes after the
round,'' Herron said. ''But I know I'm right there in the
tournament, and I have a chance to post a good score in the
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the day's highlights was a double eagle on the par-5 2nd
hole by Frank Lickliter, among those tied for second. His drive
landed 257 yards from the green, and he hit a 3-wood that landed in
front of the green and rolled into the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went in just like a putt,'' Lickliter said.
</P>
<P>
   Others tied for second were Jeff Gove, Bob Gilder and Andy Bean.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament's former home was the Oakwood Country Club in
Coal Valley. In years past, the tournament has been called the
Miller Classic, Quad Cities Open, Hardee's Classic and Quad Cities
Classic. This is the second year it has been sponsored by
Moline-based John Deere &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Deere Run was built as to host the Deere Classic. Players said
some of the greens played soft, but praised the course overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''This year it's playing pretty well,'' said Joe Ogilvie, one of
five players who carded 66s. ''Next year and the year after, this
field is going to grow and grow because this is that good a
course,''
</P>
<P>
   Gove, a tour rookie, said the new course deprives more
experienced players of a perk they often enjoy through having
played tour courses many times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this week the veterans don't have an advantage because
it's a new course,'' he said. ''This could be a good week for
rookies.''
</P>
<P>
   The first round certainly was for one of them.

   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- The New York Islanders have signed three
more free agents -- centers Jesse Belanger and Robert Petrovicky,
and left wing Jeff Toms.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deals were not released.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger, 31, had three goals and six assists in 16 games for
the Canadiens last season. Belanger has also played for Florida,

<P>
   Toms, 26, had one goal and three assists in 20 games for the

</P>
<P>
   ''These are three skilled forwards that have excelled at the
minor league level and have been effective when called up to the

<HEADLINE> Cheney Defends His Record  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Dick Cheney on Thursday explained his votes
against the Equal Rights Amendment, a ban on cop-killer bullets and
sanctions on South Africa and GOP nominee George W. Bush assailed
Democrats for their criticism of his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Secretary Cheney brought people together and helped win a war,
which stands in stark contrast to Vice President Al Gore, who tends
to divide people to create war,'' Bush told reporters as he took a
break from practicing for his GOP acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's defense came after Cheney, the GOP vice presidential
choice, was peppered by questions on his votes as a Wyoming
congressman as he made the rounds of network news shows.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney called criticism ''typical distortion'' by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, I came from a conservative state and did, in fact,
vote that way. But I don't have any apologies to make for that,''
Cheney told CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was defense secretary in the administration of Bush's
father and a key strategist in the 1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pursued their effort to portray Bush's running mate of
two days as far right -- clearly trying to seize the initiative in
identifying him to the public before Republicans can at the GOP
convention that starts Monday in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheney is a card-carrying member of the 'old guard,''' said
Mark Fabiani, a deputy campaign manager for Democratic presidential
candidate Al Gore. ''Some of his past votes are hard to explain
away in any era.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, countering, noted that Gore had also staked out
many conservative positions as a lawmaker from Tennessee --
including opposing gun control legislation and publicly funded
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush asserted: ''Secretary Cheney is well defined in the
eyes of the American people. ... My opponent is somebody who's
tearing down and dividing people to create political war and that
stands in stark contrast in the minds of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not surprised'' with the Democratic onslaught, Bush said.
Then, to some listeners, he appeared to say: ''It's their constant
lying. 'Vote for me I'm going to tear down the other person.'''
However, Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer later insisted that
Bush's Texas accent caused confusion, and what the candidate really
said was ''constant line.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney represented Wyoming for 10 years between jobs as
President Ford's chief of staff and President Bush's defense
secretary. He has said that many of his votes were cast in a
''different era'' marked by the Cold War and huge budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new attacks, Cheney was generally known in
Washington less for his political leanings and more for his
soft-spoken managerial style and ability to get along with both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney remained in Dallas on Thursday, tying up loose ends in
connection with his plans to resign next month as chief executive
officer of Halliburton, an oil-services conglomerate
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a down day in Austin, practicing his acceptance speech.
''It's a little longer than most of my speeches, probably I would
say 30 minutes,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the speech would set ''a tone that's positive,
uplifting, a tone that recognizes a leader, not somebody who tears
people down.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Thought I'd start off with 'I accept your nomination.' That
seemed risky, but it seems always to get applause,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Cheney were to hit the campaign trail on Friday for a
campaign swing that will begin in Arkansas, President Clinton's
home state, and continue through most of the battleground states of
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans asserted that Cheney's conservative voting record
was well known and expressed astonishment anyone would be surprised
by it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes noted that Gore himself
had voted in 1989 to confirm Cheney as defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans issued a set of ''talking points'' noting that
Gore and Cheney had similar voting records on opposition to
federally finance abortions and in opposing various gun limits.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's record was raised repeatedly in a series of television
appearances on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Of his 1988 votes against banning plastic guns and
armor-piercing ''cop-killer'' bullets, Cheney told ABC: ''I was a
great believer and am a great believer today in the Second
Amendment, the right of the citizens to keep and bear arms.''
</P>
<P>
   He told NBC his vote not to impose economic sanctions against
the segregationist government of South Africa did not mean he
opposed freedom for the jailed Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   In several interviews, he noted that he was widely supported by
colleagues for his No. 2 GOP leadership slot and likely would have
become House speaker had he stayed in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''So whatever the Democrats want to say about me now, the fact
of the matter was many Democrats, as well as all of the
Republicans, thought I was a reasonably respectable fellow in the
1980's,'' he told ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Among other votes, Cheney:
</P>
<P>
   -- Was one of just 21 lawmakers in 1985 to vote against a ban on
armor piercing bullets called ''cop killers.'' In 1988, he was only
one of four lawmakers to vote against banning plastic guns that
might be smuggled past metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   -- Was one of only eight lawmakers to oppose passage of the Clean
Water Act in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   -- Voted against Head Start funds and pro-environment measures.
</P>
<P>
   -- Voted against abortion rights 26 times while in Congress, in
many cases supporting measures that prohibited women from abortions
even in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment, according to
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bush opposes abortion rights except in cases of
rape or incest or when a woman's life is endangered.

<HEADLINE> Jury Declines To Indict N.Y.C. Cop  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A grand jury declined to indict an undercover
narcotics officer Thursday in the March slaying of an unarmed black
man that aggravated tensions between minorities and New York
police.
</P>
<P>
   The decision cleared Detective Anthony Vasquez of any criminal
wrongdoing for firing a fatal shot into Patrick Dorismond's chest.
</P>
<P>
   The undercover officer had approached Dorismond, a 26-year-old
security guard, near Madison Square Garden and asked where he could
purchase marijuana. The exchange led to a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ''What the grand jury found is that on the basis of the
evidence, nobody could be charged with a crime,'' Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's parents and sister, joined by the Rev. Al Sharpton
at an emotional news conference, called on the Justice Department
to take over the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's mother wept and denounced Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
who like Morgenthau offered condolences to the family, but defended
the grand jury decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Mayor ... you just took everything from my son,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said her office
routinely reviews such cases, and would look at Dorismond's death
''to determine whether there were any violations of the federal
criminal civil rights laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was killed just three weeks after the acquittal of
four officers in the Bronx slaying of Amadou Diallo, another
unarmed black man.
</P>
<P>
   The case took on added significance when Giuliani, then still
running for Senate, set off a furor by publicly releasing
Dorismond's sealed juvenile criminal record. The mayor also
publicized a toxicology report showing Dorismond had marijuana in
his system when he died.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's decision to go public with the records infuriated the
dead man's family, black activists and the city's Haitian
community. Dorismond was of Haitian descent.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions ran so high that Dorismond's funeral broke into a
free-for-all, with 27 people arrested and 23 officers injured. The
Dorismond family also has filed a $100 million civil claim against
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said after the grand jury decision that he wanted to
''extend my sympathy and my prayers to the people most affected by
this: the Dorismond family, who will have a very hard time
accepting this.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Vasquez and his partner, the incident began when
Dorismond, who was with a friend, Kevin Kaiser, threw a punch at
the second officer during their confrontation outside a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Vasquez said that as he came to his partner's aid, he heard one
of the two men scuffling with the officer saying, ''Get his gun!''
Vasquez claimed that he shouted ''Police! Police!'' before pulling
his weapon.
</P>
<P>
   When Dorismond grabbed at the gun, it went off and struck him in
the chest with a single bullet, the officer claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, 22, insisted that the officers threw the first punch and
Dorismond was only defending himself. Kaiser also alleged that
neither officer identified himself as police.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau, questioned about whether the black victim of a
police shooting could receive justice from a grand jury, said the
panel was ''racially mixed ... took its duties seriously and
reached a fair result.''

<HEADLINE> Army Generals Said Allowed Massacre  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's attorney general on Thursday
accused four army generals and a colonel of allowing the massacre
of 18 civilians by a rightist paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, the second this week implicating senior
officers in a massacre, follows the approval in Washington this
month of a $1.3 billion anti-narcotics aid package for Colombia
despite concerns about the army's ties to deadly paramilitary
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The army angrily denounced the investigations, saying they were
sapping military morale.
</P>
<P>
   According to Attorney General Jaime Bernal, the five officers
took no actions to prevent a May 1997 massacre of unarmed villagers
in the southern town of Puerto Alvira. Their troops stood by idly,
he added, despite warnings from local officials that the rightist
militiamen were going to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the officers -- Maj. General Jaime Cortes, Brig. Gen.
Freddy Padilla, and a lieutenant colonel -- are on active-duty and
could be suspended or court-martialed should an expected appeal be
rejected. The other two, Brig. Gen. Jaime Uscategui and Maj. Gen.
Agustin Ardila, are retired but could prohibited holding public
office.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, the attorney general can dismiss public officials,
but has no role in criminal prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Puerto Alvira killings, right-wing militias
were moving into territory previously dominated by rival leftist
guerrillas. Their ''scorched-earth'' strategy involved dragging
suspected rebel sympathizers from their homes and executing them in
public.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the charges Thursday, army chief Gen. Jorge Mora
claimed that no troops were stationed closer than 60 miles to
Puerto Alvira at the time, and two of the accused generals were not
even in command of troops in the same region.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is the second Bernal has launched this week.
On Tuesday, he said he was investigating four army officers and a
police colonel for failing to prevent an August 1999 paramilitary
massacre of 27 villagers near Colombia's border with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the head of the Colombian senate's commission on
human rights met with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to draw
attention to the kidnappings and massacres of civilians by
right-wing paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   After his meeting with Sen. Piedad Cordoba, who was herself
abducted by rightists last year, Annan called on all sides in the
conflict to reach a comprehensive human rights and humanitarian
agreement, according to a statement from Annan's spokesman Fred
Eckhard.

<HEADLINE> Brit Cyber-Snooping Bill Made a Law  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Legislation allowing the British government to
track e-mails and seize encrypted Internet communications has
passed its final hurdle in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The law, hailed by the government as a bulwark against organized
crime but condemned by civil libertarians as the harbinger of an
Orwellian state, was approved by the House of Commons on Wednesday
evening. After the formality of a royal signature, it will become
law on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The measure enables law-enforcement authorities to demand
records of Internet traffic and view the content of encrypted
messages. Once the law takes effect in October, the snooping will
be overseen from a multimillion-dollar spy center reported to be
located within the headquarters of MI5, Britain's domestic
espionage agency.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers will be required to set up secure
channels to the center -- innocuously named the Government Technical
Assistance Center -- so they can transmit information about Internet
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The government says the law is needed to fight technology-savvy
criminals and crack down on cybercrime.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in the House of Commons agreed without a vote to adopt
amendments to the bill proposed by the House of Lords, the upper
chamber of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments sought to allay the fears of Internet service
providers about the cost of complying with the new rules, and calm
businesses and financial institutions who worried that being forced
to hand over the keys to encrypted material could compromise
Internet security.
</P>
<P>
   Encryption is commonly used by business and in e-commerce
transactions to protect credit card numbers and other sensitive
information.
</P>
<P>
   Under the amendments, individuals will not be required to prove
they do not hold the keys to encrypted material -- a provision that
was criticized by rights groups as a reversal of the burden of
proof.
</P>
<P>
   And Clarke said law enforcers who ask to see records of Internet
traffic will not be able to read the content of the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Web page logs -- lists of Internet sites browsed -- also may not
be obtained without a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke said the government would contribute $30 million to
service providers to cover the cost of installing the ''black box''
links to the spy center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that the worry that the bill will cause financial
crises for particular companies is unfounded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fears of civil libertarians may prove harder to calm.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Party lawmaker Harry Cohen worried that information
obtained by one agency could be passed on to others, and said the
system -- overseen by a single interception commissioner -- was open
to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that the provisions dealing with communications data
are born of complacency, are unsatisfactory, and have little regard
for the protection of privacy and commercial confidences,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Israeli Leader To Get Pacemaker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Weeks after his resigning the Israeli
presidency because of a financial scandal, Ezer Weizman will have a
pacemaker implanted in his heart, Israel radio reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's aide Aryeh Shumer said the former president had been
through ''quite a lot recently,'' noting the 76-year-old former
president's ill health in recent years, according to the report.
The operation is to take place at a Haifa hospital on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman was forced to end his seven-year term on July 10
following revelations that he failed to report hundreds of
thousands of dollars in cash gifts from a French millionaire friend
while he was a legislator and Cabinet minister in the late 1980s
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Police recommended not pursuing charges, partly because the
statute of limitations had run out on some of the alleged
infractions, which included fraud and breach of the public trust.
Still, the police report prompted Weizman to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Members of parliament are to vote on Israel's next president on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut firm links with Mohicans to study New York casino  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A Connecticut gaming company has teamed up
with a Wisconsin Indian tribe to study the possibility of a casino
in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Trading Cove Associates confirmed they have been
talking with the Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Mohicans Tribal Council
about a gaming center in the Catskills. The tribe joins other
Indian groups interested in developing the former resort area that
analysts say would tantalize New York City-area gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   Len Wolman, a managing partner in Trading Cove, said Thursday
the development company is constantly looking for new business
opportunities, including gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the Connecticut Mohegans met with Catskill
Development Corp., which hopes to attract the attention of a New
York tribe interested in opening a casino at the old Monticello
Raceway, about 75 miles north of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Stockbridge-Munsee band is a federally recognized
1,500-member Wisconsin tribe that runs a small casino in Bowler,
Wis. The band migrated from the upper Hudson Valley about 150 years
ago. Today, the tribe owns land in Leeds and has a 24,000-acre land
claim in Madison and Oneida counties.
</P>
<P>
   Several tribes, including the Oneida, Cayuga and St. Regis
Mohawk are said to be in negotiations to open gaming centers in New
York. Park Place Entertainment, the world's largest gaming company,
has an agreement with the St. Regis Mohawks to open a casino in the
Catskills. The Oneidas already operated Turning Stone in Verona.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Cove helped Connecticut's Mohegans build their
successful Mohegan Sun casino in 1996 and until January was a
partner in the casino operation, which had gross revenues of almost
$700 million last year. The Connecticut Mohegans bought out the
management contract.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chicks, chairman of the Stockbridge-Munsees, said tribal
members are interested in returning to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we feel good about (Trading Cove), and we're generally
impressed by what they've done with Mohegan Sun casino,'' Chicks
said. ''Now we're trying to ... figure out if they're a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had a long-standing interest in our tribe in
establishing our presence in New York,'' he said. ''We feel very
strongly about our cultural and historical ties to New York.''

FTC Backs Internet Privacy Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to ease public concerns about online privacy, the
government today approved a plan drafted by Internet advertisers to regulate the
gathering of information used to profile Web customers. The Federal Trade
Commission voted 4-1 to endorse a self-regulatory plan submitted by the Network
Advertising Initiative, a consortium of major Internet advertising companies.
Privacy advocates objected, calling it ''written by industry for industry'' and
saying it fails to adequately address the issue. The plan takes effect
immediately but still contains vague language with few details.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- More than 10,000 opponents of President Alberto Fujimori
on Thursday staged one of the biggest protests yet against his decade in power,
rallying on the eve of his inauguration for an unprecedented third term after a
tainted re-election. The peaceful overnight outpouring against Fujimori's
inauguration united workers, students, and Peruvians from all walks in a
raucous, torchlit rally, marked by bottle rockets screaming over a downtown

Montana Fire Grows; Some Evacuated

<P>
   HELENA, Mont. -- Two wildfires east of Montana's capital city swelled to some
24,000 acres today as investigators confirmed one of them was started by
discarded charcoal briquettes from a home barbecue. The fires have driven more
than 300 families from their homes and destroyed 36 buildings, including nine
houses and 27 outbuildings, fire information officer Kimberly Landl said. In
Colorado, officials prepared to protect historical treasures in the aftermath of
a 23,000-acre fire at Mesa Verde National Park. Nearly 830 firefighters doused
smoldering flames in the charred landscape today after deeming safe the historic
cliff dwellings in the nation's largest archaeological preserve.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House capped a summer of tax-cutting by voting today
to rescind a 1993 tax increase that now applies to 9 million Social Security
beneficiaries. The Republican-backed legislation, approved 265-159, reduces
taxes on Social Security for individuals with incomes above $34,000 and married
couples above $44,000. The tax would fall from 85 percent of benefits to the
pre-1993 level of 50 percent.

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Cliff Floyd homered off Greg Maddux in a
three-run sixth inning to start Florida's comeback, and Mike Lowell
hit a grand slam Thursday night as the Marlins beat the Atlanta
Braves 12-4.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Smith (1-3), a 30-year-old rookie, got his first major
league win, helping Florida stop a five-game losing streak. He gave
up two runs and six hits in five innings, walked four and struck
out two.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (12-5) allowed only one runner past first base in the
first five innings and led 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which outhit the Braves 15-8, tied in in the sixth on
Floyd's one-out homer, the 15th off off Maddux this season, and
consecutive two-out singles by Lowell, Derrek Lee and Alex
Gonzalez, the latter a one-hopper over third baseman Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Castro's bloop single to right scored Lee for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux gave up three more runs in the seventh. Preston Wilson
hit an RBI single and Reggie Sanders dropped Lee's fly to right for
a three-base error as two runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, 9-4 against the Marlins, lost his second straight start,
giving up six runs -- four earned -- and 10 hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta closed to 6-4 in the bottom of the seventh when Paul
Bako, released by Florida on July 21, hit his first homer since
July 23, 1999, and Andruw Jones had an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Marquis forced in a run by walking Wilson with the bases
loaded in the eighth and Lowell, who went 3-for-4, followed with
his second career slam for an 11-4 lead. Mark Kotsay added an RBI
double in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta built its early lead on Bobby Bonilla's RBI single in
the first and Rafael Furcal's run-scoring triple in the fifth,
which drove in Maddux, who had singled.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Gonzalez left after six innings with a sprained left knee.
He is to be examined Friday by a team orthopedist. ... Atlanta CF
Andruw Jones saved when he charged in and made a diving catch to
rob Floyd of a bloop single in the seventh. ... . Bako got his
first hit as a Brave by doubling in the fifth, but he was thrown
out at the plate by Wilson trying to score on Maddux's single to
center.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Buffalo Bills quarterback Doug Flutie will be out
until at least
September after suffering a severe groin injury when he slipped in
practice Thursday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''He's going to be out quite a while, probably into the regular
season,'' coach Wade Phillips said after learning the result of an
MRI. ''We don't know the timetable yet, but it's a severe injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie's injury, sustained at the Bills' training camp in
Pittsford, N.Y., didn't initially appear serious.
</P>
<P>
   ''His foot slipped a little bit.'' Phillips said. ''It didn't
grab. Just typical of what happens when you strain a groin.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred when Flutie, taking a snap from center,
appeared ready to run the ball up the middle, but the turf gave out
under his right leg. Flutie went down face-first and grimaced in
pain while holding his leg.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could be a lot worse,'' Flutie said. ''Of course it
could've been a couple of days, too. But I'm not missing hopefully
too much of the season. Just take it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Flutie's injury came the day that starting quarterback Rob
Johnson made his first appearance at practice since Monday. A
stomach virus forced him to miss three straight practices.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not participate in Thursday morning's practice,
instead watching from the sidelines. He was expected to be ready,
Phillips said.
Rams:
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Warner got the longterm deal he was looking for, signing a
seven-year, $47 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL MVP received $17.5 million in bonuses -- $11.5 million
now and another $6 million in a few years. The $11.5 million bonus
is the largest in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference was set for 1 p.m. EDT Friday to announce the
deal. Warner's agent, Mark Bartelstein, said Warner signed the deal
Thursday night.
Steelers:
</P>
<P>
   Center Dermontti Dawson's hamstring is hurting again. And
running back Richard Huntley joined him.
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers don't think the Dawson's injury is serious -- it
might be only scar tissue tearing apart after months away from
football -- but it is worrisome given his hamstring problems of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Huntley, expected to compete with Jerome Bettis for playing time
after signing a $4 million, three-year contract, injured his left
hamstring during practice Thursday afternoon and is out
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson an All-Pro fixture during the 1990s, missed nine games
and lasted only three plays of another.
</P>
<P>
   Before last season, Dawson had not missed a game in 10 years.
Now, at age 35, he is questioning his own durability.
</P>
<P>
   ''After that episode last year, you've got to wonder: How much
longer can I last?'' Dawson said. ''You've got to have your legs.
If you don't have your legs, you can't run. And if you can't run,
you can't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, he's not playing, at least not in an exhibition game
Sunday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're erring on the side of caution with this,'' said coach
Bill Cowher, who suddenly finds himself without any of his top
three centers. ''It's something you have to deal with.''
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back Ray Crockett and linebacker Glenn Cadrez pulled
hamstrings.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hopeful that these will not prove to be serious,'' said
team spokesman Jim Saccomano. ''It's a day-to-day situation at this
point, but hamstrings can be kind of funny, and it can take a
little longer than one had thought.''
Dolphins:
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Oronde Gadsden signed a two-year contract extension
through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms weren't disclosed, and Gadsden's agent didn't
return a phone call seeking comment. Last week, Gadsden signed a
$358,000 contract for this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old receiver was second on the Dolphins last year
with 48 catches for 803 yards and six touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Tackle Richmond Webb, after consulting with a specialist
Wednesday, decided against surgery to remove bone chips in his
right elbow. Webb will continue receiving treatment, but is
expected to miss the first exhibition game, Aug. 5 in Pittsburgh.
Saints:
</P>
<P>
   Children will replace Fetch Monster, the popular pooch who
retrieved kicking tees during New Orleans Saints games.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Fielkow, director of administration for the team, agrees
with a fan advisory board recommendation to allow children to
retrieve the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Fetch Monster is an Australian Shepherd whose owners got as much
as $1,000 a game to fly to New Orleans from Houston. The kids will
have to settle for the thrill of being on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   From one to four children will be picked for each home game.
Fielkow was unsure how the children will be selected.
Eagles:
</P>
<P>
   One day after team owner Jeffrey Lurie blasted the state of
negotiations with first-round draft pick Corey Simon, and said he
would not relent in contract talks, there appeared to be
significant progress in getting a deal done in the next day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast reports indicated a softening in the stances of
Simon's agents, Roosevelt Barnes and Eugene Parker, and the Eagles'
chief negotiator Joe Banner.
</P>
<P>
   It was apparent in recent days that Simon was interested in
pursuing a four-year contract, after which he would become an
unrestricted free agent. The Eagles, on the other hand, want to
sign him to a longer-term deal.

   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Blues defenseman Todd Reirden underwent surgery
Thursday for three broken bones in his left foot suffered in an
off-ice conditioning workout.
</P>
<P>
   Last season was Reirden's first with St. Louis and he had four
goals and 21 assists in 56 games. Reirden had 32 penalty minutes
and a plus-minus rating of plus-18.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues claimed Reirden off waivers from the Edmonton Oilers
on Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis also signed free-agent forward Chris Murray and
re-signed defenseman Bryce Salvador to multiyear contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, 25, had three points and 62 penalty minutes in 32 games
with the Dallas Stars last season, and has 34 points and 550
penalty minutes in 242 career NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador, 24, was originally signed as a free agent on Dec. 16,
1996, and has played for the Blues' minor league affiliate in

<HEADLINE> Twins 9, Yankees 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- David Cone lost his career-worst eighth
straight decision, pitching five poor innings Thursday night as the
Minnesota Twins beat the New York Yankees 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Hocking had four hits and Cristian Guzman drove in three
runs as the Twins won their third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Mark Redman (9-4) went six innings to earn his fourth win
in a row. Minnesota stopped New York's four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (1-10) was in trouble from the start as the first five
Twins reached base in a three-run first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Cone tied season highs by allowing eight runs, nine hits and
five walks. He left after the first three batters reached in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have lost the last 12 times Cone has started, and he
is winless in 14 starts since beating Toronto on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Since pitching a perfect game against Montreal on July 18, 1999,
Cone is 3-15 in 32 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Redman leads all AL rookies in wins, strikeouts (87) and innings
pitched (107 1-3).
</P>
<P>
   Redman started strong, giving up just one hit in the first four
innings. He left after walking David Justice to start the seventh,
having allowed three runs and six hits.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins wasted no time roughing up Cone. Hocking led off with
a double and scored Cristian Guzman's single.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Lawton walked and Ron Coomer's RBI single made it 2-0.
David Ortiz then walked and Corey Koskie followed with a sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton's two-run double put the Twins ahead 5-0 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Hocking misjudged Justice's foul fly to left field in the fifth
and let it fall harmlessly. On the next pitch, Justice hit his 27th
homer of the year, a 423-foot drive into the upper deck in right
field. Scott Brosius' RBI double into the left field corner made it
5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Hocking then made amends for his miscue when he threw out
Brosius at third base as he tried to advance on a deep fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins put the game away in the sixth, scoring four runs.
Hocking's third hit of the game -- his second double -- scored a run
and chased Cone. Guzman greeted reliever Jason Grimsley with a
two-run double and later scored on Ortiz's grounder to make it
9-3.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees continue to struggle against AL Central teams.
They are 14-19 against the division as compared to 20-13 versus
teams in the AL East and 9-5 against the West. ... Despite the
loss, New York has won nine of its past 13 games and 16 of 23.

<HEADLINE> Tackle Relieved at MRI Results  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. (AP) -- Oakland Raiders offensive tackle Matt
Stinchcomb was nervous. His left shoulder was hurt again, and an
MRI test was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb, who spent all of last season recovering from
shoulder surgery to repair torn ligaments, was hit hard during
practice Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   He won't say how it happened, or who delivered the hit, but he
felt a sharp pain and winced as he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, he underwent an MRI to see just how bad the
situation was. Happily for Stinchcomb, the results were negative.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to admit, I was a little nervous,'' he said Thursday
morning at the Raiders' training facility in Napa.
</P>
<P>
   Stinchcomb was the Raiders first-round draft pick, 18th overall,
in 1999. The standout from Georgia was excited about his first NFL
season, but then got injured during a preseason game and ended up
in surgery and out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Raiders expect to start Stinchcomb on the left
side, moving Mo Collins to the right side at guard.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Sims was taking snaps at left tackle during practice for
the time being. Sims started six games at left tackle last season
and four at right guard. He's backed up by Toby Myles, signed as a
free agent in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Both Stinchcomb and coach Jon Gruden said it was too soon to
tell when he'd be back. But Stinchcomb was hopeful
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this is going to be a drawn-out issue at all,''
Stinchcomb said.
</P>
<P>
   Gruden admitted he also was a bit nervous Wednesday night about
the MRI results.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all very pleased that things worked out OK,'' Gruden
said. ''Matt's worked very head and we're counting on him.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's anxious to get back on the field and get his career
underway, Stinchcomb is wary of returning too soon and possibly
reinsuring his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to be out there trying to screw my shoulder up
again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nate Parks, another offensive lineman, missed practice Thursday
morning with a sore ankle. An MRI was negative.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defensive tackle Darrell Russell did not practice
because of a sore lower back, and wide receiver Horace Copeland had
a sore hamstring.

<HEADLINE> Boy Severely Injured by Foul Ball  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOOSIC, Pa. (AP) -- A young boy was seriously injured when he was
struck in the head by a foul ball during a minor league baseball
game Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, who appeared to be about 3-5 years old, was sitting in
the second row behind the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre dugout when he was
struck by a ball hit by the Red Barons' Fausto Tejero in the bottom
of the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   The game against the Columbus Clippers was delayed at the start
of the eighth inning while Lackawanna County sheriff's deputies and
emergency medical technicians administered to the boy and the
Clippers and Red Barons watched with concern for the top of their
dugout steps.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was taken to Community Medical Center in Scranton by
ambulance, then airlifted to Geisinger Medical Center in Danville.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported that the victim was conscious but bleeding from
the ear following the accident, but there was no further
information on his condition. Tejero left immediately after the
game to go to the hospital.

<HEADLINE> Chow, Moceanu Off To Great Start  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Amy Chow was magnificent once again. Dominique
Moceanu wasn't bad, herself. And Shannon Miller offered a 30-second
thrill that should make the next month interesting.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited return to major competition for five members of
the Magnificent Seven -- the group that took Olympic gold in 1996 --
came Thursday night at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Chow used a sparkling routine on the uneven bars to finish in
third place with a total of 37.700 points after the preliminary
round. Moceanu overcame an ankle injury in warmups to grit out a
10th-place finish, well in the hunt for a spot in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time defending national champion Kristen Maloney scored a
9.825 on the floor exercise to take the lead with 38.262 points.
Elise Ray, the country's best finisher last year at World
Championships, was .05 points back. Jamie Dantzscher finished
fourth and Alyssa Beckerman was fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But, as was the case in 1996, it was the members of the
Magnificent Seven that seemed to capture the audience's hearts. A
few years away from the sport also changed the old-timers' outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I've been through it,'' the 18-year-old Moceanu said.
''It's not as overwhelming as it was when I was little.''
</P>
<P>
   The most anticipated moment of the night came when Miller,
recovering from a hairline crack in her right shin, simply saluted
the judges and stepped on the springboard in front of the balance
beam. She took a 0.00 on that event, the balance beam and the floor
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   It was all so she could compete on the uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
   She scored a 9.65 in that event, tying her for second among the
30 competitors.
</P>
<P>
   After sticking her dismount, Miller hugged coach Steve Nunno
before even stepping off the mat. His decision to take her out of
the other events seemed like a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Miller will withdraw from Saturday's finals. Nunno submitted a
petition after the meet to get into the Olympic trials. It's a
proposition team coordinator Bela Karolyi will have trouble turning
down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shannon Miller was the world champion on bars in 1993,'' Nunno
said. ''She's always been one of the best bar workers and she
proved that tonight. The team could use her.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 12 finishers at nationals will advance to the trials,
where Karolyi will head a committee that will choose six members of
the Olympic team. Performances at nationals and trials will be used
to rank the gymnasts, but they won't be binding.
</P>
<P>
   Unless they blow up in upcoming competition, Chow, Moceanu and
Miller will merit serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can, of course, improve on my performance,'' Chow said.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to imagine what Moceanu would have done had she
not twisted her left ankle during warmups. Fighting back tears
after the injury, she completed the warmup, not even able to make
her landings.
</P>
<P>
   She then gutted out an inspirational performance, the kind that
made her America's darling back in 1996. She had a perfect dismount
on the uneven bars, barely moving after her feet touched the
ground, as Karolyi, standing on the sidelines, smiled and nodded
his head in approval.
</P>
<P>
   She will almost certainly compete Saturday, said her coach, Mary
Lee Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just pushed on,'' Moceanu said. ''I've dealt with injuries
before. ''I'm glad I hit everything and to be just hanging in there
and doing the best job I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Chow also got off to a shaky start, stepping a good 12 inches
off the mat during her floor routine for a 9.150. But her
performance on the balance beam was good, and after executing a
solid triple twist on the dismount for a 9.650, the normally stoic
gymnast came off the floor smiling brightly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I had a lot of energy, so I just went out of bounds,''
Chow said of the floor routine. ''I knew I couldn't hang onto that
feeling. I had to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Another comeback hopeful, Dominique Dawes, landed squarely on
her backside on her second vault, the same vault teammate Kerri
Strug used to seal the gold medal in 1996. She finished with 36.512
points and dropped from 10th to 13th.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth comeback hopeful, Jaycie Phelps, struggled to a
17th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time national runner-up Vanessa Atler once again had trouble
on the uneven bars, the event that cost her the championship the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Her legs wobbling as she tried to lift them fully above her head
in a handstand position on the high bar, she earned a score of
8.800 on the event. Her next three events were excellent, but she
still finished in sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always hard coming back, but I'm used to that,'' Atler
said with a laugh. ''It was pretty familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   Maloney had the best all-around performance of the evening, but
by the time she aced her floor routine, some fans were already
filing out, having seen Miller's uneven-bar routine moments
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that didn't dampen the moment for the 19-year-old,
competing for the first time since last October.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'm pretty happy with the way it turned out,'' Maloney
said. ''I thought I could do well, but you never know until you get
out there.''

<HEADLINE> Warner Agrees to Deal With Rams  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- NFL MVP Kurt Warner got the longterm deal he
was looking for Thursday, becoming the highest-paid player in St.
Louis Rams history with a seven-year, $47 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always dreamed of playing in the Super Bowl, I always
dreamed of winning the Super Bowl, but I never really imagined the
stuff that would come with it,'' Warner said. ''I'm truly
blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal features $17.5 million in bonuses, $11.5 million now
and another $6 million in a few years. The $11.5 million bonus
alone is by far the largest in franchise history, eclipsing the $7
million bonus Marshall Faulk got as part of a seven-year, $45
million deal last August.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference was set for 1 p.m. EDT Friday to announce the
deal. Late Thursday night, Warner said he hadn't yet signed the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm assuming I'll do that early in the morning,'' Warner said.
''If they bring it to me, I'll sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner's wife, Brenda, and son, Cade, have been in training camp
the last two days. But the quarterback said that was just because
Rams players had the night off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Warner signed for $358,000, the minimum for a two-year veteran,
last Friday so he could participate in training camp. He said
earlier Thursday that he believed the sides were close.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams' initial offer was $42 million for six years, with a
$10 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's appearance in camp appeared to remove his leverage from
getting a deal done. But it also apparently pushed both sides to
reach an agreement only six days later.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody moved, and they negotiated in good faith,'' said
Mark Bartelstein, Warner's agent. ''They wanted to get a deal done,
and so did we. Everyone tried to listen to what the other side had
to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner, 29, said when he arrived in camp that he believed he was
close to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't even think when we're talking dollars that things have
even changed over the past three weeks,'' Warner said. ''It was
basically just the structure of things and trying to get it where
we both felt comfortable with the number of years and how it all
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner, who has been involved in the negotiations all along,
told Bartelstein on Wednesday it was time to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I didn't want it drag on for a long time,'' Warner
said. ''I talked to my agent a lot, telling him the things that
were important to me and just kind of said, 'Let's get it done.'''
</P>
<P>
   The parties had been talking since shortly after the Super Bowl.
Warner made only $250,000 in base salary last year, although the
Rams gave him a $500,000 bonus -- the money they had remaining under
the salary cap -- after the season. He's getting a huge raise, but
Bartelstein has said all along that this case was unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's never been a situation like this, and I give the Rams
credit for dealing in good faith,'' Bartelstein said. ''There's
never been a player in this position before.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner threw 41 touchdown passes in his first season as a
starter. He entered training camp as the third-stringer, and was
elevated only after Trent Green suffered a season-ending knee
injury in the third preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Todd Lyght, designated as the team's transition
player, is the only Rams player not in camp. Lyght also wants a
longterm deal.

<HEADLINE> Miller Saves Best for Last  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Shannon Miller stuck her landing on the uneven
bars and as the crowd roared, she turned and got swallowed up in a
big hug from her coach.
</P>
<P>
   Finally.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, it's great to be back competing again, and I was
very happy to be able to compete bars,'' she said Thursday night.
''A week ago I was having trouble walking.
</P>
<P>
   ''So right now, it's a relief to be back out here and know I'm
on the road to recovery and everything is going pretty well. At the
same time, it's hard being out there and not competing all four
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Still nursing a hairline crack in her right leg, Miller skipped
her first three events at the U.S. Gymnastics Championships, taking
0.00s so she could still compete in the uneven bars, her final
event.
</P>
<P>
   America's most decorated gymnast was greeted with huge cheers
when she was introduced at the uneven bars, and she didn't
disappoint the crowd. Her routine was vintage Shannon Miller --
crisp and clean, with big, sweeping moves above the bar and sharp
moves between the bars.
</P>
<P>
   She stuck her dismount and the crowd roared. She received a
9.650, tying her for second-highest on the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''For Shannon, it's been a long time since she's felt like she
just did,'' said her coach, Steve Nunno.
</P>
<P>
   And it will be awhile before she feels that way again. Because
only the top 12 gymnasts from nationals advance to next month's
trials, Miller wouldn't make it if she had a bunch of zeroes for
her scores.
</P>
<P>
   She's withdrawing from Saturday night's all-around finals, and
is petitioning for a spot at the Olympic trials. Nunno had the
petition in his hands when the competition ended and was on his way
to submit. USA Gymnastics has three days from the end of the meet
to decide whether to accept it.
</P>
<P>
   Miller knew she wouldn't be able to do all four events Thursday
night, and she could have simply withdrawn from the event and
submitted her petition. But by competing on bars -- and tying for
second -- Miller gives Bela Karolyi something to think about when
he's choosing the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   A selection committee headed by Karolyi will choose the
six-person team. Three or four all-arounders will be chosen, and
the remaining will be specialists who can help bolster the team's
weak spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shannon Miller was the world champion on bars in 1993,'' Nunno
said. ''She's always been one of the best bar workers and she
proved that tonight. The team could use her.''
</P>
<P>
   According to USA Gymnastics' petition process, athletes can
petition for a spot at trials due to ''extraordinary and unforeseen
circumstances.'' For her petition to be granted, Miller would have
to prove she's got an ''injury, illness or other unforeseen
circumstance'' that keeps her from competing.
</P>
<P>
   She'd also have to submit her petition ''as soon as practical''
after realizing she couldn't compete. Though she's had the stress
fracture since July 6 and has had to curtail her training, Miller
could make the case that she thought she'd be able to compete this
week.
</P>
<P>
   And she badly wanted to. She looked downright miserable as she
went to the balance beam -- her first event -- saluted the judges,
stepped on the spring board, touched the beam and then saluted the
judges again, signaling the end of her routine.
</P>
<P>
   When her score flashed, there were three, bright red zeroes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before I went up I was trying to go through my beam routine in
my head like I would normally do. I was trying to put myself in a
competition situation every step of the way,'' she said. ''It was
very hard just going up and just touching the beam and getting down
because I'm so used to getting in the mode, doing the routine and
finishing everything that I start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting out either trials or nationals is becoming somewhat of a
tradition for Miller. In 1992, still recovering from elbow surgery,
she withdrew after the compulsories because she hadn't had enough
time to train. She competed at the trials and went on to win five
medals in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   She skipped the Olympic trials in 1996 because of an ongoing
problem with her left wrist. She won two gold medals at the Atlanta
Games, including an individual gold on the balance beam.

<HEADLINE> Congress OKs $288B Spending Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon would get $20 billion more next
year -- including a 3.7 percent military pay increase -- under a $288
billion Pentagon spending bill that Congress is sending President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the bill on a 90-10 vote Thursday after Sens.
John McCain, R-Ariz., and Phil Gramm, R-Texas, objected to $1.8
billion added to the package by a select group of Appropriations
Committee members that was not in either House or Senate versions
of the bill passed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm said the extra $1.8 billion represented the eagerness to
spend budget surpluses -- ''money burning a hole in our pockets'' --
on ''any constituency that wants it'' in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cited the addition of $5 million for the study of desert
tortoises in California as an examples of the items that were
neither requested by President Clinton nor written into the bills
by either house.
</P>
<P>
   ''The practice of pork-barrel spending has been out of control
for years; only now can we take it to a cosmic level never before
contemplated,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed the compromise bill last week and Clinton is
expected to sign it even though it is $3.3 billion more than he
requested.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pay raise, the bill includes a 9 percent
increase in funds for military health care. Spending on those two
items alone would be $988 million above this year.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the bill includes $75.8 billion for military personnel;
$100 billion for operations, maintenance and working capital funds;
$59 billion for weapons procurement, $41.4 billion for research and
development and $14 billion for other Pentagon programs and
classified amounts for foreign intelligence activities by the
department, the CIA and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Other specific items include:
</P>
<P>
   --$1.5 billion to help the Army quickly develop two new
4,000-person ''medium brigades'' that can deploy to the world's hot
spots within 96 hours.
</P>
<P>
   --$4 billion to buy and continue research and development on the
F-22 fighter jet program.
</P>
<P>
   --$12.1 billion for health programs, including research into
breast and prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   --$4 billion for a new aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 4576.

<HEADLINE> Dispute Rages Over Slain Cardinal  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Seven years after a Roman Catholic cardinal
died in a fusillade of bullets at Guadalajara's airport, officials
reported Thursday that they remain deeply divided about who was
behind the crime.
</P>
<P>
   At a four-hour news conference to announce the end of an
unprecedented joint two-year probe, state, federal and religious
leaders differed sharply over whether Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas
Ocampo was the target or merely an accidental victim on May 24,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Even leading churchmen disagreed. A member of the joint
commission, Bishop Luis Reynoso Cervantes of Cuernavaca, said the
cardinal probably was killed by accident in a shootout between two
violent drug gangs, and asked why anybody would stage such an
elaborate, public and complicated shooting just to kill the
cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   Posadas' successor, Juan Sandoval Iniguez, said evidence is
clear he was purposely slain.
</P>
<P>
   The killing was one of a series of prominent murders and
outbreaks of violence that shook Mexico -- and Mexicans' tenuous
confidence in their legal system -- in 1993 and 1994. The continuing
controversy led to the creation of the joint commission to probe
the crime two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, officials of the federal attorney general's office
repeated their long-held conclusion that the cardinal ''sadly died
in the extreme dynamic ... of a confrontation between two
antagonistic bands of drug traffickers'' who had earlier clashed
several times.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the agency said the cardinal arrived at the
airport to greet a visiting papal nuncio at the same time gunmen
for the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix drug gang were arriving after
spending five days hunting for a rival, Joaquin Guzman -- who
himself was just arriving at the airport for a planned trip to the
coastal town of Puerto Vallarta.
</P>
<P>
   They said that some of the gunmen had expected Guzman to be
driving a car much like the cardinal's and attributed the brief
bursts of automatic weapons fire at the cardinal as the result of
drug-addled, adrenalin-fueled confusion as bullets flew around the
airport parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Jose Ruis Ramos Rivera ridiculed claims
of a plot. He noted that the shooting continued for 10 minutes
after the cardinal was shot and that six other people, including
innocent bystanders, were also killed, some at close range.
</P>
<P>
   ''But more than that, there is not one single witness, one
single indication, that suggests even the possibility'' of someone
who might have summoned the drug gangs to the airport at the same
time as the cardinal -- who, he said, had decided only that morning
to go to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   But the state of Jalisco, whose prosecutors are in charge of the
murder investigation, flatly disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The murder of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo was a willful
crime, with 14 very direct shots and from a short distance,'' the
state said in a report read by its secretary-general, Fernando
Guzman Perez.
</P>
<P>
   State officials admitted they have no hard suspects, no firm
motive and only circumstantial evidence of a plot. But they
criticized the early months of the federal investigation of the
crime -- and seemed to cast suspicions on powerful, shadowy figures
in the government or security forces at the time of the slaying.

<HEADLINE> Montana Fire Grows; Some Evacuated  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON DININNY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. -- Two wildfires east of Montana's capital city
swelled to some 24,000 acres Thursday as investigators confirmed
one of them was started by discarded charcoal briquettes from a
home barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have driven more than 300 families from their homes
and destroyed 36 buildings, including nine houses and 27
outbuildings, fire information officer Kimberly Landl said. Some
who fled the fire along the west shore of Canyon Ferry Lake were
allowed to return home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado, about 1,000 firefighters doused smoldering flames
in the charred landscape of Mesa Verde National Park after deeming
safe the historic cliff dwellings in the nation's largest
archaeological preserve.
</P>
<P>
   With lines built around 70 percent of the 23,000-acre fire,
firefighters hoped to contain it fully by the weekend so they could
release crews to battle other blazes in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel real good about this fire,'' said Bobby Kitchens, a
fire management team spokesman. ''It's not dead, but it's not
running on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montana fire on the east side of the Canyon Ferry Lake
burned farther northeast into the Big Belt Mountains Wednesday
night, prompting residents of the mountain community of York to
flee.
</P>
<P>
   While investigators confirmed that charcoal briquettes from a
home barbecue started the fire Sunday afternoon on the western
shore, Landl said, officials think the other fire also may have
been man-caused.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimated the cost of fighting the two fires at $1.3
million by Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The growing firefighting force had surpassed 1,000 Thursday,
according to Forest Service spokesman Dave Turner. They were
supported by seven helicopters, two air tankers, 36 engines and 15
volunteer fire department engines.
</P>
<P>
   Fire bosses have requested an additional 200 National Guard
members to undergo basic firefighting training. They will be
deployed against the fires as 20-member hand crews, Landl said.
One-hundred-and-fifty Guardsmen and Reservists were already at work
on security, a medical camp and helicopter water drops.
</P>
<P>
   Among those able to return home along the western shore, Irene
Waling found her garage with several restored antique cars, a boat,
camper and tractor destroyed.
